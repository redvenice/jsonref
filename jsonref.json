Wright allegedly plotted with Guiseppe Pagliara and Dax Price (right) to profit from playersWright, 53, of Barnsley, South Yorkshire, denies two charges of accepting a bribe in contravention of the Bribery Act 2000. Pagliara, 64, of Bury, Greater Manchester, and Price, 48, of Sittingbourne, Kent, both deny two counts of paying and facilitating a bribe under the same act. The court heard that undercover journalist Claire Newell, using the pseudonym Claire Taylor, posed as a representative of a fake sports management company named Meiran, and contacted Pagliara in May 2016 pretending to want to invest in football players in the UK.Prosecutor Mr O\u0027Neill explained that, across a series of meetings, emails and texts, Pagliara, originally from Genoa in Italy, and Price, allegedly proposed schemes which saw them becoming players\u0027 agents, buying them and placing them at clubs.They would maintain ownership of a player, and profit from his onward sale, which Mr O\u0027Neill said was \u0027all to be facilitated by bribery\u0027.The court was told that such \u0027third party ownership\u0027 set-ups were banned by the English Football Association (FA) in 2009 and by Fifa, the football world-governing body, in 2015.In August 2016, when all three defendants were present, Mr O\u0027Neill said Wright received \u0027an envelope containing £5,000 in cash\u0027 in return for \u0027commercial information about Barnsley FC\u0027s players\u0027.The jury heard that Price and Pagliara, who has never been registered as a football agent with the FA, set up an introduction with Wright, who allegedly accepted payment to encourage players to appoint Price and Pagliara as their agents and help place players at Barnsley.         The court heard the case centres on the same newspaper investigation which led Sam Allardyce to resign as England managerMr O\u0027Neill said Price and Pagliara \u0027explicitly discussed the payment of future sums to Mr Wright\u0027.The court was told that from their first meeting with the undercover journalist, Price and Pagliara \u0027revealed their awareness of corrupt practices in the football transfer market and discussed their willingness to be involved in such activities\u0027.Mr O\u0027Neill said the men repeatedly used the phrase \u0027looking after people\u0027 when discussing alleged corruption across the football world.He said Wright had helped arrange a meeting for the owner of Barnsley to be introduced to Price and Pagliara, where the Italian would pretend to be an interpreter, because he did not want it to be known that a previous finding of corruption had been made against him in Italy by the Italian Football Federation.Mr O\u0027Neill said Wright \u0027rather than alerting his employers to this ruse, played along with the facade\u0027.The jury heard that at their first meeting with the undercover journalist, Price claimed football managers received \u0027back-handers\u0027 for player-signing deals.He said: \u0027It\u0027s not corruption but you know it is corruption... because obviously at the end of the day they\u0027re just putting every deal through the manager and they\u0027re obviously copping the money for it.\u0027The jury were taken through transcripts of conversations with Pagliara and Price, secretly recorded during the Daily Telegraph\u0027s investigation, which were later passed to the City of London Police.The trial continues. "},{"url":null,"title":"Seven types sugar daddy relationships theyre not money","story":"Share this articleSugar babies have \u0027genuine connections\u0027 with daddies: study"},{"url":null,"title":"Senior BBC editor Jon Sopel makes crude joke Twitter users cringeing","story":"Share this article Robert Arthur said: \u0027Be prepared for a spate of indignity from people, Jon.

Mr Johnson speaks at a joint press conference with President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker (not pictured) at the European Commission headquarters in Brussels Despite apparently not knowing the details, he added: ‘These proposals risk triggering a race to the bottom on rights and protections – putting food safety at risk, cutting environmental standards and workers’ rights, and opening up our NHS to a takeover by US private corporations.‘This sell-out deal won’t bring the country together and should be rejected. The best way to get Brexit sorted is to give the people the final say in a public vote.’‘From what we’ve read of this deal, it doesn’t meet our demands or expectations, it creates a border down the Irish Sea and it leads once again to a race to the bottom in rights and protections for British citizens and a danger of the sell-off of our national assets to American companies.’Asked whether he had given up on his plan to negotiate a Labour Brexit deal, Mr Corbyn replied: ‘Not at all. A Labour government elected in a general election would within three months negotiate an agreement with the EU... and then within six months we would put that to a referendum.’Tory MP Michael Fabricant said: ‘Corbyn is seriously misreading the view of the British public who want Brexit done.‘He knows he is the most unpopular Opposition leader since records began in the Seventies. Maybe he thinks it can’t get any worse. It can. His immediate condemnation of the deal reveals him in an even clearer light.’ Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer also dismissed the deal, saying it ‘paves the way for a decade of deregulation’. He argued it would give the Government a ‘licence to slash’ worker, environment and consumer protections.Sir Keir added: ‘If Boris Johnson has confidence in his deal, he should put it back to the people in a public vote against Remain.’Tony Lloyd, the party’s Northern Ireland spokesman, said Labour MPs were ‘almost bound’ to vote for holding a referendum if Mr Johnson found a majority to support his deal.He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that even though Labour would ‘prefer a general election’, it was ‘consistent’ with party policy that MPs would back holding a confirmatory vote on the freshly inked Brexit deal.  Jeremy Corbyn has behaved like a spiv trying to welch on a bet, says Theresa May’s ex-communications boss SIR ROBBIE GIBBBy Sir Robbie Gibb for the Daily Mail Of all the descriptions often attributed to Jeremy Corbyn, being a mind-reader is not one. And yet before the Prime Minister’s new Brexit deal was published yesterday, the Labour leader definitively declared that he couldn’t support it.There are two possible explanations for this.Either Corbyn is a sage who managed to deduce the contents of the unpublished 64-page document.Or, he jumped in without waiting to read the first page.Having seen first-hand the shameless speed with which Corbyn can denounce a deal, forgive me if I lean towards the second possibility.Over the past three years, there has been little about Corbyn’s handling of Brexit to suggest he has any inclination to prioritise the Brexit referendum result over the demands of Labour’s own internal party politics. So much for the man who’s party went into the last general election with a manifesto which clearly stated: ‘Labour accepts the referendum result and a Labour government will put the national interest first.’         Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn talks to the media as he arrives to attend a pre-council meeting of the Party of European Socialists at Albert Hall in Brussels on ThursdayFaced with a growing Remainer insurgency along his front bench, Corbyn has also ditched his own Eurosceptic beliefs.Whether, therefore, Corbyn has tried to scupper every attempt to deliver Brexit out of political cowardice or shameless cynicism scarcely matters.And while Boris Johnson has staked everything – not least his own reputation and premiership – on making good on that promise, the Labour leader has behaved like a slopey-shouldered spiv trying to welch on a bet. As his actions demonstrated yesterday, Corbyn isn’t one to spend time reading important documents.But should he ever start, he could do no worse than begin at page 24 of Labour’s own 2017 manifesto.Time and again, Corbyn has shown how those key five words – ‘Labour accepts the referendum result’ – aren’t worth the paper they were printed on.Under his leadership, Labour MPs opted to trigger Article 50 and set the two-year clock running on Brexit negotiations, but subsequently voted on 34 separate occasions in the Commons to block Brexit legislation.Even when we were trying to broker a deal with Labour to break the Parliamentary deadlock, I remember how their delegation failed to take the matter at hand seriously. I will never forget one particularly farcical moment in April when, during crunch talks with Labour to get Theresa’s May’s deal through, the party’s Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, condemned a document we had just given him – even though it had been copied and pasted from his own proposals!At another point, Corbyn’s deputy, John McDonnell, suddenly raised the issue of a Second Referendum.I was surprised. At the time, McDonnell had no great love for the Remainer rump of his party.‘I said I’d raise it,’ he explained matter-of-factly, ‘and I’ve raised it.’ It was a bizarre outburst – though one that now explains why Corbyn’s self-serving game-playing over Brexit is coming home to roost.         At another point, Corbyn’s deputy, John McDonnell (pictured alongside Sajid Javid), suddenly raised the issue of a Second ReferendumHeld captive by Labour’s hardcore Remainer membership, he has been backed into a cul-de-sac of support for a second referendum.Meanwhile, Boris Johnson has never deviated from the course he set – to take Britain out of Europe on October 31, ‘do or die’.He has gambled everything on this promise and it seems to have paid off.Indeed, it means that, tomorrow, there is a clear choice for MPs: back this deal or leave without a deal in less than two weeks’ time.There are, of course, a handful of honourable former Labour MPs, such as John Mann and Iain Austin, who will do their duty and honour the referendum result.There are also decent, moderate Labour MPs, such as Caroline Flint, who voted Remain but have since stated resolutely that Brexit must be delivered.Tomorrow, other Labour MPs would do well to follow their lead.Now is the time for our politicians to break free from this appalling Parliamentary paralysis, to live up to their promises to voters and get Brexit done.If Jeremy Corbyn continues to put the brakes on Brexit, it could plunge Britain into an almighty crash.Sir Robbie Gibb was Theresa May’s director of communications  A boost for workers’ rights that could win Labour round: Boris Johnson pledges set ‘highest possible standards’ into LAW – despite Jeremy Corbyn saying deal is a ‘race to the bottom’By Daniel Martin for the Daily MailModerate Labour MPs could be persuaded to back the Prime Minister’s Brexit deal after he offered a series of sweeteners on workers’ rights.Speaking in Brussels last night, Boris Johnson said he would ‘gladly’ make a commitment to maintain the ‘highest possible standards’ on environmental and social protections.And the Daily Mail understands that Downing Street is now offering to write them into the Withdrawal Agreement Bill to make them legally binding.Behind-the-scenes talks have already taken place with rebel Labour MPs, led by Stephen Kinnock, who has previously said he would support a deal which honoured the referendum result.              Behind-the-scenes talks have already taken place with rebel Labour MPs, led by Stephen Kinnock (left), who has previously said he would support a deal which honoured the referendum result. Ruth Smeeth (right) yesterday said it was her ‘intention to vote for a deal’ unless rights were ‘undermined’ by the dealJeremy Corbyn made clear yesterday that he wanted Labour MPs to vote against the revised withdrawal agreement, saying it would lead to a ‘race to the bottom’ on workers’ rights.The party has not said whether MPs who defy him would lose the party whip. Even so, as many as ten Labour MPs are reported to be considering voting for the deal if Mr Johnson’s pledges on workers’ rights are enshrined in law.Ruth Smeeth yesterday said it was her ‘intention to vote for a deal’ unless rights were ‘undermined’ by the deal.Labour MPs John Mann, Sir Kevin Barron and Jim Fitzpatrick are also understood to support the agreement.Mr Johnson will be dependent on some Labour support now that the DUP has said it will vote against the deal on ‘Super Saturday’ tomorrow.Yesterday, the PM reached out to Labour MPs, saying: ‘It is a good text, and it gets to the heart of what we want to achieve with the EU. It does also contain important provisions and commitments that this country gladly makes about our determination to maintain the highest possible standards on environment and social protection.’The agreement, announced yesterday morning, provides for a ‘level playing field’ on workers’ rights and environmental protection and commits Britain to ‘maintain... standards at the current high levels’.However, the promise is part of the political agreement that sits alongside the withdrawal agreement – not the withdrawal agreement itself.         Mr Johnson (pictured alongside president of the European Comission Jean-Claude Juncker (second-from-right), Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay (left) and European Union chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier (right) during a press conference on the Brexit deal in Brussels) will be dependent on some Labour support now that the DUP has said it will vote against the deal on ‘Super Saturday’ tomorrowIt is understood that Downing Street is offering to write these protections into the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, the legislation which enacts the Brexit deal, to make them legally binding and get the Labour rebels on side.Mr Kinnock and 18 other Labour MPs wrote to European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker earlier this month, declaring that they ‘wish to see the British EU referendum result honoured without further delay’.One of the signatories told Huffington Post that around ten Labour MPs are now in the mood to vote for ‘any deal’.On Wednesday night Mr Kinnock suggested that he could support the Brexit deal.Speaking to Robert Peston on ITV, the MP was asked if he would back the deal. He said: ‘Yes, if the text meets Labour’s six tests... The level playing field is absolutely crucial.’Yesterday Mrs Smeeth said: ‘It is my intention to vote for a deal unless Boris has completely undermined workers’ rights, environmental rights and consumer rights.’Mr Mann said: ‘I will vote for this deal... We voted to leave, and I’m happier to leave with a deal that gives stability for businesses and jobs in this country, that’s what a deal does...

The present government has so far not given any similar assurances and the indications have been that it would seek a deregulatory agenda, according to a separate source involved in discussions between business and ministers.The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy was approached for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b43a7d0fa640b3756d915d2c68c58e8298a2f417/0_138_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a19436fb58a872b1d91041ea32325f0","title":"no deal brexit food shortages are you a small business owner whos stockpiling","story":"We’d like to hear from small business owners about how they are preparing ahead of BrexitWith the cut-off date to secure a Brexit deal looming, the likely outcome of negotiations this week is still uncertain.

Here, they reveal what influences their styleI try to combine street style and a smart, minimal aesthetic. The combination between colours or materials is the first thing I think about when I’m choosing an outfit. I always pay attention to little details: pocket squares, socks or laces. I’m constantly travelling so I try to get the best out of the vibes and the style I discover during my trips, especially New York.I always want to feel comfortable and confident, whether I’m going for a posh dinner or a coffee with friends. Shoes can make the difference and Clarks shoes are some of my favourites, as they’re right for both day and night.My top fashion tip? It should either be a perfect match or a sharp contrast. I’d describe my style as erse, dynamic and always packed with attitude. I think makeup is as much part of your outfit as clothes are – it’s a great way to lift and accentuate what you’re wearing or how you’re feeling.The word “Iconic” has been watered down, but Clarks shoes actually are iconic. They’re timeless, super comfy and my mum loves them.My interest in art has a huge influence on what I wear. Most of my wardrobe is vintage or secondhand – every piece is unique and I love combining different elements that usually wouldn’t go together. I’m a fan of very simple, minimalistic clothes. I wear a lot of black and white. I love to combine basics with a fancy jacket and I think a hat can change the whole vibe of an outfit.I always dress for comfort. I love huge shirts, boyfriend jeans and hoodies. I love my Clarks shoes because they are super comfortable, too. When you feel comfortable with fashion your presence and charisma is different – it’s more authentic.UK Mod culture predominantly influences my style – Paul Weller, Eddie Piller, Martin Freeman, Bradley Wiggins. Although I also love Americana so as a complete casual ergence I would go for west coast indie kid get-up: basic Vans, Stance socks, jeans and a T-shirt. I’m also a runner and love that varsity athletics look. Tracksmith does some classic stuff for run and post-run.My philosophy? Have a colour palette and know what colours don’t work on you. I wear navy and grey as opposed to red and black. Always have a smart shoe, such as a Clarks, and a classic sneaker, such as a New Balance, then work up from there, depending on the occasion.“Easy” describes my style. I used to spend ages trying to plan a look, instead of playing around with what felt natural. Natural can be so many different things too: it can be a really out there two-piece suit, or just jeans and a T-shirt. I go for whatever feels right on the day. I walk a lot so I always look for footwear that’s comfortable and stylish, and Clarks has some lovely options.I love to browse through my Instagram timeline, taking inspiration from other influencers I follow. My rule is to have one or two stars of the show, and muting what’s around it, such as a printed dress with minimal accessories. But for dressing up, I have no boundaries. Whatever makes me feel like I can take on anything – no limits.When I love the outfit I’m wearing, it makes me step that bit stronger. My style will always be based off two different looks – the Cuban silhouette, fitted but airy or a more robust sport look with a heavy textile feature. I find a lot of inspiration just by living in London and being with friends.Clarks footwear were the first pair of school shoes I ever owned. The wallabees are the perfect balance of comfort, style and sturdiness. There will always be a pair in my collection.Fashion trends that stand the test of time need a shoe that is just as hard working.

Their “blood-red line” has been crossed by putting a hard customs border down the Irish Sea, iding them from the rest of the UK. They have lost the veto they wanted, reduced to a vote only held four years after the dual customs union comes into effect, aligned with the EU – and even then, they would have to wait for another two-year cooling-off period.These devilishly good DUP negotiators usually succeed because their No Surrender reputation has the other side of the table believing their stony faces are unmovable. But this time it looks as though Boris Johnson has thrown them under another of his mendacious buses. Of course this could be a last-minute DUP bluff. There are rumours not only of a new medical school and a motorway, but also a daintily gift-wrapped “peace fund”, paid by the UK with EU contributions via the Irish government. However, the biblically well-versed DUP won’t be trading their birthright for that mess of pottage.If no means no, that’s a heavy blow for Johnson – but even with DUP votes he can’t know if there are the numbers to push the deal through parliament. Johnson is back exactly where Theresa May was at Chequers with an EU deal agreed only to be blocked at Westminster – it would be a dose of his own medicine, as he was her prime rebel. Besides, his deal is far worse than May’s for the many Tory soft-leaver MPs who were once assured the UK would always keep close to Europe: this makes all borders rock hard, a lethal barrier to vital just-in-time trade.ERG Europhobes may like this deal better than the last, but they have been mainlining hopes of a no-deal crash out. Will they follow the DUP lead, as they once promised? Then up jumps Nigel Farage to declare “the ‘new deal’ is not Brexit”, frightening the life out of Tory MPs in marginal seats.Johnson chose to try to appease the ERGs, abandoning hope of those 19 Labour MPs who wrote to the European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, backing a deal if it met their red lines. None of the red lines required by Stephen Kinnock and the others have been met, as “level playing field” alignment on regulations is moved from the withdrawal agreement into the non-binding political statement. As Downing Street asserts through a source to Robert Peston: “Britain is out of all EU laws. We will be able to change our laws in a huge number of areas from product standards to fishing rules and farming subsidies where we are currently bound by EU rules.” Just so. That is precisely what the Europhobes always wanted, the deregulated purpose of the whole Brexit fandango. Food safety and working conditions, traditionally well ahead of UK standards, will now be at the mercy of this Brexit government. Very few in Labour could tolerate that.This deal unites Labour, and even fires up Jeremy Corbyn to cast aside his ancient scepticism and at last put his shoulder to the cause of killing it off. Today Labour was calling for a confirmatory referendum: ask the voters if this is really what they want? As Corbyn says, this deal “risks triggering a race to the bottom on rights and protections: putting food safety at risk, cutting environmental standards and workers’ rights, and opening up our NHS to a takeover by US private corporations”.There is a tide in politics, a natural surge towards resolution after years of excruciation and paralysis. Is the Get It Done sentiment so strong at Westminster that it will sweep aside doubters on all sides? MPs know that nothing is “done” if they sign up to Johnson’s deal: it’s only the beginning of unending torment over the economy-defining negotiations on customs, tariffs and regulations, where as an outsider the UK will have the weakest hand. Brexeternity beckons.Johnson may not get his vote, and his own absurd “die in a ditch” pledges will make a forced extension a humiliation. The last chance to get his deal agreed would be to accept the Kyle-Wilson amendment for a confirmatory referendum ballot, which would see the Commons overwhelmingly pass it. That ends the impasse once and for all. If leave wins again, the agreement is ready to sign the next day – and those long, hard future negotiations begin. If remain wins, Brexit could be stopped in its tracks.Labour would whip its MPs to back it, along with the SNP, Liberal Democrats, Greens and Plaid Cymru – plus a growing numbers of Tories of the Dominic GrieveJustine Greening variety.Many shudder at the prospect of five long months of a referendum campaign that would be more bitter, more mendacious and savage than the last. But as hundreds of thousands of People’s Vote marchers file past parliament as it sits on Saturday, the worthwhile prize is a vote to stop Brexit dead: 204 polls for the past two years have put remain ahead, only seven for leave, with 15 ties – according to YouGov analysis for the Evening Standard.A packed Labour for a Public Vote meeting in the Commons last night discussed ways to run a grassroots campaign, making the remain side a fiery insurgency, with greater input from young people and women it could hardly be worse than the 2016 fiasco. But if leave were to win, that too would be a necessary catharsis. Remainers would just have to live with it, in the hope of drawing gradually closer to Europe again over the years.A referendum can’t resolve the deep national rift, but it can clear the fetid air that has asphyxiated all political life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31680dc6aebadd83053e756e2d6313ea74d85efe/0_355_5408_3244/master/5408.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ccbe23bf2bc3644bb72e763c1297d064","title":"chain hotel florida","story":"Four days spent alone in Florida pushed me to the limits of boredom. But it was just what I neededI was in a chain hotel 20 miles north of Orlando for meetings that would last, on and off, for four days. This was not a holiday resort. Outside, the rain was bathwater warm, the pool windswept and empty. Inside, guests wandered the conference facilities, lanyards swinging. The breakfast buffet was like the idea I’d had as a child of how millionaires live: all the pineapple you could eat. It is a truism of escape plans that the problem with going anywhere is that you take yourself with you. But there is an exception to this, and I have found it. Burnt out? Always yelling? So tired you would gladly hand over your humanity to Elon Musk for a chance to become fully digitised? There’s another way. Open Google Maps, find a place that is not a place but, rather, on the way to other places, and select the blandest hotel you can find. Then go and sit in it for four days. I swear to God, it’s better than six months in Bali.On the second day, after my meetings, I went down to the hotel lobby. The sliding doors opened and the chill air contracted in the dank Florida day. I did some laps of the car park, talking on the phone to friends, then went inside and ate wings. Back in the room, I lay on the bed, looking through the sliding glass doors towards the highway. I thought about sending an email and didn’t. I took a three-hour nap, went downstairs and ordered more wings. No one spoke to me, looked at me or confirmed I existed.The next day, I stepped out. Florida isn’t made for walking. The only viable destination was a branch of Applebee’s (a restaurant) a mile up the highway. After 15 minutes, the pavement disappeared. Wow, this is how it ends, I thought: in a dusty underpass outside Orlando how disappointing and yet true to the essence of journalism: risking your life for bad food. At Applebee’s, the air smelled of mildew and ant powder. The waitress and I exchanged looks approximating the sentiment, “Smile, we’ll soon be dead.”I felt like the heroine of that Anne Tyler novel where she drops out of her life because no one in her house ever says thank you. I was invisible, weightless, immune to the passage of time. When I got back, I lay on the bed and exchanged text messages with someone towards whom my feelings aren’t ambivalent, though my feelings about those feelings are deeply ambivalent, and wondered, briefly, what my children were doing.By the third night, I became aware that I was thanking the staff in the hotel restaurant with the over-emphasis of someone exhibiting largesse to those less fortunate than herself, and that they were talking to me in the gentle tones of trained professionals managing a 43-year-old woman who hadn’t left the hotel for 24 hours and had clearly only packed one sweater. If I was Hunter S Thompson, I thought, I would be using this time to knock myself out at the minibar (there was no minibar) and do something dynamic like watch porn. Instead, I bought two Twixes from the shop, went back upstairs and watched that clip of Maggie Smith reading John Betjeman that’s been doing the rounds. I reloaded it four times for the way she says “tea”.On the last day, in the deep silence of the room, I felt a novel sensation. What even was that? Wait, it couldn’t be, could it? Oh my God, it was boredom. I got up and went to the desk. A tiny miracle: I wanted to work."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/399dfc115cc0d5d9d9d140ac885cc05cfca93401/0_97_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44fcc539d5e386fbff529197dec69b4c","title":"naming and shaming the polluters","story":"Global environment editor Jonathan Watts discusses the ’s investigation into the fossil fuel industry, and the structures that need to change to halt the climate emergency.

At the time it seemed jarring, and in retrospect very much not what was needed but it’s not the worst of the bunch – González Iñárritu gets nul points for incorporating footage of people jumping from the collapsing World Trade Center in a soundimage collage.A somewhat supercilious satire on the property-owning middle classes that Loach later admitted he was the wrong director for: a little bit Fassbinder, a little bit Gurney Slade. It played into Loach’s favourite theme – the little man against the system – but the director’s instincts are not best served by wackiness. A shame, as it throws away a great lead performance by Ken Jones, a regular Loach collaborator, and later immortalised as the prison snitch Ives in Porridge.Not an adaptation of the Robert Harris alternative-history novel, but a patchy account of an East German musician as unhappy under communism as he is in the west. This is Loach’s signature theme – systems and authority of any kind are open to abuse – but he is never at his best with non-English-speaking characters and this film (almost entirely in German) is not exactly a triumph.Another package film, with Loach directing the final third after chunks from Ermanno Olmi (The Tree of Wooden Clogs) and Abbas Kiarostami. It’s a clever idea – train tickets as a symbol for wider social permissions – and Loach’s bit is nice but slight, with a bunch of Celtic fans squabbling among themselves whether to help an Albanian migrant family.The earliest of Loach’s Wednesday Plays to survive shows his early style in full flow. A talky, digressive piece, this anti-death penalty broadside is infused with a jittery hyperactive energy as Loach sought to overcome the staid traditions of television drama. It’s a bit on the stagey side, with lots of cockney chat, but the final execution scene, when poor Tony Selby is strung up for killing a prison officer, still packs a hell of a punch.Loach may not be an obvious football man, but it’s a thread that runs through his work. This innovative mix of drama and documentary pleasingly focuses on a cult figure from Everton’s mid-60s cup-winning side: the Scottish midfielder Alex Young. Loach (as ever) is more interested in the fans and how football folds into their lives (more good work from Ken Jones), with real-life footage of Everton personnel (including Young) talking to camera about their lives. In truth, it doesn’t amount to all that much, but texturally it’s still pretty interesting.Loach really nailed his political colours to the mast with this script by the Trotskyist former docker Jim Allen, and in doing so proved that the intricacies of an industrial dispute could be material for compelling, if not exactly exhilarating, drama. Nevertheless, this was evidence that Loach had achieved what he had clearly been aiming at for some time: acting so planed down it was indistinguishable from reality.You can see the attraction of the Nicaraguan civil war: one of the great international causes of the 80s. The involvement of Robert Carlyle, fresh from Trainspotting, gave this film a shot in the arm, although the somewhat saucer-eyed approach to the Latin characters – particularly Carla herself, with whose exotic mystery Carlyle’s bus driver falls in love – doesn’t do the film many favours.An uncomplicated, comfort-zone paean to the Irish communist Jimmy Gralton, whose brand of free-thinking is too much for the local worthies in 1930s Ireland. There’s not much light and shade here: Gralton (Barry Ward) is your standard crinkle-eyed nice-guy, a sacrificial lamb to the republic’s new intolerance.Loach’s mature, unadorned style emerged with this account of a labour dispute in north-west England, a BBC Play for Today that is essentially a lightly fictionalised treatment of the 1970 Pilkington glass strike. It recreates the smoke-filled rooms and committee discussions, establishing that the unions and management are both conspiring to shore up a system that keeps the ordinary workers in their place. Compared to The Big Flame, which covers not dissimilar ground, this is a sober, unblinking treatment, eliminating the flourishes of his 60s work. Heavy-duty stuff.While there is something fundamentally naive in this film’s analysis of mental illness – merging RD Laing’s anti-organic thesis with his own politics, Loach aims to pin responsibility for its subject’s schizophrenia on “social conditions”, namely, Kate’s poor relationship with her mother – this is high-achieving formally. Formatted as a documentary, with a stream of “interviews” and voiceover, this is fiction disguised very convincingly as fact. Unusually, Loach slips into point-of-view as the final ECT scenes approach.This one is a bit of an outrider. Loach scored something of a coup by casting the Manchester United legend Eric Cantona as a sort of Play It Again, Sam-style dope-fuelled fantasy adviser to a harassed Mancunian postman. It’s got its strong points, but the required wackiness isn’t always there.Named after the road into Baghdad airport, Loach’s assault on the west’s murky activities in Iraq focuses on the outsourcing of fighting and the subsequent corporate cover-up. It is one of his more conventional-looking films, and takes on a big target – possibly too big for the scale of film Loach is able to mount.A remakereworking of In Two Minds, framed as a more traditional dramatic narrative and with the central character’s troubled mindset more obviously triggered by the generation gap and the abortion she was made to have. Although this film follows a similar trajectory, finding environmental and social causes for her erratic behaviour, leading to seemingly brutal ECT treatment, Loach wisely retreats a little from the wider mental-illness thesis of the original.A lightweight entry in Loach’s Scottish cycle: a violent tearaway (played by Paul Brannigan) resolves to get out of the Glasgow gang life by stealing some valuable whisky. This actually has a happy ending (of sorts), but Loach doesn’t quite succeed in making a basically vicious central character likable.This film contains one of the few non-white lead characters in Loach’s work: Casim, son of Pakistani immigrants, who embarks on a forbidden relationship with Catholic school teacher Roisin. Loach’s target, as ever, is the system of control that prevents ordinary people from achieving freedom in their lives this inter-ethnic romance does a decent job in exploring religion and immigrant culture, but it isn’t Loach’s natural habitat.A likable comedy from Loach’s early-90s resurgence, working from a Jim Allen script about an on-his-uppers chancer trying to scrape together enough money for a communion dress for his daughter. It’s not one of his most resonant films, but is basically good natured and an excellent example of the director’s unerring ability to get great performances from first-timers: the lead is Bruce Jones, who was a club-circuit comic at the time.Another great spot from Loach: Crissy Rock, another former club comic, is tremendous as self-destructive mum Maggie, who has lost four of her children to social services after a string of disastrous relationships. Loach, characteristically, is doing his utmost to extract sympathy for one of life’s casualties there is little sympathy to spare for the council workers trying to deal with her.In its day, this adaptation of Nell Dunn’s stories for the Wednesday Play spot was notorious for its agonised abortionmiscarriage sequence but there’s more to this than outrage. Like its predecessor Three Clear Sundays, this is a rangy, digressive portrait of street life here it is about three young women working in a wash-house in Battersea and is a depiction of a marginalised, under-represented community that hums with life. The abortion itself is interestingly consequence-free the three leads (who include Carol White in her first Loach role) are all great.One of Loach’s few attempts to make a putatively commercial “family film”: this is adapted from Leon Garfield’s book about a kid in the 18th century who falls in with an itinerant, hulking villain (the Black Jack of the title), rescues a girl who has been sent to the madhouse and works for a funfair. It is unusual, interesting material for a children’s film, even by 70s standards, but the flat, ultra-naturalistic acting style Loach employed works against the extravagant storyline: the whole thing could have been a bit more rollicking.Loach held his nose and went to the US to make this statement-film about exploitation of immigrant workers in Los Angeles. It stars Adrien Brody as a union organiser who (wouldn’t you know it?) falls in love with one of the women he is defending. Even so, Loach lands some telling sledgehammer blows, even if – outside his UK and Ireland comfort zone – much of his customary nuance is absent.In retrospect, this looks like an early emanation of the nostalgia-socialism that helped pave the way for Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour leadership triumph two years later. A compendium of interviews of warhorse campaigners and archive-clip history about Clement Attlee’s landslide victory in 1945, this is just about the only Loach documentary expressly aimed at the cinema. Although its contemporary political purpose is rather over-evident, it is still a stirring vision of what used to be, and what many hoped could be again.A conspiracy thriller that marked Loach’s return to feature film-making after a difficult 1980s spent trying (and often failing) to get his TV projects broadcast. As with the later Route Irish, Loach goes for a relatively mainstream style to tell an incendiary political story: here it is about British military collusion in the murder of a human rights lawyer (clearly related to the real-life killing of Pat Finucane). It is a bit by-the-numbers stylewise, but it re-established Loach as a radical force.A feature-length drama made for ITV, adapted from a Barry Hines novel, and about as pared-down a piece as Loach is ever likely to make. Phil Askham is the eponymous estate worker, caught between competing loyalties and as out of place down the pub with the poacher-forgiving locals as with the capped-and-Barboured shooting gentry. There is no plot to speak of: just an incremental progression of incident (some, like rabbit hunting with ferrets, looks pretty gruesome for modern sensibilities), but it’s remarkable all the same: a working life in collision with muddy, bloody nature.Unusually, this full-length feature had its UK premiere on TV perhaps reflecting the popular nature of its subject: rail privatisation. Loach has always admired “railwaymen” for their tight organisation and solidarity: he clearly enjoyed bringing out their camaraderie in an appealing film that had self-evident real-world parallels. Staffed with the customary lineup of club comics and singers turned actors, this is Loach in confident, mid-season form.The pick of Loach’s 1960s TV work, and not just for the galvanising effect it had on the then, and still, current concerns over homelessness. Carol White is tremendous as the mother who desperately tries to hang on to her children as her domestic situation becomes ever more precarious (husband injured at work, clashes with the in-laws, hard-hearted landlord). This is society as a slowly closing trap, with Loach accusatory towards the social workers and housing officers who are as cold as everyone else. The final scene, where Cathy’s children are taken off her in a railway station, is horrible in its raw intensity.In the late 90s and early 00s, Scotland provided a rich seam of material for Loach and this one – nominally a teen movie – is one of the finest. Starring Martin Compston (another first-timer who, unlike most of Loach’s discoveries, has gone on to enjoy a solid acting career), this is a rough, violent tale of Glasgow kid sucked, not entirely reluctantly, into the drug-dealing life. His naive dreams of escape soon evaporate: there is no going back.Kierston Wareing made a real splash in this excellent and well-observed drama (like The Navigators, a TV premiere in the UK but a cinema release in other countries). And also like that film, Loach finds a new seam of material in the outsourced working world, where job security and back-up have melted away. Wareing is a new version of the hemmed-in Loach figure: a recruitment agent ruthless to those below, a victim of those above, with none of the security net of old-style employment. Loach’s main target is the apparent freedom such conditions promise: the reality is very different.Loach was reportedly very disappointed by the box office failure of this Barry Hines adaptation, which motivated his return to TV in the ensuing decade. In retrospect, it is not hard to see why audiences avoided it: it is an incredibly gloomy black-and-white portrait of boredom and the Thatcherite recession. Looking at it now, it is an unexpectedly charming film: a study of a teenage relationship in adversity, staged with a total commitment to realism and awkwardness, and light years away from the John Hughes teen movies that would be coming down the pipe a few years later.A monster success – the Cannes Palme d’Or and record box office – that must have come as a pleasant surprise. All Loach’s characteristic ingredients are here: a fierce concentration on hot-button social issues (food banks and benefits assessment) preternaturally realistic performance a standup comic (Dave Johns) doing his first bit of acting. Released in the year of the Brexit referendum, and surfing on the Momentum-inspired confidence of the anti-austerity left, the film unexpectedly hit a major nerve. If we are being absolutely honest, as a film it is solid if not spectacular (although the awful baked-beans scene is up there with Loach’s most harrowing). In terms of impact, though, it is something else.Loach didn’t exactly discover Peter Mullan, who had been bobbing about for years – and had even played one of the builders in Riff-Raff (see below) – but he gave him a tremendous showcase in what turned out to be the finest of Loach’s Scotland-set films. Mullan plays the classic Loachian male: struggling with demons, hoping to be redeemed by love but dragged down by misplaced loyalties. It’s Mullan’s charisma that puts this one over the top, both ferocious and tender as the film requires it.Loach’s new film, his first since Blake, shows that he can pull off top-notch work as he heads into his 80s. As a subject, the gig economy appears to have only intensified the director’s motivations and his principal character here, delivery driver Ricky (Kris Hitchen), exemplifies the new type of trapped victim: worker solidarity has been destroyed by zero-hours contracts, with devastating effects on Ricky’s working and family life. It also contains one of Loach’s most memorable bad-guy characters: self-proclaimed “nasty bastard” Maloney, the warehouse supervisor played by Ross Brewster.Loach suddenly expanded his horizons in the mid-90s with this tribute to the foreign fighters who got involved in the Spanish civil war – another cause eternally dear to the left’s heart. Ian Hart – who had just played John Lennon in Backbeat – turned in a fine performance as the Liverpudlian communist who travels out to join the struggle in the 1930s like many a Loach protagonist before and since, supposed good guys (in this case, the Stalinist cadres of the International Brigades) are as bad as the official enemy. The script, by Jim Allen, posits the Trotskyist POUM militia as the real heroes. Rather brilliantly, Loach applied his ultra-realist style to the combat scenes, of house-to-house guerrilla warfare, with impressive results they effectively balance out the longwinded scenes of political discussion.After making a splash with his TV work, Loach was picked up by Joseph Janni, the celebrated producer of British new wave films such as Billy Liar, Darling and Far from the Madding Crowd. This was Loach’s feature debut, and it imported all the strengths of his previous films: empathetic drama, brilliantly natural performances (including one from Terence Stamp, amazingly right at the height of his 60s stardom), and an audacious deployment of on-camera improvisation. This very much benefited from being more focused and less digressive than the TV plays, and its refusal to find neat narrative solutions pointed the way ahead for Loach’s film work.Loach’s first Palme d’Or went to this complex, large-scale film about the Irish state’s birthing pains, ning both the war of independence against the British and the subsequent civil war that followed it. Like Land and Freedom, this suggested that authentic radical values were destroyed, cynically, by revolutionaries-in-name-only: Cillian Murphy, as a socialist doctor and IRA soldier, is the vessel through which this conflict is explored – first fighting alongside, and then against, his brother Teddy. It is a thoroughly absorbing film, and very much not the propaganda piece one might expect (although, inevitably, the British, fuelled by their imperial arrogance, don’t come out well).Loach has always liked to make films about camaraderie: the literal representation of the class solidarity so central to his political thinking, and something in desperately short supply in the era of outsourcing and privatisation. Riff-Raff is arguably his finest treatment of the theme: the group of builders working on (symbolism alert!) a former hospital being turned into luxury flats. The lead actor is Robert Carlyle, in a career-making performance as Stevie: Ricky Tomlinson (former real-world union activist and long-term resident of Brookside) was a revelation as the effervescent socialist and site leader. Loach also contrived one of his most moving romances, between Stevie and Emer McCourt’s Susan, undone by drugs and difficult circumstances. It is perhaps not Loach’s most hard-hitting film, but it is his most purely likable.It may have spent decades in school-treat screening hell, but Kes’s glories remain undimmed 50 years after it was first released. Adapted from Barry Hines’s novel about a kid who becomes obsessed with looking after a bird of prey, it has got an obvious point of entry for school-age children – it is the ultimate misfit story – so its popularity as a classroom time-filler is understandable.As a parable of how iniduality is squashed and warped – not only by the heartless teachers, but by Billy Casper’s uncaring family – it is as heartrending as ever. Loach got one of his most miraculously brilliant performances in the central role from David “Dai” Bradley the raft of others on hand include Brian Glover as the bullying sports teacher and Colin Welland as the friendlier English teacher.What sets the film apart, though, is that Kes is Loach’s most brilliant film cinematically: his and cinematographer Chris Menges’s interest in the Czech new wave found its expression in beautifully astute choices of shot and lighting, alternately amplifying the story’s wit, cruelty and desperation. It may seem churlish to pick Loach’s second feature as his best, but Kes has stood the test of time like no other, and will surely continue to do so."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/136db03b5b6c279212862d4036602334c79768dc/0_107_3158_1895/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=795868529861c45058c50a2e9c6f6dca","title":"paul dano riddler batman cast","story":"The There Will Be Blood and Little Miss Sunshine actor will star alongside Robert Pattinson and Zoë Kravitz in a noirish take on the DC character Paul Dano will take on the villainous role of the Riddler in The Batman, a new noirish take on the DC story.The There Will Be Blood star, who was recently nominated for an Emmy for his performance in Escape from Dannemora, will join Robert Pattinson, playing Batman, and Zoë Kravitz as Catwoman. The Batman comes from the director of Cloverfield and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Matt Reeves, who is seeking to make a more grounded take on the character.Jonah Hill had been in talks for the role but recently decided against joining the project. The role of the Riddler was previously played by Jim Carrey in 1995’s Batman Forever. According to Warner Bros, the character will be known as Edward Nashton.“What’s exciting about Batman is how it relates to now and also how personal it can be,” Reeves told the Hollywood Reporter earlier this year. “It’s very much a point-of-view-driven, noir Batman tale. It’s told very squarely on his shoulders, and I hope it’s going to be a story that will be thrilling but also emotional.”The cast will also include Jeffrey Wright as Commissioner Gordon, played by Gary Oldman in Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight trilogy.Last year saw Dano’s directorial debut with drama Wildlife, starring Carey Mulligan and Jake Gyllenhaal. He’s also attached to The Power of the Dog, the new film from Jane Campion that will also star Kirsten Dunst and Benedict Cumberbatch.Media sources suggest The Batman will begin production late this year or early 2020 with a summer 2021 release date confirmed.

It is a beady-eyed spy drama that has shrewd things to say about the British establishment’s tendency to spite under pressure, about the eternal duality of cockup and conspiracy, about the Kafkaesque problems involved in defending yourself legally against a treason charge, and, importantly, about the kind of young, vulnerable people that we end up depending on to tell us how we are governed.Official Secrets shows that spy dramas from real life are very often not action thrillers such as Bond or Bourne or Homeland – or indeed Hood’s last movie, Eye in the Sky, from 2015 – but something more like nuclear-level office politics.It is based on the true case of Katharine Gun, a translator working for the British security services at the GCHQ surveillance unit in Cheltenham. In 2003, she was astonished to receive an email making it plain she was expected to find out incriminating personal details in the lives of UN representatives from small countries so that they could be blackmailed into voting for the war in Iraq. Gun printed out the email, and passed it to an anti-war friend, and it eventually formed the basis of a sensational front-page scoop in the Observer.Although it did not stop the war, as Gun dreamed of doing, it played an important part in turning press and public opinion. Gun herself was prosecuted under the Official Secrets Act.Keira Knightley gives a focused, plausible and sympathetic performance as Gun, and the film shows that she is in many ways the classic whistleblower. She has an idealism, work ethic and professionalism that made her an excellent intelligence operative in the first place, and yet it is precisely these things that made her rebel. Most importantly of all, she is young – like Edward Snowden, or Chelsea Manning, or Sarah Tisdall, jailed in 1984 for revealing details about American cruise missiles in Britain. Gun is still young enough not to have made an ineradicable career investment in GCHQ or formed loyalty links to its upper reaches.The working life of the Observer is boisterously and affectionately represented. Rhys Ifans plays renowned reporter Ed Vulliamy as a passionately angry critic of the government Matt Smith plays Martin Bright – who wrote the original story – and Hanako Footman plays young journalist Nicole Mowbray, whose chaotic, innocent mistake in transcribing the email, replacing its American spellings with British ones, caused the story to be initially rubbished by online conspiracists in the US. Conleth Hill plays the Observer’s editor Roger Alton who, despite his pro-government line, comes out of this rather well. It is his honest lust for a good story that causes him to publish.But these journalists’ lives are basically comfortable. Gun, on the other hand, is marched into a hair-raising inquisition at GCHQ, and then into a police station, and then informed that she can’t reveal details about her work to her defending counsel, and then finds that her Turkish asylum-seeker husband, Yasar (Adam Bakri), has been mysteriously shuffled up the list for imminent deportation.The most intriguing relationship suggested by the film is that of the veteran human rights lawyer Ben Emmerson (Ralph Fiennes), who defended Gun, and his former colleague, the one-time liberal barrister Ken MacDonald (Jeremy Northam), who became the director of public prosecutions and with the decision of whether to press the charge against Gun, and how or if to make an example of her. What can have been the dynamic between these two men? The film depicts a kind of cordial wariness curdling into detestation.In 2019, we have arguably more complicated views on leaks and whistleblowing, now that the reputation of Julian Assange has clouded who we think of as the underdog hero. But Gun’s case is extraordinarily relevant it shows a world that in some ways feels like yesterday and in other ways like a lifetime ago. It’s a world in which people store computer files on Zip drives, where a youthful-looking Tony Blair is interviewed on TV by David Frost and where the establishment was broadly, if unhappily, on board with supporting and joining the US military adventure in Iraq.These are precisely the people who now urbanely accept that it was all wrong. The change of heart didn’t happen naturally. It happened because of people like Gun, of whom the film is a sharp, pertinent reminder.• Official Secrets is released in the UK on 18 October and Australia on 21 November."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76b4ca24a8ad97f332e3e09a6b015d7e74409079/0_139_4158_2495/master/4158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b2b51c2cedeb37527ccc0ca864b487e","title":"womens football have you tried to set up a grassroots team","story":"We want to hear from those who have struggled to set up women’s football teams Women’s football has seen a score of successes in recent months: England’s top league went professional, the World Cup was watched by record-breaking audiences and crowds during the current FA cup are growing.The number of girls and women taking up the sport has also skyrocketed, with 605 new girls youth teams and 260 new adult female clubs registered to play this season.But some women have experienced difficulties in accessing facilities, such as pitches.

The manager cut an embattled figure before the international break when his team followed the 7-2 humiliation at home to Bayern Munich with a 3-0 defeat at Brighton.Pochettino’s ability to motivate the dressing room in year six of his tenure has been questioned, with some worrying he has reached the end of the cycle. Spurs have won only three games this season and they looked broken during that harrowing afternoon at Brighton. They can ill afford anything other than victory in Saturday’s home fixture with Watford.However Pochettino has no concerns about the level of unity behind the scenes and he pointed towards a team bonding meal that has been arranged for next week – and to which he has been invited – as evidence of it.“When you receive a text from the players inviting you and the coaching staff for a dinner – only two things can happen,” Pochettino said. “It’s because they want to say goodbye. Or because they feel they love you and they want to show they are with you. I think it’s the second. They are not about to say goodbye to me. To say goodbye to me, say goodbye here! Not invite me to dinner.The freshness of Pochettino’s squad has been held up for scrutiny, sometimes by the manager himself, after a lack of signings in recent windows. Although Tanguy Ndombélé, Ryan Sessegnon and Giovani Lo Celso arrived last summer, they were the first new faces since January 2018 and it was certainly an unusual move when the club brought back the 35-year-old goalkeeper Michel Vorm on Monday.Vorm had left in search of a new challenge at the end of last season only not to find one and remain a free agent. Spurs have given him a contract until the end of the season after Hugo Lloris dislocated an elbow at Brighton. There have been calls for Pochettino to strengthen in January.“I never was keen on January and I will not change now because it is a tough period. The most important is to stay together. Some circumstances can arise in December and January and you need to take some decisions but we are not going to force nothing. We decided the squad was decent and now we have to be strong that our decision was right. We cannot change quickly because we are suffering a storm.“Now is not a point to talk about January and refreshing the team. It is about trying to find solutions. I am not talking about January with anyone. I told the players: ‘For me, January is too far away.’ You can accept the word ‘crisis’ when you lose two games in the way we did. Or you can use a different word. The most important is how you feel inside. We hope we are going to turn it around.”Christian Eriksen is a doubt for the Watford game after he suffered a dead leg on Denmark duty."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8db7e58c7b68539a2bbf256c6e3c569acbae4e3e/0_189_4385_2631/master/4385.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5715c7a8db6b983b81f6a6d4fdd744d9","title":"sean matty longstaff newcastle united","story":"Newcastle’s midfield brothers discuss their different paths to the first team, Matty’s debut goal against Manchester United and why their family could rival the NevillesWhatever the future holds, Matty Longstaff will never forget the sudden, almost elemental, assault on his senses. He met the ball, his brother screamed “hit it”, David de Gea was beaten from distance and the 19-year-old knew life would never be quite the same again.“I can just remember the loudest roar I’ve ever heard in the Gallowgate,” he says, his smile as wide as the Tyne. “It was all a bit surreal.”As a schoolboy growing up by the mouth of the river in North Shields, he was obsessed with Newcastle United but never dared imagine that, this month, he would make his Premier League debut against Manchester United playing alongside his 21-year-old sibling, Sean, in central midfield. The idea that he might score the winning goal for Steve Bruce’s previously struggling team in a 1-0 win at St James’ Park belonged strictly to the realms of fantasy.After the game he said thank you to Bruce. Manners matter to the Longstaffs’ parents, David – a former Great Britain ice hockey player – and Michelle but if such politeness reflected his upbringing it was also sincere.“It was only right,” says Matty, who earns around £850 a week but seems set for a significantly enhanced contract. “I can’t thank him enough. It was a brave move putting me in and backing a kid. He’d been getting a lot of stick a lot of managers under pressure at such a big club in such an important game would have gone for experience.”With his bonfire-bright ginger hair and adhesive first touch, Matty has, inevitably, been likened to Paul Scholes while Sean’s elegant, straight-backed passing style meant he was hyped as the new Michael Carrick when he broke into Rafael Benítez’s side last season.Flattered as the siblings are, there is arguably a better comparison. Considering their younger sister, 15-year-old Milly, is an outstanding netballer, the Longstaffs may just be Tyneside’s answer to the Neville family.“Two footballer brothers and an England netballer sister,” says Sean. “We’ve said to Milly: ‘We’ve done our little bit, it’s up to you now.’ She’s really good.”The boys are talking in a decoratively tired backroom at Newcastle’s training ground but their enthusiasm and sheer niceness refreshes it in a way two coats of fresh paint could not rival.Their mother has said the pair “really love each other” and they look slightly startled at being asked whether her words damaged their street cred.“We genuinely do love each other,” says Sean, firmly. “We’ll always be there for each other, always keep each other pretty level. There’s not loads of people you can trust, so to have your brother out there alongside you, knowing he’s got your back, is special.“We used to fight a lot and my mam once had to ask Newcastle’s coaches to have a word and tell us to behave but we got it out of the way at a young age. We realised we had to help each other.”If mutual devotion has long trumped minor disagreements, the pair remain different, with Matty more extrovert and Sean stronger academically. Whereas the latter progressed smoothly through Newcastle’s youth system, impressing hugely in nine first-team appearances last spring before a serious knee injury abridged his season, Matty’s trajectory proved more complicated.“When he was 10 or 11 Newcastle turned him away,” says Sean. “I’ve seen him crying about it. He said: ‘No one will ever do that to me again.’ From then on he’s worked so hard. It’s why I got a bit emotional when he scored. I filled up and thought: ‘I can’t start crying.’ The emotion was crazy. It was just pure happiness. It was even better than when I scored my first goal, just because of the occasion and knowing what he’d been through.”Visceral as the emotions surrounding it remain, Newcastle’s initial rejection was possibly the making of Matty. “It really pissed me off,” he says. “But it fired me up.”Back at North Shields Juniors, Sunderland tried to sign him several times but he refused to countenance the notion and Middlesbrough received similarly short shrift: “I said: ‘Stop asking, there’s only one club for me.’ Fortunately I got back to Newcastle.”With Michelle dedicating almost every evening to driving her children to football, netball or cricket practice and spending weekends cheering them on from frequently windswept touchlines, sport shaped their lives. “We were brought up quite strictly,” says Matty who, like Sean, is also a fine cricketer. “We had jokes and everything but our parents disciplined us.”After a year in Stockholm, where their father played for Djurgården, the family debated emigrating to Canada. It was a sliding doors moment but England’s north-east coast ultimately won the argument, leaving Longstaff Sr on course for his current role as player-coach at Whitley Warriors.Whereas the 45-year-old is a veteran, his sons’ on-pitch synchronicity belies their novice status. “Playing alongside my brother makes it a lot easier,” says Matty. “He’s so composed.”Sean shakes his head. “I couldn’t have done what he’s done at 19. We were in a tough situation and Matty’s controlled the tempo of a Premier League game on his debut.”If the Longstaffs have made North Shields famous for more than its fish quay, Georgian houses and international ferry terminus, their stabilising presence seems imperative at Chelsea on Saturday. “This season’s been turbulent,” says Sean. “Now it’s about the dressing room sticking together. As long as we’re all fighting for each other we’ll be all right.”He is more worried about Milly’s adolescence in a small town where everybody recognises her celebrity siblings and heads turn when they take their regular place in the crowd at non-league North Shields. “It can be hard for her at school when everyone’s talking about us we try to make sure she doesn’t read too much social media. That’s the not so great side of it. We can’t thank her enough for the sacrifices she’s made for us.”Shola Ameobi, who played alongside his brother Sammy at St James’, offers informed advice and a challenge has been set by George and Ted Robledo, Chilean siblings who helped Newcastle to 1952 FA Cup final glory against Arsenal with George scoring the only goal.Reprising that feat is for the future though right now the Longstaffs are content to hold their own in a changing room staffed with players from a dozen countries including Argentina, Brazil, Ghana and Paraguay.“The Premier League’s so worldwide,” says Sean. “Before kick-off against Manchester United I looked across at Matty and thought that to have two brothers from North Shields starting alongside each other felt pretty crazy. A year ago we’d have laughed at the idea.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d77c1234b0c531486fd61ff912ed7d8596fef80/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7dbb068e86a71a0f562fb3fc785f7db5","title":"premier league 10 things to look out for this weekend","story":"A crunch clash at Old Trafford, Palace tackle vulnerable champions and could West Ham do for Marco Silva?The last time Liverpool visited Old Trafford, they met a United side struggling with injuries – even before three players were forced off during the first half. But, though Liverpool were three points clear at the top, they played as though the goalless draw they eventually achieved was an acceptable result. In the event, Manchester City pipped them to the title by a point, and though that required a phenomenal run of 14 straight wins, had Liverpool embraced the pressure and played with their usual intensity in that game they would now be champions of England, not into their 30th season without a league title. On Sunday, Liverpool will arrive able to wear and excuse any slip-up: they are eight points clear at the top, while United, who are not quite as abhorrently awful as they’ve looked recently, will have some key players back from injury and should be up for the fight. Even so, Liverpool would be foolish to entertain those thoughts. They have one foot on City’s throat and the other aimed at United’s solar plexus allowing them to escape instead of kicking them when they’re down would be a significant oversight with potentially significant repercussions. Playing safe is not always the safe option.

Having shipped a combined 10 goals in two games against Bayern and Brighton, Tottenham are unlikely to approach this game with confidence, but the international break will at least have provided the majority of their players with a change of scenery in which to try to rid themselves of the ennui permeating their Enfield training HQ. Despite reports that he was distinctly unimpressed with summer transfer dealings, Mauricio Pochettino has said he does not expect any January signings because “I believe in the players we have”. All available evidence suggests his players currently have little or no belief in themselves. A home defeat would likely prompt fury in the stands, albeit among a fanbase who seem as yet undecided in whose direction exactly their ire should be aimed. BGMarco Silva survived the international break but should Everton lose to West Ham there is a chance he may not survive beyond the weekend. The situation is that critical for the Portuguese, following four straight league defeats which has put his side in the relegation zone before Saturday’s game. The omens are not good either. Two years ago, Ronald Koeman was sacked after Everton lost to a team from London in October Arsenal were the visitors, 5-2 the final score, and given Everton’s defensive travails right now – particularly at set pieces – who is to say they will not concede as many this weekend? Silva needs to tighten up his side and change it. The 4-2-3-1 formation he stubbornly sticks to is not working while certain players, most notably Gylfi Sigurdsson, have been performing poorly for some time. What’s for sure is that a failure to improve and adapt will cost Silva and, if he’s not careful, could do so very soon. SNCrystal Palace have made a brilliant start to the season, and could scarcely be better placed for the visit of the champions. Manchester City, on the other hand, have not looked as vulnerable in quite some time, and Roy Hodgson will seek to exploit that. Most likely, he will ask Wilfried Zaha and Jordan Ayew to rove in the spaces between City’s full-backs and centre-backs – such as there are – and, if their teammates can get them the ball, Palace are in the game. Pep Guardiola clearly doesn’t fancy John Stones – and with fair reason – but he must now rely on him, while Nicolás Otamendi remains a liability. However – and it really is an enormous however – Stones’s return from injury means Fernandinho is no longer required at the back, and with Kevin De Bruyne also fit again, City have a full complement of midfielders. Hodgson cannot simply plan his team’s route to goal but must somehow fathom how they avoid being taken apart. One job is significantly easier than the other. DHFootball365 recently published an article that broke down the attacking numbers surrounding Leicester’s very good start to the season and hypothesised that they are quite simply unsustainable. For instance, Jamie Vardy’s five goals have come from seven shots on target, while the four Ricardo Pereira and Wilfred Ndidi have scored between them have come from four shots on target. So a drop off is coming. There was the loss at Liverpool before the international break and now a game against a Burnley side whose own decent start has gone under the radar somewhat. Sean Dyche’s side are seventh, having won two of their past three games and lost only once away from home. They won’t be pushovers at the King Power and could stifle a Leicester side who, if the stats are anything to go by, are playing at a level that is remarkable in more ways than one. SNBrighton have never won at Villa Park, but will fancy their chances of breaking that duck at the 12th time of asking. Graham Potter’s side went into the international break on the back of a 3-0 dismantling of Tottenham that had all the hallmarks of a lightbulb moment a game in which their players put into practice to devastating effect the possession-based philosophy their erudite manager has been preaching. With a run of winnable games against Villa, Everton, Norwich and Manchester United to come, they must show their performance against Spurs was no one-off. But, following the slaughter they visited upon Norwich at Carrow Road, Villa should provide a stern test. BGAfter difficult starts to the season, neither manager will have welcomed the international break. Frank Lampard had Frank Lampard’s Chelsea playing with freedom and zest, while Steve Bruce had finally copied Rafael Benítez, thereby restoring Newcastle’s discipline and intensity. However, it is not hard to predict the flow of this game: Newcastle will invite Chelsea on to them and hope to nick a goal, while Chelsea will look to pick holes in their back line, making the match an interesting test for Callum Hudson-Odoi. Lots of wingers are adept at running in behind, but the better the team they play for the less opportunity they have to do it, because opposing defences tend to occupy that space. What counts is the ability to pinch a yard from a standing start, pick clever passes that change the angle of attack, and sneak poacher’s goals at the back post. If Hudson-Odoi can marry these attributes to his preternatural skill, balance and composure, Chelsea have a star on their hands. DHCome Monday night it is possible Arsenal will be second. Victory over Sheffield United combined with City’s failure to win at Palace on Saturday would secure that outcome and leave Unai Emery no doubt feeling satisfied. But while Arsenal’s results have been good, the majority of their performances have not and should they be unconvincing again at Bramall Lane, regardless of the result, it will leave a question mark hanging over the Spaniard’s long-term credentials. Right now Emery seems like a man unsure whether to stick to his conservative principles or twist and let his team’s attacking riches flourish. A shift to something more decisive, and specifically to the latter, could be the thing that shows he knows what he is doing. SNThe Southampton jury remains out on Ralph Hasenhüttl, who takes his side to the Black Country to face Wolves . While not being Mark Hughes is a tick on the credit side of the Austrian’s ledger, it will only get him so far. His team have lost three consecutive Premier League matches against middling-to-decent opposition and failed to beat anyone of major significance since Spurs at the beginning of March. Hasenhüttl claims not having too many of his players away on international duty has benefited his team. “It gave me the chance to work on a few weaknesses in our game that we have seen in our last two games,” he announced. With his team averaging less than a point a game and tough assignments to come against Leicester and Manchester City next, his players urgently need to show they have taken his pointers on board. BGNorwich’s win over Manchester City – and the manner of it – made for the most inspirational 90 minutes of the season so far. But subsequent to it, Norwich were beaten by Burnley and Crystal Palace, then walloped by Aston Villa. Now sitting second-bottom, they need points as a matter of urgency. In a way, Bournemouth are ideal next opponents: their desire to play will permit Norwich to do likewise, but wins over Everton and Southampton followed by a creditable defeat at Arsenal show the Cherries are also in form. Their front four of Harry Wilson, Callum Wilson, Dominic Solanke and Josh King pose a stern threat to any defence, but the power and intelligence of their press mean Norwich must take more care than most. Playing out from the back against City’s diminutive technicians is one thing, but – however silly this may sound ­– doing likewise against Bournemouth is something else entirely.

It contained – according to the bottle – 6.25 mg of CBD per dosage, and tasted – also per the bottle’s label – of cold-pressed oranges.I wasn’t sure what to expect, if anything. But with the mania around CBD approaching fever pitch, I was curious to know if I, too, could in some way be touched by its allegedly remarkable powers of stress reduction, relaxation, and all-around wellbeing. We live in dire times. What’s the harm in trying to get away from it all without actually having to go anywhere?I bought the oil a week ago at the 420 Store, which bills itself as “New York’s first luxury, dedicated CBD store”. Most of its wares are displayed sparingly on pristine white shelves, and run the gamut from bath salts and skin creams to flavored gummies and tinctures. All contain some amount of CBD, a non-psychoactive cannabis compound (different from THC, the plant’s main psychoactive compound).The shop has a self-serious, high-gloss ambience, with a touch of wellness-derived spirituality thrown in, like some hybrid of Sephora and a Burning Man prayer circle. It made me want to laugh, but also made me mad, which is the same reaction I have to most attempts of the wellness industry to commodify and market the myriad stresses that accompany our attempts to exist in the modern world.The 420 Store opened its doors in June, six months after hemp was removed from the FDA’s list of controlled substances. Although there were already plenty of CBD products on the market, this had the effect of ungating a dam suddenly CBD seemed to be everywhere, from bodega counters to subway ads to shiny Soho storefronts to Walgreens. CBD had effectively become the new pumpkin spice, sprinkled on products high and low and everywhere in-between in an attempt to cash in on its alleged magic.CBD is purported to provide relief from a host of bodily ills like inflammation, pain and digestive problems to stress and anxiety. As such, the market is now crowded with CBD-infused chocolate bars, beverages, gummies, body lotions, pills, tinctures, face masks, and pain creams. The products are not limited to humans: a reportedly growing number of pet parents now turn to cannabidiol as the latest remedy to treat their pups.Dr Jordan Tishler founded and has run the Boston-based medical cannabis practice InhaleMD for six years (which in the cannabis world, makes him “one of the old guys”, he said). He’s also an instructor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. He takes a slightly dim view on the CBD gold rush. “I’m like, this is a side step this is foolishness,” he said. “People are so obsessed with talking about CBD that they’ve stopped talking about cannabis. And at the end of the day, cannabis is what helps my patients. CBD is close to useless.”Topicals, Tishler explained, wouldn’t do anything to me (“They’re another mythology– cannabinoids don’t go through your skin,” he said). Ingestible products such as vapes and oils might have an impact, but have been known to contain heavy metals like arsenic and mercury. The FDA doesn’t regulate cannabis products, and many of them aren’t subjected to third-party laboratory testing. Tishler recommended buying products only from legitimate dispensaries that require a medical marijuana card, which I didn’t have, so I went for the OTC variety.I started with the topicals: TriBeauty’s CBD Superfood Mask, Tribe Revive’s CBD-infused pain cream, TriBeauty’s CBD eye cream, and Uncle Bud’s CBD body lotion. All of them smelled nice the pain cream had a pleasant wintergreen aroma, while the face mask was redolent of pineapple (it doesn’t actually include pineapple, though it does include kale, spinach, and green tea). And all of them were, well, creamy I appreciated their ease of application and lack of discernible oiliness.Did any of them make me feel anything? No. Of course they didn’t the only thing I felt was the menthol in the Tribe Revive pain cream, which made my arm tingle like I’d slathered on Bengay. The amount I was getting from the creams was miniscule, in the ballpark of 1 to 5 mg. The doses that tend to be effective in humans, says Tishler, are 10 to 20 mg per kilogram. “The average human is about 70 kg,” he says. “That’s 700 to 1400 mg of CBD per day. Nobody can get that.”Annoyed but not surprised, I pressed on to ingestibles. I bought the Vitamin Shoppe’s Ancient Nutrition’s organic CBD hemp caplets (10 mg) and Winged’s Happiness “mood support complex”, (15 mg of CBD per soft gel, “uniquely formulated for women”). From the 420 Store, I bought Wyld’s blackberry gummies (25 mg per gummy) Grön’s Fair Trade dark chocolate bar (100 mg per $23.99 bar – yes, you read the price correctly) and Toast’s cold-pressed orange tincture (250 mg of CBD per one-ounce bottle) – the one I took before I started writing this. From TribeTokes, I tried Tribe Tincs’ full-spectrum CBD tincture (1,500 mg of CBD per one-ounce bottle).Had I taken them all at once, I would have easily exceeded the 700 mg mark, but the thought of potentially incapacitating myself with CBD was not appealing. I had a job and shit to do. So I proceeded with some vague sense of moderation.Unlike the lack of effectiveness of the topicals, the ingestibles presented a spectrum of results. On one end were capsules by Winged. One capsule’s evening primrose oil and “good mood complex”, it read, “may support balanced hormone levels as well as the brain’s ‘happy’ neurotransmitters serotonin and dopamine. Get your smile on girl!” Instead, I felt nothing (aside from disgust for the company’s car salesman-esque messaging) .Toast’s tincture did taste and smell just like oranges, as advertised, but was similarly uneventful. As for the Grön bar, it tasted like any other decent artisan chocolate bar, but the idea of eating the whole thing just to glean some kind of purported CBD effect was unappetizing. So I gave up, unaltered.Trying to toe the line between Tishler’s recommended effective dosage, my need to be a functioning adult, and, at this point, determined to feel … something, I took the Tribe Tinc’s prescribed 50 mg dosage. While I disagree with its claim of flavorlessness – to me, it carried a definite note of weedy funk – it did produce a noticeable feeling of general wellbeing, a sense that life had somehow become something I didn’t need to worry about very much.I felt my mind stray from thoughts of deadlines, rising sea levels, and the president’s sphincter-like visage to how beautiful my bag of frozen compost looked when I removed it from the freezer. Whether this was because I took it on the weekend or wasn’t feeling particularly anxious to begin with, I don’t know there’s also the possibility of the (very real) placebo effect. But what I can say is that, for whatever reason, 50 mg of CBD seemed to have a positive effect on me, insofar as it seemed to redirect my mind to a more sunny locale.Likewise, taking one of Wyld’s 25 mg gummies seemed to alter my outlook on the day. It helped that the gummies actually taste like blackberries and are thus delicious they also have a pleasing soft-chewy texture. Not long after taking one, I started to feel somewhat relaxed – so relaxed that I literally walked into traffic later that afternoon (thankfully, it was moving slowly, as was I).For my last adventure in CBD, I decided to go big, and also straight to the source. On a sunny Thursday afternoon, I climbed a flight of stairs to the snug but brightly lit Lower Manhattan office of Tribe Tokes. There I was greeted by Kim Byrnes, the company’s cofounder, who proceeded to guide me through a CBD dab. Byrnes, clad in midriff-bearing athleisure wear (she’s also a longtime pilates instructor) is an incredibly enthusiastic proponent of both CBD and THC – both, she told me, have helped her treat her ulcerative colitis and other ailments. She sounded almost encyclopedic as she talked about the numerous methods of CBD ingestion and their comparative merits.A dab is a highly concentrated form of CBD, containing about 10-15 mg of CBD. You inhale its vapor through a dab rig, a close cousin to the bong. The result, Byrnes said, is a “body high – it feels nice and relaxed and calm”.She put a concentrate of 7 Point Natural’s CBD Terp Sauce, a mix of CBD crystals and cannabis terpenes (organic compounds) in the rig’s nail and heated it up. I sucked the resulting vapor deep into my lungs, and, because I’m a rank amateur, scorched my esophagus. But on my second pull, I managed to get light-headed for a minute, and then felt … fine.It was only after leaving the TribeTokes office that I began to understand what Byrnes was talking about. All of the afternoon’s obstacles seemed to fall away from me, leaving me to walk a clear, gloriously smooth path through the rest of my day. Tourists walking four abreast down the sidewalk? Whatever, I thought. They’re just enjoying my city’s unparalleled beauty. A 15-minute wait for the train home? Not a problem, I thought more time to watch adorable rats frolic on the tracks.I felt beatific rather than annoyed by all of the obstacles the city placed in my path. But more than anything, I felt lucky. I am lucky that I’m at a point in my life where I’m not suffering from aches and pains or even much anxiety, aside from the usual geopolitical-climate-crisis-end-of-days variety. Had I written this story a few months ago, when I was dealing with the aftermath of a terrible relationship and wrenching shoulder and back pain, I might have been much more receptive to the claims being made by the CBD industry. But on this day, I was a contented skeptic.My head felt clear, my limbs felt loose, and the world rolled out its carpet in front of me, beckoning me to bask in the sunshine of my mind’s own invention."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9adb89bcbcab7d9d5936502afe7e81a7fd520322/0_0_2283_1370/master/2283.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80111548f266cf0fc545c6e039fb010f","title":"how paul dacre became the norma desmond of journalism","story":"The former Daily Mail editor had been living in his secluded dreamworld. But then he had to go and spoil it all with a letter attacking his successor Geordie GreigTo the executive offices of Associated Newspapers, publishers of the Daily Mail, and a story that you sense will end with a screenwriter floating dead in a swimming pool. For while a certain faded newspaper executive’s office is physically located in the Associated building on London’s High Street Kensington, I’m afraid that, in spiritual terms, this inidual resides on Sunset Boulevard. And some shots have been fired.But who is this descending the staircase, wild-eyed and writing excruciatingly humiliating letters to the Financial Times? Why, I believe – yes, it looks like Paul Dacre, forgotten star of the silent newspaper era. You know, before everyone pivoted to video. Then pivoted back again, having made somewhat less of a success of it than Hollywood did with the talkies.Anyway, let us bring up the lights and hear what the former Daily Mail editor is saying as he emotes furiously down the stairs of his dreamworld: “You see, this is my life! It always will be! Just us, the printing presses, and all those wonderful readers out there in the dark. All right, Lord Rothermere – I’m ready for my closeup.” Wonderful. Tragic, camp, hilarious – of course. But wonderful. Legends don’t die they just stew in the C-suite.But forgive me, for I’m getting ahead of myself. Let’s widen our shot from the corpse – perhaps my own, after writing this – and go back in time a bit. Last Saturday’s Financial Times featured a letter written to the paper by Dacre, and it was impossible to behold this document for even a moment without the words reassembling themselves into Norma Desmond’s famous speech. The missive was prompted by the paper’s interview with the current Mail editor, Geordie Greig, who, over the course of a lunch, chanced to mention that 265 advertisers who had deserted the Mail under Dacre have returned to the fold since his successor assumed the editorship. Alas, the suggestion that he was commercially dislikable – the only kind of dislike that matters – was rather too much for our silent star.And so to the letter. “Admirable chap he may be,” runs Dacre’s first blatant euphemism for his favourite four-letter word, “but Geordie Greig is as economic with the actualité as your paper is in reporting Brexit.” Oooooh! Since digressions seem to be permitted, I do hope that, even in seclusion, Dacre is still attended by one faithful retainerdamaged former news editor, who forges daily fan mail to him and assures him: “Madame is the greatest star of all.”Anyway, back to madame. “He claims 265 advertisers came back to the Daily Mail in his year as editor,” she hisses. “In fact, far more than that number left during the same period.” Don’t you just adore dirty linen – the only type of washing that isn’t a lady’s job. In similarly relaxed style, Dacre goes on to fret to the FT about “your writer’s ludicrous caricature of the Mail before I stepped aside” – before you what, sorry? – “before I stepped aside at 70 after 26 years in the chair”. It’s somewhat disappointing that the FT headlined this letter “A solid start, but Greig has some way to go yet”, when it clearly should have gone for: “I AM big – it was the papers that got small.”Dacre goes on to list his achievements with the Daily Mail down the years – billions in profits, increased circulation, successful campaigns and a number of much-loved but dated Cecil B DeMille pictures. No mention of all the unvaccinated kiddies, but perhaps the FT edited him for space, or a late-breaking letter from a sustainable businesswoman.“As for Mr Greig,” comes the next clear euphemism for Dacre’s favourite word, “I congratulate him for making a solid start as editor and continuing so many of those campaigns but I’m sure he’ll forgive me for suggesting that he (or his PR) defers his next lunch with the FT until he has notched up a small fraction of those journalists’ achievements.” And with that, it is signed: “Paul Dacre, chairman and editor in chief, Associated Newspapers.”Well then. No matter how kindly we may wish to look upon former idols, this letter has more than a touch of the messy bitches to it. In fact, as a show of weakness, it is almost too much. To put it in terms I know he would appreciate: the former Mail editor seems to have had some sort of dignity malfunction. Yes, outspoken Paul Dacre has accidentally flashed a bit of weaknessboob there, giving onlookers much more than they bargained for. Stunned newspaper fans – all five of them – commented how Dacre seemed not to care who saw as he flaunted his vulnerability in a revealing letter that left nothing to the imagination.Furthermore, that doesn’t seem to be the end of it. Indeed, it was an exquisite torment to read a follow-up story on Wednesday, headlined: “Paul Dacre’s position at Mail in doubt after attack on Geordie Greig.” In many ways, we don’t need to pay any attention to the article in question, on account of it having appeared in the , a newspaper neither Dacre nor I would ever dream of having in the house. On the other hand, we have both had one of our secretarial retinue print out a hard copy of the article from the online version of that publication, from which I learn that senior Associated executives have been “infuriated” by Dacre’s flash of weaknessboob (again I paraphrase). Words such as “unprofessional” are used.According to this report: “The row has focused attention on Dacre’s actual role at the publisher of the Daily Mail. He signed the letter to the FT using the title of ‘chairman and editor-in-chief of Associated Newspapers’.” And why shouldn’t he? “The title was regarded by many internally as a way of honouring a long-serving employee rather than an active editorial role.”Early days, early days. Still, if it doesn’t come good for Dacre in the executive suite, he does have other irons in the fire. A couple of months ago, it was announced that Channel 4 had commissioned a landmark series detailing “Paul Dacre’s worldview”. I am, of course, absolutely dying to see this show, which I’m intrigued to understand will be more than a 60-minute looped shot of a Spitfire shooting up a Viagra factory.So yes, all very promising, but don’t call the programme a “comeback”. As Norma warns Joe Gillis: “I hate that word. It’s a return, a return to the millions of people who have NEVER forgiven me for deserting the screen.” Well, quite. I feel absolutely sure that Dacre’s best days are ahead of him, just like the UK’s after the leaving the EU, or a single mother trying to re-enter the job market after having a baby. But if not, this current performance should serve as a delight to all – a glorious swansong, if you will, from Fleet Street’s finest."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46e032a78627fdce61f11cedb9a0feac168eb2c1/0_0_4550_3033/master/4550.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3a41b635f330703985faa262879bc62d 1320w","title":"caroline polachek women in music are taught that once youre 35 youve expired","story":"After 12 years in the Brooklyn indie band Chairlift – and a magic mushroom epiphany – Polachek has produced one of the year’s finest experimental pop albumsCaroline Polachek was writing about the danger of trying to change for somebody from her first hit with indie-pop group Chairlift. “I tried to do handstands for you,” she sang on 2008’s twee yet melancholy Bruises, which made the Boulder-to-Brooklyn transplants ubiquitous after it was used in an iPod advert. The charming track caught the trio in a similar bind with their audience. “Even when we released our second album, which was much grittier than the first, people pushed back and said: ‘We want more Bruises,’” Polachek recalls.To their credit, Chairlift never caved in. Over three albums, the trio-turned-duo easily outstripped the fast-diminishing Brooklyn indie scene of the early 2010s. She and Patrick Wimberley were as fluent in 80s Japanese pop, esoteric English songwriter Virginia Astley and opera as they were contemporary R\u0026ampB Beyoncé ended up recording a Chairlift castoff, No Angel, on her self-titled fifth album. They split, amicably, in 2017, proud of their distinctive sound, says Polachek, if disheartened by the limited perceptions of what an indie band could become.Polachek had released a pop album as Ramona Lisa in between Chairlift’s second and third albums. An ambient record, billed to CEP, followed their split. The shifting names, she says, offered conceptual limitations that guided her work. Pang, her first album under her own name, arrives free from such scaffolding – so much so that it was never supposed to exist. Thankfully, it does: it’s among the year’s finest experimental pop albums, blending acoustic and synthetic textures into a surrealist yet affecting listen. Co-producers Polachek and PC Music alumnus Danny L Harle wield elegance and precision worthy of a sushi master, or peak-pop Peter Gabriel.After Chairlift split, Polachek felt her life lacked structure. “I figured I would just try a bit of everything,” she says over lunch in Paris last month. She’s here for fashion week and her outfit suggests someone at home there: a leather vest over a blousy white shirt that makes Polachek, with her striking, almond-shaped face and wide eyes, look like a modish Joan of Arc, whereas I would look like an employee at a medieval-themed restaurant. In summer 2017, she was in LA to write songs with Harle, the idea being to pitch them to Katy Perry. A magic-mushroom trip made her second-guess her plans. “I remember thinking: what I do with my time right now is really going to determine what happens next,” she recalls in her cut-glass accent. “I shouldn’t be wasting my time on things that I don’t care passionately about.”When she called Harle to cancel, he suggested they write for her instead. Polachek had been making a “warmer, auburn, folk-tinged, peaceful” album titled Calico that she didn’t see working with the hard, shiny, electronic sound Harle was known for. Still, she agreed. Perhaps inevitably, they came up with something that overshadowed Calico and kickstarted a fruitful collaboration. Their first song, Parachute, “is about a total loss of control,” says Polachek. “And it’s not giving that control up to another person, it’s giving it up to life – and that’s the scariest thing.”It turned out to be premonitory. Polachek had been experiencing inexplicable adrenal rushes that stopped her from sleeping and accelerated her metabolism. She called them “pangs” and sought to recreate the sensation in her sessions with Harle. “I couldn’t tell if my excitement about all these musical breakthroughs was triggering my body,” she says, “like I was manufacturing drugs internally.” Six months later, her marriage of four years ended. “All these structures that had seemed essential to my identity and my time fell away,” she says. “Everything happened very fast. I felt a giant shift within myself that caught me by surprise. As much as I fought against it, I had to learn that the body knows more than we do.”Polachek had felt rooted in New York in her relationship. Then she experienced “what Joni Mitchell calls the hejira, this need to fly to another place,” she says. “A lot of the music comes out of that conflict of wanting this other thing and feeling guilty about wanting it, and then it guiding me somewhere despite my kicking and screaming.” She is opaque about the relationship “out of respect for privacy”, she says carefully, welling up a bit. Following those impulses entailed “a digestion of shame and self-questioning that, nonetheless, led to a resolution that things would be OK”. She felt she was running towards something rather than away from it, although she admits she felt burdened by “a crystallised idea of what the world was” in New York – even though the Brooklyn heyday was over, she still saw the same faces on the street every day. “I felt like it was a weight that was always on whatever I did.”She is more cutting in her lyrics, which repeatedly touch on being asked to change her nature. “When I stop caring, you stop caring,” she sings on I Give Up, which crests on a frustrated heave of a chorus. (Polachek describes her music brilliantly: “The whole song is an expression of apathy, and I wanted it to feel like something was being chucked really hard.”) She had never written that plainly before, though it came easily. “Chairlift felt like a comfort blanket because Patrick and I were like brother and sister,” she explains. “But it subconsciously imposed a platonic neutrality over everything we did, which stopped me from approaching things with a certain emotional intensity. I wanted to make sure he felt like he could get behind everything.”Polachek has found transitioning into a solo career easier than expected, it bringing new fans who hadn’t followed Chairlift. “I felt the perception of what I was doing as ‘indie’ was going to travel with me, but it hasn’t at all, which is really exciting,” she says. Aged 34 and with 12 years in a band behind her, she had worried about being a late starter, a notion she made herself reject. “I’m just beginning,” she says. “I think women are taught in the music industry that once you’re 35, you’ve expired, and I’m here to prove that factually incorrect.”If Polachek clings to any vestiges of the late-00s Brooklyn scene, it’s that DIY mindset: she directs her videos and recently started her own imprint within Sony, Perpetual Novice. “I do way more of my own stuff than I should be at this point,” she says. “I’m so obsessed with doing it myself.” Although in person her thoughtful answers and clarity evince academic-level focus, she describes herself as “easily distractible”, always ided between four different endeavours even this short stay in Paris has produced a possible new musical collaboration. Not only does Polachek not want to know what other people think she should be doing, she doesn’t want to preordain it herself. “I want to keep different options for different futures open all the time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd67411371a9a294fd623e369476d85222ea87b5/0_332_5592_3356/master/5592.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98dd06efe01e9af0590fde47a87e7de8","title":"on the frontline as us troops leave northern syria","story":"Martin Chulov, who covers the Middle East for the , has spent the past week on the frontline of north-east Syria.

Can you respect and work under a person who shares the views of this unsavoury organisation or is so gullible that he has been duped by them?”The letter, posted by Shaheen on Twitter, did not ask her view about any other issue. Shaheen, the director of the Centre for Labour and Social Studies thinktank, said Seeff’s decision to write to her about the organisation was designed to highlight her religion.“He wants me to be publicly highlighted as a Muslim,” Shaheen said. “If he had wanted me to be publicly highlighted as a Corbyn supporter, for instance, he could have written to me about anything else. I find it concerning that as one of the few Muslim women running in a marginal seat, my identity is being targeted.”Shaheen said she had not heard of the IHRC before she received Seeff’s letter. “In the letter it says, ‘as you will know’. I run an economics thinktank. Why does he think I know about every small Islamic organisation?”She said she had been surprised to receive such a letter from a Lib Dem candidate. “I’m kind of ready for it from the Tories,” she said. “But I was surprised to get this from the Lib Dems who champion themselves as liberals and progressives and say they don’t have a problem with racism. This demonstrates to me that they are willing to use dirty tactics in order to get votes.”Shaheen tweeted after receiving the letter: “Has he sent a public letter to the local Conservative MP, Iain Duncan Smith, asking him if he agrees with Boris Johnson’s comments on Muslim women? Why is he singling me out on this issue?“The local Labour party has knocked on thousands of doors in recent months and no one has ever mentioned the IHRC.”She said she had written to the Lib Dems regarding Seeff’s letter, which she received on Tuesday.Seeff wrote that he had a personal interest in the IHRC and the issue was “exercising the minds of a number of voters I am speaking to in the constituency”.The Charity Commission concluded a two-year investigation into the relationship between IHRC and its trust but did not request any changes, the Times reported last week.A Liberal Democrat spokesperson said: “We have received a complaint on this matter and will not make a further statement whilst the complaints process is ongoing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/749ab62f0b598325c6e65c6d238e47f7791f2226/0_30_2737_1643/master/2737.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=60e585c96d51141c2adad0c72653a36c","title":"rival unionists accuse dup of catastrophic brexit miscalculation","story":"UUP leader says party’s blunders threaten to put Northern Ireland on ‘window ledge’ of unionThe Democratic Unionist party is reeling from accusations it was duped and betrayed by Downing Street over a Brexit deal that weakens Northern Ireland’s position in the UK.Rival unionists on Thursday said the DUP had committed a catastrophic miscalculation in trusting Boris Johnson, potentially putting Northern Ireland on a path towards a united Ireland.The DUP also risked isolation at Westminster where some Conservative Brexiters, who previously pledged solidarity with the DUP, signalled they would ignore the party’s opposition and vote for the deal in a Commons vote on Saturday.It was a vertiginous fall to earth for a regional party that until recently boasted of unprecedented influence, its clout extending from Belfast to London and Brussels.Robin Swann, leader of the Ulster Unionist party (UUP), said DUP blunders had paved the way to Northern Ireland being left on the “window ledge” of the union.“It’s an absolute disgrace ... this deal is worse than the one Theresa May brought forward at Chequers. It’s awful. It would put a customs and regulatory border down the Irish Sea and annexes Northern Ireland from the rest of the United Kingdom.”Jim Allister, leader of the Traditional Unionist Voice party, called the deal – welcomed by the Irish government and Sinn Féin – a disaster that would put Northern Ireland in the Republic of Ireland’s economic orbit, ensuring the union “slowly bleeds to death”.“The inescapable reality is that a permanent regulatory and customs border cutting us off from GB puts us in a waiting room for Irish unity with the door locked from the outside.”Many farmers and business owners, in contrast, welcomed a deal that would keep trade flowing and avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. “What is good is that a deal is struck, we can move on to the more positive conversation about the future relationship and, regardless, Northern Ireland can continue to have tariff-free, quota-free access to both the UK and the EU’s single market,” said the Manufacturing Northern Ireland chief executive, Stephen Kelly.The party’s deputy leader, Nigel Dodds, told the BBC that he felt the Benn act preventing no deal had pushed Boris Johnson “into desperate measures”.Dodds said: “He has been too eager by far to get a deal at any cost, and the fact of the matter is, if he held his nerve and held out he would, of course, have got better concessions that kept the integrity, both economic and constitutionally, of the United Kingdom.”Under Johnson’s deal, Northern Ireland would legally remain in the UK’s customs territory but stay in the EU’s single market for goods. The EU’s customs code would be enforced on goods coming from Great Britain into Northern Ireland.Under a complicated consent mechanism, four years after the end of the transition period, the Northern Ireland assembly at Stormont would vote on maintaining the arrangements. Crucially, the DUP would have no veto.The DUP rejected the deal and vowed to vote against it, saying it would undermine the integrity of the union and drive “a coach and horses” through the Good Friday agreement’s consent mechanism.Once the details became clear DUP leaders pivoted towards a campaign to retain their base, said one source. “Shouting traitor from the green benches might suit them.”Some Brexiters will blame the party if the deal falters in the Commons, further straining relations between Northern Ireland’s unionists and English Conservatives.Rival unionists said DUP hubris led to the deal.A year ago the party’s leader, Arlene Foster, boasted of its unprecedented influence at Westminster – where its 10 MPs propped up the government – and garlanded Johnson at its party conference. Johnson said Northern Ireland should be treated no differently from the rest of the UK.Two weeks ago Johnson, under pressure for a deal with Brussels, persuaded his allies to accept some regulatory alignment with the EU, necessitating checks in the Irish Sea.That concession – a DUP recognition that farmers and business owners feared a no-deal hit on Northern Ireland’s economy – facilitated Downing Street stretching the measure to clinch a deal with Brussels, said Jon Tonge, a University of Liverpool politics professor and co-author of a book about the DUP.“They’ve been completely stitched up by Boris Johnson. He reversed on all that he promised them. This deal gives the EU and Irish government huge economic leverage over Northern Ireland.” Tonge called the consent mechanism a fantasy given Stormont’s dysfunction – it has been mothballed since power sharing collapsed in January 2017.The anti-abortion DUP may receive another humiliation on Monday when abortion rights are due to be extended to Northern Ireland, the result of a vote by Labour and Conservative MPs at Westminster earlier this year.The Stormont assembly is due to sit on Monday for the first time since devolution collapsed after more than 30 members backed a recall petition to debate the law. Analysts said it was unlikely they could stop the law taking effect."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8383db76369a6fb9c4840c328c654be657606a6/672_98_1861_1116/master/1861.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e3a46d1eae392aa882c615222cfa511","title":"channel 4 launches menopause policy for employees","story":"Women will have access to flexible working arrangements, and cool and quiet workspacesChannel 4 is launching its first menopause policy in an effort to normalise the “taboo” subject.The policy will support employees experiencing menopausal symptoms such as hot flushes, anxiety and fatigue, giving women access to flexible working arrangements and paid leave if they feel unwell because of the side-effects of ageing.The strategy, which Channel 4 says is the first known among UK media companies, will also offer employees a private, cool and quiet workspace, a working environment assessment to ensure their physical workspace is not worsening their symptoms, and a range of support and guidance resources.The broadcaster hopes to end the stigma around the menopause by encouraging a better understanding of it among staff, including line managers, and facilitating a more open work environment for those transitioning through it.As part of the policy, Channel 4 will also introduce menopause awareness briefings to its leadership teams, and its HR team now has a dedicated menopause champion.The channel’s in-house gender equality staff network 4Women is responsible for the policy, and will continue to offer support along with the mental health employee network 4Mind.The broadcaster announced its dedicated action on World Menopause Day.Alex Mahon, the Channel 4 chief executive, said: “This is Channel 4 living its remit, normalising a taboo subject by making it more visible, and we hope that 4Women’s fantastic work will inspire more in the industry to support women in their workplaces transitioning through the menopause.”Jane English, a co-chair of 4Women, said: “We wanted to open up the conversation at Channel 4 and in doing so prompt the media industry to also start talking more about how they can better support women transitioning through menopause.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98cc48b7a8f13a16cbeaf1a0c8d5bd2440510ee4/0_43_4575_2746/master/4575.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42af88bf493b0dec8e2061a03459f041","title":"rubgy world cup new zealand ireland teams","story":"Green will be New Zealand’s colour on Saturday. They go into their quarter-final against an Ireland team who have won two of the past three Tests between the sides with a recently minted back ision while their opponents will be armed with 12 of the starting lineup from the victory against the All Blacks in Dublin last November.Given that the scrum-half Conor Murray and the centre Robbie Henshaw missed that match because of injury and Iain Henderson has established himself in the second row at Devin Toner’s expense, Ireland are virtually at full strength. Bundee Aki might have been picked ahead of Garry Ringrose in the midfield but for his suspension for a high tackle against Samoa but their head coach, Joe Schmidt, has gone for experience and players who know what success tastes like.Like Schmidt the New Zealand head coach, Steve Hansen, is preparing for what may be his last Test with each man standing down at the end of his respective side’s tournament, whenever that may be. Hansen talked during his team announcement about not living in the past when asked about Ireland’s victories in 2016 and last year, their only two against the All Blacks in 114 years, but his body language suggested his memory stretched some way beyond the start of this tournament.The forecast here is for rain on Saturday, but Hansen has picked a team to attack Ireland out wide. The wings George Bridge and Sevu Reece have 12 caps between them, the centre Jack Goodhue 11 and Richie Mo’unga, who continues at fly‑half with Beauden Barrett the second playmaker at full-back, 14. The experienced Ben Smith and Ryan Crotty did not even make the bench, which is where Sonny Bill Williams will sit.Ireland’s victory last year was based on their suffocating defence, which prevented New Zealand from playing with width, together with their ability to retain possession. Seldom in recent years have the World Cup holders looked so clueless and, although they did not know until last weekend who they would be playing in the last eight, they will have been planning for this match for a long time, ready to cold-bloodedly serve their revenge.Despite being the bookmakers’ favourites, New Zealand are not widely fancied here to win the cup for a third consecutive time. The Irish media at Schmidt’s team announcement here at Disneyland were fantasising about a first appearance in a semi‑final at the ninth time of trying, optimism breaking through after the cloudburst prompted by the defeat by Japan.Ireland have conceded only two tries this tournament and, when Hansen was asked to sum up Ireland’s strength, he said: “They are tenacious. They play a pretty structured game and they know what they are good at. They do not wander too much off script and they are not a team that give you many opportunities through mistakes.”Schmidt has in the past cited the ability of the All Blacks to turn defence into attack with alacrity, highlighting the essential difference between the sides. New Zealand are reactive, waiting to exploit a disorganised defence, while Ireland have the organisation of a team who prepare in the minutest detail. Both sides are coached by New Zealanders, but their approaches are markedly different.•\u0026nbspFixtures, tables and results• Top try and points scorers•\u0026nbspSign up to The Breakdown, our free rugby union email newsletter“You cannot go out against New Zealand and accept that you are second fiddle,” Schmidt said. “You need belief, and the accumulation of experience and success our players have had builds confidence. After beating them twice in three years, we know we are not going to be able to sneak up and surprise them. They are well aware of how we play and what they are going to do to combat that.”Schmidt was in expansive mood, as if he had heard what the weather was expected to be like come kick-off, and like Hansen he talked about the closeness of the two coaching teams: his forwards coach, Greg Feek, is also a New Zealander and won 10 caps as a prop and once led the haka. “They are good guys to have a drink with afterwards,” Schmidt said. “We exchanged a few texts last weekend. It is hard for anyone not to respect what the All Blacks have achieved and it is awesome to be coaching against them.”As with the two head coaches, one of the respective captains will be playing his last Test. New Zealand’s Kieran Read is moving to Japan and retiring from international rugby while Ireland’s Rory Best will end his professional career at the age of 37.“It’s all about Saturday,” Best said. “It is about which team is able to implement its gameplan the best and deal with the pressure of knockout rugby. I think we are in a good spot.”Read said that while the All Blacks were ready for the physical demands Ireland would place on them, they had also worked on the mind. “A lot of it comes down to mental application,” he said. “We have had close games against them in the last few years and the fun part is Saturday. I want the guys to be fired up, but we need to be in the right space. That means having clear minds.”Ireland teamR Kearney, K Earls, G Ringrose, R Henshaw, J Stockdale, J Sexton , C Murray, C Healy, R Best (capt), T Furlong, I Henderson, J Ryan, P O\u0027Mahony, JV Der Flier, CJ Stander.

Another was the suspicion that Done’s real target was the Tote’s estate of 500 off-course betting shops, which could be home to four of the cash-generating FOBT machines that each squeezed a risk-free £1,000 or so from punters before stakes were limited to £2 this year.Overall winners of the TTF used to pick up life-changing amounts – the winner in 2009, for instance, received around £450,000 – but it was discontinued in 2014 due to what the Racing Post, its co-sponsor, described as a fall in entry levels.In what seems to be an increasingly quick hit world, it will be interesting to see if the Tote’s new owners can rekindle interest in a contest that demands a considerable investment of time and effort.The Tote will also continue to be the public face of pool betting at most British racecourses via its partnership with Britbet, which had seemed poised to go it alone on Britain’s tracks until an agreement was reached last year to ensure that a single pool would operate on British racing.As a result, the future for the Tote looks brighter than it has for many years. “Pool betting plays a leading role in racing jurisdictions around the world,” Frost said on Wednesday, “and we believe the Tote can play a similar role in the UK, while supporting and growing British racing in the years ahead.”The racing jurisdictions where pool betting thrives are the ones where bookies are banned and the pool-based alternative is the only show in town. In Britain, where punters have a choice between bookmakers, pool betting and, more recently, exchange betting, the Tote trails in a distant third place and it is hard to see that changing any time soon.Many of the investors in the UKTG are involved in racing as owners or breeders and there will doubtless be an attempt to sell the new Tote as racing’s in-house betting operation. For all the goodwill it may generate, however, backers generally prefer to know what price they are getting and have also become accustomed to offers such as best price guaranteed. The process of tempting even a small number away from the bookies promises to be difficult, expensive and time-consuming.That said, co-mingling of pools with overseas jurisdictions with a strong pool-betting tradition is expected to increase significantly in the years ahead and British racing has an outstanding product to bring to the party. There could also be another attempt to crack the “small stake, big win” formula that generates huge pools elsewhere but has never quite captured the public imagination in Britain.Maybe, just maybe, Wednesday’s claims of “an exciting new era for the Tote” will prove to have some substance.Tips by Greg Wood"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65adbcb8f93637d171c7d16fe20bd34c98496300/240_562_4797_2879/master/4797.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc914ef64e445b66c48f1b5b9e777ca6","title":"the lion king musical london disney in pictures","story":"Celebrating 20 years at the Lyceum theatre in London this weekend, the Lion King stage show has been seen by 16 million people.  photographer David Levene was given exclusive behind-the-scenes access to the Disney production"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/056fb1ed7c2b627dfa4eed07998d8742d6093113/0_252_3992_2396/master/3992.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7858e93946439161ccd238fa2c7527f7","title":"mark zuckerberg facebook free expression speech","story":"CEO faces quick backlash over highlighted policies, including on hate speech and voter suppressionMark Zuckerberg touted Facebook as a champion of “free expression” in a wide-sweeping speech, offering a staunch defense of the social media giant following several rocky years characterized by allegations against the platform of censorship and bias.Speaking at Georgetown University on Thursday, the Facebook CEO invoked Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King Jr and Black Lives Matter as a means of positioning Facebook as a champion for freedom of speech.Zuckerberg defended the company’s decision to allow misinformation in political advertising on the platform, despite high-profile pushback against the policy.“Given the sensitivity around political ads, I’ve considered whether we should stop allowing them altogether,” Zuckerberg said. “But political ads are an important part of voice – especially for local candidates, up-and-coming challengers and advocacy groups that may not get much media attention otherwise. Banning political ads favors incumbents and whoever the media covers.”And he also seemed to brazenly rewrite the site’s beginnings, which were reportedly as a “hot or not” game for Harvard students to play, as a platform to share perspectives after the beginning of the Iraq war.“I remember feeling that if more people had a voice to share their experiences, then maybe it could have gone differently,” he said. “Those early years shaped my belief that giving everyone a voice empowers the powerless and pushes society to be better over time.”The CEO addressed Facebook’s attempts to enter the Chinese market, saying the company was unable to overcome China’s strict censorship. And he seemed to take a swipe at competitor platform TikTok, the Chinese video sharing app recently gaining huge popularity.“I wanted our services in China because I believe in connecting the whole world, and I thought maybe we could help creating a more open society,” Zuckerberg said.“I worked hard on this for a long time, but we could never come to agreement on what it would take for us to operate there,” he said. “They never let us in.”Zuckerberg said the company now has 35,000 people working on platform security and that the company’s security budget is larger than $5bn – greater than the entire company’s revenue when it went public in 2013.Zuckerberg’s address was met with swift, and fierce, criticism.Not-for-profit organizations pushed back against a number of Facebook policies highlighted on Thursday, including those around hate speech and voter suppression. When discussing discriminatory speech, Zuckerberg repeatedly stressed his commitment to “free expression” and said he feared “potentially cracking down too much”.“Mark Zuckerberg made clear today that he is not only doubling down on a business model that corrupts our democracy, but also fundamentally lacks an understanding of how civil rights, voter suppression, and racism actually function in this country,” said Rashad Robinson, the president of digital anti-hate group Color Of Change.“Zuckerberg is co-opting civil rights history to justify Facebook policies that undermine our democracy,” said Vanita Gupta, the president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. “Hard to imagine MLK and Frederick Douglass, who he just invoked, supporting FB’s move to protect politicians who rely on misinformation and race-baiting for electoral gain.”Zuckerberg’s reference to Facebook as the fifth pillar of democracy drew criticism from journalists. The Facebook CEO represents “the antithesis of free expression”, said John Stanton, the co-founder of the Save Journalism Project, in a statement.“He’s thrown pennies at programs to ‘help’ journalists that, in actuality, are little more than PR stunts intended to provide cover as he puts countless journalists out of work, strips the industry to the bone, and reaps billions in ad revenue,” Stanton said.Facebook’s policies on allowing misinformation in political advertising have been the subject of intense debate in recent weeks, following the platform’s refusal to take down a Donald Trump campaign ad that made misleading statements about the Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.Facebook has increasingly come under scrutiny as the 2020 elections near, with a number of candidates calling for the breakup of the social media giant.In an effort to highlight the consequences of the policy, the Democratic senator and presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren published her own misleading advertisement on the social media network.Many of these issues may be addressed when Zuckerberg testifies next week at a congressional hearing over Libra, Facebook’s new cryptocurrency.“Look, we know we’re doing a very good job of making everyone angry,” Zuckerberg said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e06d2c7492357a1c0228dbcaf69c172a6207232/396_312_4903_2942/master/4903.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63007e5503f020fa6f2b4bd2b1722ddf","title":"finland be more like finn campaign tourism pledge initiatives","story":"Campaigns to encourage more sustainable and respectful travel are increasing, though some industry figures doubt their power to effect changeFinland has become the latest destination to introduce a tourism pledge, asking visitors to the country to promise to respect its nature, culture and inhabitants.Forming part of a wider sustainability drive that focuses on Finnish values and traditions, such as embracing the outdoors, foraging and recycling, the pledge requires visitors to “be more like a Finn” and includes the line “in my choices the climate comes first”.Iceland claimed to be the first to introduce the idea of inviting tourists to make a specific commitment to behave responsibly in July 2017. A year later it installed a Pledge button at Keflavík airport, to encourage more visitors to agree to leave places as they found them, park and sleep only where permitted but also to “take photos to die for without dying for them” and “When nature calls, I won’t answer the call on nature.”In December 2017 Palau, in the western Pacific, announced a compulsory conservation pledge to the children of Palau that visitors are required to sign on arrival in the country. In September 2018 Hawaii launched the Pono Pledge, which forms part of a new marketing campaign, revealed this week, that aims to encourage responsible, mindful travel and sustainable tourism. New Zealand’s Tiaki Promise was announced in November 2018 and is now promoted on Air New Zealand flights, in tourist offices and through tour operators. This year, Sonoma County, California laid out plans to get one million tourists to commit to “travel kindly”, part of a strategy aimed at attracting tourists whose values align with the area’s vision for responsible tourism. In the Faroe Islands, the tourist board is calling its new sustainable tourism strategy a Preservolution, which puts “the needs, desires and lifestyle of the Faroese people” at the centre of a tourism manifesto. Instead of a pledge, the Faroes took drastic action earlier this year, closing the islands for a week when it welcomed 100 volunteers – out of 3,500 applicants – who helped repair footpaths alongside local people. The tourist board now plans to make its “Closed for Maintenance” initiative an annual event and is inviting volunteers to sign up for April 2020.For all these destinations pledges are part of a long-term vision to balance the need for tourism with a determination to protect natural resources but not everyone is convinced as to their real impact. Responsible Travel, an online holiday directory, this week called into question the growing trend among tour operators to offset the holidays they sell – and it is equally doubtful about pledges.“I’m sceptical because there’s no evidence that they work,” said founder Justin Francis. “Pledges are nothing new: I was studying them 20 years ago when I did a master’s in sustainable tourism. Since then, what we’ve seen most recently is really deteriorating tourism behaviour. Pledges fall short of creating any resources or finances to manage tourism properly.”Instead of a “superficial” pledge, Francis advocates tourism taxes that create income for the destination, “as long as the money is ringfenced to improve destinations for locals and future tourists”.This month, Venice confirmed that it will charge daytrippers up to €10pp. The charge does not apply to visitors staying overnight who already pay tax through their hotel.But Dr Daisy Fan, a lecturer at Bournemouth’s tourism and hospitality department, was less dismissive of pledges, calling them “a good beginning”, though she admits more needs to be done to educate tourists. “It’s about forming a mindset in the visitor at the earliest stage, not at the last minute as they arrive.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb01a5944d09856829cb4cc7ae0a73293b2c3057/0_253_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8abf2dd17ddf14785e0c72a59a820fb2","title":"england first vineyard hotel denbies surrey wine tourism champagne","story":"A champagne cork’s throw from Dorking – and 40 minutes from London – our wine critic toasts English plonk’s progress at a vineyard that feels like part of the local communityIt’s an early autumn afternoon and I’m standing at the top of a vineyard. Below me is a sea of greens and golds, acres of vines heavy with ripened grapes – the harvest is well under way. The sky is azure, clouds scud over and butterflies flutter past. It could be the Loire, or even Sonoma, but in fact I’m just outside Dorking, in commuter belt Surrey, just 40 minutes from London Waterloo.My trek up the hillside is part of Denbies Secret Vineyard Trail, an escorted tour round parts of the 265-acre estate that are not normally open to the public, punctuated, if this sounds too much like hard work, by tasters of cheese and honey, and glasses of wine.The estate was established in 1984 when a local entrepreneur, Adrian (now Sir Adrian) White, took over a former pig farm and planted it with vines on the advice of his neighbour Professor Richard Selling, a geologist who recognised that the soils were similar to those in France’s Champagne region. It was an extraordinarily far-sighted project for a time when English wine was regarded as a bit of a joke.Things are very different these days: an exceptional 2018 harvest saw England and Wales produce 15.6 million bottles, compared with only 4.15 million in 2016. Planting has also taken off, nearly doubling in the past five years from 1,884 hectares (4,665 acres) in 2013 to 3,778 hectares in 2018. Even the French have got involved, with champagne house Taittinger buying vineyards in Kent, and Pommery collaborating with Hattingley Valley in Hampshire.Denbies, like the rest of the UK wine industry in the early days, used to be known for rather weedy medium-dry whites made from grape varieties such as seyval blanc and müller thurgau.Now, half the production is sparkling wine and the rest is dominated by the popular sauvignon-blanc-like bacchus, ortega (which is often used for sweet wines) and even some red varieties. Denbies has actually planted syrah (shiraz to the new world) in its experimental vineyard, which sounds hopeful, even as global temperatures surge. It’s already well set-up for tourism, too, with a vast visitor centre and a slightly Disney-esque train trundling through the vineyards. But this summer, it added a hotel which proudly claims to be the first English winery hotel. (There is already one at Llanerch in Wales, whose former chef, Michael Hudson, it has lured to Surrey to oversee the new restaurant.) The accommodation is functional rather than flash – with its somewhat spartan corridors it feels a bit like a posh Premier Inn – but the views over the vineyards and the hum of a tractor in the background give it a bucolic vibe.The south-east of England is home to three-quarters of the UK’s wineries. There’s a handful of urban wineries in and around London, including Blackbook in Battersea, and one near Bristol, Limeburn Hill, but most English wine comes from Sussex, Kent and Hampshire.Wine has become a lucrative second career for former financiers such as Ian Kellett of Hambledon Vineyard in Hampshire and hedge fund manager Mark Driver of Rathfinny near Alfriston in Sussex, which boasts an upmarket B\u0026ampB, The Flint Barns.  readers may not be quite so keen on patronising the glamourous new facilities at Gusbourne in Kent, which is owned by Tory donor and Leave supporter Lord Ashcroft, but it and nearby Hush Heath winery – which also has a lavishly decked new visitor centre – are part of Kent’s new Wine Garden of England trail.Denbies, too, is continuing to innovate. While the estate isn’t organic (the British weather makes this too tricky, they say – and it did chuck it down the morning after my vineyard walk), it puts great emphasis on sustainability, is moving away from plastics, and installing solar panels on the roof and electric car charging points outside the hotel.In a pair of circular, tiled cabanas on the “infinity lawn”, with views down to the vineyard beyond, parties of up to 10 can enjoy a food and wine matching exercise with the Denbies range £45pp plus £100 for a wine expert to talk you through it). The pairings are enjoyably whacky. I’m impressed by the combination of local Chalk Hill Bakery bread and Marmite butter with Denbies’ Cubitt Blanc de Noirs sparkling wine (Marmite and bubbly – who knew?) and am amazed to try its Brokes botrytised sweet wine with vanilla pannacotta and caramelised apricots. It’s a bit of a treat given that only 100 bottles are made each year, which presumably accounts for the £60 price tag. Surrey’s answer to Chateau d’Yquem, maybe?As we sip and munch, cyclists and joggers speed past. To foster goodwill locally, the grounds, with seven miles of public footpaths, are open to the public. After asking for feedback from residents, the winery changed the colour of the train that runs through the estate from blue to a more subtle green that blends into the trees. A local group organises a park run every Saturday morning which attracts some 350 runners. Seasonal events such as a Santa fun run and Easter Bunny Hop run pull in even more. But maybe the biggest draw is that it’s within easy walking distance of Dorking station, which is probably just as well after all that “tasting”. And all the more reason for going into the hotel business.• Accommodation was provided by Denbies Vineyard Hotel (doubles from £135 B\u0026ampB). The Secret Vineyard Trail runs throughout the autumn in fine weather, from £25pp (check website and social media for dates).

How have the BBC and Netflix managed to make it such a bore?Younger siblings, eh? They are either the attention-sucking baby of the family, leaving you out in the cold, or a thorn in your side causing trouble from cradle to grave. Detective Kenzo Mori feels your pain. When a Yakuza boss is killed on Mori’s beat, threatening to destroy the fragile truce that has been maintained for the last few years, it appears that the killing may have been undertaken in revenge for a murder in London that Mori’s younger brother, Yuto, carried out.Yuto was believed dead, but nobody ever saw the body and there has been a rumoured sighting of him. Mori’s boss – a man possibly ensnared in the Yakuza web himself – requires his underling to go to London and pretend to be a student on a detective refresher course while he does some unofficial digging. The theory goes that Yuto is more likely to reveal himself to his brother than anyone else.So begins GiriHaji (DutyShame), an intercontinental thriller and co-production between the BBC and Netflix. The latter – which will air the series globally next year – provided the deep coffers needed to split the setting between Tokyo and London. Mori is played by Takehiro Hira, who gives the detective a bone-deep weariness that makes increasing sense as we see, via a series of flashbacks involving Yuto, that it is not just the burden of ageing parents and a rebellious teenage daughter weighing him down. (Yosuke Kubozuka lends Yuto a needy, nervous energy that justifies what might otherwise seem unconscionably extreme service from his brother.)In London, Mori puts out feelers among the Japanese community in his search for leads. A half-Japanese young man, Rodney, proves a useful conduit, but Mori discovers he is also a rent boy with a complex and dangerous life, in which he soon becomes embroiled. In a scene-stealing turn from Will Sharpe, Rodney is full of brio and wit (“I’ll have to ring you back,” he sighs theatrically into his phone when an emotional ex-boyfriend turns up. “I’m in the middle of a Greek play”). But he also has a vulnerability that makes us care instantly about his fate possibly too much, given his ability to get into perilous situations soon and, one fears, often.At a club Rodney introduces him to, Mori hears rumours of an assassin who fled Tokyo and is making his mark in London. He sets out to pursue the lead below the radar. Above the radar, he soon deduces, he is being watched and, where possible, thwarted. The plot thickens.Meanwhile, his refresher course is being run by Detective Sarah Weitzmann (Kelly Macdonald, using her patented form of stoic anguish to full effect), a lost soul in her own city ostracised at work and harassed at home – albeit inventively, with snakes pushed through her letterbox by ill-wishers. So far, she and Mori have done little but exchange awkward pleasantries. But whatever continent the protagonists come from, we have been here before and international relations will surely take place before series end.Herein lies the problem with GiriHaji. Apart from the novelty of seeing Japan’s capital unfetishised – this is a Tokyo where people live, work and manage the daily grind, not a neon-soaked fun palace or futuristic hellscape – and the odd animated interlude (created by the company behind Hey Duggee, fact fans), nothing here feels new or revelatory.Lonely, troubled detectives torn between loyalty to a ne’er-do-well relative and their professional duty are a staple of police series – and they are often in unsuspecting conflict with corrupt powers above them, too. For the fish out of water to be Japanese rather than American or European provides some nice cultural cosmetic detailing – like Mori bowing to the taxi driver who drops him off after his first black cab ride, and the man speeding off before he has even straightened up – but the bones are the same.So far, at least. Not all the episodes were released for review, though they will all be available on iPlayer after the first has aired. I am hoping that the actor playing Roy, the London detective sent to Tokyo in Mori’s place, gets something more to do. Being cast simply so one of your new colleagues can deliver the line “He looks like a fucking sex tourist” seems harsh."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/484ca07a8a4f5c7680e276aeec94a71ccb0aa38f/0_91_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=690d016f0148fbf7e9c73dc99d2daad9","title":"living with yourself review paul rudd","story":"Rudd is doubly charming in this cloning comedy-drama on Netflix, which riffs on identity, self-sabotage and the lives we wish we were leading It has long been understood that there is nothing Paul Rudd cannot do. Except age – but scientists are surely studying that phenomenon. He has effortless warmth, charm and comedy chops all melded into one handsome but somehow still relatable package. He is our Everyman figure in the Hollywood firmament the best bits of our inner selves heightened and put into one lucky body.Which gives the premise of his latest venture, the Netflix series Living With Yourself, an even more discombobulating feel. Rudd plays disaffected ad exec Miles Elliot and, after a trip to a DNA-tweaking spa to rejuvenate his tired body and spirit goes wrong, also a newer, better cloned version whom we’ll call, for convenience, Miles II. Suddenly there are two men fighting over one life.It’s a fun idea, if not exactly new there are shades of every splittingdoubling-up story here, from Dostoevsky to Multiplicity. And if you are warned that – despite Rudd, and comedian Aisling Bea as Miles’s wife Kate – it skews more to the dramatic than the comedic, perhaps you won’t be visited by the gentle sense of disappointment that might otherwise intrude on proceedings.It is not without humour – especially where the spa managers, and Miles’ bohemian half-sister (Alia Shawkat), who takes to the situation with airy nonchalance, are concerned. But rather than play it for laughs, creator Timothy Greenberg prefers to ask questions about identity, the qualities that make up an inidual and make us distinguishable and worth distinguishing from each other. As Miles II goes around outdoing original Miles in every area of his life, we see a reflection of our own inertia and our own ridiculous capacity for self-sabotage. Miles II actually writes the play Miles has been noodling about with for years. He makes the evening meal and treats Kate well, because the unfamiliarity has cleared away the contempt we never bother to protect against.As the series goes on, Miles and Kate’s underlying frustration with and creeping estrangement because of their fertility issues becomes clear, while Miles II, who is first hidden in his progenitor’s study and then set up in a flat of his own, wrestles with loneliness, even as his material successes and one night stands accrue. The pivotal point, halfway through the series, is a natural inevitability. It also has the advantage of giving Bea, so underused in a standard wife part (even to those who hadn’t seen her sterling work in This Way Up), far more to work with, and ends up enlivening the whole show.Events are shown, and re-shown, from different perspectives and often reach far enough back to cause some confusion if you’re not bingewatching several episodes or the whole thing at once. The technology makes Rudd’s appearances with himself seamless – no dodgy shooting over a stand-in’s shoulder here – and it chunters along nicely, musing philosophically as it goes and delivering enough laughs at least to make sense of the casting. I can live with it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a021dfbf126d0306454a0ac85345a52a729652eb/0_502_3744_2246/master/3744.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f10af36606be0f577a59251c6978d86e","title":"manchester council urged reject mahatma gandhi statue racism","story":"Students say remarks by Indian freedom fighter mean proposed sculpture would be an ‘insult’Manchester city council should reject a statue of the Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi on account of his “well-documented anti-black racism”, according to student activists.The planned 2.7-metre (9ft) bronze statue is due to be erected outside Manchester Cathedral in November to coincide with the 150th anniversary of Gandhi’s birth. An open letter is calling for the council to acknowledge Gandhi’s “vile comments” and reverse the decision, which it says is an “insult” to Manchester’s black and Kashmiri communities.The statue was given as a gift by a charitable organisation, the Shrimad Rajchandra Mission Dharampur, which cited the “non-violence and compassion” on show in the city after the Manchester Arena terrorist attack in 2017. It was paid for by the Manchester-based Kamani family, the founders of the fashion retailer Boohoo.The letter, organised by the Decolonise Network at the University of Manchester, says Gandhi referred to Africans as being “savages”, “half-heathen natives”, “uncivilised”, “dirty” and “like animals”.A book published in 2015 by two university professors painted a complicated picture of the Indian freedom fighter, highlighting derogatory comments about black Africans and efforts to prove to British colonial rulers that South Africa’s Indian community was superior to black Africans while living in the country.One of the organisers of the letter, Sara Khan, said the group felt the need to raise awareness of Gandhi’s comments as soon as they heard about proposals for the statue two weeks ago, “given that it is October – Black History Month”.Although a statue of the anti-colonial activist might seem a more surprising target than those of Horatio Nelson or Cecil Rhodes, Khan said “anti-black racism” in south Asian communities was not addressed often enough.“There’s a tendency to homogenise people of colour and our communities,” she said. “It’s a function of colonial ideology – it’s just as important to talk about it when it is people of colour who reproduce racist ideas as when they come from white people.”Shrimad Rajchandra Mission Dharampur said the campaign “appears to diminish Gandhi’s rich and complex history and his principles of tolerance, peace and unity”.The organisation cited Gandhi as an inspiration to African leaders such as Nelson Mandela and the civil rights movement, including Martin Luther King. “While we welcome a searching public discussion of the past, it is misleading to fixate on comments made in Gandhi’s early life as a lawyer under British colonial influence,” it said.In response to the charity’s assertion that it was “non-political” and not aligned with any national government, Khan said the idea that Gandhi was a “spiritual figure” who transcends politics “is something we should reject”.She also rejected accusations that movements targeting statues were attempting to rewrite history, saying: “There’s no rewriting at play here, it’s more about centring a narrative that isn’t spoken about.”The English literature student, who is her university’s liberation and access officer, said the reaction to the campaign had been “intense from both sides”. While she had received support including from the NUS black students’ campaign, Manchester University’s Indian society has released a statement endorsing the statue. She said she had also faced Islamophobic abuse online since the campaign was reported in the media, but added: “We feel very strongly that we don’t want to the statue to be erected.”The letter also references the #GandhiMustFall campaign, which successfully halted the erection of a Gandhi statue in Malawi. A statue was also removed by the University of Ghana in Accra after protests from students and faculty members, who argue the Indian independence leader considered Africans “inferior”. Gandhi’s views on India’s caste system have also been the subject of fierce debate.Its final demand to the council is to consider erecting a statue instead to a black anti-racist activist with connections to Manchester, such as the feminist Olive Morris or anti-apartheid campaigner Steve Biko.A spokesperson for Manchester city council, which did not receive any objections during the planning process, said that while they were aware of “some debate about Gandhi’s life, most people in the city will see the statue in the context in which it was intended – to spread a message of peace, love and harmony”.Prof Meena Dhanda from the University of Wolverhampton said it was unsurprising that “the more people have begun reading Gandhi rather than merely idolising him, the more they are finding out about his racism”.She added: “As scholars have shown, he was terrified of intermixing, he upheld caste rules that restricted marriage outside one’s caste. He stereotyped people, for instance, he wrote – ‘Mussalman as a rule is a bully and a Hindu a coward’ and ‘Kaffirs are as a rule uncivilised’.“Despite his political actions harnessing the force of ‘non-violence’, his underlying metaphysical views were deeply at odds with modern sensibilities. To use him as an apostle of peace whilst ignoring the very beliefs that cause ruptures within modern erse communities is ill-advised.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e0a402b66da6306802275a92f94b510d2484a5d/0_0_4700_2821/master/4700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0408bede22e8004c17ceb0367efb3dd3","title":"friday briefing brexit deal comes down to numbers","story":"Brussels gives nod but PM needs to muster votes … DIY cancer tests miss serious genetic risks … and UK set to make its first moon landingHello, Warren Murray with you as the Briefing week draws to a close.Boris Johnson has insisted he is “very confident” his Brexit deal will be approved after it is presented to the House of Commons tomorrow. For the latest, head straight to our live blog. The arithmetic looks daunting for the PM after the Democratic Unionists (DUP) insisted they could not support the government’s position. “I want to stress that this is a great deal for our country, for the UK I also believe that it is a very good deal for our friends in the EU,” Johnson said at the European council in Brussels where EU leaders gave the nod.Johnson’s deal differs principally from Theresa May’s by swapping the Irish border “backstop” for a four-year customs alignment between Northern Ireland and the EU. Northern Ireland would be legally in the UK customs territory but practically in the EU customs unions. A complex mechanism would allow the Stormont power-sharing assembly to vote after four years to extend or end the alignment. Without the DUP’s 10 MPs, Johnson is likely to need the support of some Labour MPs and the 21 Tory rebels he expelled from the parliamentary party in September. Pro-remain MPs appeared to be pulling back from trying tomorrow to attach a second referendum to the deal – fearing they do not have enough support and preferring to wait and see if the deal passes.Heather Stewart and Lisa O’Carroll write that while this weekend’s vote will be extremely tight, it could be a rare win-win for Johnson. “If the PM’s deal is passed by MPs on Saturday, he’s well on the way to getting Brexit done. If it’s rejected, and he is forced into requesting an extension against his wishes, it will provide a clear, public demonstration of his claim that he wants to get on and take Britain out of the EU – and recalcitrant MPs have stopped him.”Mexico chaos – Police in Mexico arrested but then had to to release a son of the drug lord “El Chapo” overnight as gun battles raged in the city of Culiacán. Masked gunmen threw up burning barricades and exchanged fire with security forces after Ovidio Guzmán López was taken into custody. Mexico’s security and public protection secretary, Alfonso Durazo, confirmed the arrest but later said the backlash was so serious that in order to safeguard the citizens of Culiacán, the authorities had decided to “suspend our actions”. It was later confirmed that the young Guzmán was let go.DNA tests miss cancer risk – DIY genetic tests being marketed direct to consumers that claim to predict the likelihood of cancer are “woefully incomplete” and can falsely reassure people they have received the all-clear when they actually have a heightened risk, experts have warned. The direct-to-consumer tests give negative results to the vast majority of those carrying DNA mutations in the genes under investigation, a study by a clinical genetic testing company found. The US study analysed the DNA of 270,806 patients who were referred by healthcare providers for testing of the MUTYH gene, and 119,328 who had been referred for BRCA12 genetic testing. It showed that for both tests, the majority of those carrying mutations would not be spotted.Moony McMoonface? – The UK’s first moon rover is due to touch down in 2021, courtesy of a private company called Spacebit. The four-legged “robot spider” is a cube 10cm across and weighs 1.5kg. It will be transported to the moon by the Astrobotic Peregrine lander, which was awarded $79.5m (£62.3m) by Nasa in May as part of its commercial lunar payload services programme.The lander will be carrying up to 14 Nasa payloads and an equal number from private companies, including Spacebit, and other countries. The rover will test the use of legs to scuttle across the moon’s uneven surface, which could lead to larger versions able to crawl into hollow lava tubes and explore the lunar subsurface.Global environment editor Jonathan Watts discusses the ’s investigation into the fossil fuel industry and the structures that need to change to halt the climate emergency.

Jones’s opposite number, Michael Cheika, has selected 19-year-old Jordan Petaia at outside-centre – the youngest player to start there in a World Cup – but says he trusts him “infinitely”.Ed Woodward believes the perception he and other non-experts are making decisions over football policy at Manchester United is “insulting”, though the executive vice-chairman admits recruitment strategy was dysfunctional in the wake of Sir Alex Ferguson’s retirement.

The Times says: “Final hurdle in sight as Johnson gets his deal”, while the  reports: “Johnson gets his Brexit deal – now it’s a numbers game”.The Mirror says: “On the brink of Brexit … once again”, the i has: “Johnson gets his EU deal – now for the tricky part” and the FT says “DUP veto threat leaves Johnson’s Brexit deal gamble in the balance”.Other papers are sounding warnings to MPs to vote for the deal. The  quotes from the prime minister: “It’s my deal or no deal”, the Daily Mail features a picture of Johnson pointing, with the headline: “He’s done his duty. Now MPs must do theirs”, the Sun strikes a rhyme: “Get real … take the deal” and the Express says: “Just do it!” Morning Briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes bright and early every weekday.

But the summer before my senior year in high school, my family and I flew to New Orleans instead – my dad had a surprise specifically for me.When he met me in our hotel lobby with my uncle Al, I thought to myself, “A little father and son and uncle bonding time. I’m with it.” But then a luxury tour bus pulled up to the curb, and suddenly all these people piled out of the hotel and started boarding. “Oh, a wine tour?” I thought. My dad, my uncle and I hopped on last. I saw a digital sign above the bus driver’s head that read: “PLANTATION TOURS.”There was not a single black passenger on the bus besides the three of us. I turned to my dad and asked, “Are we really going to a plantation? Like – on purpose?”The bus driver, an older black man, must have overheard what I said because he turned around and replied, “I was thinking the same thing. Y’all the first black people I’ve ever seen on this tour …”To be honest, even though I believe it’s important to learn about your family’s past, slavery is something I’m comfortable only reading about. Although my family is from the south and always talked openly about slavery, I grew up in California where slavery wasn’t something I learned much about in school. So it feels more distant, not as present, with fewer reminders – the sugar cane fields, the old mansions – all around like I’d see in the south.These reminders give me an eerie feeling when I’m in Louisiana, but on the drive out to the plantation, the driver just pointed them out like monuments.Everyone was so intrigued. I even saw a young white guy with tortoiseshell glasses writing in a notebook. Was he taking notes? On what? On how to run a plantation? The bus driver quickly interrupted my thought with, “Who here loves the movie ‘Django Unchained?’” I raised my hand. But when I looked around, I saw no other hands and slowly lowered mine.“Well to your right we have the Candyland plantation from Django.” I started to hear the “oohs” and “aahs”. The person behind me commented on the “tall white pillars” and the “beautiful outdoor staircase” that lead from the front garden to the balcony of the second floor. Everyone’s phones were out.Then we got out, and the place was creepier than the bus ride. The employees at the plantation were walking around in full 1800s slave master outfits. To my left was the “big house” (for the slave owners). To the right, about 100 yards away, were the slave quarters. And right in front of the slave quarters were a gift shop and a restaurant. The restaurant is known for all-you-can-eat pancakes. No joke. The overall vibe was far too festive, too tourist-y – and disrespectful.Everyone seemed to be doing more reminiscing than reflecting. My boy tortoiseshell? He was still taking notes. I couldn’t help but look at the way the Spanish moss hung and swayed off the trees. I thought about the bodies that likely did the same over this ground that now is home to some tasty pancakes and souvenirs to remind you of the good ole days. I thought about my dining room back home, where we have slave bill of sale papers from my dad’s side of the family in a picture frame. It’s hanging right next to a picture of our family today.Apparently, my dad’s ancestors were held at the same plantation as Nat Turner. That’s why my last name is Turner. So looking at the Spanish moss hit me in all sorts of ways because being there on that plantation, I could almost imagine slavery happening to me. It’s hard to put into words. And this was all before the tour even started.The next thing I noticed was a mint julep stand. I was surprised to see a young black woman working there (the only black employee there as far as I could tell). The idea of getting a celebratory drink seemed stupid, but at this point seeing another black person felt like home. So my dad and I walked over.“Bourbon or rum?” she asked. Even though I’m not yet allowed to make 21-and-up decisions, I replied, “Let’s go with the, um, uh bourbon.”While she made the drink, through some type of black telepathy I tried my hardest to communicate how strange this place was to the employee.As I walked away with my drink, I quickly doubled back and said, “This is weird, righhh–” And before I could finish my sentence, she replied, “Weird as hell.”We began the tour with a guide wearing a long tan suit jacket and a white shirt with frills on it. Nervously he said, “Um, I just want to say by no means are we condoning what happened. We are just showing people the history of this land.”It seemed as if the tour guide was looking at us to pardon him on behalf of all black people. So my dad, uncle and I nodded.The big house was still in great condition. Even I caught myself marveling at the architecture for brief moments – the way the ceiling had beautifully hand-designed white borders that matched the borders on the floor that lead to the fireplace with so much detail in each corner. The strong, rich hardwood floor told stories of its own.Then my eye caught an extremely worn-down spot in the corner of the room. I asked, “What’s that over there?” The guide replied, “Oh they would usually have a slave boy stand there at every meal, pulling a rope the entire time to activate a fan over the dinner table.”My palms got really sweaty. He continued the rest of the tour, but none of it really stuck. I was so zoned out – how many slave boys stood there for hours pulling a rope to fan the room? I now wished that I didn’t ask that question, that I didn’t notice that spot.Then I thought, “If this is a slave plantation tour, how come there aren’t any employees dressed as slaves walking around?”I started to feel lightheaded. Then I found myself being dragged outside. The next thing you know, I was at the back of the “big house” with my dad. Just me and him.He said, “Hey, you good?”“Yeah, I’m fine. It’s just a lot …”He nodded saying, “I know. It’s crazy seeing how our family was treated worse than animals isn’t it?”He looked at the big house. Then at me. Underneath his mowing-the-lawn sun hat, a devious smile grew on his face. He took a step toward the house – first staring at the ground where his feet sink into the dirt, then scanning the house intensely. His face was one shot of curious, two shots of scared for what these walls have seen. Then he looked back at me and said, “Spit on it.”What? Of all the things he could have said in that moment, that was the furthest from my mind.“Spit?” I said, unsure if he was joking or not.“Yes. The house. Spit on it.”I swung my head to see if anyone was around. No one. Then my dad started making guttural throat sounds, put his back into it, and spat on the house. Honestly, that is one of the most disgusting things I’ve seen my dad do. But as soon as he did it, it felt like the air got easier to breathe.My dad was laughing like a little mischievous kid and said, “Now it’s your turn – for all the people who didn’t get a chance to spit before.” So I got the biggest loogie my throat could muster, put my back into it and spit on the house.Suddenly, my body felt lighter and I couldn’t stop laughing. I knew spitting on the house was not that big of a deal. But it felt like a secret I had from the plantation. My own rebellious Nat Turner moment.My dad leaned over and said, “You can’t let that happen Nyge.”I was confused. “Let what happen?”He said: “You know what I always say when it comes to you and your brother right? I’m raising lions. You can’t make anyone make you feel smaller than you are. You’ll feel this more when you get older and I know you feel like I’m a little bit extreme, but when situations arise later in life, I want you to be able to see it for what it is. Don’t let any surroundings shrink you. Always spit on the house. Always.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17062e1c599cf90c7a2ae6c769d811361feb67c0/0_426_6385_3831/master/6385.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b827b9a21c9814c5929629da8485f11f","title":"the wing how an exclusive womens club sparked a thousand arguments","story":"The Wing is a private members’ space for women that claims to be an ‘accelerator’ for feminist revolution in the US – and now it’s coming to the UK. But how progressive is it really? By  Linda KinstlerOn a recent weeknight in midtown Manhattan, a trickle of professional women wearing sheath dresses and smart blouses swept into a delicately lit penthouse. The space they entered was filled with women quietly working and chatting, seated on an array of curved pastel furniture, designed to fit the precise ergonomic specifications of the average woman. The women’s computers bore stickers reading “I’m With Her”, “Hermione 2020”, and “Cornell”. The colour-coded bookshelves behind them included works such as 50 Ways to Comfort a Woman in Labor, Suffragette: My Own Story, and Cunt: A Declaration of Independence.It was a typical Wednesday night at The Wing, an exclusive club that describes itself as a “network of work and community spaces designed for women of all definitions”. For between $185 and $250 per month, US Wing members – or Winglets, as the company sometimes calls them – can use the space to work, eat, socialise, breastfeed, shower, network, exercise, nap, reapply their makeup, meditate or all of the above. In other words, The Wing is a one-stop shop for the performance of contemporary mainstream feminism, a meticulously curated space where women can blow-dry their hair or “stage a small coup”, depending on the day.Audrey Gelman, the company’s co-founder and CEO, often tells The Wing’s origin story roughly as follows: she was working as a press secretary, and later as a political consultant, dashing from city to city and from meetings to parties. This lifestyle forced her to change her outfits in Starbucks and Amtrak bathrooms, places she found “semi-degrading”. She dreamed of having a more dignified place to go, where women like her – talented, outgoing, highly ambitious – could find like-minded souls, get changed and charge their phones in peace. Thus the idea for The Wing was born.The company now has eight locations – three in New York City, and one each in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Boston and Washington DC, with five more scheduled to open imminently. Its first international outpost, on Great Portland Street in London, opens next week. Second locations in London, San Francisco and LA are in the works there will be 20 Wings by 2020. Over the past two years, The Wing has raised $117.5m in funding, attracting a formidable and erse array of investors, whose ranks include Serena Williams, President Obama’s friend and former senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, and members of the US women’s soccer team.Since the moment it opened its doors three years ago, The Wing has attracted the kind of buzz, funding and controversy usually reserved for projects involving Gwyneth Paltrow or Lena Dunham. (Not totally coincidentally, Dunham is a close friend of Gelman’s and a Wing founding member. Gelman had a cameo on Girls, and was famously the basis for the character of Marnie.) The attention The Wing generates is, in large part, because it was founded upon a paradox: its brand is steeped in the feminist language of emancipation, empowerment and equality, while its business is based on one of society’s most elitist institutions: the private members’ club. The result is that the company has become a kind of proxy for national debates over issues of gender, race, inclusivity, intersectionality and the limits and possibilities of neoliberal democratic politics. And yet, the number of people who actually belong to The Wing is still pretty small – it aims to have about 15,000 members by the end of the year, slightly less than the monthly circulation figures for The Cricketer magazine, and 16 times less than the total youth membership of the RSPB.Because The Wing is in part a co-working space, many of its members hail from professions in which office space is a rare commodity – the creative class of writers, editors, freelancers, artists and influencers who make up the media. Handily, these are precisely the same kind of people who like to tweet, Instagram and write about the world as it looks from The Wing. This has ensured that even its minutest details, from the coffee to the furniture to the lunch offerings to the customised scented candles in the gift shop, have been deemed worthy of an article of their own. It also means that The Wing has been the subject of seemingly endless criticism – accused of being too rich, too white, too cis-gendered, too feminist, not feminist enough, too liberal and not liberal enough. One former employee described it as a “super-toxic” place, while a British member told me that upon walking into The Wing in New York, she felt that she had found her “holy grail.”That Wednesday evening in Manhattan, Wing members sat with their guests, sipping rosé and snacking on seasoned popcorn as they waited for the evening’s event to begin. It was nominally a talk by the writer Caitlin Moscatello, whose new book tells the stories of first-time female candidates running for office, but it was more like a political strategy meeting for women who were thinking of running themselves. Sitting in the audience felt like being entrusted with trade secrets. Moscatello sat between Kimberly Peeler-Allen, co-founder of Higher Heights, an organisation that works to elect black women, and Catalina Cruz, the newly elected assemblywoman for New York’s 39th district.After the three speakers finished their discussion, a woman in the audience raised her hand and introduced herself to the group. She was planning a run for local office, but had yet to announce. “Please don’t repeat this!” the woman told the crowd. “Cone of silence!” exclaimed Peeler-Allen. As Cruz went on to describe the personal and financial strains of campaigning, the woman who had announced her run looked increasingly stricken. “You’re scaring me!” she said. “You’ll be fine, girl,” said Cruz. “Just get yourself ready.”It was just the kind of exchange that The Wing has been designed to generate. One of its press representatives described it to me as an “accelerator” for the coming revolution, a place where women are preparing to “leap year” into a more egalitarian future. In the US, it has become an almost compulsory campaign stop for women, trans and non-binary political candidates. Three of the women running for president have visited in the past year, and a Wing spokesperson told me that the other two – front-runner Elizabeth Warren and Senator Amy Klobuchar – are actively discussing doing so. The company’s corporate ranks are stacked with former Democratic political operatives who worked on Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaigns or in the Obama administration.To belong to The Wing is to join this in-crowd, a kind of utopian shadow government. “There’s a secret smile that you share with the other women in the elevator,” said Jess Lee, a partner at the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Sequoia, which led the The Wing’s latest $75m funding round. And it was true – I found myself giving a look of ambiguous fellowship to the women I encountered in The Wing, and felt a slight twinge of embarrassment at the check-in desk as they swiped their membership cards and glided away, while I announced myself as a journalist, there to report on the workings of their private club. At Moscatello’s event, I laughed and clapped along with the women in the audience as they shared strategies for their political triumph. In the elevator on the way out, an older woman turned to me and two young women and gave us the secret smile. “So, are you all going to run?” she asked.The Wing opened its doors on 10 October 2016, four weeks before the presidential election. One of the very first events it held was an invitation-only “very adult sleepover” featuring face masks, monogrammed pyjamas and pillow fights. The next one was a public “phone bank and debate watch party” in partnership with Clinton’s presidential campaign, which invited women to spend three hours calling members of the public and urging them to vote the first woman into the Oval Office. Gelman and her co-founder Lauren Kassan hoped that their company would flourish alongside a Clinton administration, buoyed by the arrival of feminism’s golden age.On election night, about 175 women gathered in the Wing’s Flatiron location to watch the results come in. Like just about everyone else in New York, they expected it would be a celebratory event, a coronation. But as the evening drew on, and it became increasingly clear that Clinton was not going to win, the mood shifted. “Oh my goodness, you could feel it getting colder,” says Noël Duan, a Wing founding member. At one point, Gelman, wearing a backwards baseball cap and a pink “Madam President” T-shirt, sat down and held Duan’s hand. The Wing was heavily aligned with Clinton, yet among the Democratic party’s young, progressive voters, Clinton’s strain of establishment politics was swiftly disavowed. In no time at all, the former secretary of state had become both a feminist martyr and a political liability, a flawed candidate whose defeat everyone felt they should have seen coming.Almost everyone I spoke to about the company said it would be a different place if Clinton had won. Instead of being just a beautiful space for women to revel beneath a shattered glass ceiling, it became, for its members, a place to take shelter. “It was a really sobering moment,” Kassan told me. “I think there was already the demand and excitement, and I think that we realised just how important it was now.”A few days later, The Wing briefly opened its doors to all women who felt they needed a place to regroup. Gelman and Kassan gave the organisers of the Women’s March on Washington access to the space, and in January, they hired buses to take 100 Wing members to Washington to participate. The Wing began to emphasise civic and political programming, ramped up hiring and continued planning to expand. In interviews, Gelman has articulated the mission in overtly political terms: “Being a girl is no longer politically neutral. Your identity, whether you like it or not, is now political,” she told Elle in 2017.The Wing has found itself trying to please all sides, in the process finding itself attacked from all sides, often within its own walls. It is an easy target, and the fact that it is owned and operated by women makes it all the more so. Where its programming and brand have conflicted with the aims of progressive politics, its members have called the company out. Yet anyone who criticises The Wing may expect to be swiftly criticised in turn, on one side for poking holes in an otherwise admirable project, and on the other for paying it any attention at all. All parties involved might expect their exchange to be followed by a polite reminder of the specific actions that The Wing has taken to respond to the initial criticism, and perhaps an invitation to continue their discussion in a panel event. To begin to reckon with The Wing’s project is to risk entering an “ouroboros of doom”, as the writer and illustrator Shelby Lorman put it. “It feels like such a perfect metaphor,” she said, for the many tangled and charged disagreements over what it means to be a modern woman, feminist and political subject.Before any woman sets foot in The Wing, she will, in all likelihood, already know what it looks like. Every corner of every branch seems to have been designed specifically for Instagram, which is to say that the furniture and art and food and plants and people feel as if they have been carefully chosen to telegraph that they are coveted, consumable goods. The company posts mock-ups of every new space months before it is built, so that women between the ages of 26 to 35 living in major metropolitan areas and possessing roughly $2,000 of annual disposable income can begin to imagine themselves wandering around there. (The company’s omnipresence on social media is another reminder that its power derives from not letting everyone in and letting everyone know about it.)Every outpost contains careful local touches, and each projects an air of strained yet somewhat soothing whimsy. In the Soho premises in New York, I walked up a set of stairs that read “It’s not a reach when we climb together”, before settling in to enjoy a “fork the patriarchy” grain bowl on a blue pastel desk. In its Washington DC outpost, located above a spa in Georgetown, one of the toniest corners of the city, there is a conference room named “K Street”, after the city’s main lobbying thoroughfare, and a phone booth named after Anita Hill, “legal eagle”. The Wing London, a five-storey penthouse in Fitzrovia, will offer a tearoom, terrace, fitness room and floral patterned tile floors, as well as a portrait gallery featuring the likenesses of Diane Abbott, Mary Beard and Amal Clooney, among others. It is the first members’ club in London that has signed on to the mayor’s living-wage pact, and proceeds from its cafe and its programming will benefit local charities. There will be trellises, black-and-white tiles and chandeliers. “I was very inspired by the British countryside,” Laetitia Gorra, the company’s director of interiors, told me.Walking through one of the Wing’s premises can sometimes feel like exploring what would happen if Oliver Bonas were to design a luxury corporate office: lots of pastel and very few sharp edges. The walls, cushions and seating offer an array of muted pink, mustard and rose-gold hues, a colour scheme chosen in part for its calming effect. The air conditioning is usually set at 22C (72F), to accommodate women’s slightly lower skin temperatures. Chiara de Rege, who helped design the first few locations, said that the goal was to make them “feminine, but not girly girl or precious”. Hilary Koyfman, who collaborated with De Rege on the early design, has described the overall aesthetic as “kind of like Mad Men – without the men”.There is certainly something beautiful and powerful, even alchemic, about being in a women-only space. For some women, it is a place to find support, friendship and inspiration, where they do not have to apologise for anything or worry about their things being stolen or their drinks being spiked. Two locations currently offer childcare services, while every location features a private nursing room for new mothers. Each Wing also offers a luxurious beauty room with a wide array of hair and makeup products. These beauty rooms, staff told me, are a key part of the company’s “storytelling”. They are designed to make life easier, as Gelman once said, for the kind of woman for whom “part of being successful is not only making sure that you know everything that’s going on in the news and that you’ve responded to every single email , and that nothing is on fire in your house, but also looking good because it is what’s expected of you and can make you feel more confident”.Yet, for its critics, this point of articulation is where the alchemy dissolves: instead of being a place that seeks to lift all women up, it becomes a place where one must constantly consider how well one is performing both feminism and femininity. And with any performance, this can be exhausting, and always carries the risk of failure. Spending time at The Wing, I was reminded of the kind of “ideal woman” that the writer Jia Tolentino described in a recent essay: she has expensive hair and expensive skin, she is successful and svelte. “Today’s ideal woman is of a type that coexists easily with feminism in its current market-friendly and mainstream form,” she writes. “This sort of feminism has organised itself around being as visible and appealing to as many people as possible it has greatly over-valorised women’s inidual success.”Some of the tensions within this brand of feminism can be glimpsed, not too surprisingly, at The Wing’s in-house shops, where it sells T-shirts, bags and hats with slogans like “casual business woman” and “annihilate the patriarchy” on them. There are workout clothes and $17.50 keychains. When I visited the Soho location in early August, the shop was selling a range of colourful award ribbons, printed with lines such as “Wow, you’re not sexist”, “Best ally”, and “You’re my Wingman of the year”. As Jezebel has reported, some of the merchandise resembles that of other feminist artists. The ribbons, for example, seem to be emulating the work of Shelby Lorman, whose book Awards for Good Boys satirises the low standards to which men are held. Lorman first spotted The Wing’s version of the ribbons on Instagram. “I thought it was amazing and hilarious, because they are awards for men, for sale for $6, but they’re stripped of humour, so it’s literal,” she told me. “I truly don’t think that anything could be funnier because if they did borrow my work, they have totally missed the point. And they are monetising the missed point, which is kind of genius. It’s so sinister and so evil that I kind of love it.”The commission was investigating the company for discriminating on the basis of gender. (New York law requires it to investigate any complaint it receives. The investigation closed in March 2019.) At first, the club refused to allow men into its spaces, even as guests. A former employee told me that one of the first things they were taught was how to keep men out: “Block them with your body, push them to the elevator, push the elevator button.” But outward appearance does not always correlate with gender identity the employee witnessed instances where iniduals who presented themselves to the check-in desk at The Wing were misgendered by staff. In August 2018, a serially litigious 53-year-old man sued The Wing for up to $12m for rejecting his application, claiming that he had been denied entry because of his gender. After the lawsuit was filed, and as a result of conversations with its trans and nonbinary staff and members, The Wing adopted a formal membership policy that would evaluate applicants “based on their commitment to The Wing’s mission, regardless of their perceived gender or gender identity”. In a letter to members announcing the new policy, Kassan and Gelman wrote that they would be “working to actively incorporate the perspective of trans and non-binary members into our offerings”. The language of guest emails was changed from “she’s landed” to “they’ve landed.” The policy also meant that menen could enter the space as guests and apply for membership, if they really wanted to.The company’s success is partly due to the fact that, over the past five years, the identity-based members club has emerged as a powerful trend. In the US, The Wing already has too many competitors and imitators to list, which have names such as The Lola (Atlanta), The Broad (Richmond), The Assembly (San Francisco), The Riveter (Seattle) and The Hivery (Mill Valley). In London, women’s clubs such as The AllBright and The Trouble Club already occupy part of The Wing’s target audience. In November, Ethel’s Club, “the first private social and wellness club designed with people of colour in mind”, will open its doors in Brooklyn. “The Wing was created for a certain type of woman, which, from my point of view, is not for me,” Ethel’s Club founder, Najla Austin, told me. “I’m looking for my people. It’s not unlike religion. If you write down the similarities of Catholicism and a social club, they’re not that different.”Akilah Cadet, who runs a ersity and inclusion consulting firm in Oakland, had a similar first impression of The Wing, and decided that it probably was not for her. But then Yari Blanco, at the time The Wing’s senior manager of culture and ersity, reached out to her about her work, and Cadet decided to join the club. Being a member, she rightly predicted, would bring in business. “Honestly, my objective was like, get this money, so that’s what I did,” she told me. She said her application to the San Francisco location was fast-tracked, and soon she found herself at an event thrown specifically for black women. At one point, a white woman stood up on the couch and announced that they would be giving away T-shirts reading “phenomenally black”. Cadet raised her concerns about the event to Blanco and her team, criticising what she perceived to be a lack of serious thought about the way the event was organised. Two days later, she found herself on a panel at The Wing sponsored by Secret deodorant, where she got a new client.The company has made similar missteps along the way, and has almost always made concerted efforts to correct them wherever they arise. Noël Duan, the founding member from New York, who is Chinese American, told me that when The Wing held an event for Asian women, they posted an Instagram story intended to celebrate the club’s “women from Asia”. Duan did not attend, but some of her friends did. “They were like: we’re not women from Asia, we’re American,” she said. “What I really love about Wing members is that they are willing to speak out, including against the company,” Duan added, noting that the company had changed in response to criticism. “I can see from personal experience that it has come a long way since they first launched,” she said.Cadet took it upon herself to point out instances where The Wing could be more attentive to ersity and difference. Eventually, she was doing so much work for The Wing that she said they offered her a complimentary membership, and she frequently used the space to hold meetings in San Francisco. Like many of its critics, Cadet tries to view the company with generosity.Lately, however, maintaining this nuanced view has come to require a more intricate set of mental gymnastics. At the end of May, a racial confrontation occurred at the West Hollywood branch. According to reporting by the online magazine Zora, Wing member Asha Grant, the director of The Free Black Women’s Library Los Angeles, and her guest were harassed in the parking lot by “an unaccompanied white woman guest” who began yelling at them after Grant took what she felt was her parking space. The harassment and racist threats continued inside, where the white woman gave the middle finger to Grant, her guest, and another black club member, Stephanie Kimou. In an attempt to ease the situation, staff offered Kimou, Grant and her guest a free meal, but the white woman was not asked to leave the premises.News of the incident spread quickly. In mid-August, Kimou and Grant posted on Instagram announcing that they were cancelling their memberships. “After the initial allure of their perfectly designed co-working spaces, beauty rooms stocked full of Glossier and Goop, the lattes and their ‘commitment to ersity’, the facade started to crack and what was underneath all that pink felt oppressive and debilitating,” Kimou wrote in her post.On 6 September, the day after the first email from Gelman and Kassan went out, I visited the company’s new headquarters in the East Village in New York. Zara Rahim, senior director of strategic communications, gave me a tour around the four-storey office, which is located in what was once a hospital for German immigrants and later expanded to include a dedicated women’s wing. In the basement, the only place in the building where I spotted several men, the tech team was hard at work. Upstairs, we popped our heads into a mint-green conference room, where a planning meeting for the London launch was underway.Rahim and I settled into a couch in Kassan’s office, where Kassan greeted us wearing a yellow plaid jacquard blazer and a logo necklace bearing The Wing’s “hero W”, which looks something like the Wonder Woman logo, but softer, rounder, cuter. While Gelman, as CEO, is the public face of the company, Kassan, as COO, tends to handle operations behind the scenes. Before this venture, Kassan was the first employee at the fitness chain SLT, which specialises in high-intensity reformer pilates (motto: “better sore than sorry”), and then moved on to Classpass, a fitness class app. She rarely gives interviews, but by the time we spoke, Gelman was busy preparing to go on maternity leave and Kassan was taking over some of her duties.Kassan was excited for the London launch, which she told me had been years in the making. She would be bringing her whole family over to celebrate the opening. I asked her about the recent email to members and about the common criticisms of the company. Diversity had been “a part of who we are and what we’ve cared about since the beginning”, she explained. “That shows up through our programming and through our products. When things happen, we want to be transparent and clear about that … because there are things that happen outside in the world that we can’t control. And we want to create a space to be able to have these honest and hard conversations.”The more time I spent speaking to the company’s critics and supporters, the clearer it became that the controversy it generates has far more to do with what it claims to be rather than what it actually is. Last month, for instance, it debuted a members-only job marketplace that allows members to post listings and hire one another. From a business perspective, this is a savvy move – giving ambitious women yet another reason to want to join, while connecting bosses who are members with a pool of promising candidates. But this is a very narrow vision of feminism. Of course, many talented people will gain new opportunities through this service but, equally obviously, its exclusivity threatens to exacerbate the same kinds of inequality that The Wing claims to want to combat.“Feminism, for me, is fundamentally about collective struggle, not iniduals,” says Sarah Banet-Weiser, a scholar of communication and gender studies at the London School of Economics. The Wing’s strain of feminism, she argued, is something else: “They’re empowering women to be better economic subjects within capitalism, empowering women to network, to get a raise, to address the pay gap. Those are real things, but they are really tied to capitalist logic.” As a former employee put it, The Wing’s feminism is less about making the world more equitable as it is about making sure women are given equal opportunities to make money: “It’s like, you only make $1m? Well, this man makes $2m! You could make $2m if only it weren’t for misogyny.” (One recent post from The Wing’s Instagram feed read: “Mood: CE0,000,000”.)Progressives often talk about The Wing in the same way they talk about the Democratic party: it’s not great but maybe things will get better, maybe the politicians will figure it out, maybe the world The Wing’s founders imagined they would serve will one day emerge. One vocal supporter of The Wing is, somewhat surprisingly, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Gelman hosted a fundraiser for Ocasio-Cortez at her home in Brooklyn last summer and, a few months later, the politician told Glamour: “The Wing isn’t just a functional space, it’s a real symbol of what’s happening in our country.” She called the company “one of the most potent forces that we’ve seen emerge in politics this year.” Many of the people I spoke to for this piece were disappointed in The Wing for a variety of reasons, but hesitant to publicly criticise it. They had made good friends there, and saw all the work that staff were putting in to make it a better place. They had low expectations for corporate behaviour, and saw The Wing doing a better job than most companies when it comes to addressing its failures. They understood the paradox of a company whose profitability rests upon both expanding its tent and guarding the entrances. “I really wonder what the plan is to grow while staying true to their values,” one San Francisco-based member told me. “Maybe they have something up their sleeve, they have a ton of really smart women working for that company, but I don’t see it.” Cadet also felt burned out by her experience. “I want this to go well. I want this to be a good thing,” she said. “I don’t know, maybe I’ve done all that I can do.” (“And when you write that, say that I was gazing off into the distance,” she joked.)The opening of the London branch comes as The Wing seems to be reckoning with its first few years. Last week, The Wing unveiled a mural advertisement, its first in London, on a street corner in Shoreditch in east London. In a bright coral hue, it introduces The Wing as “the first place in London to solve the dual epidemic of mansplaining and manspreading”. After it went up, Rahim texted me a photo of a handful of men and women pausing in front of it, presumably wondering what a thing called The Wing could be and what it might become.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Letter reminds public service pay body of view expressed previously about judicial recruitmentFitness-to-practise hearing also told of false references on Romanian-trained doctor\u0026rsquos CVSchool leaders say Minister\u0026rsquos move will have an impact on junior cycle reformTerrorism expert says questions remain how Irish soldier became Islamic extremistSmall print on operational details of complex Irish Sea border checks has yet to be writtenJudge dismisses recordings and directs jury to find Bell not guilty of soliciting murderAudit will check if offenders are repeatedly availing of cautions and so escaping justice\u0026lsquoJobpath Macht Frei\u0026rsquo sign above Intreo office mimicked sign above concentration campsJudge John O\u0026rsquoHara says taped confession was \u0026lsquoimproperly and dishonestly induced\u0026rsquo\u0026lsquoWe should pay attention because assimilation and language-loss is present\u0026rsquoGarda\u0026iacute objected to bail on several grounds including fear that accused would interfere with witnessesMcDonald rules out Sinn F\u0026eacutein MPs taking seats in Westminster for vote on agreementSecond unrelated operation carried out by Cab against Cork-based crime gangCommittee chairman says it would be a travesty if abuse survivors \u0026lsquoleft high and dry\u0026rsquoIMO warns vote will take place in 21 days unless move made to end two-tier pay systemEvent told \u0026lsquonot right that we have over 100,000 children still living in poverty in Ireland\u0026rsquoNurse noted at the time the complainant \u0026lsquowas feeling guilty\u0026rsquo and saying \u0026lsquoI shouldn\u0026rsquot have drank so much\u0026rsquoProposed law delayed for three months to allow completion of public consultationShared history unites Irish and Lebanese people, says Irish President in Beirut"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4054486.1571343043!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit out but in customs plan has hallmarks of hastily agreed deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIn an effort to maintain an open Irish border, the EU is outsourcing checks on goods coming on to the island of Ireland – and possibly into the EU market. Photograph: Alan BetsonA major change from the original Northern Ireland backstop to avoid a hard border will require a huge leap into the unknown. It is the area of customs.In practical terms, this is the most complex part of the proposed Brexit plan to manage, with much of the small print yet to be written.By dropping the idea of a EU-UK customs territory in the original plan, London and Brussels have agreed to allow Northern Ireland to leave the EU customs union while still applying the bloc’s customs rules there.In an effort to maintain an open Irish Border, the EU is outsourcing checks on goods coming on to the island – and possibly into the EU market – to the UK authorities, with EU officials entitled to be present for checks at ports in the North, Scotland and England.Beyond a broad line of how it would work, there is little detail on how it will be managed. It is not clear what exactly would happen to a truckload of widgets travelling from Scotland to Northern Ireland through Belfast Port on to Dublin and then further into the EU market. A similar customs proposal from the UK was dismissed last year by Brussels as unworkable.Five paragraphsOnly three pages in the 64-page “protocol” are devoted to this unprecedented out-but-in customs plan and there are just five paragraphs on how the EU’s value-added tax rules would apply for goods in Northern Ireland. The issue is “totally fudged” in the deal, according to VAT expert Jeremy Cape.The plan is described by the European Commission as a “fully legally operative solution,” yet the day-to-day operation of the proposals is being deferred to a proposed “joint committee” of EU and UK officials to work out the precise details in the standstill transition period that, as of now, would run until the end of next year. It has all the hallmarks of a deal cobbled together at the last minute.In broad terms, it would work as follows: no customs duties would be paid on goods going into Northern Ireland from another part of the UK “unless that good is at risk of subsequently being moved” into the EU.TrickyThis is where matters become tricky: how to manage products coming into Northern Ireland that end up being used to manufacture other products which could find their way into the EU market.The deal proposes managing this by charging the EU customs tariff on the goods and allowing Northern Irish businesses to claim back a rebate from the beneficial difference in tariffs to benefit from future UK trade deals where it agrees lower tariffs with third countries.As for much of the detail here, the protocol document kicks lot of cans on the operational minutiae down the road to the all-powerful joint committee.All this creates a substantial new border between Britain and Northern Ireland and a heavy administrative burden for Northern Irish businesses.“It won’t be a huge problem for a large company. It could be a lot more difficult for a small company,” said Carol Lynch, trade expert at consultants BDO.Other problemsAvoiding a hard Irish land border and pushing checks back to Scottish and English ports potentially creates other problems on the island of Ireland.Edgar Morgenroth, professor of economics at Dublin City University, said that goods from another country transiting from Dublin Port to Britain via Northern Ireland might not be checked until they reach Scotland.“The potential for really significant smuggling into the EU is the bit I worry about,” he said. “If that is what would happen, then somebody would have to stop it and then the problem is an Irish problem.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Video: European Council\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar at the European Council summit in Brussels. Photograph: Stefan RousseauPA WireBrexit was originally due to happen on March 29th, two years after then UK prime minister Theresa May triggered the exit process known as Article 50. If Boris Johnson’s deal is backed by the House of Commons, it now is almost certain to happen six months later, at midnight on October 31st.A long and difficult road that has tested British politics and its uncodified constitution to its limits has seen old loyalties turned on their heads, parties in turmoil and a cull of prime ministers and ministers that has little parallel in its history. Voters and parliament, and courts and executive have been at loggerheads.At European level the tide of populism that gave the UK Brexit has swept across many states but, remarkably, the sort of political isions manifest in the UK have not disturbed the rock-like solidarity of the 27 remaining states around the European Commission’s negotiating position – and around Ireland. British negotiators have tried repeatedly, and failed, in attempts to prise the 27 apart or to cast doubt on the authority of chief negotiator Michel Barnier.In large measure that was a reflection of an old trade-union like solidarity – we stand by our own, and Ireland is a member state. For the smaller states, as Taoiseach Leo Varadkar suggested on Thursday night, it was an article of faith – some day, as the Cypriots do now over Turkish illegal drilling, they too might need to call on that solidarity.Forceful messageIn part it was also the force of the central Barnier message all along: the UK is leaving the EU, not the other way around. It was therefore responsible for finding ways of minimising the damage that did not undermine the union. Negotiations, to the fury of the UK, were never going to be the usual “you give a bit, I’ll give a bit”.In the Brexit talks that philosophy was reflected in a mantra constantly repeated – and successfully held to in the final deal – that any deal would have to conform to the Belfast Agreement in all its aspects, to ensure no hard border, protect the inviolability of the single market and protect the all-Ireland economy. The trouble was that the UK’s commitment to the Belfast Agreement appeared to Ireland and the 27 to be incompatible with its ambitions to break free of the EU.But the EU held to its line. In the end it was the UK that crossed its own red line – although Northern Ireland was not to be formally in the EU customs union, it would be in it in all but name but also able to enjoy the advantages of those magnificent trade deals the UK has been promised. Some might say having its cake and eating it.The workable unworkableThe resuscitation by Johnson – or was it a Leo Varadkar prompt? – of Theresa May’s idea of “customs partnership”, already rubbished by the EU as unworkable and all too porous, was the key after months spent wastefully fighting the same battles.Instead of applying it to the whole of the UK, however, it would be just about acceptable in a small economy like Northern Ireland. In a neat piece of political symmetry after May’ s scrapping of the Northern Ireland-only backstop for an all-UK backstop, Johnson swapped the all-UK customs partnership idea for one confined to the North.The sounding board of Leo Varadkar in Liverpool last week was essential – although not negotiating on behalf of the EU, the Irish role was evolving from first among the partners, trusted implicitly by the task force, to a facilitator that could test ideas out with the British that might be awkward around the formal talks table.Both the idea of the North remaining in the UK customs union with internal customs controls and the formulations for the consent compromise appear to have come from Varadkar, to whom Barnier made a point of paying tribute on Thursday. The invitation to the Taoiseach to speak at the press conference sent the same message of appreciation.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

But it was his meeting with Leo Varadkar in Thornton Manor outside Liverpool just a week ago that was the turning point that led to the agreement.“That was the key moment when I understood there was a joint will to advance on most key issues,”\u0026nbspEU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said.By the time they met, Johnson knew his proposal for a light-touch customs border on the island of Ireland was going nowhere. Downing Street was briefing aggressively against Varadkar and Angela Merkel and the prime minister had run out of ideas.“He didn’t have anything written on a piece of paper when he went in there,” a British government source said.But Varadkar, whose officials had been co-ordinating closely with Barnier’s team, did have an idea for unblocking the negotiations and resolving the toughest issue: customs. If Johnson accepted that there should be no customs border between North and South, the EU could agree to two customs territories on the island.Northern Ireland would leave the EU customs union with the rest of the UK and would enjoy the benefits of any new British trade deals, but it would be treated for administrative purposes as if it had not left. Like a slimmed-down version of Theresa May’s proposed customs partnership, a system of rebates would ensure that Northern Ireland residents would pay the UK tariff only on goods that were not destined for the European single market.Johnson had already established a much warmer relationship with Varadkar than May ever enjoyed and a meeting in New York last month persuaded both leaders that they shared a determination to agree a deal on Brexit. During three hours of talks at Thornton Manor, for most of which officials were not present, they agreed the outline of what they called a pathway to a deal.NegotiationsIrish officials immediately debriefed the European Commission’s Brexit taskforce and, after a meeting with Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay the following day, serious negotiations resumed in Brussels. Meanwhile, Downing Street started work on persuading the DUP to accept the proposals with historian John Bew taking the lead in contacts with the party.The DUP had already agreed to a regulatory border in the Irish Sea, a move that angered some of its membership and drew flak from the Ulster Unionist Party. Now they were being asked to agree to thicken that border by adding customs declarations and checks on goods moving from Britain to Northern Ireland.On Sunday night, Arlene Foster and Nigel Dodds flew from Belfast to London, along with the DUP’s powerful chief executive, Timothy Johnson. The prime minister had learned from May’s unhappy experience of dealing with the DUP and took a more solicitous and respectful approach in his engagement with them.Over the next three days, they had numerous meetings with Johnson and his officials, receiving constant updates on the progress of negotiations in Brussels. The DUP were unhappy with the customs proposals but they would consider accepting them if the mechanism for winning political consent in Northern Ireland was sufficiently robust.After a 10-minute phone call with Varadkar on Wednesday morning, Johnson thought the Taoiseach had made a big move on consent that would be enough to bring the DUP on board. The DUP rejected it that morning but after a meeting on Wednesday afternoon, Downing Street believed they were ready to agree to the new deal.Following consultations with their membership, however, Foster and Dodds told Number 10 on Wednesday evening that they could not support the deal. At 6.45am on Thursday, they issued a statement rejecting it but saying they would continue to work with the government to get a better deal.Johnson did not take up the implied offer of further talks and the DUP heard nothing from Downing Street before he announced on Thursday morning that he had reached a deal with the EU. A few hours later, the party issued a longer statement detailing its objections to the deal and warning that it would not only vote against it on Saturday, but would seek to block enabling legislation for it if it passed.The prime minister showed no sign of regret on Thursday after he jettisoned the DUP to agree the deal, turning his focus instead towards the forbidding challenge of building a parliamentary majority for it without them.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

The more sponsors pay, the more products they can nominate to be on the list and the more prominently their own products will be featured on the popular website. Amazon aimed to sell at least $20m in sponsorships for this year’s list, the documents show. Amazon also published a summer toy list with lower sponsorship prices.It’s perfectly legal for Amazon to sell advertising on its site. It becomes a problem when the world’s largest online retailer tells shoppers recommendations are curated by experts but doesn’t disclose the money it gets from the toy industry, said Robert Weissman, president of the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen. Because consumers place more value on recommendations from independent sources, companies prefer to keep their financial involvement hidden, he argued.“They don’t write ‘paid ad’ on it because it completely changes how consumers perceive the information,” Mr Weissman said. “If the list is entirely or in part paid advertising, people have a right to know.”Amazon likened the payments it received to the money brands pay stores to be included in advertising circulars or to get prominent shelf space.In an emailed statement, the company said: “Every product on our annual Holiday Toy List, which features family gift ideas from new releases to customer favourites, is independently curated by a team of in-house experts based on a high bar for quality, design, innovation and play experience. We source product ideas from many places, including our selling partners who have an opportunity to nominate their best toys for the season and increase visibility of those toys.”Gift lists are a time-tested way for toy manufacturers to stand out in the critical holiday rush when busy parents are desperate for ideas. Toymakers are eager to appear on these lists because the companies generate about half their annual sales during the holiday season.Walmart charges toymakers $10,000 monthly per product to appear on its “Buyer’s Picks” toy list in November and December, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg. The company produces other lists, including “Top Rated by Kids”, which uses feedback from children who test and rate more than 100 toys in July. Walmart and its toy suppliers partner to determine which 100 toys will be tested. Spokeswoman Leigh Stidham said suppliers and brands cannot pay to be included on the latter list, but didn’t comment on “Buyer’s Picks”.Parents looking for independent recommendations can turn to toy lists produced by third-party reviewers such as Toy Insider and Toys, Tots, Pets \u0026amp More (TTPM). But in an era when customer reviews can be gamed and social media influencers push products without always disclosing that they’re getting paid, consumers sometimes struggle to distinguish between objective online recommendations and paid promotions.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe US law is murky about precisely what should be disclosed and when. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which enforces laws on deceptive advertising, issues general guidelines. A full-page magazine photo of a thirsty runner guzzling from a glistening bottle of Fiji water is so obviously an advertisement it doesn’t have to be disclosed. If the same water brand pays the magazine to publish what appears to be a news story about the health benefits of its product, it must be clearly labelled an advertisement so consumers aren’t confused.While federal regulators are taking a closer look at advertising these days, they can’t possibly monitor all the promotional activity out there. So the FTC occasionally cracks down to send a message, as it did in 2017 with letters to more than 90 influencers and marketers reminding them about the need to disclose paid promotions in social media. The spotty enforcement presents a big grey area for the toy industry.Amazon promotes security cameras that can be hacked to spy on youNew Amazon devices put Alexa inside glasses, a ring and your earsHow to get the best Amazon Black Friday deals this yearThe lists are a powerful negotiating tool for retailers, according to industry insiders familiar with the process. Toymakers are led to understand that if they buy marketing space on the lists they will get bigger orders, the people said. Sometimes manufacturers get better visibility if they agree to sell a product exclusively through the retailer, they said. Retailers include only toys on the list that they are actually selling.Lists are a fast-growing part of Amazon’s advertising business. Amazon holiday gift guides promoting toys, electronics and home goods combined to generate more than $120m in revenue in 2017, up about 40 per cent from the previous year, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg.What sets Amazon apart from other retailers is how much it charges for space on its toy page over the holidays. A narrow strip across the top of the web page costs $500,000 per month in November and December, up from $150,000 the rest of the year, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg. A billboard ad atop the toys page runs $300,000 per month, up from $75,000 the rest of the year.Similar spots atop Walmart’s toy page cost $180,000 in November and $132,000 in December. According to Comscore, Amazon generates about twice as much web traffic as Walmart, which could explain the discrepancy in pricing.Public Citizen, the watchdog group, in July lodged a complaint with the FTC about Amazon’s annual summer sale Prime Day, alleging the retailer didn’t do enough to help shoppers differentiate between paid promotions and genuine recommendations. The FTC confirmed receiving the complaint. The annual toy list presents similar concerns, Mr Weissman said.“When Amazon presents a top 100 toy list,” he said, “it’s a mistake to assume that shoppers understand this is just paid billboard space versus a list Amazon curated itself.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The UK company blamed its “disappointing” performance on the challenges of expanding both in the US and the EU simultaneously.“With the benefit of hindsight, we were not adequately prepared for the additional complexities of planning and trading across our expanded warehouse footprint,” Asos said in a statement, adding that it lost focus on some of its core tasks. \u0026nbspCaroline Gulliver, a retail analyst at Jefferies, made a similar assessment.“The complications of trying to do both projects at the same time meant they took their eye off the ball with regards to being best in class for products and fashion and customer experience in the UK and globally,” she said.Created with Sketch.Best high street fashion buys in October 2019 Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Ms Gulliver contrasted the performance of Asos with rival Boohoo, which reported a more than 80 per cent jump in pre-tax profit in the six months ending in August.“Boohoo is very, very focused on having a good product, very focused on what the customer wants to wear, supplying it at a really competitive price,” she said.Asos acknowledged shoppers’ growing appetite for bargains, noting\u0026nbspthat the UK market has been “more promotionally intense” over the last year –\u0026nbspsomething that, it suggested, may affect future profits as well.“We will also watch consumer confidence carefully, particularly in the context of Brexit,” the retailer added.There are already signs consumers are becoming more cautious. September data from the British Retail Consortium and KPMG\u0026nbspmarked\u0026nbspthe slowest growth in online sales on record, while total sales fell 1.3 per cent from a year earlier.More specific data from Kantar showed\u0026nbspthat online sales of clothing and footwear dipped 0.2 per cent in the 24 weeks to 25 August compared with the same period last year – the first drop since the consultancy\u0026nbspfirm started collecting the data a decade ago.“The online market isn’t immune to the challenges seen in the overall clothing market,” said Glen Tooke, a consumer specialist at Kantar.“We can link the performance of the market to shaky consumer confidence. It’s increasingly difficult for retailers to get consumers to part with their cash.”Despite the weak results from Asos, its shares soared by a quarter on Wednesday, with investors encouraged by the steps the retailer is taking to address its long-running problems.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

While a deal has now been agreed firms are still unclear about what shape Brexit will take and how it will affect them.\u0026nbsp in\u0026nbspProperty and real estate businesses experienced the highest annual increase in distress of any sector covered by the research, in part because they have found it difficult to raise the cash needed to finance their operations.\u0026nbspJulie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said: “With a considerable increase in the number of businesses suffering significant financial distress in the last three years there is growing frustration among businesses that they cannot plan for the future and the whole economy is lagging as a result.“Much investment is on hold as businesses have their hands tied by not knowing what the state of play will be post-Brexit and whether the agreements or contracts they currently have in place will still be valid following the expected withdrawal, which is contributing to stifled growth nationwide.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The more sponsors pay, the more products they can nominate to be on the list and the more prominently their own products will be featured on the popular website. Amazon aimed to sell at least $20m in sponsorships for this year’s list, the documents show. Amazon also published a summer toy list with lower sponsorship prices.It’s perfectly legal for Amazon to sell advertising on its site. It becomes a problem when the world’s largest online retailer tells shoppers recommendations are curated by experts but doesn’t disclose the money it gets from the toy industry, said Robert Weissman, president of the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen. Because consumers place more value on recommendations from independent sources, companies prefer to keep their financial involvement hidden, he argued.“They don’t write ‘paid ad’ on it because it completely changes how consumers perceive the information,” Mr Weissman said. “If the list is entirely or in part paid advertising, people have a right to know.”Amazon likened the payments it received to the money brands pay stores to be included in advertising circulars or to get prominent shelf space.In an emailed statement, the company said: “Every product on our annual Holiday Toy List, which features family gift ideas from new releases to customer favourites, is independently curated by a team of in-house experts based on a high bar for quality, design, innovation and play experience. We source product ideas from many places, including our selling partners who have an opportunity to nominate their best toys for the season and increase visibility of those toys.”Gift lists are a time-tested way for toy manufacturers to stand out in the critical holiday rush when busy parents are desperate for ideas. Toymakers are eager to appear on these lists because the companies generate about half their annual sales during the holiday season.Walmart charges toymakers $10,000 monthly per product to appear on its “Buyer’s Picks” toy list in November and December, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg. The company produces other lists, including “Top Rated by Kids”, which uses feedback from children who test and rate more than 100 toys in July. Walmart and its toy suppliers partner to determine which 100 toys will be tested. Spokeswoman Leigh Stidham said suppliers and brands cannot pay to be included on the latter list, but didn’t comment on “Buyer’s Picks”.Parents looking for independent recommendations can turn to toy lists produced by third-party reviewers such as Toy Insider and Toys, Tots, Pets \u0026amp More (TTPM). But in an era when customer reviews can be gamed and social media influencers push products without always disclosing that they’re getting paid, consumers sometimes struggle to distinguish between objective online recommendations and paid promotions.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe US law is murky about precisely what should be disclosed and when. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which enforces laws on deceptive advertising, issues general guidelines. A full-page magazine photo of a thirsty runner guzzling from a glistening bottle of Fiji water is so obviously an advertisement it doesn’t have to be disclosed. If the same water brand pays the magazine to publish what appears to be a news story about the health benefits of its product, it must be clearly labelled an advertisement so consumers aren’t confused.While federal regulators are taking a closer look at advertising these days, they can’t possibly monitor all the promotional activity out there. So the FTC occasionally cracks down to send a message, as it did in 2017 with letters to more than 90 influencers and marketers reminding them about the need to disclose paid promotions in social media. The spotty enforcement presents a big grey area for the toy industry.Amazon promotes security cameras that can be hacked to spy on youNew Amazon devices put Alexa inside glasses, a ring and your earsHow to get the best Amazon Black Friday deals this yearThe lists are a powerful negotiating tool for retailers, according to industry insiders familiar with the process. Toymakers are led to understand that if they buy marketing space on the lists they will get bigger orders, the people said. Sometimes manufacturers get better visibility if they agree to sell a product exclusively through the retailer, they said. Retailers include only toys on the list that they are actually selling.Lists are a fast-growing part of Amazon’s advertising business. Amazon holiday gift guides promoting toys, electronics and home goods combined to generate more than $120m in revenue in 2017, up about 40 per cent from the previous year, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg.What sets Amazon apart from other retailers is how much it charges for space on its toy page over the holidays. A narrow strip across the top of the web page costs $500,000 per month in November and December, up from $150,000 the rest of the year, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg. A billboard ad atop the toys page runs $300,000 per month, up from $75,000 the rest of the year.Similar spots atop Walmart’s toy page cost $180,000 in November and $132,000 in December. According to Comscore, Amazon generates about twice as much web traffic as Walmart, which could explain the discrepancy in pricing.Public Citizen, the watchdog group, in July lodged a complaint with the FTC about Amazon’s annual summer sale Prime Day, alleging the retailer didn’t do enough to help shoppers differentiate between paid promotions and genuine recommendations. The FTC confirmed receiving the complaint. The annual toy list presents similar concerns, Mr Weissman said.“When Amazon presents a top 100 toy list,” he said, “it’s a mistake to assume that shoppers understand this is just paid billboard space versus a list Amazon curated itself.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The UK company blamed its “disappointing” performance on the challenges of expanding both in the US and the EU simultaneously.“With the benefit of hindsight, we were not adequately prepared for the additional complexities of planning and trading across our expanded warehouse footprint,” Asos said in a statement, adding that it lost focus on some of its core tasks. \u0026nbspCaroline Gulliver, a retail analyst at Jefferies, made a similar assessment.“The complications of trying to do both projects at the same time meant they took their eye off the ball with regards to being best in class for products and fashion and customer experience in the UK and globally,” she said.Created with Sketch.Best high street fashion buys in October 2019 Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Ms Gulliver contrasted the performance of Asos with rival Boohoo, which reported a more than 80 per cent jump in pre-tax profit in the six months ending in August.“Boohoo is very, very focused on having a good product, very focused on what the customer wants to wear, supplying it at a really competitive price,” she said.Asos acknowledged shoppers’ growing appetite for bargains, noting\u0026nbspthat the UK market has been “more promotionally intense” over the last year –\u0026nbspsomething that, it suggested, may affect future profits as well.“We will also watch consumer confidence carefully, particularly in the context of Brexit,” the retailer added.There are already signs consumers are becoming more cautious. September data from the British Retail Consortium and KPMG\u0026nbspmarked\u0026nbspthe slowest growth in online sales on record, while total sales fell 1.3 per cent from a year earlier.More specific data from Kantar showed\u0026nbspthat online sales of clothing and footwear dipped 0.2 per cent in the 24 weeks to 25 August compared with the same period last year – the first drop since the consultancy\u0026nbspfirm started collecting the data a decade ago.“The online market isn’t immune to the challenges seen in the overall clothing market,” said Glen Tooke, a consumer specialist at Kantar.“We can link the performance of the market to shaky consumer confidence. It’s increasingly difficult for retailers to get consumers to part with their cash.”Despite the weak results from Asos, its shares soared by a quarter on Wednesday, with investors encouraged by the steps the retailer is taking to address its long-running problems.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

While a deal has now been agreed firms are still unclear about what shape Brexit will take and how it will affect them.\u0026nbsp in\u0026nbspProperty and real estate businesses experienced the highest annual increase in distress of any sector covered by the research, in part because they have found it difficult to raise the cash needed to finance their operations.\u0026nbspJulie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said: “With a considerable increase in the number of businesses suffering significant financial distress in the last three years there is growing frustration among businesses that they cannot plan for the future and the whole economy is lagging as a result.“Much investment is on hold as businesses have their hands tied by not knowing what the state of play will be post-Brexit and whether the agreements or contracts they currently have in place will still be valid following the expected withdrawal, which is contributing to stifled growth nationwide.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

However, the pound later gave up the gains after Boris Johnson\u0027s DUP allies quashed his hopes of progress by declaring they will oppose the plan.\u0026nbspElsewhere, WHSmith agreed a $400m deal to buy US travel retailer Marshall and RBS boosted its Brexit contingency fund to £8.2bn.WHSmith snaps up US retailerDomino\u0027s UK to quit four overseas markets amid falling salesWelcome to The Independent\u0027s live coverage of business and economics events.\u0026nbspWHSmith has agreed to buy US retailer Marshall for $400m, Asda has cut fuel prices and the pound is down against the dollar after the DUP\u0026nbspsaid it could not support Boris Johnson\u0027s Brexit deal as it stands.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspDomino\u0027s UK to quit four overseas markets amid falling sales\u0026nbspThe British arm of Domino\u0027s is to exit Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland because of declining sales.\u0026nbspWe have concluded that, whilst they represent attractive markets, we are not the best owners of these businesses. The board has therefore decided to exit the markets in an orderly manner, said outgoing chief executive David Wild.\u0026nbspIn the UK, Domino\u0027s is in the midst of a long-running battle with store operators who are angry at the declining share of profits they take.\u0026nbspMr Wild said: Normal working practices continue to be impacted by our franchisee dispute.\u0026nbspAs we said at our interim results, this situation is complex and we expect a resolution to take time, certainly into 2020. We remain committed to working with our franchisees to agree sustainable win-win solutions.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWHSmith snaps up US retailer\u0026nbspWHSmith has continued its march into the US by snapping up North American retailer Marshall Retail for $400m (£3122m).\u0026nbspBosses said they had first started watching the business around four years ago when they made an active decision to pursue the 3.2 billion dollar US travel market.\u0026nbspThe previous owners of Marshall launched a sales process over the summer as WHSmith came out on top.It means the retailer now has a further 170 stores in North America, including 59 in airports, with the remaining in busy tourist hotspots including Las Vegas.\u0026nbspIncoming chief executive Carl Cowling, who starts the new job in November, said: We\u0027ve known the business for about four years. We\u0027ve been watching the market for years trying to think of the best ways to break in.\u0026nbspThe deal comes a year after WHSmith bought travel accessories business InMotion for £155m.\u0026nbspPress AssociationAsda cuts fuel prices\u0026nbspAsda is cutting petrol and diesel prices by 2p and 3 p respectively.\u0026nbspMotorists will pay no more than 121.7p per litre for petrol and 125.7p per litre for diesel, Asda said.\u0026nbspThe RAC said other fuel retailers were failing to pass on falling wholesale prices to drivers.\u0026nbspSimon Williams,\u0026nbspfuel spokesperson\u0026nbspfor the RAC, said: Drivers are losing out badly, paying around 7p a litre more for petrol than they should be.\u0026nbspThis means a driver filling up a 55-litre family car is paying £3.85 too much.\u0026nbspFor some reason, in the last year or so our biggest retailers haven\u0027t been as transparent with their pricing as they have been in the past, which means motorists all over the country lose out as a result of them taking more margin than they have previously.BREAKING:\u0026nbspA senior EU official has said there will be no Brexit negotiations with Boris Johnson at the two-day leaders’ summit beginning today in Brussels, according to Reuters.\u0026nbspThe bloc has not yet received the text of an agreement, the official said.UK retail sales flat\u0026nbspin September\u0026nbspUK retail sales were flat in September compared with August, a slightly better performance than a 0.2 per cent dip forecast by economists. Compared with a year earlier, sales rose 3.1 per cent.\u0026nbspOn the three-month measure, which strips out some of the typical volatility in the figures, sales inched up by 0.6 percent from the April-June quarter. \u0026nbspRBS boosts Brexit contingency fund by a third\u0026nbspRBS has increased a support fund for small businesses by more than a third to help them deal with Brexit disruption.\u0026nbspThe bank -\u0026nbspwhich has a less-than-stellar reputation with Britain\u0027s SME\u0027s after it was found to have pushed many to the wall and sold off their assets to repair its own balance sheet -\u0026nbsphas added an extra £2.2bn to the fund, taking it to £8.2bn\u0026nbspThe state-backed lender said it had already committed £5.6bn\u0026nbspof the fund.Paul Thwaite, commercial banking managing director at RBS subsidiary NatWest, said: “We are very much open for business and want to be the bank that supports the UK’s businesses through this uncertain time.”“Retail sales in September show a small degree of growth, despite very poor weather for much of the month. This growth is despite the turbulent times and uncertain future. It appears that consumers are starting to stockpile in anticipation of a no-deal Brexit,” said Duncan Brewer, retail expert at Oliver Wyman.\u0026nbsp“We expect consumers to tighten their purse strings in the coming months. Our research shows that households will be worse off by £810 annually in the case of a no-deal Brexit, even including the government’s planned no deal tariff schedule.”\u0026nbspHe added: “As retailers have been trying to weather the Brexit storm, they haven’t been able to make structural changes that are needed for long-term survival on an ever-more competitive high street.”Pound jumps after Brexit deal agreed\u0026nbspSterling is up 0.9\u0026nbspper cent so far against the dollar to $1.29, after the UK and EU agreed a Brexit deal.\u0026nbspMarc Ostwald, global strategist and chief economist at ADM Investor Services International, says: “This takes no deal off the table.”\u0026nbspBut he notes\u0026nbspthat the pound had already strengthened substantially in the past week on hopes of a Brexit deal, limiting today’s further rise.\u0026nbspDoubts over whether the deal that has just been agreed will be approved by UK parliament are also keeping a lid on the pound.\u0026nbsp“What we really need is some more clarity on how the parliamentary arithmetic is going to work out, so it’s going to stay choppy for the time being,” he said.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The researchers point to previous work by the OECD showing that some people with health issues or a disability would be able to work if arrangements such as flexible hours or remote work were an option.In contrast, UK government statisticians treat those two types of the “hidden” jobless as economically inactive rather than unemployed, without distinguishing why some people are not looking for work.“When the hidden unemployed are added to official unemployment statistics, the number of working-age jobless people not in education is estimated to jump from 4.6 per cent to 13.2 per cent,” the Centre for Cities said on Thursday.“This challenges the claim that Britain has experienced a job creation miracle in recent years.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Britain\u0027s Prime Minister Boris Johnson shake hands during a news conference after agreeing on a Brexit deal, in BrusselsA man walks his dog through the fallen leaves in Clarkes Gardens, Allerton in LiverpoolPolice officers carry away an activist as Extinction Rebellion protesters block a road with a caravan in central LondonQueen Elizabeth II sits with Prince Charles on the Sovereign\u0027s throne ahead of delivering the Queen\u0027s Speech at the State Opening of ParliamentGreat Britain\u0027s Joe Fraser competes on Parallel Bars during the World Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.

The authors used that figure because other data in the report is also from 2017.In cities with weaker economies, such as Liverpool, Dundee and Sunderland, the jobless rate that includes the “hidden” unemployed reaches nearly 20 per cent, according to the report.“This research suggests that people in cities which have struggled to recover from the deindustrialisation of the 20th\u0026nbspcentury could be dealt a second blow as they are ill-equipped to respond to automation,” said Andrew Carter, the chief executive of the Centre for Cities.In another change from official statistics, the researchers excluded from their calculation of the overall unemployment rates people who are inactive by choice or for other non-economic reasons – specifically, students, early retirees and people looking after children, relatives or a home.“Being a student, retiring earlier and looking after family or home are not necessarily directly linked to the economic performance of the local area where people live and work,” they wrote.For example, most early retirees have probably left work because they can afford it, the authors note.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

However, the pound later gave up the gains after Boris Johnson\u0027s DUP allies quashed his hopes of progress by declaring they will oppose the plan.\u0026nbspElsewhere, WHSmith agreed a $400m deal to buy US travel retailer Marshall and RBS boosted its Brexit contingency fund to £8.2bn.WHSmith snaps up US retailerDomino\u0027s UK to quit four overseas markets amid falling salesWelcome to The Independent\u0027s live coverage of business and economics events.\u0026nbspWHSmith has agreed to buy US retailer Marshall for $400m, Asda has cut fuel prices and the pound is down against the dollar after the DUP\u0026nbspsaid it could not support Boris Johnson\u0027s Brexit deal as it stands.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspDomino\u0027s UK to quit four overseas markets amid falling sales\u0026nbspThe British arm of Domino\u0027s is to exit Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland because of declining sales.\u0026nbspWe have concluded that, whilst they represent attractive markets, we are not the best owners of these businesses. The board has therefore decided to exit the markets in an orderly manner, said outgoing chief executive David Wild.\u0026nbspIn the UK, Domino\u0027s is in the midst of a long-running battle with store operators who are angry at the declining share of profits they take.\u0026nbspMr Wild said: Normal working practices continue to be impacted by our franchisee dispute.\u0026nbspAs we said at our interim results, this situation is complex and we expect a resolution to take time, certainly into 2020. We remain committed to working with our franchisees to agree sustainable win-win solutions.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWHSmith snaps up US retailer\u0026nbspWHSmith has continued its march into the US by snapping up North American retailer Marshall Retail for $400m (£3122m).\u0026nbspBosses said they had first started watching the business around four years ago when they made an active decision to pursue the 3.2 billion dollar US travel market.\u0026nbspThe previous owners of Marshall launched a sales process over the summer as WHSmith came out on top.It means the retailer now has a further 170 stores in North America, including 59 in airports, with the remaining in busy tourist hotspots including Las Vegas.\u0026nbspIncoming chief executive Carl Cowling, who starts the new job in November, said: We\u0027ve known the business for about four years. We\u0027ve been watching the market for years trying to think of the best ways to break in.\u0026nbspThe deal comes a year after WHSmith bought travel accessories business InMotion for £155m.\u0026nbspPress AssociationAsda cuts fuel prices\u0026nbspAsda is cutting petrol and diesel prices by 2p and 3 p respectively.\u0026nbspMotorists will pay no more than 121.7p per litre for petrol and 125.7p per litre for diesel, Asda said.\u0026nbspThe RAC said other fuel retailers were failing to pass on falling wholesale prices to drivers.\u0026nbspSimon Williams,\u0026nbspfuel spokesperson\u0026nbspfor the RAC, said: Drivers are losing out badly, paying around 7p a litre more for petrol than they should be.\u0026nbspThis means a driver filling up a 55-litre family car is paying £3.85 too much.\u0026nbspFor some reason, in the last year or so our biggest retailers haven\u0027t been as transparent with their pricing as they have been in the past, which means motorists all over the country lose out as a result of them taking more margin than they have previously.BREAKING:\u0026nbspA senior EU official has said there will be no Brexit negotiations with Boris Johnson at the two-day leaders’ summit beginning today in Brussels, according to Reuters.\u0026nbspThe bloc has not yet received the text of an agreement, the official said.UK retail sales flat\u0026nbspin September\u0026nbspUK retail sales were flat in September compared with August, a slightly better performance than a 0.2 per cent dip forecast by economists. Compared with a year earlier, sales rose 3.1 per cent.\u0026nbspOn the three-month measure, which strips out some of the typical volatility in the figures, sales inched up by 0.6 percent from the April-June quarter. \u0026nbspRBS boosts Brexit contingency fund by a third\u0026nbspRBS has increased a support fund for small businesses by more than a third to help them deal with Brexit disruption.\u0026nbspThe bank -\u0026nbspwhich has a less-than-stellar reputation with Britain\u0027s SME\u0027s after it was found to have pushed many to the wall and sold off their assets to repair its own balance sheet -\u0026nbsphas added an extra £2.2bn to the fund, taking it to £8.2bn\u0026nbspThe state-backed lender said it had already committed £5.6bn\u0026nbspof the fund.Paul Thwaite, commercial banking managing director at RBS subsidiary NatWest, said: “We are very much open for business and want to be the bank that supports the UK’s businesses through this uncertain time.”“Retail sales in September show a small degree of growth, despite very poor weather for much of the month. This growth is despite the turbulent times and uncertain future. It appears that consumers are starting to stockpile in anticipation of a no-deal Brexit,” said Duncan Brewer, retail expert at Oliver Wyman.\u0026nbsp“We expect consumers to tighten their purse strings in the coming months. Our research shows that households will be worse off by £810 annually in the case of a no-deal Brexit, even including the government’s planned no deal tariff schedule.”\u0026nbspHe added: “As retailers have been trying to weather the Brexit storm, they haven’t been able to make structural changes that are needed for long-term survival on an ever-more competitive high street.”Pound jumps after Brexit deal agreed\u0026nbspSterling is up 0.9\u0026nbspper cent so far against the dollar to $1.29, after the UK and EU agreed a Brexit deal.\u0026nbspMarc Ostwald, global strategist and chief economist at ADM Investor Services International, says: “This takes no deal off the table.”\u0026nbspBut he notes\u0026nbspthat the pound had already strengthened substantially in the past week on hopes of a Brexit deal, limiting today’s further rise.\u0026nbspDoubts over whether the deal that has just been agreed will be approved by UK parliament are also keeping a lid on the pound.\u0026nbsp“What we really need is some more clarity on how the parliamentary arithmetic is going to work out, so it’s going to stay choppy for the time being,” he said.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It will also be worn by the first ever woman to walk on the Moon, who will head there as part of the Artemis mission.Nasa unveiled two prototypes, one white model designed for exploring outside of the spacecraft on spacewalks, and a second orange suit for high-risk activity on the inside, such as launch and returning to Earth.Amy Ross, a spacesuit engineer, said the new Exploration Extravehicular Mobility Unit (xEMU) for outside use has been made more flexible than before, making it easier for astronauts to move and bend.It is so flexible that it allows users to put their arms overhead, something astronauts during the Apollo programme were not able to do.\u0026nbspZippers are bad and cables are bad so we have no zippers or cables on this suit, she explained at a demonstration held in Washington DC.There will be fewer seams and new materials that keep the dust out.We found evidence of life on Mars in the 1970s, former Nasa scientistIt also features new technology to better manage pressure and the gloves have been improved to allow greater dexterity.You\u0027ll remember, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, they bunny hopped on the surface of the moon, well now we\u0027re actually going to be able to walk on the surface of the moon, which is very different than our suits of the past, said Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine.The Orion suit used for launch and entry is made from fire resistant material and features a lighter and stronger helmet, with improvements to reduce noise.Nasa is aiming to put the the first woman and next man on the moon by 2024 and maintain a presence with an ISS-like gateway orbiting around it, in hopes of eventually moving further into space to Mars.Kenneth Bowersox, acting associate administrator for human exploration, recently cast some doubt on the target date for the Artemis missions to the moon, saying he would not bet anything on it.Funding and technical challenges still need to come together in order to meet the White House-set deadline, the former space shuttle and space station commander told a congressional subcommittee last month.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

You weren’t moved, and whatever, but f*** you actually. F*** you all the way to the bank, actually.’”Created with Sketch.18 of the greatest gigs ever – according to our critics Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The long gone Rainbow in London’s Finsbury Park was one of the great rock venues, and though I was young at the time it would be impossible to forget the impact of Bowie in one of his first outings as Ziggy Stardust. “They haven’t even finished building the stage,” I said with breathtaking naievety to the person next to me, on observing the scaffolding and ladder. Of course, it was all part of the Ziggy theatrics, a show that began with DavidZiggy walking out to the drums of “Five Years” and continued with mime, flamboyance and songs that have all become classics. I remember his appearance being heralded by music from Beethoven’s Ninth (also used in A Clockwork Orange, the film being current at the time). In those years Bowie always used it as his theme music. I also remember being blown away by the support act – a fresh, imaginative outfit called Roxy Music. (David Lister)Truly charismatic performers leave an indelible impression and I marvelled at the way Chuck Berry had the crowd in the palm of his hand when I saw him in the 1970s. But few could match Dolly Parton in her prime for her larger-than-life enthusiasm and sheer sense of fun. When the country superstar came to London’s Dominion Theatre in 1983, she played some mean finger-picking banjo, sang beautifully, especially on an a capella version of “Do I Ever Cross Your Mind?” and even did an Elvis impression. Her concert was filmed for a video release and about half an hour after the crowd had left in, they brought in a large group of young punks and Goths (to intercut into crowd shots) and suggest an edgy young following. Happily, I had stayed around and saw her deliver this impromptu extra set, which was full of risqué jokes and blue banter. There’s no one quite like her. (Martin Chilton)You don’t usually realise you’re present at what will become a moment in history. But that sunny July afternoon at Wembley Stadium felt special right from the off, even if the off was Status Quo doing “Rockin’ All Over The World”. There were numerous stand-out moments perhaps on paper the biggest was the return of Paul McCartney, topping the bill after nearly five years self-enforced absence from high-profile performing following the shooting of John Lennon. Somewhat sadly the sound failed for part of “Let It Be”, but we can draw a veil over that. The most stunning set of the day came from Queen: a high energy medley through “Bohemian Rhapsody” and “Radio Ga Ga” to “We Will Rock You” and “We Are The Champions”. No one fired up the crowd quite as much that day. And since the band had not been at their most visible around that time, this proved to be their resurrection. (David Lister)Blues titan BB King released two of the greatest concert albums of the 20th-century in Live at the Regal (1964) and Live in Cook County Jail (1971). Even though he was 60 when I saw him at London’s Hammersmith Odeon in 1985, he was still full of energy. He sang with passion and his guitar work was transcendent, especially on gloriously funky version of “The Thrill is Gone”. I skipped my graduation ceremony for the concert and had the good fortune to bump into an old family friend called Ray Bolden, who had worked at Dobell\u0027s Record Shop in Charing Cross Road. King\u0027s face lit up to see Ray, who had put him up in his London flat in the 1950s. The blues superstar could not have been friendlier, despite his tiredness after a long gig. Seeing Muddy Waters live in 1979 was special but BB King at full power, bending guitar notes like no one else, topped even that. (Martin Chilton)When The Jesus \u0026amp Mary Chain reached the status of noisenik godheads with their fourth album Honey’s Dead in 1992, they decided to put together a visceral modern rock revue tour called Rollercoaster that’s still ringing in my ears almost 30 years on. Of the three revolving support acts, Blur opened the night, mid-transformation from baggy latecomers to art-pop pioneers. With Damon Albarn flinging himself wildly around the stage and clambering up amp stacks, they premiered ferocious second-album character studies like “Colin Zeal” while screening films of the journey of meat from slaughterhouse to defecation, in reverse. Most crucially, with their all-horns-blazing new single “Popscene”, they kick-started Britpop right before our eyes. The Mary Chain, meanwhile, were at peak malicious, I left with my skull buzzing, my eyes opened and my tastes re-arranged, convinced I\u0027d seen the new music, and I had. A gig that didn’t just make my night, it made me. (Mark Beaumont)When Pixies came onto a London stage on my birthday in 2004 and played Pixies songs – and music just doesn’t get better than that – it was pure relief, euphoria and dark-hearted epiphany. “Tame” sent me feral, “Gigantic” was titanic, “Bone Machine” crushed out my marrow. Black Francis snarled, barked and ranted through “Gouge Away”, “Monkey Gone To Heaven” and “Debaser”, every bit the demented pervert preacher he ever was Kim Deal’s angelic coos and bass melodies made an unholy pact with Joey Santiago’s werewolf guitar riffs, seemingly played with a plectrum made of Satan’s fingernail. Of their four Brixton dates that week, I lost every ounce of my s*** at three. Best gigs ever, no particular order.North London’s tiny and now-defunct, Buffalo Bar in the 2000s, hosted early gigs from the likes of Bloc Party, The Libertines, The Maccabees – or Foals. Their show took place 14 months before the release of their debut album Antidotes, and it justified their precocious reputation as a live act. That night, the energy of their high-octane math-rock was infectious it’s not often that you see a band in their earliest days and know that this is probably the last time you’ll be able to reach out and touch them. The songs followed: The French Open, Balloons, Hummer”, “Mathletics”, all fuelled by astoundingly complex polyrhythms, interweaving staccato synths and guitar played high on the fretboard in angular electro harmonies, set to punk-disco techno beats and urgent new wave vocals. I’d never seen a rock gig so precisely engineered (a sticker on the synth read Math is for Everyone), yet so exhilarating. There was a true sense we’d discovered something great. (Elisa Bray)Problematic in every way given singer Alice Glass’s October 2017 statement accusing her former bandmate Ethan Kath of sexual abuse, non-consensual sex and controlling behaviour, but this short set in front of a small crowd in a Camden bar was proof that when a performer truly plugs into the mother lode, the intensity they generate can burn itself into your retinas and shake your soul. Glass was 19 years old, and for most of the set just a blur of spectral movement frozen into violent shapes by an almost incessant strobe singing, shouting and screaming her way through songs such as “Courtship Dating”. The result was a reminder that whenever one of your heroes gets on stage to try to channel that primal essence of “rock ’n’ roll” – or whatever the hell it is – most of the time, they’re just trying to find an echo of something that once flowed through them. That can go on for 50 years or more. There’s sadness now in the memory, but on this day in April 2008, Glass had it. (Chris Harvey)918 Nick Cave \u0026amp the Bad Seeds, Brighton Centre, 2008It used to be that rock’n’roll was a young person’s game anyone over the age of 50 still tearing it up on stage needed to calm down and have a word with themselves. Nick Cave, the latter-day harbinger of the apocalypse still identifiable by his raven hair and pallbearer’s suit, has consistently shown us the idiocy of this thinking. I’ve seen Cave perform scores of times and he has never let me down, but this show, which coincided with the release of the album Dig!!! Lazarus Dig!!!, was a whole new level of spectacular: funny, furious, life-affirming, heavy on the biblical melodrama. Alongside the Bad Seeds, then operating as a seven-piece coolly attired in suits, open-necked shirts and slicked-back hair, Cave showed how musical talent can deepen rather than ebb in mid-life, and how he was – and indeed remains – untouchable in terms of intellect, charisma and sheer feral energy. (Fiona Sturges)Leonard Cohen steps onto the stage, dressed in grey shirt and tie, black waistcoat, trilby concealing his white hair. It\u0027s sweltering. And yet Cohen, in his mid Seventies, is barely breaking into a sweat. Much like his attire, the songs - such as Dance Me to the End of Love and So Long, Marianne – are immaculate, his voice no longer a wail but a raw, rumbling baritone. The Spanish sun is beating down and my friends and I are genuflecting before one of the greatest lyricists of all time. This was to be the only time I saw him live and no performance has ever, in terms of pure emotional intensity, targeted me with such laser-guided precision as his rendition of Hallelujah. The song\u0027s been covered by everyone from Jeff Buckley to Alexandra Burke, but sung by him that day, it\u0027s surely never felt as moving. (Patrick Smith)The great Sixties and Seventies soul singers are nearly all gone now, and I doubt we’ll ever see their like again. Bobby Womack had recovered from colon cancer but was in the early stages of Alzheimer’s Disease, and less than a year from his death in June 2014, when he played the UK in the summer of 2013. He came on stage on a sunny Saturday afternoon at the Latitude festival, to play songs from his brilliant comeback album, The Bravest Man in the Universe, to a basking, picnicking audience. “All soul singers come from gospel,” he told them. Womack’s voice still seemed like a gift from God. The years of cocaine addiction hadn’t altered its richness and warmth. To be in the presence of Womack that day, knowing it would likely be the last time, was very special.1218 St Vincent, End of the Road, 2014Most rockstars, terrified of seeming to be trying too hard, would never dream of hiring a choreographer. But St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, is no ordinary rockstar. For her Digital Witness tour, the musician recruited Annie B Carson to help her dream up a procession of strange, shuffling moves to perform alongside her brilliant self-titled fourth album. At End of the Road Festival – a small, Dorset delight which she had played with David Byrne a year earlier – her headline set was scuzzy, eccentric, and thrilling. At one point, without missing a lick on her guitar, she rolled herself down an oversized flight of white stairs like a glitching robot. Then again, no robot can play guitar like that. (Alexandra Pollard)After 35 years away from the stage it was a moment Kate Bush fans never thought would happen. Beforehand, I was reporting from outside the venue for NME and the excitement and energy was extraordinary, like nothing I\u0027ve ever experienced. One woman told me it would be fine if she died after the gig because she would die happy. The show started with a greatest hits section. And then it all got a bit more, well, Kate Bush, with a dramatic adaptation of The Ninth Wave. Sinking ships, confetti cannons, surreal fish people and a soliloquy about sausages. Act three was more pastoral. The second side of Aerial, The Sky of Honey, was performed in front of the most beautiful visuals I\u0027ve ever seen: birds, a red sun, a moon tilting on its axis and then Kate suspended into the air. Pure theatre. As we filed out, there was a sense that the audience was stunned. I still am. (Lucy Jones)Patti Smith was celebrating the 40th anniversary of her seminal 1975 album Horses at Field Day in Victoria Park, London, 2015. The sky was a perfect blue, and the sun was still blazing hot at 7pm. “I’m sorry about the dark glasses,” Smith said by way of introduction. “I’m not trying to be cool, it’s just, you know… the sun.” “You’re the f***ing coolest!” a fan screamed back. From there, she and her band, including long-serving guitarist Lenny Kaye, embarked on a blistering set that had myself, and many other audience members, in tears. Smith is a ferocious performer, she spat and snarled and howled tearing up her guitar as though it just insulted one of her favourite poets. It didn’t matter if she messed up, as she did on “Break it Up”, because she offered the instantly immortal words: “I don’t do nothing perfect. I only f*** up perfect.” You felt you were in the presence of something momentous. (Roisin O’Connor)When D’Angelo released his surprise third record – the politically fraught Black Messiah – it ended the 14-year hiatus that followed 2000’s Voodoo. It also reminded music fans that the American hip-hop artist was still as monumentally talented as he was back then. Accompanied by his eight-strong band The Vanguard, his show at the Hammersmith Apollo was a visceral, quasi-religious experience. Jesse Johnson, formerly of Prince-produced outfit The Time, added funky hooks to “Sugah Daddy”, while legendary bassist Pino Palladino took time out from The Who\u0027s live shows to join in the fun. At one point D’Angelo led a classic James Brown funk staple, holding three fingers in the air so the band could respond with three loud vamps. One encore was followed by a second that broke the curfew with free abandon, until D’Angelo was left on stage alone, reflective and blissful. It inspired a ine kind of worship, for a show that was appropriately titled The Second Coming. (Roisin O’Connor)A week before she played Brighton, I reviewed Lorde’s Alexandra Palace show in London. It was a five-star performance – the New Zealand musician exorcised the pain of the break-up she\u0027d chronicled on her brilliant second album Melodrama, twitching and twirling as an abstract house party played out in glass boxes around her. The stage design was so good, in fact, that Kanye West may or may not have nicked it a year later. Seeing her in Brighton the following week, without a notepad in my hand, I saw even more clearly all the intimate nuances of her performance – and was free to give in entirely to the exhilarating, heartbreaking melodrama of it all. (Alexandra Pollard)When you’ve been going to gigs for decades, you tend not to expect anything new, just variations – some mind-blowing, others not – on what you have seen before. So when I saw David Byrne’s American Utopia show, it felt like stumbling on the Ark of the Covenant. Here was a man who had been working in music for 40 years completely redrawing the rules of pop performance – no drum riser, no cables, no visible amps or microphones – and taking it deep into the territory of experimental theatre. In opposition to the usual freeform live music set-up, this tour was the result of fastidious planning, with everything rehearsed to the last nanosecond. And yet, forever on the move, dressed in matching grey suits and dancing barefoot in formation, Byrne and his 12-piece band were loose-limbed, unfettered and joyous to watch. And the music was pretty great too. (Fiona Sturges)1818 Christine and the Queens, Hammersmith Apollo, 2018Before her short run at Hammersmith Apollo last year, Héloïse Letissier – known as Christine and the Queens, though she dropped all but the Chris for her second album – tweeted: “I think we finally have some surprises for those who come to the shows!” She delivered on that promise – falling snow and sand, and a balcony homage to Romeo and Juliet – as she redefined what a pop show could be. With a gender-fluid cohort of athletic dancers, she brought to theatrical life her tumultuous journey towards embracing her pansexual identity, and finding liberation. And we went through all those emotions with her, those alternately tender and powerful vocals never faltering despite the restless dance routines. Everyone was on their feet dancing, and her declaration of inclusivity could not have been more empowering: “Vive everyone!” We left thrilled and elated. (Elisa Bray)The long gone Rainbow in London’s Finsbury Park was one of the great rock venues, and though I was young at the time it would be impossible to forget the impact of Bowie in one of his first outings as Ziggy Stardust. “They haven’t even finished building the stage,” I said with breathtaking naievety to the person next to me, on observing the scaffolding and ladder.

The most stunning set of the day came from Queen: a high energy medley through “Bohemian Rhapsody” and “Radio Ga Ga” to “We Will Rock You” and “We Are The Champions”. No one fired up the crowd quite as much that day. And since the band had not been at their most visible around that time, this proved to be their resurrection. (David Lister)Blues titan BB King released two of the greatest concert albums of the 20th-century in Live at the Regal (1964) and Live in Cook County Jail (1971). Even though he was 60 when I saw him at London’s Hammersmith Odeon in 1985, he was still full of energy. He sang with passion and his guitar work was transcendent, especially on gloriously funky version of “The Thrill is Gone”. I skipped my graduation ceremony for the concert and had the good fortune to bump into an old family friend called Ray Bolden, who had worked at Dobell\u0027s Record Shop in Charing Cross Road. King\u0027s face lit up to see Ray, who had put him up in his London flat in the 1950s. The blues superstar could not have been friendlier, despite his tiredness after a long gig. Seeing Muddy Waters live in 1979 was special but BB King at full power, bending guitar notes like no one else, topped even that. (Martin Chilton)When The Jesus \u0026amp Mary Chain reached the status of noisenik godheads with their fourth album Honey’s Dead in 1992, they decided to put together a visceral modern rock revue tour called Rollercoaster that’s still ringing in my ears almost 30 years on. Of the three revolving support acts, Blur opened the night, mid-transformation from baggy latecomers to art-pop pioneers. With Damon Albarn flinging himself wildly around the stage and clambering up amp stacks, they premiered ferocious second-album character studies like “Colin Zeal” while screening films of the journey of meat from slaughterhouse to defecation, in reverse. Most crucially, with their all-horns-blazing new single “Popscene”, they kick-started Britpop right before our eyes. The Mary Chain, meanwhile, were at peak malicious, I left with my skull buzzing, my eyes opened and my tastes re-arranged, convinced I\u0027d seen the new music, and I had. A gig that didn’t just make my night, it made me. (Mark Beaumont)When Pixies came onto a London stage on my birthday in 2004 and played Pixies songs – and music just doesn’t get better than that – it was pure relief, euphoria and dark-hearted epiphany. “Tame” sent me feral, “Gigantic” was titanic, “Bone Machine” crushed out my marrow. Black Francis snarled, barked and ranted through “Gouge Away”, “Monkey Gone To Heaven” and “Debaser”, every bit the demented pervert preacher he ever was Kim Deal’s angelic coos and bass melodies made an unholy pact with Joey Santiago’s werewolf guitar riffs, seemingly played with a plectrum made of Satan’s fingernail. Of their four Brixton dates that week, I lost every ounce of my s*** at three. Best gigs ever, no particular order.North London’s tiny and now-defunct, Buffalo Bar in the 2000s, hosted early gigs from the likes of Bloc Party, The Libertines, The Maccabees – or Foals. Their show took place 14 months before the release of their debut album Antidotes, and it justified their precocious reputation as a live act. That night, the energy of their high-octane math-rock was infectious it’s not often that you see a band in their earliest days and know that this is probably the last time you’ll be able to reach out and touch them. The songs followed: The French Open, Balloons, Hummer”, “Mathletics”, all fuelled by astoundingly complex polyrhythms, interweaving staccato synths and guitar played high on the fretboard in angular electro harmonies, set to punk-disco techno beats and urgent new wave vocals. I’d never seen a rock gig so precisely engineered (a sticker on the synth read Math is for Everyone), yet so exhilarating. There was a true sense we’d discovered something great. (Elisa Bray)Problematic in every way given singer Alice Glass’s October 2017 statement accusing her former bandmate Ethan Kath of sexual abuse, non-consensual sex and controlling behaviour, but this short set in front of a small crowd in a Camden bar was proof that when a performer truly plugs into the mother lode, the intensity they generate can burn itself into your retinas and shake your soul. Glass was 19 years old, and for most of the set just a blur of spectral movement frozen into violent shapes by an almost incessant strobe singing, shouting and screaming her way through songs such as “Courtship Dating”. The result was a reminder that whenever one of your heroes gets on stage to try to channel that primal essence of “rock ’n’ roll” – or whatever the hell it is – most of the time, they’re just trying to find an echo of something that once flowed through them. That can go on for 50 years or more. There’s sadness now in the memory, but on this day in April 2008, Glass had it. (Chris Harvey)918 Nick Cave \u0026amp the Bad Seeds, Brighton Centre, 2008It used to be that rock’n’roll was a young person’s game anyone over the age of 50 still tearing it up on stage needed to calm down and have a word with themselves. Nick Cave, the latter-day harbinger of the apocalypse still identifiable by his raven hair and pallbearer’s suit, has consistently shown us the idiocy of this thinking. I’ve seen Cave perform scores of times and he has never let me down, but this show, which coincided with the release of the album Dig!!! Lazarus Dig!!!, was a whole new level of spectacular: funny, furious, life-affirming, heavy on the biblical melodrama. Alongside the Bad Seeds, then operating as a seven-piece coolly attired in suits, open-necked shirts and slicked-back hair, Cave showed how musical talent can deepen rather than ebb in mid-life, and how he was – and indeed remains – untouchable in terms of intellect, charisma and sheer feral energy. (Fiona Sturges)Leonard Cohen steps onto the stage, dressed in grey shirt and tie, black waistcoat, trilby concealing his white hair. It\u0027s sweltering. And yet Cohen, in his mid Seventies, is barely breaking into a sweat. Much like his attire, the songs - such as Dance Me to the End of Love and So Long, Marianne – are immaculate, his voice no longer a wail but a raw, rumbling baritone. The Spanish sun is beating down and my friends and I are genuflecting before one of the greatest lyricists of all time. This was to be the only time I saw him live and no performance has ever, in terms of pure emotional intensity, targeted me with such laser-guided precision as his rendition of Hallelujah. The song\u0027s been covered by everyone from Jeff Buckley to Alexandra Burke, but sung by him that day, it\u0027s surely never felt as moving. (Patrick Smith)The great Sixties and Seventies soul singers are nearly all gone now, and I doubt we’ll ever see their like again. Bobby Womack had recovered from colon cancer but was in the early stages of Alzheimer’s Disease, and less than a year from his death in June 2014, when he played the UK in the summer of 2013. He came on stage on a sunny Saturday afternoon at the Latitude festival, to play songs from his brilliant comeback album, The Bravest Man in the Universe, to a basking, picnicking audience. “All soul singers come from gospel,” he told them. Womack’s voice still seemed like a gift from God. The years of cocaine addiction hadn’t altered its richness and warmth. To be in the presence of Womack that day, knowing it would likely be the last time, was very special.1218 St Vincent, End of the Road, 2014Most rockstars, terrified of seeming to be trying too hard, would never dream of hiring a choreographer. But St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, is no ordinary rockstar. For her Digital Witness tour, the musician recruited Annie B Carson to help her dream up a procession of strange, shuffling moves to perform alongside her brilliant self-titled fourth album. At End of the Road Festival – a small, Dorset delight which she had played with David Byrne a year earlier – her headline set was scuzzy, eccentric, and thrilling. At one point, without missing a lick on her guitar, she rolled herself down an oversized flight of white stairs like a glitching robot. Then again, no robot can play guitar like that. (Alexandra Pollard)After 35 years away from the stage it was a moment Kate Bush fans never thought would happen. Beforehand, I was reporting from outside the venue for NME and the excitement and energy was extraordinary, like nothing I\u0027ve ever experienced. One woman told me it would be fine if she died after the gig because she would die happy. The show started with a greatest hits section. And then it all got a bit more, well, Kate Bush, with a dramatic adaptation of The Ninth Wave. Sinking ships, confetti cannons, surreal fish people and a soliloquy about sausages. Act three was more pastoral. The second side of Aerial, The Sky of Honey, was performed in front of the most beautiful visuals I\u0027ve ever seen: birds, a red sun, a moon tilting on its axis and then Kate suspended into the air. Pure theatre. As we filed out, there was a sense that the audience was stunned. I still am. (Lucy Jones)Patti Smith was celebrating the 40th anniversary of her seminal 1975 album Horses at Field Day in Victoria Park, London, 2015. The sky was a perfect blue, and the sun was still blazing hot at 7pm. “I’m sorry about the dark glasses,” Smith said by way of introduction. “I’m not trying to be cool, it’s just, you know… the sun.” “You’re the f***ing coolest!” a fan screamed back. From there, she and her band, including long-serving guitarist Lenny Kaye, embarked on a blistering set that had myself, and many other audience members, in tears. Smith is a ferocious performer, she spat and snarled and howled tearing up her guitar as though it just insulted one of her favourite poets. It didn’t matter if she messed up, as she did on “Break it Up”, because she offered the instantly immortal words: “I don’t do nothing perfect. I only f*** up perfect.” You felt you were in the presence of something momentous. (Roisin O’Connor)When D’Angelo released his surprise third record – the politically fraught Black Messiah – it ended the 14-year hiatus that followed 2000’s Voodoo. It also reminded music fans that the American hip-hop artist was still as monumentally talented as he was back then. Accompanied by his eight-strong band The Vanguard, his show at the Hammersmith Apollo was a visceral, quasi-religious experience. Jesse Johnson, formerly of Prince-produced outfit The Time, added funky hooks to “Sugah Daddy”, while legendary bassist Pino Palladino took time out from The Who\u0027s live shows to join in the fun. At one point D’Angelo led a classic James Brown funk staple, holding three fingers in the air so the band could respond with three loud vamps. One encore was followed by a second that broke the curfew with free abandon, until D’Angelo was left on stage alone, reflective and blissful. It inspired a ine kind of worship, for a show that was appropriately titled The Second Coming. (Roisin O’Connor)A week before she played Brighton, I reviewed Lorde’s Alexandra Palace show in London. It was a five-star performance – the New Zealand musician exorcised the pain of the break-up she\u0027d chronicled on her brilliant second album Melodrama, twitching and twirling as an abstract house party played out in glass boxes around her. The stage design was so good, in fact, that Kanye West may or may not have nicked it a year later. Seeing her in Brighton the following week, without a notepad in my hand, I saw even more clearly all the intimate nuances of her performance – and was free to give in entirely to the exhilarating, heartbreaking melodrama of it all. (Alexandra Pollard)When you’ve been going to gigs for decades, you tend not to expect anything new, just variations – some mind-blowing, others not – on what you have seen before. So when I saw David Byrne’s American Utopia show, it felt like stumbling on the Ark of the Covenant. Here was a man who had been working in music for 40 years completely redrawing the rules of pop performance – no drum riser, no cables, no visible amps or microphones – and taking it deep into the territory of experimental theatre. In opposition to the usual freeform live music set-up, this tour was the result of fastidious planning, with everything rehearsed to the last nanosecond. And yet, forever on the move, dressed in matching grey suits and dancing barefoot in formation, Byrne and his 12-piece band were loose-limbed, unfettered and joyous to watch. And the music was pretty great too. (Fiona Sturges)1818 Christine and the Queens, Hammersmith Apollo, 2018Before her short run at Hammersmith Apollo last year, Héloïse Letissier – known as Christine and the Queens, though she dropped all but the Chris for her second album – tweeted: “I think we finally have some surprises for those who come to the shows!” She delivered on that promise – falling snow and sand, and a balcony homage to Romeo and Juliet – as she redefined what a pop show could be. With a gender-fluid cohort of athletic dancers, she brought to theatrical life her tumultuous journey towards embracing her pansexual identity, and finding liberation. And we went through all those emotions with her, those alternately tender and powerful vocals never faltering despite the restless dance routines. Everyone was on their feet dancing, and her declaration of inclusivity could not have been more empowering: “Vive everyone!” We left thrilled and elated. (Elisa Bray)Taylor pointed out that Bohemian Rhapsody was still a successful film despite negative coverage. “Bad reviews usually mean that it’s going to be really successful,” he said.“I think people know a lot more than film critics, and the word of mouth via social media is so much more powerful than review from a guy who probably watches 40 movies a week, and has probably lost the essence of the joy of a movie.”\u0026nbspIn March, Taylor’s fellow Queen member and lead guitarist Brian May called out\u0026nbspthe “vindictive sickness” of those who criticised\u0026nbspBohemian Rhapsody.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The observation points at true airway changes that are associated with obesity.“We need to investigate this finding in more detail and particularly whether this phenomenon can be reversed with weight loss.“In the meantime, we should support asthma patients to help them achieve or maintain a healthy weight.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Many have no other option but to return to traffickers who exploit their continued vulnerability,” she added.“Other young people have become homeless as local authorities are unable to meet their needs in a way that makes them feel safe. When children approach adulthood they are particularly vulnerable to these risks as the support they receive is drastically reduced upon turning 18.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Whether by fake migration services or unscrupulous iniduals who befriend and then betray them, women fall into a dark spiral of sexual exploitation and forced, unpaid prostitution, unable to escape.The cannabis industry hides a dark secret in the house next door. Gangs bring young boys to the UK from countries like Vietnam and deliver them to a house where, once in, they won’t be able to leave. Forced to tend cannabis plants that fill specially rigged houses, the boys are often locked in and forced to work, sleep and eat in one confined and dirty room.

People need time. You’ve got young people for whom it’s so far removed to their understanding. Everything is difficult to understand,” she said.“I’m in this surreal place where I’m the foster carer and I’m having to have debates with\u0026nbspprofessionals from across the multi-agency team.”Unaccompanied children driven to suicide due to ‘gaps in support’Cllr Simon Blackburn, chair of the LGA’s safer and stronger communities board, said the spiralling rate of council referrals, especially relating to county lines drug trafficking or child sexual exploitation, were having a “huge impact on overstretched council services, particularly children’s services”.He added: “Councils are committed to tackling the despicable crime of modern slavery, which is a rising threat to our communities. It can destroy the lives of vulnerable people working in fear of physical violence from ruthless gangmasters for little or no pay.\u0026nbsp“Extra funding next year will help but government needs to ensure councils have adequate long-term resources to tackle this abuse and support its victims, as well as creating a sustainable NRM system in the long term.”The LGA’s analysis follows\u0026nbspwarnings that unaccompanied minors in the UK were being driven to self-harm and suicide due to “gaps in statutory support” provided to them, which in\u0026nbspsome cases has led them to take their own lives.Charities warned that many unaccompanied minors are at severe risk of trafficking on arrival in the UK, but that a lack of one-to-one support means they are not adequately protected from exploitation.\u0026nbspA government spokesperson said:\u0026nbsp“Modern slavery and child exploitation are barbaric crimes and we remain committed to stamping them out and supporting victims.“Factors like county lines-related criminality are thought to be driving the increase of child referrals to the National Referral Mechanism. The world leading Modern Slavery Act ensures that we are identifying and protecting vulnerable children, including those exploited by county lines gangs.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But not as much as I love my little girl.”He picks her up and swings her around the kitchen to a soundtrack of jangly acoustic guitar music, and it becomes apparent he is cooking vegetarian sausages.\u0026nbspHolding a knife and fork he turns to the camera. “Just as tasty as it used to be,” he says.Created with Sketch.Finding food on the front line of climate change Show all 17Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.117 Balkisa Zakow, 25, with her twins Hassan and Ousseni, Tombokiery village, NigerAt nine months’ pregnant with twins Balkisa Zakow, 25, feared she wouldn’t have the energy to give birth.

The researchers point to previous work by the OECD showing that some people with health issues or a disability would be able to work if arrangements such as flexible hours or remote work were an option.In contrast, UK government statisticians treat those two types of the “hidden” jobless as economically inactive rather than unemployed, without distinguishing why some people are not looking for work.“When the hidden unemployed are added to official unemployment statistics, the number of working-age jobless people not in education is estimated to jump from 4.6 per cent to 13.2 per cent,” the Centre for Cities said on Thursday.“This challenges the claim that Britain has experienced a job creation miracle in recent years.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Britain\u0027s Prime Minister Boris Johnson shake hands during a news conference after agreeing on a Brexit deal, in BrusselsA man walks his dog through the fallen leaves in Clarkes Gardens, Allerton in LiverpoolPolice officers carry away an activist as Extinction Rebellion protesters block a road with a caravan in central LondonQueen Elizabeth II sits with Prince Charles on the Sovereign\u0027s throne ahead of delivering the Queen\u0027s Speech at the State Opening of ParliamentGreat Britain\u0027s Joe Fraser competes on Parallel Bars during the World Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.

The authors used that figure because other data in the report is also from 2017.In cities with weaker economies, such as Liverpool, Dundee and Sunderland, the jobless rate that includes the “hidden” unemployed reaches nearly 20 per cent, according to the report.“This research suggests that people in cities which have struggled to recover from the deindustrialisation of the 20th\u0026nbspcentury could be dealt a second blow as they are ill-equipped to respond to automation,” said Andrew Carter, the chief executive of the Centre for Cities.In another change from official statistics, the researchers excluded from their calculation of the overall unemployment rates people who are inactive by choice or for other non-economic reasons – specifically, students, early retirees and people looking after children, relatives or a home.“Being a student, retiring earlier and looking after family or home are not necessarily directly linked to the economic performance of the local area where people live and work,” they wrote.For example, most early retirees have probably left work because they can afford it, the authors note.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Show all 22Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Air conditioning accounts for less than 10 per cent of China’s or India’s electricity use.The country’s total cooling capacity – and emissions – are expected to nearly double by 2030 from 2016 levels, according to the International District Cooling and Heating Conference.“If you turn off air conditioners, it will be unbearable. You cannot function effectively,” Yousef al-Horr, founder of the Gulf Organisation for Research and Development, told The Washington Post.In rapidly growing urban areas throughout the Middle East, some predict cities could become uninhabitable, said Mohammed Ayoub, senior research director at the Qatar Environment and Energy Research Institute.“We’re talking about 4 to 6 degrees Celsius increase in an area that already experiences high temperatures,” Mr Ayoub said.The danger is acute because of the humidity. When humidity is very high, evaporation from the skin slows or stops.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And in a heatwave in July 2010, temperatures hit an all-time high of 50.4C.Free tickets given out in desperate bid to fill empty stadiumIn the Souq Waqif market, housing shops, restaurants and small hotels, 3ft air-conditioning units blow cool air onto customers.A German television report alleged hundreds of deaths among foreign workers in Qatar in recent years, prompting new limits on outdoor work.The government has said the World Cup will be carbon-neutral, and recently unveiled plans to plant a million trees, an idea at least one expert has condemned as “unrealistic”.Fears that visiting football fans might wilt or even die prompted the decision to delay the World Cup in Qatar by five months.At the new Al Janoub open-air stadium, grates built underneath the 40,000 seats expel cool air.

The Syrian government is hostile to foreign\u0026nbspNGOs\u0026nbspand many remain at risk of arrest.International aid and medical agencies, including Medicines Sans Frontieres, Save the Children, Mercy Corps and DanChurchAid, all released statements saying their intentional staff had\u0026nbspto leave Syria, either partially or fully halting their activities there.The UN said this has disrupted the “supply change” of aid to much of northern Syria, which before the latest conflict was already home to nearly a million displaced people who depended on aid to survive.“Due to changes on the ground and insecurity some NGO partners have had to transfer international staff who were operating in the northeast out of the area, and others have had to temporarily suspend operations,” Hedinn Halldorsson from the agency in Damascus, told The Independent.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A slew of countries including the UK has also imposed arms embargoes on Ankara, to little effect.\u0026nbspBut despite the mounting pressure, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan remained defiant, saying earlier: “We will never declare a ceasefire.”Back in Syria, meanwhile,\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspa rebel spokesman confirmed that the “operation is ongoing in\u0026nbspRas\u0026nbspal-Ain.” From the Turkish side of the border, ambulances could be seen in war-ravaged town racing away from the front,\u0026nbsptowards hospitals.A briefing paper released by the Turkish government said the town centre of\u0026nbspRas\u0026nbspal-Ain\u0026nbsphad been “cleared out of terrorists” along with 1,217 sq km of territory.Aid workers in Syria said international staff having to evacuate the country because of regime presence,\u0026nbspwould only see the humanitarian crisis worsen.\u0026nbspThe Kurdish Red Crescent (KRC)\u0026nbspcalled the sudden withdrawal\u0026nbspa “disaster” saying the KRC’s 1,000 or so staffers and volunteers were unable to shoulder the burden alone.“Coordination has almost collapsed since the international staffers had to leave. The burden was on them to secure cross border aid. We were also dependent on our partners to get funds, we need international doctors to support us,” the KRC’s Dr Sherwan Berry said.Turkey ‘effectively holding 50 US nuclear bombs hostage’ at air baseRussian soldiers filmed apparently moving into US Syria baseNine suspected Isis members escape from camp in Syria, says FranceMilitary veterans Tulsi Gabbard and Pete Buttigieg clash over SyriaHow Russia is filling the gap left by Trump’s withdrawal of US troops “We have such a load on our shoulders. We don’t have enough staff to man the hospitals, we lost a lot of clinics to shelling and bombing, we have 300,000 displaced people needing food, shelter, water and medical care. We are struggling to provide for them,” he added.He said that KRC ambulances had been targeted by Turkish strikes and several hospitals taken out of service because of the fighting.“Tens of thousands of internally displaced civilians are sleeping on the ground, lacking food, medicine and water,” he added.A senior foreign humanitarian professional, who asked not to be named for security reasons, said should the regime retain control of northeast Syria and the border\u0026nbspit would be “catastrophic” as they would not be able to return.\u0026nbsp“International aid agencies have been supporting hospitals in all the major towns and cities, they have been doing water tucking, bread distribution, rehabilitating schools, water stations and irrigations canals.

But, perversely, it may have also cost them the game.There are not yet specic punishments in place for breaking the racism protocol but Uefa’s Disciplinary Regulations  state: “If a match cannot take place or cannot be played in full, the member association or club responsible forfeits the match.”So it could have been perceived as a home win for racism and defeat for England.Uefa’s woefully inadequate response to a litany of previous racist incidents meant it was left up to Tyrone to make a call.Cool-headed England manager Gareth Southgate later said all his players wanted to carry on.If Uefa bosses had spines, they should have abandoned the game and given the points to England.Players should be able to walk out on a game where mass racism is taking place without risk of forfeiting the match. If nations such as Bulgaria can’t police and steward racist fans, then Uefa should force them to play behind closed doors or exclude them from tournaments until they can.In the build-up to the game, the Bulgarians pointed out the English could hardly occupy the moral high ground.There have been a number of reports of players being racially abused at games here this year and stars are regularly subjected to racism on social media.I have reported on England games for The Sun for the past  years and the dedicated fans are a friendly and welcoming bunch.Most use the opportunity of foreign games for sight-seeing and immersing themselves in local culture.Yet a “stag do” following of younger yobbish fans attaches themselves to Three Lions away games in party destinations such as Amsterdam, Porto and Prague.Booze and drugs are swilled down and continental squares echo to the sound of Ten German Bombers and splintering glass.A minority of fans it may be, but they are still intimidating to locals and families. We have our own house to get in order, too.After the final whistle Tyrone stated that he believed England’s collective decision to stay on was the correct one, saying he was “proud of how we dealt with it”.Dignied in stark contrast to the far-Right nasties who had hounded him.His cry of “Hey, did you hear that ” must surely now be acted upon in football’s corridors of power.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We want the government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Join our Universal Credit Facebook group or email UniversalCredit@the-sun to share your story. Apply for an advance - Claimants are able to get some cash within five days rather than waiting weeks for their first payment. But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently, or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free. You can find your nearest one on the Trussel Trust website.The new Secretary of State gave a staunch defence of Universal Credit today, arguing that her Suffolk constituents would give it a . out of ten.She also refused to accept there was a link between the benefit cap and child poverty.And the Permanent Secretary Peter Schofield told MPs that there were , cases of suspected Universal Credit fraud being investigated after reports of scams."},{"url":null,"title":"reaminer mps sabotage brexit","story":"The “People’s Vote” mob have repeatedly told the world that Britain has changed its mind and is itching to reverse Brexit.

Dont let the world down. You can make a great deal.The letter, first revealed by Fox News host Trish Regan, adds: History will look upon you favourablyyou get this done the right and humane way.Last weeks sudden removal of the American military presence in northern Syria was seen by US allies the Kurds - a sworn enemy of Turkey - as a stab in the back.Turkey swtly deployed troops over the Syrian border to seize Kurdish Syrian Democratic Frontpositions in a series of bloody battles.The assault created a new humanitarian crisis in Syria with , civilians taking flight and a security alert over thousands of ISIS fighters abandoned in Kurdish jails.He also declared that the Kurdish fighters he had abandoned were “much safer now” and were “not angels”.His remarks contradicted the official assessment of both the state and defence departments that the offensive was a disaster for regional stability and the fight against ISIS.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So you run. And I’ve done a lot of that kind of running.”His tale of a washed-up B-picture Hollywood stuntman held together by steel rods is equally about the knocks Springsteen has taken during his  years.The character is just one of his “broken” drters haunting the highways, byways and railroads of Western Stars.“Everybody is broken in some way,” he opines in his weathered drawl. “We all have our broken pieces, emotionally, spiritually. In this le, nobody gets away unhurt.“We are always trying to find someone whose broken pieces fit with our broken pieces, and something whole emerges.”In Springsteen’s case, cue the entrance into his le of partner and soulmate, Patti Scialfa, in the Eighties to help forge that “whole”.It’s through her abiding love for him as well as affection from his three children that he’s finally learning to stop running — eventhings aren’t always that easy.“I’ve spent  years trying to let go of the destructive parts of my character,” he says. “And I still have days when I struggle with it. For a long time,I loved you or I felt a deep attachment, I would hurt youI could.”Despite his admission, flame-haired Patti is seen steadfastly at his side throughout the Western Stars concert footage, filmed in a gorgeous old barn on the Springsteen farm at Colt’s Neck, just down the road from his childhood home in Freehold, New Jersey, and “filled with the best kind of spirits”.Oh, and a -piece orchestra, a band, backing singers, a small invited audience, a sizeable film crew and an overflowing bar, all beneath cathedral-like rafters.“The barn is pretty cool,” he tells a London audience during a recent promo trip. “It came with the property and we rebuilt the bottom for the horses.“Upstairs hasn’t been touched since the late s. It’s an incredible space so we have our parties and weddings there and we built that little bar.”The American icon seems genuinely thrilled with his widescreen adventure which took him from his homely barn across the continent to the spectacular wide open spaces of Joshua Tree National Park in southern Calornia for the spoken-word sequences.Dressed down in checked shirt and jeans, Springsteen appears relaxed, fit and well-preserved for his years during a screening and QA hosted by Edith Bowman in the company of his go-to director and collaborator Thom Zimny.For transparency’s sake, the quotes I’m using here are either from the film, the QA or a more casual chat that I and three other journalists have with Bruce afterwards.Thoughtsto Patti’s appearance which helps accentuate the film’s more positive values of love and family and Springsteen is keen to stress her central role.He’s asked about the song Stones, which dwells on the crushing nature of lying and seems even more impactful in a live setting.It finds him crooning, “Those are only the lies you’ve told me”, with Patti leaning into his mic and softly echoing, “Only the lies you’ve told me”. The lyrics and performance imply unspoken untruths in a relationship.As you can tell by now, there are deep issues for Springsteen’s audiences to ponder as they watch his film unravel. I wish them a lot of luck,” he quips. “It’s complicated s**t.”Springsteen harbours a big regret over the Western Stars album, which was lavished with critical acclaim on its release in June, prompting him to make amends in the movie.“I should have had Patti on it,” he says. “That was a big mistake because it’s all about men and women.“Patti brings so much and we’ve been together for such a long time, so that’s a lot of experience around that one little microphone. We bring all of that the minute we lean in. Oh my Lord, there’s this whole  years of emotional le together between us.“She’s wonderful. Even when she’s not singing with me,you dig deep down into the centre of the film, she’s there.”At certain intervals, old home video clips are inserted, notably scenes from Bruce and Patti’s  honeymoon at a log cabin in Yosemite National Park, Calornia.The lovers goof around, share a kiss obscured by his Stetson and you can see a partly drunk bottle of bourbon on the outdoor table.For Springsteen, this movie is the next chapter in a stellar run of projects which have required much soul-searching, beginning with his  autobiography Born To Run, continuing with his compelling Broadway residency and culminating in Western Stars.“I’m a man of many talents,” he says with a self-deprecating laugh. “You know I write books and Broadway plays and now I’m making movies.“I’m going to try being an astronaut next and I’ll let you know how that goes!” He suggests his th birthday on September  might have something to do with this period of reflection.“You’re getting to that age where you’re summing up a lot of what you’ve learned and what your le has been,” he says.“I’ve had a really, really good run over the past five years as far as feeling inspired and being creative. I’ve done things I’ve never done before. I feel very lucky because you never know.”Springsteen understands the jeopardy of being a songwriter only too well. “Writing is a mystery,” he says. “You always think you’re never going to write again.”He knows the feeling of “simply wandering around for a year without ideas or inspiration” before finding “another vein in your creative mind that you can tap”.In the case of Western Stars, he cites the work of great songwriters Burt Bacharachand Jimmy Webbas inspiration.It explains the smooth, orchestrated major chord sound of Western Stars, a huge departure from Springsteen’s earthy, street- savvy, saxophone-fuelled work with the E Street Band as well as the understated folk stylings of solo albums Nebraska and The Ghost Of Tom Joad.He sensed he was on to something fresh and says: “Your audience wants you to do two things . . .  they want to feel at home AND they say, ‘Surprise me’.”A real surprise comes at the end of the movie. Rather than finish on the album’s evocative but downbeat closing track Moonlight Motel, there’s a rousing rendition of Glen Campbell’s sparkling singalong Rhinestone Cowboy.Springsteen says of the late Campbell, who also sang those two Webb classics: “When he first came out, I thought, ‘He’s a little mainstream’, but then I realised he made well-crafted records.“He can really sing and he was a great guitarist so, as I got older, I got into that music and thought, ‘Ah, I want to make a record with those influences’.”Springsteen’s new songs drawing on Bacharach and Webb are similarly imbued with a keen sense of geography, Tucson Train, Sundown and Somewhere North Of Nashville in particular.This classic American songwriting trope plays into Springsteen’s travel song obsession, hence opening song Hitch Hikin’ in which the protagonist gets a lt from a truck driver described as a “gearhead with a souped up ’”.The Wayfarer continues the theme with its lyric, “When everyone’s asleep and the midnight bells sound My wheels are hissin’ up the highway.”“This is my th album and I’m still writing about cars,” says Springsteen in the movie. Cars have been a powerful metaphor for me. Forty years ago, they represented freedom.“Today, not so much. A metaphor for movement at best. But are we moving forward  A lot of the time we’re just moving.”In our chat, he speaks fondly of the teal-coloured, s Chevrolet El Camino coupe utility vehicle used in the widescreen interludes evoking vast desert landscapes of old John Ford westerns such as The Searchers, Fort Apache and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.During filming, realisation dawned on him about acquiring a suitable mode of transport. “I said I’ve got to drive something. Get an El Camino. It’s classic Western.“When in doubt I just get in and drive the car. What are we going to do with this song  Ah, drive the car!” Springsteen adds: “Maybe cars were just a part of growing up for me but they continue to be resonant and romantic.“The idea of a journey is always compelling to people. The image of driving is fundamentally American, particularly in the South West, just very evocative.“There’s a geography that people carry inside them, images they’ve internalised through films and travel over the years.” So, how does he hope his audiences will react to his movie “Well, you come in to see it and you’re with your gal and you sit down and you’re watching it. Gets towards the end and you hold hands.”Just like the emotional, symbolic shot you see of Bruce and Patti’s hands entwined on the wheel of the El Camino. And what’s next for Springsteen, in such a rich vein of form nearly  years into his recording career “We’ll work on the record and after we get it done, we’ll start to book some dates.” Time for tramps like Springsteen to fire up his old hot rod again . . .“One, two, three, four!

So who are they and what do they stand for Led by Arlene Foster, they are staunchly pro-union and pro-Brexit, making them a natural fit for a deal with the Tories.Their campaign manesto included retaining the triple lock on pensions and cutting VAT for tourism businesses.The DUP also support a nuclear deterrent, which puts them at odds with anti-Trident Jeremy Corbyn.But the DUP have conservative views on issues such as gay marriage and abortion - which could make implementing Mays social policies more dficult.They have also been criticised in the past for their links to members of violent loyalist paramilitary groups like the UVF.Johnson has reportedly been handed a leline by the Democratic Unionist Party in the Irish backstop battle.It was said the DUP has agreed to a move that could pave the way for a Brexit deal.The Times reported the party accepted some changes that would see Northern Ireland sticking to some European Union rules post-Brexit.But it would be a new deal to replace the hard Irish backstop, a sticking point for many in the Brexit negotiations.The paper claimed the DUP, the biggest party in Northern Ireland, had also privately said it would drop its objection to regulatory checks in the Irish Sea.Theresa Mays government has struck a deal to work with the Northern Irish party on a confidence and supply basis.It means the DUPs ten MPs will vote with the Tories on key measures such as the Budget and any votes of no confidence that could topple the government.The Conservatives, who do not have a majority in Parliament, will still have to battle to pass other laws, striking deals with the DUP on a case-by-case basis.Theresa May and Arlene Foster met with their deputies and senior MPs at Number  to seal the deal around the Cabinet table after the election in June.Mrs Foster said she was delighted by the conclusion of talks, while Mrs May added that the parties share many values and said the agreement was a very good one.Arlene Foster, , is Assembly Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone and the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party.She took over as First Minister of Northern Ireland last year after Peter Robinson stood down.But the devolved Stormont governments collapsed in January amid a renewable energy fiasco.The region has been directly governed from Westminster as repeated efforts to hatch a new power sharing deal failed.Born in Enniskillen and raised in Dernawilt, County Fermanagh, she is the daughter of a police reservist who survived an assassination attempt by the IRA during the Troubles.As a teenager she was on a school bus that was bombed by the IRA. Her pal was seriously injured.Mrs Foster, a graduate of Enniskillen Collegiate Grammar School and Queens University Belfast, has three children with husband Brian.Theresa May seemed on the brink of agreeing a deal with Brussels on the first stage of Brexit negotiations, allowing talks to move to trade and the future relationship.One sticking point was the frontier between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland post-Brexit, with all sides keen to avoid theof a hard border.A leaked draft appeared to show the UK had vowed to ensure continued regulatory alignment with the EU so as not to undermine the Good Friday Agreement.The Dublin government claimed it as a victory, while Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Welsh leader Carwyn Jones said it meant other parts of the UK could stay in the single market.While Mrs May was meeting EU Commission chief Jean Claude-Juncker, the DUP made a statement that kiboshed what had seemed a done deal.Mrs Foster said Northern Ireland must leave the EU on the same terms as the rest of the UK and she would not accept anything .The DUP had threatened to pull out of the confidence and supply dealTheresa May caved into demands from Ireland and the EU.Mrs Foster has previously accused the Irish government of hijacking Brexit negotiations to promote a united Ireland.On  November, as Theresa May prepared to address her Cabinet with her agreed Brexit deal, Mrs Foster warned she wont accept a Brexit deal that treats Northern Ireland dferently to the rest of the UK.She rejected suggestions Northern Ireland could remain in the single market and customs union in a special arrangment to keep the border open.Ireland’s PM, Leo Varadkar, warned he would veto any progress in Brexit talks unless the UK came up with proposals to avoid a hard border with Northern Ireland."},{"url":null,"title":"sukkot 2019 feast of tabernacles","story":"So what is being celebrated  Heres what you need to know.Sukkot is a Jewish holiday which is all about giving thanks for the autumn harvest and commemorating the  years Israelis spent wandering the desert after leaving slavery in Egypt.A sukkah is a booth or hut, and sukkot is the plural form of the word - hence the name is a nod to the temporary shelters Jews lived in at this time.The holiday also can be translated as Feast of Tabernacles or Festival of Booths.It is one of Judaisms three central pilgrimage festivals - along with Passover and Shavuot.Sukkot is a week-long festival which falls on the th day of Tishrei on the Jewish calendar, five days after Yom Kippur.This year the holiday begins in the evening of Sunday October  and runs up until the evening of Sunday October .Like Easter, its a movable feast which can take place in either September or October.The main holy days fall between Wednesday and Friday night, while the following days are seen as quasi holidays.While, in Israel, they only take one day of holiday.Traditionally, Jews eat all their meals in a festively decorated sukkah during the week of Sukkot.While worshippers should read the Torah every day, and rituals include the Four Species.Its custom to buy a lulavand etrog , and shake them daily throughout the festival.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They had only broken up in the early hours of Thursday morning - still without resolving the remaining obstacles to a deal.The PM was back on a conference call with his crack team in Brussels led by his chief Brexit negotiator David Frost at .am. They went over the sticking points to a deal being struck before Thursdays Brussels summit kicked off and the concessions the EU was still demanding from the UK.These were over the ability for the UK to set dferent VAT rates to the EU and the controversial “Level Playing Field” mechanism that Mr Johnson had so far refused to sign up to because it would require the UK to mirror swathes of EU standards.But before this first conference call of the day had even finished the DUP had thrown its grenade that put the entire deal into doubt by announcing they could not support the proposals. Remarkably, there was no more contact with the DUP as No gave up trying to win them over.But there was little anger towards their Ulster allies. One No official was askedany swear words were exchanged and replied: “No swear words - and I’m usually a sweary person.”On his call with his negotiating team the PM had given them the green light to pave the way for concessions on both the main stumbling blocks when negotiations reopened with the EU. But as he wrapped up the conference call with his officials it still wasn’t clear whether he was going to sign up to a deal before jetting off to Brussels.His next move was to a brief phone call to EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker at . to tell him a deal was in sightthe remaining issues could be overcome. The EU chief told the PM to provide assurances that a new agreement would pass the Commons. Mr Johnson told him he would go away and consult the major players.At .am it was all-systems go as EU countries received copies of the new draft legal text and trade blueprint and were called into an emergency meeting. But the crunch decision to go ahead with the deal despite not having the DUP’s support came during the PM’s conference all with the six members of his EU Exit Strategy Cabinet committee - known as XS.The call with his five fellow Cabinet ministers Sajid Javid, Dominic Raab, Michael Gove, Steve Barclay and Geoffrey Cox ran through the remaining concessions needed to facilitate a deal. As the -minute call came to an end, it was time to make a call - and the PM decided it was time to go for a deal.Shortly before .am he dialled up Mr Juncker for the second time Thursday morning to tell him the good news and the pair “sealed the deal”. The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier was also on the line and the three of them shared jokes as they finally confirmed the deal.The pair agreed to tweet the good news at the same time - but it was Mr Juncker who beat the PM to it by one minute, writing: “Where there is a will, there is a deal - we have one!” This was also the first the DUP knew that the PM had abandoned them.Mr Johnson then hurried to Brussels and went straight into a joint-press statement alongside Mr Juncker at the EU Commission’s Berlaymont building at lunchtime. It was then time to go face-to-face with EU leaders in the Council’s Justis Lipsius building over the road and was seen sharing a joke with Luxembourg PM Xavier Bettel who he had clashed angrily with last month.Mr Johnson faced a grilling from EU leaders - mostly about how he would get the deal through Parliament, and assured them it would pass. But the EU leaders saved their warmest welcome for Mr Barnier when he personally presented the deal to them at the summit.Mr Johnson toasted his Brexit deal with EU leaders over a four-course meal of scallops, sauerkraut, roasted veal and fig puff pastries. Amongst EU diplomats and officials the sense of relief was palpable, following a rollercoaster four days that almost saw the whole thing derailed.Heading into this week talks were at an impasse, with Brussels angered by hostile No  briefings and in despair at the UKs backstop proposals. One senior EU source recalled: “They so unbalanced we didn’t believe they were real”.The bloc believed it was being gamed by Mr Johnson and his chief advisor Dominic Cummings who wanted talks to fail ahead of an election. But on Sunday night EU capitals were suddenly told things were shting rapidly after the PMs breakthrough meeting with Leo Varadkar in the Wirral.There was relief and cautious optimism in No too. Mr Johnson was due to arrive home in the early hours of this morning ready for a day of salesmanship to MPs.Summing up the message they would drum home to MPs over the next  hours, one No official said: “You will never get another moment to deliver on Brexit.”It is thought five could still vote against. The PM has left open the option of removing the whip from them.Some of the hardliners gave his deal a cautious backing.Peter Bone said: “This is vastly better than Theresa May’s deal.” Andrew Bridgen added: “It looks like Brexit, it smells like Brexit — that’s Brexit for me.”ERG deputy leader Mark Francois confirmed the group would make its final decision on Saturday morning.Mr Johnson may also restore the whip to the  MPs he sacked for backing the Brexit-delaying Benn Act.One of them, Sir Nicholas Soames, said: “I think you can assume that the  will by and large vote for the deal.”Sacked rebel Rory Stewart admitted he “got it wrong” when he said the PM would fail to get a deal.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Now MPs will hold a showdown vote on Saturday to decide whether to approve it. The Prime Minister today said the deal was excellent and means the UK leaves whole and entire on October  as  EU leaders prepared to back it. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker added he was happy about the deal - evenhe was sad about Brexit . Yet Boris Johnson is looking down the barrel of a historic Commons defeat on Saturday afternoon after the DUP and Labour both refused to back the new pact. So what does the Withdrawal Agreement actually say and what are the main sticking points  Hereaposs what you need to know.  The deal is based on a new Brexit plan Boris Johnson sent the EU two weeks ago to replace Theresa Mayaposs -page Withdrawal Agreement. Todayaposs -page draft would keep a transition period which continues EU rules in Britain and payments to Brussels, up to  December . But it scraps the Irish backstop, an insurance policy designed at preventing a hard border between Northern Ireland the Republic from  January . In the backstopaposs place would effectively be apostwo bordersapos: Northern Ireland and Britain would share a customs territory - forcing customs checks on goods crossing the -mile border with the Republic.  Northern Ireland and the Republic would share some EU single market rules - forcing checks on manufactured and agricultural products crossing the Irish Sea.   What are the main points  The deal is incredibly complicated but any opposition will boil down to a few main points. Here are the initial details you need to know about the Brexit deal. Customs  Northern Ireland will stay in the UK customs territory - putting goods north of the -mile border under dferent customs rules to the Republic of Ireland. A new set of UK tarfs will be paid on goods imported to the UK from the EU. But no customs duties will be paid on goods crossing the Irish Sea, from Northern Ireland to the rest of the UK and vice versa. That meansthe UK strikes a trade deal, say with the US, US goods can be imported into Northern Ireland just as they are onto the British mainland. But thereaposs a vital exception - EU customs rules will apply to goods entering Northern Ireland that are deemed at risk of moving into the EU at a later date. A set of rules will be drawn up by a joint committee of EU and UK officials before December  to decide how a product is deemed at risk. Factors will include the nature and value of the goods, the nature of movement and the final destination. This will apply to goods whether theyaposre in their original form or not. Sosugar is imported to Belfast, put in a soft drink, then exported to the EU, EU rules apply. No EU tarfs would be paid on personal goods carried by travellers across the Irish border - or on exempted goods for immediate consumption. These would include the hauls from some fishing boats. There will be no customs checks on the island of Ireland - they will be done in ports. Single market rules  Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of EU single market rules - to avoid checks on goods crossing the -mile Irish border. These are: legislation on goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls , rules on agricultural production marketing, VAT and excise in respect of goods, and state aid rules. This means Northern Ireland will have some dferent rules to Britain. And there will be single market checks and controls on the relevant goods when they pass between Northern Irelandand mainland Britain . The EU says there will be border inspection posts to make sure the sanitary and phyto-sanitary controls are carried out correctly. Politicians in Northern Ireland will get a veto on this system - but itaposs controversial. Read more below...  The Northern Ireland Assembly - known as Stormont - will get a vote every four years on whether to let EU law continue in Northern Ireland. The first four-year period begins on  January , so the first vote by Stormont will be in late  - in time for it to come into effect on  January . If Stormont backs EU rules by a simplemajority, the system will continue for four years before another vote. If Stormont backs EU rules by % or more - with a aposdouble lockapos of % of unionists and % of nationalists - it will continue for eight years before another vote. If Stormont rejects EU rules by a simple majority, they will lapse after two years. This sets up a massive showdown with the DUP, because it means EU rules could rule over Northern Ireland despite one side - e.g. unionists - opposing them. Many of the other details are the same as in the original -page Withdrawal Agreement that Theresa May agreed in November . The previously agreed settlement on citizensapos rights after Brexit and Britainaposs orce bill stay as they were. That also goes for a transition period of  months until the end of , which can be extended by one year or two years. In the long term, both sides would aim for an ambitious free-trade agreement after Brexit with no tarfs and unlimited quotas. It comes together with a statement that sides will uphold high standards on environment, climate, workersapos rights and other rules. There are some other less prominent aspects below. EU courts No sources were keen to insist that Britain is out of the European court. But Britain does not necessarily include Northern Ireland - and the document suggests there will still be some European court involvement for the UK. The exact nature of such involvement is unclear but it says: The UK may participate in the proceedings before the Court of Justice of the EU in the same way as a member state. Continued access to EU programmes Britain and the EU will work together to see that the UK can continue to stay part of popular EU programmes like the Erasmus student exchange and Euratomaposs research programme. But Britainaposs membership of those schemes will be subject to conditions set by the EU and subject to fair and appropriate financial contribution - meaning Britain will stay pay into certain EU programmes. Free trade and regulation Both parties have agreed to strike a free trade deal which will combine deep regulatory and customs co-operation. In practice, this means that while Britain and the EU will be technically free to set their own rules, both parties recognise that in key areas - including the regulation of medicines, agricultural products and technical definitions - they will likely strike a deal to effectively mirror one anotheraposs regulations. On key areas such as financial services and fishing, the document says the EU and UK will try and strike deals by July . But British fisherman who have long argued that the EU is strangling their industry will find the Political Declaration light on detail - with the document saying that Britain and the EU will establish a new agreement on...access to waters and quote shares. The EU and UK will both attempt to recognise on anotheraposs financial services regulations as equivalent - but expect fierce negotiations as both Germany and France see profits to be made in companies relocating after Brexit. Government procurement In a blow to many people who believed Brexit would be a chance for the UK to end the practice of EU companies bidding to run UK public services, the Political Declaration declares that any future agreement should provide for mutual opportunities in one another public procurement markets. Level playing field As part of the Political Declaration, the EU and UK have agreed to a level of cooperation on regulations, workers rights and market rules which might cheer Labour MPs looking for an opportunity to support the bill. But promises that any arrangement will prevent distortions of trade and unfair competitive advantages will come as bad news to Tories who believe Britainaposs economic success after Brexit comes from aggressively cutting regulation to undercut the EU and attract global business. What happens now   On Thursday and Friday all  EU leaders meet for a crunch summit in Brussels. Brexit and the deal are top of the agenda. Despite recommendations from the top EU chief Donald Tusk to back the deal, it is subject to the approval of the governments of the  member states at the summit. If passed, it then comes to a vote in Parliament on Saturday ahead of an pm deadline - at the same time as a massive march in London for a second referendum. MPs will either vote on whether to back a dealor to back no deal . Will EU leaders back the deal   Itaposs likely but could be dficult and tortured. For some, the big concern will be approving a deal which is maybe doomed once it has to be voted on by MPs. So they will be keeping a close on the statements of opposition parties - particularly the DUP, who this morning say they still have concerns about the deal. For some EU leaders, like Franceaposs Emmanuel Macron, they may try and force a tougher set of demands on Mr Johnson - but it is likely the deal will survive the negotiations. Will MPs back the deal   MPs will likely vote on the deal in a special sitting of Parliament on Saturday - the first since the Falklands War. The government will likely bring the new Withdrawal Agreement and the political declaration that accompanies it before MPs. But Boris Johnson has a majority of minus  - and thataposs with the DUP. As it stands, even the DUP are likely to vote against as their concerns are not addressed. With them would probably go a relatively small band of Tory Brexiteers. Jeremy Corbyn signalled Labour would vote the deal down, so Mr Johnson can only count on a few backbenchers to make up the numbers. With all that opposition the path to winning in the Commons is very unclear.  Boris Johnson needs to get a deal approved by MPs by pm on Saturday  October. Otherwise, a law called the Benn Act says he must write to the EU in Brussels requesting a three-month delay to Brexit. The government has promised it will obey the law and write that letter. Yet Boris Johnson is also expected to tell EU leaders he doesnapost want a delay and has insisted the UK will leave on October  anyway - deal or no deal.

He will hope that promises on workersapos rights and environmental commitments are enough to convince the signicant number of Labour MPs in Leave seats to vote for it. Ruth Smeeth, who represents Stoke-on-Trent North, told ITV: I want to vote for a deal and it is my intention to vote for a deal, unless Boris has completely undermined workersapos rights, environmental rights and consumer rights. Members of the cross-party group MPs for a Deal are understood to be considering their position. Mr Corbyn, who is in Brussels for a meeting of the Party of European Socialists, hit out at the proposals on Northern Ireland.  He said: This is a day where the Prime Minister seems to have made a deal with the European Union which doesnapost give us the complete freedom of movement between Britain and Ireland because it creates a customs union border down the Irish Sea. As it stands we cannot support this deal.  Also it is unclear whether it has the support of his allies in the DUP, or indeed many of his allies on his own backbenches.  From what we know, it seems the Prime Minister has negotiated an even worse deal than Theresa Mayaposs, which was overwhelmingly rejected.He added:“These proposals risk triggering a race to the bottom on rights and protections: putting food safety at risk, cutting environmental standards and workers’ rights, and opening up our NHS to a takeover by US private corporations.“This sell out deal won’t bring the country together and should be rejected.

Those welcoming this breakthrough would be wise to keep the champagne on ice. The PM is having to scramble for votes to get the agreement through the Commons. We understand people’s frustration and the wish to see the back of Brexit. But just because there is an appetite to \u2028get it sorted does not mean it should be \u2028done at any price. If you had waited three years to get on the housing ladder you would not snap up the only property available regardless of the price or the state of the brickwork. Having worn down the public’s patience the PM is cynically assuming people will swallow any deal in their desperation to get Brexit done.    Poorer On offer is a Tory deal written in the darkest of blue inks. It will make the country poorer and threatens jobs and livelihoods. Worse still, it will allow the Conservatives to roll back hard-won protections for workers and paves the way for American firms to sell us hormone-raised beef and chlorinated chicken and to enter the NHS.

People have come to sing and worship here for over , years. But today’s choir are linked by a dferent modern institution – the foodbank. Britain’s first foodbank choir are not singing for their supper, but raising awareness of the End Hunger UK campaign. And there’s also something deeper at work – the solidarity of song. Jacqui, a -year-old mum of three, says she used to think choirs weren’t for people like her. “When I was younger, I really struggled, I know what it’s like not to be able to buy enough food for your kids,” she says.    “I caught my daughter trying to pull her tooth out once – she said she wanted to get £ from the tooth fairy so she could give it to me. How heartbreaking is that ” Toni Lawless, , is performing a solo today. “I’ve been homeless myself in the past, so I know what it’s like to be hungry,” she says.As the choir sing an emotional song about going hungry, Jamie Davies holds up a homemade banner that simply says “ Universal Credit isn’t working”.The Bishop of Sheffield, the Right Revd Dr Pete Wilcox, says: “It is an outrage that in our United Kingdom – one of the most prosperous nations on Earth, one of the most prosperous nations in history – hundreds of ­thousands of people every week live in food poverty, unable to feed themselves in a way that is healthy and reliable and which does not involve making fundamental choices between food and clothing, food and fuel, food and shelter.” Backed by dozens of protests including at an orchard in Cornwall, a Welsh castle, the Peterloo Monument in Manchester and Tower Bridge in London, the End Hunger UK coalition is calling for a Government-led plan across all departments to free millions from hunger.    Meanwhile, Trussell Trust figures show half of the public has taken action themselves on hunger in the last  months, with more than a third donating to a foodbank. The Government is sadly lagging behind the electorate, doing nothing to help the issues repeatedly shown to cause UK hunger – a torn and brutalised welfare system and poverty wages. “Hunger in the UK isn’t about food. It’s about money, and people not having enough of it,” says Emma Revie, chief executive of the Trussell Trust. Niall Cooper, chairman of End Hunger UK, puts it another way: “The UK has no shortage of food. The problem is one of incomes.” The moving and hopeful Food Glorious Food choir symbolises some of the contradiction of our national hunger crisis. Foodbanks exist because the ‘Big Society’ has been deliberately used to replace Britain’s social safety net. But, while they shouldn’t exist, they are often extraordinary and le-changing – providing not just food, but often a new family.    A few days, ago, we caught up with the choir at rehearsals at the Gleadless Estate, home to , residents and a well-used foodbank. Cradling his baby daughter Olivia, Jamie was singing Let It Be. Like many beside him – mums, pensioners, neighbours, friends – he never thought he’d perform in public. “I love singing and so does my daughter,” he said. “She never stops trying to join in.” He and his partner, Madison, , moved to Sheffield when Olivia was just  days old. They didn’t know anyone, and while they were getting settled were transferred over to Universal Credit. Like lots of families they were left struggling on £ child benefit a week. Then a leaflet advertising the local foodbank came through the letterbox. “They fed us, gave us baby food, nappies, even a buggy, but more than that we got to know everyone, we met all these lovely people,” Jamie said. “Using a foodbank, it doesn’t make you feel good, you feel ashamed. But singing is the opposite, it makes you feel like a dferent person, like you’ve got more to offer.” Mum Clare Day, , visits the foodbank as a service user and a volunteer. A former retail worker, she now relies on disability benefits. “Like a lot of people, after I’d paid all my bills I didn’t always have enough for food,” she said.

Unsuspecting Nigel Graham, , bought the swine, named Grace, as an alternative to a cat or dog because his we Sam, , is allergic to fur. He was told by her unnamed seller that she was a miniature pig who would weigh no more than lbs when fully grown. But five years later Grace now tips the scales at an astonishing  stone and munches her way through £-worth of food every week. She grew so big the couple decided to move her into the back garden - but the house-trained pig had other ideas.    Grace did not fancy staying outside in the cold and instead chills out on the living room sofa. She uses a giant ‘pig-flap’ which had to be cut into the back door of their three-bedroom cottage to go outside for the toilet. Dad-of-two Nigel, of Malvern, Worcs, said: “Her parents were about knee high, which is the actual size of a fully grown micro-pig. “She was meant to remain small but she’s just kept on growing and growing. “I built her an outdoor hutch - Graceland - but she’s only spent two nights there ever as she likes to be warm and dry. “She lives as a house pig, spending her time on the sofa or sleeping on her bed in the kitchen, keeping warm in front of the radiator.    “She did sleep upstairs when she was younger on a double orthopaedic mattress but she’s too large for the stairs. “It’s a nightmare getting her outside - I have to tempt her with treats. “She’s just like a dog, loving lots of cuddles and belly rubs and she whines at the backdoor when she wants to go out to use the toilet. “It’s great when people come in to our house, not knowing about Grace -their reactions are priceless.” Grace, who is now fully grown, eats three meals a day and her favourite food is rice pudding and prawn crackers. Nigel added: “Bacon was my favourite meat but since Grace has joined the family, we don’t eat it anymore as it just wouldn’t feel right.    “She is quite spoilt and for dinner she will have rice pudding with jelly or tinned peaches or pineapple. “Sheaposs particular though,it has a bruise or a grub in it or something like that, she wonapost have it and will turn her nose up at it. “She is not interested in carrots anymore, itaposs just too boring for her.

Community toilets and a field for a pet dog are among the surprising items National Lottery winners have bought with their cash windfalls. How some lucky winners spent their winners is revealed in a photo exhibition to mark the th anniversary of the National Lottery.

Mr Banfield, , and his -year-old we, who won £,, on Lotto in February , said: Weaposre still in the house we lived in for  years, and the Winterbourne Community Centre has been a hub of our lives here.

When we read that it needed new toilets, we donated £, for the work - and cut the ribbon outside the Ladies and Gents ourselves at an official ceremony! The couple, who also funded new windows with their donation, added: We joined a lunch at the centre last week and a man got up to use the loo. He said, aposIaposm just off to use the Banfieldsapos, which really made our day! Faye Davies, , and husband Richard, , from Brecon, Wales, won £ million on EuroMillions in June  and spent £, on a field for their dog Lucy.    We found Lucy running up the road, starving and terried. She had been abandoned on the mountainside a week earlier, and we took her home just for the weekend. Within a day, she had a name, and we knew we couldnapost hand her into a dog home. But she was terried of people, of other dogs and water, so dog walks were a nightmare. Then, weeks after our win, a half-acre field came up for sale just down the road. We bought it for Lucy and this became her safe place for walkies. Sheaposs so happy and carefree running around there - and this emaciated, scared dog has now learned how to play. Now we also have a Labrador puppy, Khaleesi, so they run together every day in aposLucyaposs Fieldapos.    Retired Army warrant officer Ken Wedgeworth, , moved from the Midlands to the foot of Loch Ryan, Scotland, with fiancee Jannette, , after winning £ million on EuroMillions in November . We set off to house hunt in Ireland after our win and stopped for the night at Portpatrick, arriving at the hotel in darkness.

I think being part of this family, in this role, in this job, every single time I see a camera, every single time I hear a click, every single time I see a flash it takes me straight back so in that respect it’s the worst reminder of her le as opposed to the best. The prince went on to say that while the trip to Angola had been emotional, he was constantly reminded of his mother wherever he was.  In the lead up to the -day tour, which finished in Johannesburg, Prince Harry said he was very excited to introduce Meghan and their son Archie to the place he describes as his second home.

Promoters have welcomed the move as an opportunity for other producers who have access to a wider range of talent.One large firm, which spoke to the Tele on the condition of anonymity, said: “This is a very big positive#this is about partnership with promoters, and building bridges.”DF Concerts, the firm behind T In The Park and TRNSMT, is staging Bombay Bicycle Club, Bfy Clyro and the Libertines gigs at the Caird Hall before the year is out and previously expressed an interest in Slessor Gardens.The council’s approach to promoters comes after poor sales of tickets for recent shows.The latest gig at Slessor, DunDee s, failed to pull in as many punters as previous acts such as Little Mix, Olly Murs and Steps.There was criticism over scheduling of the s show as it was on the same date as a Madness gig in Montrose, which had been announced months beforehand.And Craig David’s Slessor summer show was moved to the Caird Hall, which has a quarter of the garden’s capacity.LHG claimed the move was due to “unforeseen circumstances”.Concertgoers were also angry after cut-price tickets were offered on discount website Itison just weeks after full-price briefs went on sale.Dundee City Council declined to expand on why it was now approaching other promoters, instead reissuing the same statement it provided to the Tele earlier this year.It said: “There is no long-term agreement or exclusivity agreement in place for Slessor Gardens with any promoters.“The council is continuing to carefully consider the future of the space as a venue.”Meanwhile, LHG, which previously said discussions had been “ongoing” regarding exclusivity, said it would “not be appropriate” to comment on discussions about future shows in Dundee.A spokeswoman said: “We remain committed to working with Dundee City Council and the city’s key stakeholders to realise our joint aspiration in ensuring Dundee remains a culturally vibrant and economically sustainable city.“We firmly believe a series of high quality, safe and appropriate concerts on Slessor Gardens is a key driver to help achieve this.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/03/barry-smith.jpg ","title":"dundee legend barry smith appointed assistant manager to jim weir at forfar","story":"Barry Smith has been appointed assistant manager at Forfar after boss Jim Weir decided to make changes to his coaching staff.The former Dundee, Aldershot, East Fe, Raith Rovers and Brechin City manager will bring a wealth of coaching and management experience to his new role and takes up the post with immediate effect.Following discussions, Gary Irvine has agreed to concentrate on his playing role at the League One club and long-serving Barry Sellars will be stepping aside from his coaching role and leaving Station Park.Sellars joined the club in a playing capacity under Ian McPhee nearly  years ago and, apart from a four-year spell back with home-town club Arbroath and one season up at Peterhead, he has served the Loons well in both a playing and coaching capacity since and has been a popular figure around the club.Weir has been hit by a further injury blow with midfielder Murray MacKintosh joining Dale Hilson and Andy Jackson on the sidelines after the ankle injury he picked up at Dumbarton in the Loons’ last outing failed to respond to treatment.MacKintosh has been ruled out for several weeks, while striker Hilson is to go for a scan on the leg injury he suffered against Falkirk a month ago and fellow-frontman Jackson is still recovering from a severe concussion.“Unfortunately, injuries appear to be a feature of this season so far,” Weir said.“Murray’s one is the latest and it will be a few weeks until I have a full squad available.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/5d9c514cede9f2.53093169-752x564.jpg ","title":"ex michelin employees among those who are attending dundee foodbanks","story":"Former Michelin workers are among thousands across the city turning to foodbanks just to feed their families.As part of Challenge Poverty Week, the Tele visited the Dundee Foodbank in Stobswell to meet volunteers behind the scenes as well as those struggling to make ends meet who depend on the service.And one man, who declined to be named, admitted he had been forced to turn to the Trussell Trust for help after being made redundant from the tyre factory. vw, px\"  He said: “I lost my job at Michelin and I ended up desperate.“It was just awful and I can hardly describe the feeling after being in work for so many years to be let go and not find anything at my age.“I heard about the foodbank at Stobswell and walked in here and, really, it was a godsend.”The Michelin factory in Dundee is due to close in , with the loss of  jobs.

He captained Scotland Under-s this week to a - win over Germany to book a Euro Championship elite qualying spot.Aberdeen have secured just one victory from the last five games and exited the League Cup quarter-finals via a penalty shoot-out loss away to Hearts.Sitting fourth in the table they are already nine points behind leaders Rangers after eight games.Askedhe was confident he has built a squad to bring progression, McInnes said: “Yes, I am. We put a squad together in the summer that we felt can meet the demands.“We spent £,on doing that. However, I have been more or less without Bryson, who was there to replace Graeme Shinniewho was a key player.“I thought we lacked experience and leadership on the pitch at Ibrox. Having Bryson back will help matters.“Ojo we are going to be without until January which is disappointing as I brought him in to be an important player for us.“He was clearly going to be that for me.“Against Rangers I had eight players out and five of them would probably have started.“That is half the outfield starting team.“That makes things a lot more dficult.

It is exactly in line with our vision of improving primary care by allowing GPs to focus their skills where they add most value and allowing patients to be seen at the right time by the right person.”The new, £. million facility, which includes a dental surgery and community maternity unit, will accommodate an estimated , patients in its  consulting rooms within five years, doubling that of the previous GP practice.Ms Sturgeon met Jonny and Yolanda Smith from Newmachar and their eight-month-old baby boy, Cruz – the first baby born at the facility’s new maternity unit.Yolanda, , said it was “nervewracking” to meet the leader of the country with her son.She said: “It’s really nice to be asked back. It was a bit nervewracking when you have no idea how he’s going to react but it went well.”The mum-of-two, who also has a daughter, Aaliyah, said her experience of the new unit had been “amazing”, adding she recommends it to anyone who has the chance to use it.She said: “It was such a nice experience and so relaxed.“Everything was straight- forward as well.”The First Minister also met little Lucy Sophia McDonald, who was born on Sunday night.Parents Miriam Gordon, , and Ross McDonald, , who live in Stoneywood, said they were told by the midwe yesterday morning that they might have a special visitor.Miriam also said she had an “amazing” experience at the new unit.She said: “I had a completely natural birth and didn’t have gas and air or anything. Everything was perfect.”Meanwhile, the First Minister also viewed construction progress at the £m Inverurie Community Campus, due to open in April .After touring the facilities, Ms Sturgeon said: “The new Inverurie Community Campus will be a massive boost for the town, giving young people state-of-the art, world-class facilities in which to learn.”Once complete, the campus will be home to Inverurie Academy and St Andrew’s School, extensive community sports and leisure facilities such as a six-lane swimming pool, multi-use games area and two all-weather pitches."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column september 6 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe do not profess to be experts, but the costs involved in renewing  miles of power transmission lines, along with pylons and substation # plus the removal of what was there before # must be astronomical.What would be the problem for SSEN Transmission to look at burying the line passing across the Tarbert isthmus, or even laying a shortof subsea cable under the upper reaches of West Loch Tarbert  It may have been costed based on the published design, but the money involved, relative to the whole project, would surely be negligible.The company states no #formal objections# were received and that it will #do all it can# to minimise the visual impact.

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible.

Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee. The aim is to transfer all serious patients to one of these centres following pre-hospital emergency care within  minutes.The value of a helicopter air ambulance is therefore obvious.Working alongside the Scottish Ambulance Service#s air fleet, SCAA relies entirely on public donations to keep this vital resource flying.Please consider supporting SCAA in it#s le-saving work during a week when the country focuses on the crucial work of air ambulances everywhere.For further information please visit www.scaa.org.ukDavid Craig, chief executive, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance , Perth AirportSir,I get a magazine called #Clean Slate#.In it this month is an article where a -year-old girl, Greta Thunberg, along with  other youth activists, have issued this invitation to adults around the world: #Starting on Friday September  we are going to kick-start a week of climate action, with a world-wide strike for the climate.

She also spoke at the elite gathering of business leaders in Davos and at the UN.In March , school strikes took place in more than , cities around the world.

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction.

The journey then moved through Schumann and into Brahms where the audience murmured in agreement at the rollercoaster of emotions before us.As we reached Wolf the themes took a darker turn in a short but intense piece about crying tears of blood. Swtly moving onto Strauss and Mahler the audience were given songs of simple love, a sing off between a cuckoo and a nightingale and a man in great pain which reigned the audience in with a spiritual lull.The second half opened with a stunning rendition of Faure’s #Apres Un Reve#. Through Debussy’s impressionist piece, Rinaldo Hahn’s Operatic journey and into Du Parc comforting his love with a dream like harp created by the piano.The duo then gave us a contemporary piece by Joseph Horowitz which comprised of snippets from the monologues of Shakespeare’s Lady Macbeth and the music tracks her descent into madness. It was aAs a light and fun ending we were given #I can be a sexy lady#, a piece about poor mezzos and how they always play boys and not much  in operas. I highly recommend you Youtube it for a bit of light entertainment.The partnership between the two is one I have not seen all that often and you can tell that they really enjoy working together."},{"url":null,"title":"september festival fun for soccer kids","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowIt was a busy September for kids from Red Star youths, with teams attending festivals at Haldaneand Lochnell thanks to sponsorship from Ardrishaig Community Trust and Ventient Energy A’Chruach Community Fund.Almost  kids headed off to Alexandria in early September for the popular and competitive Haldane festival playing against new teams from across the West of Scotland.Lochgilphead were represented by teams at , ,  and  age groups with each working hard and testing themselves against some really good teams.

John Kennedy played the ball between the penalty spot and the D where Allan MacDonald let the ball run across his body before turning and blasting home, giving Cameron Sutherland no chance in the Oban goal.There were harsh words in the Oban Camanachd dressing room at half-time and revamp saw Keith MacMillan replace Gary McKerracher whilst the forward line switched to a three-one formation with Andrew MacCuish on the D.The switches paid idends when the home side drew level just four minutes into the second half when Daniel MacCuish ran forward and Daniel MacVicar volleyed the ball into the net to make it -.Oban Camanachd took the lead on  minutes when Andrew MacCuish’s turn and shot flew past the keeper.Just a couple of minutes later, Andrew MacCuish turned provider as he found Scott MacMillan who finished with a low drive from the left although his effort may have taken a slight deflection.Two of the game’s best young goalkeepers were on show, and Inveraray’s Scott MacLachlan saved his side from a bigger defeat though Oban Camanachd did have to rely on Cameron Sutherland who made good saves near the end from Garry MacPherson and Allan MacDonald.The win for Oban Camanachd means that they and Kyles are the only sides, other than championship favourites Kingussie, in the title race as the season moves into the closing stages."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column october 11 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowACHA tenantIt has been a while since we carried a story where a tenant has a complaint about a housing association property.

These are big, old oaks.Appearing in support of the application, Gavin Yuill, of Galashiels-based Camerons Architects, said: ldquoIn relation to the design and placemaking, the one-and-a-half storey houses proposed are the most common house type in the rural Scottish Borders and in Minto village.ldquoThe two nearest neighbouring houses are both one-and-a-half storey, the set back of both proposed houses is consistent with the street and the stone, wet dash rendered walls, timber cladding, timber windows and doors, natural slate roofs and metal gutters are all consistent with the high-quality materials used in traditional Minto village.ldquoThe overwhelming number of retained trees, the replacement of all lost trees, and substantial new screen and hedge planting will reinforce the existing habitats and ensure that the bioersity is maximised.ldquoThese are demonstrated by the proposed landscaping drawings provided with the application.Also appearing in support of the applicant was Tim Ferguson, of Galashiels-based Ferguson Planning.He told the committee: ldquoA review of the housing analysis into the forthcoming local development plan again shows the signicant benefits windfall sites of this nature can have in meeting housing delivery targets.ldquoThe delivery of the annual housing targets are short of where they require to be and thusproposals of this nature will assist in meeting local needs.ldquoA signicant amount of housing within the Scottish Borders is met via small developments and self-build and indeed has occurred where within the confines of Mintorsquos settlement.ldquoThis subject site falls within the settlement boundary of Minto and is clearly in compliance with related planning policy principles and which has no defined restrictions upon it.Councillors also heard that planning officers are recommending the application be approved, subject to conditions.Galashiels councillor Sandy Aitchison said: ldquoMuch is made by the objectors that the buildings are not in keeping with Minto, yet the report from officers says that there are no two buildings the same in the village.ldquoTo be honest, they look okay to me but Irsquod need to see them in the context of what is already there.ldquoThe houses already there donrsquot look hugely architecturally important to me but perhaps Irsquom a Philistine.Members of the committee agreed to conduct a site visit, and to reconsider the application at the next meeting of the planning and building standards committee, which is due to meet on Monday, November ."},{"url":null,"title":"planned-early-years-centre-given-go-ahead","story":"COUNCIL planners have approved proposals to extend St Ronanrsquos Primary School in Innerleithen.Scottish Borders Council wants to construct a single-storey extension on the school, in order to meet demand generated by the Scottish Governmentrsquos decision to increase entitlement to free early learning and childcare provision.The new space will cater for  children, with  spaces allocated to two to three year olds, and  space set aside for three to five year olds.The plans will also see the relocation of the existing play area, a pumping station and water tank, and fenced nursery garden.A design statement, submitted by the councilrsquos in-house architect, reads: ldquoAccessibility and inclusivity have been a key focus during the design development.ldquoThe provision will be universally accessible and will offer a high-quality learning environment for the children and teaching staff.ldquoThe proposal has been developed to meet current and future teaching with the primary focus being on teaching spaces that are flexible and adaptive to cater for a iety of needs and learning experiences.ldquoThe design ethos has been simplied to provide a hierarchy of spaces from the two to three year oldrsquos playroom up to the three to five year oldrsquos playrooms with intermittent shared activity spaces in-between.ldquoLarge bi-folding doors within the play areas creates easy passage between the indoors and outdoors, encouraging independence and providing additional learning opportunities.ldquoA large canopy running theof the building strengthens the pedagogy of a seamless transition between the spaces and enables children to stay outdoors in wet weather conditions.ldquoFurthermore, it minimises solar gain during sunny weather.

Perceptive, spirited and loving.\"Photographer Allan, who has been publishing his work since the s, spent decades in locations such as Vietnam, Morocco, Libya and Australia to produce unforgettable images.Since ing home earlier this year he has released photographic titles, Vintage Tractors and Scotlands Islands, before putting the final shots together for Edinburgh.Allan admits that Gerdas involvement has taken the publication to a new level. He said: \"My initial concept was to produce a comparatively modest format, aimed at the photographically conscious visitor.\"By good fortune however, in engaging with Gerda as co-author, the scope and spirit of the work has been widened and deepened.\"The poems featured in this book have interacted with my images penetrating the veneer that can often dominate the city.\"All those prestigious castings and fine masonry may, collectively, have created one of Europersquos most beautul cities, but there were struggles in its making, and so often a human price was paid.\"I hope, therefore, it proves thought provoking at the very least.Gerda, who is an award-winning actor, songwriter and director as well as a writer, added: \"This has been a fascinating and welcome collaboration ndash an opportunity to reacquaint myself with my beloved home city, and its many contradictions.\"Irsquove relished both the process of responding to Allanrsquos vibrant images, and the way in which the project unexpectedly developed: finding myself writing additional poems about aspects of the city which Allan then went out to photograph.\"The journey towards finding a visual and poetic narrative

Assisted by Scott Souden’s low cross from the left flank, the substitute striker guided a delightful flick into the net beyond the Glynhill keeper. Taking on the role of target-man with gusto, Radecki played a big part in the Feathers-sponsored Pupils’ fourth goal, when he held off a defender down the right wing and crossed to substitute Calum McKillop, whose back-heel flick found Souden at the penalty spot, and the -year-old winger, making the journey home from Edinburgh for a game, passed the ball into the net with ease to complete the scoring.The game became a procession in the closing minutes with man-of-the-match Crossan, the midfield linchpin alongside the impressive Liam Renton, orchestrating some controlled possession football, but there was some trouble on  minutes when a malicious foul on ex-Dumbarton man D McCallum sparked into a melee with players from both sides involved. It resulted in a second booking for Kenny Kerr, a yellow for J McCallum, and a red card for the original Glynhill culprit, as well as yellow for the visiting keeper from referee Jimmy Litster, after charging from his own goalmouth to become involved.Undeterred, the Pupils settled back down to seal a richly deserved victory,achieved through a disciplined and determined performance.The Kintyre Park side will now enjoy a free week, with ato action scheduled for Saturday October , opponent to be confirmed.For fixture updates, and to see second-half action and goals from last Saturday’s match, see Campbeltown Football on Facebook, or @PupilsAFC on Twitter."},{"url":null,"title":"weather wont play fair for men","story":"Strong winds, for most of the players, deflected several balls into the severe rough and out of bounds and pushed scores upwards.Robert Shaw, one of the first out in the morning ballot, had an excellent round to finish on a nett  from Ken MacMillan on nett .The wind continued in the afternoon but didn#t deter John Docherty from the best scratch score of the day.

However, it was the home side that took the lead on the nd minute when Ashfield’s centre forward cut in from the left before sending an unstoppable shot in to the top corner.A test of character was required from the boys as they fell behind and with five minutes of the half remaining they were rewarded after a corner dropped to Stuart Phillps in the box. The young forward adjusted his feet quickly to send a beautul curling shot past everyone to make it -.Fteen minutes into the second half the Pupils took the lead. New signing Raphael MacLachlan, playing in only his second appearance for the s, sent in a delightful whipped corner that brushed off the Ashfield centre-half into the goal to make it -. The Clachan youngster can be proud of his impact on the game and is already proving to be a valuable addition to the team.As the Pupils pressed for their third of the game a long ball evaded the defence to allow the Ashfield number  in again to equalise with  minutes remaining.As the game drew to a close, it looked like both sides would share the points until a dramatic final minute. A long clearance by Ashfield was misjudged by the Pupils defence to allow Ashfield’s player in with a chance of his hat-trick but the youngster scuffed his shot into thankful hands of Pupils goal-keeper Lorne Paterson.Knowing it was the final minute, Paterson tried to kick the ball up the field as quickly as possible only for it to cannon off the back of Euan O’May’s head! It landed back in Paterson’s hands and he quickly dispersed the ball, long up the field where the ball bounced high over everyone, only for Calum Ellis to nip in front of the Ashfield centre-half, run in on goal, calmly round the advancing goal-keeper and stroke the ball home to make it - to the Ardshield Hotel-sponsored side – much to the delight of his fellow team mates and coaches.Ellis who has now scored seven goals in the Under s# opening four games.This weekend the team will enjoy a free fixture due before playing at home to Glasgow Boys Club on Sunday October ."},{"url":null,"title":"mcfadyens amam a tremendous days golf","story":"It was one of sponsor McFadyen Contractors Ltd#s own teams that won the trophy with a tremendous score of  # a mighty  under par.

The prize he truly covets, of course, isa majority in parliament whether that happens off the back of a deal or no-deal is a mere moot point to this reckless PM.Despite a move to substantive negotiations, there is still no guarantee that a deal can or will be struck with the EU. ButMr Johnson does manage to wrest an agreement that the EU and Ireland can live with ndash one which will, in yet another surreal and eye-rolling twist to the Brexit debacle, basically be Theresa Mayrsquos deal all over again ndash it creates a dilemma for the opposition parties.How should they respond to a potentially dangerous situation wherein the PM gleefully passes the buck to MPs, daring them not to raty his deal as the clock ominously ticks down, setting up the next play in his intellectually bankrupt but politically expedient blame game Yet again, Nicola Sturgeon has shown sense and leadership by making clear that her MPs will not vote for it. Why would they  Ms Sturgeon has been consistent from the outset: her party will not vote for any deal that takes Scotland and the UK out of the single market and customs union, causing untold damage to the Scottish economy. And since the current prime minister favours a harder, more isolationist and ideologically right-wing Brexit than even that fashioned by Mrs May, it is surely incumbent upon all UK opposition parties to fight tooth and nail to save the country from such a disastrous and isive path.Thatrsquos why they have no option but to vote down Mr Johnsonrsquos deal and force a general election, the circumstances of which will be vital in determining how it can be framed. After all, itrsquos not just Mr Johnsonrsquos tenure that must be keep short, but his list of options.The Lib Dems under Jo Swinson wonrsquot vote for any deal, not least because ldquogetting Brexit done would render their new \"stop Brexit altogether\" mandate redundant. And though itrsquos perhaps inevitable that some of the rebel Tories sitting on opposition benches might end up voting for the PMrsquos dealothers might decide to stick it to their former party and put the interests of the country first, especially since they are likely to lose their jobs anyway.

Would they be that stupid  I fear they would. It would be a cruel but perhaps not unexpected ironyLabour enabled a devastating hard Brexit to be foisted upon our poorest people.There is, as yet, no deal to put to parliament.

The UK Supreme Court had earlier ruled that secession was illegal, and that by supporting it, the Scottish Government, which has been disbanded, had committed a crime equivalent to a declaration of war against the UKThe European Union has refused to comment on the imprisonment of the Scottish nationalists. A Brussels official said it was ldquoan internal matter for the United Kingdom...Incredible  Fantasy  Of course. We donrsquot behave like that in Britain ndash at least we hope not. But thatrsquos exactly what has happened in Spain. For the first time since the death of the fascist dictator General Franco, elected politicians have been seized, tried and imprisoned, with draconian sentences, for the crime of democracy. For organising a peaceful referendum in .:Protests erupt as Spain convicts leading Catalan separatistsThe democratically-elected Catalan President, Carles Puigdemont, is in Belgium fighting attempts by the Madrid state to extradite him. Nine Catalan politicians and independence activists have been sentenced in Madrid to between nine and  years for the archaic crimes of sedition and disobedience. The government of Catalonia, elected in a free and fair election, has been suppressed.The Catalan independence movement, like its counterpart in Scotland, has been entirely peaceful and democratic. Yet it has been subjected to some of the worst police violence seen in Europe for decades. Approaching , demonstrators were injured during the suppression of voting in . Another  independistas were injured on Monday.The European Union appears to have washed its hands of Catalonia. Brussels regards it as an internal matter. The outspoken Guy Verhofstadt, who has not been slow to comment on the ldquointernal affairs of authoritarian countries from Hungary to Hong Kong, has been silent on the most egregious violation of basic civil rights seen in Europe since the creation of the EU.The EU is supposed to uphold the European Convention on Human Rights. Its own Charter of Fundamental Rights includes, under Article , on political freedom: ldquothe right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association at all levels, in particular in political, trade union and civic matters.The imprisonment of elected politicians, who have never incited violence, is an offence against every citizen of the EU. These sentences should be overturned in the European Court of Justice in Strasbourg, and hopefully, they will be.But today there needs to be more than head-shaking by leaders of other EU countries. Politicians who routinely condemn Vladimir Putin seem unable to see the hypocrisy in failing to condemn Madrid. Liberal newspapers like theshow their ambivalence by reporting the fate of Catalan political prisoners as ldquoa warning to Scottish nationalists.Seriously  A warning of what, precisely  They are surely not suggesting that an unlawful Scottish referendum could result in anything remotely similar.:Former Catalan leader Oriol Junqueras jailed over independence referendumWhat should be deeply worrying to the UK Left is that the imprisonment of the Catalan independistas has been condoned by the Socialist Prime Minister of Spain, Pedro Sanchez. The reason: he canrsquot interfere with the law of the land. One hopes that the silence from Mr Corbyn does not indicate any solidarity with Mr Sanchezrsquos rigid adherence to undemocratic laws.Indeed, Spain is a lesson for radical politicians in the UK not to place too much faith in the efficacy of Supreme Courts. Those at the SNP conference whorsquove been talking about pursuing independence through the courts should take note. The law is politics by other means, and Supreme Courts are supremely political institutions.The fact that Lady Hale gave Boris Johnson short shrt over proroguing parliament doesnrsquot mean that the Supreme Court is going to be kind to Scottish nationalism. In , the UK Supreme Court dismissed out of hand the Sewel Convention ndash the right of Holyrood to withhold consent to any laws passed by Westminster that cut across the powers of the Scottish parliament. When the chips are down, the UK Supreme Court will always see the integrity of the United Kingdom as its first priority.:Letters: The EU needs to help Spain and Catalonia find peaceThe same goes for Brussels. Ms Sturgeon has condemned the behaviour of the Spanish government, but she should also be making clear her discontent with the EU. Brussels is deeply ambivalent about state repression, whether in France against the Gilet Jaunes, or against the Catalans in Spain. Even when the UK is out of the EU, it is naiumlve to expect that Brussels will necessarily support Scotlandit comes to a constitutional breakdown with Westminster.These are dark times. All the more so because of the double standards of liberal opinion in the UK. We continually hear warnings about impending fascism in Britain. Columnists warn about the threat to democracy from Tommy Robinson, from Boris Johnson, from Brexiters. But here is real fascist repression taking place right now in one of the largest countries in the European Union.Itrsquos time for European governments to condemn this wilful regression to authoritarianism. The Spanish state should be diplomatically shunned by the British Government until it releases these political prisoners, just as countries like Russia are shunned. Madrid must be made to realise that this kind of repression cannot succeed.By reviving the spirit of Franco in st century Europe, Spain has squandered any sympathy for its centralist cause. It is legitimate to argue against Catalan independence it is legitimate to fight elections opposing it. But by breaking heads, dismissing elected governments and then imprisoning peaceful politicians, Madrid has acted in defiance of international law. And it has made the case for Catalan independence unanswerable."},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  A chance to make history but the Booker judges blew it","story":"I doubt the Booker organisers are so ecstatic. Since its inception in , the award has only twice before been shared. First was in , when Nadine Gordimer and Stanley Middleton were twinned, and again in , with Michael Ondaatje and Barry Unsworth. After that regrettable outcome, whereby both writersrsquo thunder was stolen, the rules were changed, vetoing this ever happening again.During rsquos final meeting, Florence and his team ndash Liz Calder, Xiaolu Guo, Afua Hirsch and Joanna McGregor ndash were reluctant or unable to make a clear-cut decision. Asking for advice, they were reminded of the rules. Gaby Wood, of the Booker Prize Foundation, reported that, ldquoThey were not so much ided as unwilling to jettison any more when they finally got down to two, and askedthey might split the prize between them. On being told that it was definitively against the rules, the judges held a further discussion and chose to flout them. They left the judging room happy and proud...Should they be proud  I donrsquot think so. That rule was in place to prevent exactly what is already happening. The impact on an author of winning this prestigious title can be dramatic, as last yearrsquos laureate, Anna Burns, made clear in her speech to the literati in Londonrsquos glitzy medieval Guildhall. Gaining the imprimatur of the Booker brings a blaze of international attention, and a Himalayan spike in sales that no sensible novelist would dare dream of, for fear of waking up to the grim reality of meagre royalties that make the living wage look like a Euro Lottery windfall.Margaret Atwood, a previous winner, hinted as much when accepting the accolade. More than anyone, she understands the stakes. This was attention she does not need, her career already illustrious, and she was gracious in acknowledging that. Perhaps she also knows The Testaments isnrsquot in the same class as some of her earlier work. It is not one of the best books Irsquove read this year, although one that is ndash Lucy Ellmannrsquos Ducks, Newburyport, which was shortlisted ndash was a strong contender for first place.Atwood, to my mind, was given her share of the trophy because of the hype around her long-awaited follow-up and its cult following, thanks in large part to the recent television series. But even had it been her finest novel yet, the judges have been cruel to Bernardine Eisto. She is the first black woman to win, a good news story by any standards. That triumph should have been shouted from the rooftops. What a great statement it would have been for her to have been selected, head and shoulders above the rest. Instead, a  that consisted of four women and one man did a disservice to a writer who deserved the full glory, and the full commercial boost, that this distinction brings.The make-up of the judging  is interesting, reflecting the need for greater ersity, and less male dominance, in literary decision-making. And yet this predominantly female group, drawn from a iety of backgrounds and disciplines, blew it. What might have been a historic moment, representing a signicant cultural turning point, has had its impact blunted, its signicance diminished.The reasoning behind this is hard to understand. With five members, it cannot be impossible to have a majority for one particular title. A resolute chair would usually insist on that, gradually eliminating books to reach a single choice. Previous judges have spoken of the angst and turmoil in that final meeting, as the clock ticks down to the ceremony that evening. Last-minute deals are struck, compromises conceded, arguments clinched. For the chair especially, blood pressure mounts at the thought of facing the cameras with a speech when as yet no name has been picked.The reasons for deciding the award on the day of the ceremony are obvious: fear of a leak ruining the live announcement. Yetit is possible to sign waivers in order to get hold of embargoed books ahead of publication, as happened with The Testaments, which was shrouded in Harry Potter-style secrecy, Bookerrsquos organisers can surely bind the judges to keep their choice under wraps overnight. If the final meeting could instead be held without a gun to the head, in itself a form of literary roulette, cooler heads and better counsel would prevail. Perhaps, like a jury in a murder trial, the five could be holed up incommunicado in a hotel until the award night arrives. Better still, they could simply promise to say nothing and then, for the space of  hours, keep their word. How novel would that be What this split decision suggests is that in the judgesrsquo minds, the entire shortlist was worthy of the prize, and they wanted to show as little favouritism as they could. Yet what is the point of a le-changing pound, rewardnot to anoint a standout victor  In effect, this attitude is an echo of the ideology that says we are all successes, and nobody should ever be declared a runner-up or loser in a race or an exam. By insisting on a double honour, ostensibly for big-hearted reasons, the judges have in fact ducked the tough responsibility with which they were charged.Whatever its impact on Atwood and Eisto, this two-hander feels horribly, tediously familiar. Just picture the scene, as the adjudication meeting dragged on for hours. Indecision, a mounting sense of impasse, endless, increasingly feverish discussions, and a leader who could not or would not break the deadlock. After this, a last-ditch soliciting of professional opinion, followed by a flagrant breaking of the rules. In this sense, at least, Booker rsquos unsatisfactory outcome is very much a story of our times."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit-nearing-end-game-aint-seen-nothing-yet","story":"Pull that tooth. Book an earlier flight home. Do something, anything, but make ldquoit stop, it being the pain, the boredom, or in this case, Brexit.There has been a certain hysteria in Westminster this week, fuelled by the knowledge that one way or another Brexit is approaching the end game.Wholly understandable given the isions the process has caused and the way it has brought politics to a standstill. But there is delusion at work here, too. Regardless of what happens in the coming days, Brexit is not going to be over any time soon. We are just at the start of a process that might still be playing out  years from now. There, hasnt that cheered you up Brexit has set some obvious, and not so obvious, precedents and the response to these will determine much of what comes after. Take, for example, what it has done to the way politics is conducted.: EU must condemn treatment of CatalansAmber Rudd, former Work and Pensions Secretary, said this week she detected a ldquowhf of sexism in the way Theresa Mays plan was ditched for Boris Johnsons. May was collegiate and consensual, he was macho and sacked people. Taking Ms Ruddrsquos theory further, Boris Johnsonrsquos rise in the polls could be seen as validating his behaviour, setting a ldquomight is right tone for the future.There is something to such notions, but not much. The modern age of the strongman in politics started three years ago with Donald Trump. Boris Johnson is just yet another version.A greater dficulty in accepting Ms Ruddrsquos theory of sexism at work concerns Mrs May herself. Though one could feel sympathy on a purely human level for the pressure she was placed under, her uselessness had nothing to do with her sex. She was a classic case of the wrong person being in a wretchedly demanding job at the worst time.When the history of Brexit comes to be written, there are plenty of women who could be said to have played crucial roles, sexism be damned. Among them are German Chancellor Angela Merkel , Joanna Cherry of the SNP , and Lady Hale, president of the Supreme Court, whose ruling on parliamentary sovereignty will still be quoted generations from now.: Risks of no deal Brexit set outIn any case, Mr Johnsonrsquos chest-beating, deadline waving, and itchy trigger finger has worked against him. He lost his majority and the ticking clock, the very thing Brexiteers told him to deploy in negotiations, has instead been turned in his direction.It is not Emmanuel Macron who said he would rather be ldquodead in a ditch than countenance another extension to a deadline. Michel Barnier has not committed to achieving Brexit by October  ldquocome what may.EvenMr Johnson does scrape a deal in Brussels his problems could be just beginning. Any agreement must be turned into law, and bills can be amended. Now  MPs short of a majority, the Government will be vulnerable at every twist and turn to amendments being proposed and voted on.Maddy Thimont Jack, a senior researcher at the Institute for Government think tank, told the Today programme yesterday that similar pieces of long, complex, EU-related legislation, the Lisbon Treaty and the Maastricht Treaty, had  votes and  votes on them respectively. Plenty of opportunities for ambushes, then.A more immediate concern to those who wish to see a clean exit from the EU is that MPs will support the deal but onlythere is a confirmatory referendum tied to it. Again, this has the potential to lay traps for the future, not least for the SNP and supporters of an indyref in general. There has always been a fundamental flaw with the SNPrsquos support for a second vote on EU membership.If a vote on Brexit can be overturned in just three years, what is to stop the same happening with a vote for Scottish independence Certainly, you could argue that voters in  did not have all the information to hand to make an informed choice, or were straight out lied to, but the same arguments could be deployed in time against a vote for independence.We know work is being done on another blueprint for independence, but times and circumstances change, and I do not recall the claims in the last door-stopper of a White Paper having a long shelf le. All of these caveats would also apply to a vote against independence. Unless, of course, the winning side had to reach a certain percentage, but that, as in , would be controversial.: Nicola Sturgeon addresses conferenceIf it does nothing , the Johnson plan has confirmed that a border is a border, and that they matter. Hard or soft, still a border. In the sea, monitored by technology, checks carried out in remote centres, still a border. Nicola Sturgeon, in acknowledging recently that there could be a hard border between an independent Scotland and the rest of the UK, is to be commended for her clarity and honesty. But the First Minister is mistakenshe thinks raising the matter this early on will allow voters to at least become accustomed to the possibility. The very notion of a border is problematic now, and will only become more soit looks like happening.As it might. Brexit has confirmed what was already known about the EU: that it is a formidable opponent when it believes its interests and architecture are being threatened. Much of the EUrsquos approach to Brexit has been about setting an example, pour encourager les autres. Having expended so much time, energy, and money on Brexit, the EU will be in no mood to compromise with any other nation wanting out, or, in the case of a post-Brexit independent Scotland, in. Special treatment would be highly unlikely.Which brings us back to where we came in, with Brexit fatigue. The last three years might have persuaded increasing numbers of Scots that they would be better off out of the UK and in the EU, as a poll at the weekend suggested. Yet how many,it comes to it, will see more years of upheaval as a price worth paying for that  There may not be any choice in the end, but let us not pretend it will be easy, or quick."},{"url":null,"title":"jonathon-shafi-independent-scotland-must-take-new-direction-refuse-part-nato","story":"I remember watching SNP members line up to passionately argue their case. As someone who had previously attended protests at NATO summits, I was naturally disappointed in the result. Though I do remember the quality of contributions on the conference floor, and I donrsquot believe that the decision made is irreversible. Indeed, while the issue has been off the radar in recent years, it is now vital that it reopens.One contribution in that Perth debate did stick with me. Alyn Smith said that it would be odd for an independent Scotland not to join NATO. That sent a wider signal to the conference. It was an lsquoadults in the roomrsquo type comment. This SNP would be for assimilation into the world system, as a lsquosensiblersquo alternative to challenging the sane, and measured, status quo.Long gone were the days where the SNP would produce leaflets outlining why becoming a member of NATO would be counter-productive to achieving peace and disarmament. Odd, fringe, perhaps romantic in its approach to geopolitics and lacking in pragmatism. That, anyway, is what those who pushed the argument for the SNP to become a pro-NATO organisation, posited.Yet, increasingly, the lsquoadultsrsquo have to come to terms with the reality of a failing world system. The lsquorules-basedrsquo global order was already irrevocably broken when the US invaded Iraq. Since then it has sunk into a deeper morass. And recent events in Northern Syria, with the Turkish invasion and bombing of the Kurds, have shown the bankruptcy of NATO.:Route revealed for Glasgows biggest ever march in support of independenceIt is time to re-open the debate on Scotland and NATO, and SNP members could do worse than seeking to overturn the reversal of their long-held anti-NATO policy led by Angus Robertson seven years ago.Turkey is a member of NATO. As you read this, they are attempting to bomb the Kurds into submission. The Kurds played a critical role in defeating ISIS forces in the region. Approximately -, ISIS militants are held in Kurdish-run prisons.We know Turkey would have preferred the Kurds were defeated, as their long history of oppressing the Kurdish people shows. Trumprsquos betrayal of the Kurds also came alongside a totally  narrative on the defeat of ISIS, which he takes American credit for. In truth, it would not have been possible without Kurdish resistance on the ground.There have been calls for sanctions on Turkey. And there are widespread calls for Turkey to be expelled from NATO. But this is not as simple as it may sound. NATO is not a moral arbiter of global affairs, it is a military alliance, based on competition and war. And it is undemocratic and unaccountable to the populations from which the nations which compose it come from.It is said that the present Turkish aggression is counter to the aims of NATO. In many ways this is true. But since NATO is a block of countries who are interested in the extension of American and European military power in the Middle East and North Africa, Turkey plays a vital strategic role. Which makes the situation complex for NATO.Even after Turkey started bombing Kurds in northern Syria, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg stopped short of outright condemnation.Stefano Stefanini, Italyrsquos former permanent representative to NATO, said that the alliance was ldquopowerless in trying to manage Turkeyrsquos action in Syria, without US backing.Yet you will hear some people naively arguing that, should Scotland be a member of NATO, we might somehow add our weight to pull NATO in a more progressive direction. That, however, is a total misunderstanding of what NATO is.Primarily, it is an instrument of US power. It grants the US signicant rights in our own country, including the right to base its military operations here, and that includes nuclear weapons.And letrsquos look specically at Turkey in this context. Turkey is the second largest military in NATO, with the US in first place. It plays a vital strategic role for NATO in opening access to the Middle East via the #ncirlik airbase. Not only that, the base holds approximately  US nuclear bombs. These bombs have been a long-term problem for US strategists and are a hangover from the Cold War. But they remain, and illustrate the problem NATO has with containing Turkey.Because while the relationship is strained, Turkey still provides many strategic options for the West. Little wonder that official spokespeople for NATO are guarded in their criticisms of Erdogan.Indeed, NATO is under stress from Trump too. He is touring around NATO countries demanding more money is poured into the alliance. To repeat, NATO is not a collective security shield as it is often projected, but a combative, military alliance based on building the power and influence of American interests.These then, are the reasons why supporters of Scottish independence must consider the present SNP position on NATO. If we are serious about self-determination, can we really join a nuclear club who seem impotent in the face of the oppression of the Kurds :Former Catalan leader Oriol Junqueras jailed over independence referendumIf we are serious about democracy, can we sign up to a military alliance who will demand increasing pots of money Are we prepared to send Scottish men and women to fight in future conflicts over which we have no oversight, as the global state system teeters on the brink of another financial crisis and as proxy wars turn into regional and international conflicts Surely, the answer is no.

This is that the primacy of unelected judges over elected politicians is a direct result of having a written constitution that must be enforcedthe rule of law is to be maintained.By coincidence, a written constitution is one of the demands of the  self-appointed sages from Scotlands elite who have set themselves up as superior to two million No voters with their Declaration For Independence.It is hard to see how they ndash or the SNP which also wants a statutory constitution ndash can complain about the principle of legal action against those who choose to flout that same constitution.Personally, I think the convictions are entirely in order, but the penalties are much too harsh: those found guilty should be surcharged for the waste of public money, banned from holding public office, and made to do some useful community service such as removing ugly secessionist graffiti.Peter A Russell, Glasgow G.DITCH.

The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has admitted there are “known errors” in the RPI system and last year called for the UK Government to stop issuing bonds linked to it.But that advice has come too late for many local authorities in Scotland which are now shelling out millions more in costs for schools that were built under private finance initiatives.Costs of other Scottish PFI schemes, from prisons to hospitals, have also been rocketing since the deals were agreed.A Scottish Government spokesman said PFI had left “taxpayers in Scotland liable for a £ billion legacy of payments”.He added: “The annual PFI repayment bill now exceeds £ billion – nearly five times more than the Non-Profit Distributingprogramme which we introduced and is proving far better value to the public purse.“The funding of public infrastructure has vastly improved since . “We are working to ensure PFI contracts which have been inherited provide the best value for money for the taxpayer – and to ensure savings are achieved from existing contracts, wherever possible.”The Scottish Government is understood to be eyeing a model of public-private partnerships pioneered by the Welsh Government.Like PFI, the so-called Mutual Investment Model sees private partners build and maintain public assets for a fee.But the deals do not include services like cleaning, which have proved costly through PFI. The model also involves the public sector as a minority co-investor, taking a share of the profits.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.donsidepiper webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Figures published by Facebook show that #. million was spent on political ads on Facebook or sister site Instagram.\"  Thousands spent on targeted Facebook adverts by Scottish politicians viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard has pledged to ban any further public-private finance dealshis party takes power.“Scotland’s historical PFI deals have put unnecessary pressure on our NHS, our local government services and right across the public sector,” he said.“That is why I have been clear that the Scottish Labour government that I lead will introduce a ban on new PFI PPP NPD deals.“We will also take private contracts back in-house at the earliest opportunity to save the taxpayer money in the long term.”The JPI Media investigations team has been looking into PFI contracts across the UK.According to figures obtained from hundreds of public bodies, rocketing inflation and extra costs are set to add at least £ billion to the overall price tag of PFI schemes.Among its findings, the team found that:• An NHS maternity unit built and run by a private company was closed after just  years but is still costing the taxpayer millions of pounds• A police force is trying to think up new uses for a mothballed custody suite it is still paying for• Expensive maintenance contracts have seen one police force billed £ for an extra chair.Trade union leaders have called for urgent action.Unite assistant general secretary Gail Cartmail said the escalating costs of PFI were a “national scandal”.She said: “The money that has poured into the pockets of profit-hungry financial institutions and private companies could have been much better spent directly on public service projects and infrastructure. “PFIs are a rip-roaring example of out-of-control ‘bandit capitalism’.”"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : pmLoganair has announced a new code sharing deal with Europe#s largest regional airline, Flybe, today, Thursday.

As is tradition, an ensign, which has been tied to the wreck of the battleship was presented to a family member of one of the crewmen.

People will get their money back when theytheir empty container for recycling.The scheme is expected to increase recycling of single-use bottles and cans and cut CO emissions, playing an important role in tackling the climate emergency. It will also give people an extra incentive not to litter.Zero Waste Scotland, who helped the Scottish Government design the scheme, is especially interested to hear from islands-based drinks producers, retailers, hospitality businesses, and other key stakeholders, such as tourism businesses.The draft regulations laid before the Scottish Parliament in September include a target of capturing  per cent of all scheme containers. Achieving that requires making the scheme accessible and practical for everyone in Scotland.In addition to this and six other island engagement events, the Scottish Government will complete an Islands Impact Assessment to ensure that any signicant unique impacts on island communities are captured and mitigated against. A webinar will be held after the final event to give people that could not attend a chance to learn more about the scheme.Jill Farrell, chief operating officer, Zero Waste Scotland, said: “We want to make sure that Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme works for the whole of Scotland. That’s why we are visiting Orkney to speak with residents, businesses and stakeholders. We want to benefit from their insight into how this will work for the islands.“Making the scheme a success in Orkney will require dferent approaches from in Scotland’s cities. From logistics and transport, to cash flow and tourism, we look forward to discussing how we can work together to deliver a world-class scheme.”Alastair Nicolson, programme manager at Highlands  Islands Enterprise, said: “This is a very ambitious scheme that aims to make a real dference to people and communities in every part of Scotland.“For the scheme to work effectively, dferent approaches will need to be worked out and applied. Models of recycling that work well in large towns and cities won’t necessarily bring about the desired results in rural areas, including islands and remote mainland communities.“It’s great that the needs of islanders are being recognised at this early stage of the Deposit Return Scheme through this programme of events on the ground and online.”The Orkney engagement event will take place at The Orkney Hotel, Kirkwall, on Thursday October , from am to pm.To sign up to take part, visit http:bit.ly DepositReturnOrkneyA webinar will be hosted by Zero Waste Scotland following its series of island engagement events.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The RNLI relies on donations to provide this training, to ensure that our leboat crew is as well prepared as they can be to help save lives at sea.”.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsay man gets new role at lerwick harbour ","story":"Capt Arthur was recruited to succeed Alexander Simpson who was recently promoted to harbourmaster.Deputy harbourmaster Captain Neil Arthur.Port authority chief executive Calum Grains said: #We are delighted to welcome Neil and the contribution he will make to our operations across the ious industry sectors.#Capt Arthur began his career as a cadet with Clyde Marine in , with sponsorship from the specialist geared cargo company Gearbulk.He later gained a BSc in Nautical Science from Strathclyde University and qualied as an officer from Glasgow College of Nautical Studies.Following employment by Gearbulk as a junior officer, he moved into the offshore industry with Subsea  for  years, rising through the ranks and gaining his chief officer#s licence from Glasgow College of Nautical Studies and master#s from Glasgow Maritime Academy..."},{"url":null,"title":"shetland among most vulnerable to brexit says msp todd ","story":"The SNP member has demanded that Brexit is halted and claims half of Shetlanders live in vulnerable communities.Maree ToddMs Todd is basing that on Scottish government analysis which led to the publication of #The Local Level Brexit Vulnerabilities in Scotland Report# this week. It states that rural and remote areas, especially those in The Highlands and Islands, have signicant populations at risk from the fallout of leaving the EU – with or without a trade deal.The report considers community access to services, working-age population, income deprivation, workers in #Brexit-sensitive# industries, EU worker migration and how many EU payments are received.Highlands and Islands representative Ms Todd said: “We always knew that Brexit would be damaging to Scotland but this new analysis really hits home the devastating impact that Brexit will have here in the Shetland Islands.“Families across Shetland will feel the impact of Brexit, with up to  per cent of the local population most vulnerable to the potential economic shock.“The SNP government will continue to do what it can to mitigate and minimise the impact on our most vulnerable communities, but this study lays bare the recklessness of the Tories in their blind determination to pursue Brexit at any cost.“Scotland never voted for Brexit and certainly not for the reckless extreme version now pursued by the UK government. It’s essential that we stop Brexit and go back to the people.”Ms Todd added that a report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies , also published this week, #found the UK is already £ billion worse off as a result of Brexit before we have even left the EU – with the UK economy .- per cent smaller than it otherwise would have been.#Over a million voters in Scotland voted for BREXIT, % of Shetlanders voted to leave, are their votes to be ignored  As a UNITED Kingdom we operate as a single unit well we did during two world wars. I find that Maree Todd’s concern about the potential economic effect that BREXIT could have upon Shetlanda bit of a cheek, coming from a party that currently has chalked up a deficit of £ billion for Scotland, due to irresponsible spending policies.Brexit, is nothing more than for the Tories to distance themselves from the EU, and to have a trade deal with the USA, and the, most likely, mass privatisation of most government responsibilities and duties of care going to US companies, where the Tories will benefit as shareholders of such companies. It is so typical of the Tories to put themselves first regardless to the devastating consequences of their policies and selfish agenda#s onto the people of the UK, especially those in society who struggle as it is. It will be a society of those who have and those who do not have. Where profit is the dominating principle which governs and controls those in power. Brexit, will make the UK, very much an unfair, unjust society for the majority of people. It will also have a great impact on smaller communities where the work-force is from the EU, and the economic circumstances putting many jobs and businesses at risk.Brexit, in all its forms, will cause more harm than good####not to mention poking the fires of xenophobia and racism in its wake.If Shetland is #among the most vulnerable to Brexit#, then presumably, it will also be #among the most vulnerable to Scexit# as we are guaranteed to be out of the EU with No Deal, should the SNP#s policy of Scottish independence ever become reality Tulloch undermines himself. As a UNITED Europe we acted as a single unit. Why should leaving one Union be better than leaving the other  He should reflect on the plain fact that it isn’t our European neighbours that are demanding we split from England against our stated will.“Take back control” my rear end.Peter Hamilton, we agree at last. You, at last, you admit to talking from your rear end!! Now it all makes sense.No Peter, it is the Tories. As I have previously mentioned, their agenda is nothing more than to privatise and hand control of the UK#s Health Care and and other Infrastructure to US companies, where the Tories will benefit mostly. The cost of living under Brexit, will most certainly increase, and the people most affected by it will struggle even more.The Tories, as they have always done, have only thought of themselvesand what they can gain regardless to the damaging consequences upon everybody  in society.Their policies and political motives are highly isive, and generally do more harm than good to society as a whole.Bad enough we have London Europe bleating how they will sufferwe leave EU, when frankly none of them venture beyond the M wall to see England. I would be an idiotI didn#t think we will not suffer first but most of the problems stem from weak MPs and woeful spending.Perhaps the turning point was Thatcher and the Poll Tax. The capture of the Conservative and Unionist Party, one nation and pragmatic until then, by monetarist, neo-liberal ideologues is now all but complete. They just don’t make Tories like they used to.

By Alistair Carmichael‘s lack of understanding on why this piece of legislation has been put forward. The United Kingdom is one of the few countries in Europe, and in fact the world,that doesn’t require some form of identication when an election is taking place. However, in light of massive electoral fraud in the West Midlands and the South East of England, particularly in local government elections, the current administration has decided to tighten up the rules it is long overdue. Germany, France, Sweden, the Netherlands and Greece all require either a national ID card or a utility bill or bank statement as proof of residency which, especially in the case of Greece, have been necessary. Australia and Israel, and certain states within America have also tightened up the rules due to similar issues with fraud. None of the above measures have prevented honest citizens from exercising their democratic rights.The UK remains a country with low levels of voter fraud and the majority of the recent alleged voter fraud in the Midlands related to postal and proxy votes which voter ID at the ballot box will do nothing to solve.Carmichael an obstacle to democracy , says Anderson.#The government have sat on their hands in the face of the actual threats to electoral integrity: anonymous ‘dark ads’, dodgy donations and disinformation.

Work was due to begin on the £.million project in August, but campaigners had occupied the green for over  days in a bid to block the development. Since , Friends of Glassmullin Open Greenhave campaigned against the facility, which is funded by Education NI for De La Salle College.In recent days, however, through consultation and engagement, the school and local community representatives have reached an agreement that will pave the way for the new G pitch. Amongst the terms of the agreement is a commitment that there will be no floodlights and a fence will not exceed . metres at the facility.The resolution will further ensure that there will be no infrastructure put in place for the installation of floodlights at a later date.A seven-person committee made up of school representatives, residents, and an independent chair will now be appointed to manage the facility.Local residents, Martin Derby and Anthony Marron, commented: “We have agreed, in good faith, a pathway to allow for the construction of the De La Salle Sports Facility to commence. Recently we have been part of positive and open discussions with the college and the outcome is a cohesive proposal that benefits all parties involved. This proposal has now been accepted and we will work closely together through a newly formed committee for the project delivery. We will continue to act with the community and our young people at heart throughout the forthcoming process.”Claire White, Principal De La Salle College, said: #The school is delighted to have worked in partnership with local residents to reach a mutual agreement thus allowing for the construction of the sports facility to begin. The facility will provide much needed sports amenities for the pupils of De La Salle College as well as for young people within the community. We are excited to see the project come to fruition and are looking forward to participating and working with the newly formed committee to ensure community cohesion.#Construction of the facility is due to start imminently partnered with ongoing engagement across residents and interest groups via the newly formed joint committee."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"decision due on casement in month","story":"WEST Belfast MP Paul Maskey has said that a decision on the planning application for the redevelopment of Casement Park could be reached in the next month.The £ million redevelopment plans had previously faced setbacks due to safety concerns linked to the size of the stadium.Planning permission was granted for a , capacity stadium in , but in  approval was quashed in a High Court legal challenge brought by Mooreland # Owenragh Residents’ Association .New plans to build a , capacity Casement Park were submitted by Ulster GAA in February .Mr Maskey, who recently met with planners at the Department for Infrastructure , said that, while some information regarding the decision was still outstanding, a decision on the application is imminent.“The department are still waiting on some information coming back to them from DFI roads,” he said.“Obviously when they get that back they’ll have to go through that with due diligence.“When they get that information, which should be within the next month, then hopefully they will be able to make a decision. I hope that they will make that decision as soon as possible.“There have been other large-scale applications that have been submitted after Casement Park, which have already been decided.

But Aidan was intrigued by the natural world – just like so many youngsters today – and when he was  his le changed forever when a simple thing happened – his father bought him a pair of binoculars so he could better study the birds he spent so much time watching in the gardens of Riverdale.Those old second-hand binoculars were the catalyst that propelled him on a le journey that culminated this week in the opening of an Eco Wildle Garden at St Michael’s Nursery School in Andersonstown.The garden was a labour of love for Aidan and fellow wildle crusader Debbie ‘Doolittle’ Nelson. Their plan to build a nature haven for kids – rather than a common play park – got the full backing of the school. Principal Clare McAllister said the children now choose themselves to go outdoors every day.“They just love to be outside in the middle of nature – so many children don’t get the opportunity to getoutside. And I think this park will encourage children and parents to use our parks and public amenities more,” she said. Board of Governors chairperson Sean Óg McGuinness said that even bad weather doesn’t deter the kids. “They just put on their wet gear and can’t wait to get out to play. It’s a nature paradise.”Aidan and Debbie spent months designing and perfecting the garden – Debbie herself did all the joinery work, making the  bird boxes, as well as hedgehog havens in each corner and a wildle pond.“I planted giant water lilies for dragonflies to rest on, and just as I was putting them in during the summer a dragonfly flew by,” said Debbie. “So even though we’re in the heart of West Belfast there are still some rarities about here.”Debbie even managed to allow pathways for hedgehogs to the fenced-off pond by cutting mini-archways into the fence. “The pond itself has wee ramps so frogs and newts and hedgehogs can safely visit it,” she said.And the nestboxes aren’t just to attract garden birds – one at the front of the school has been designed for kestrels. Aidan said: “You can just imagine the faces of the kidsa pair of kestrels take up residence here. It would be fantastic.”In fact the boxes are designed to provide homes for seven other species – including swts, robins, house sparrows, treecreepers and bats. The children’s eco garden – behind the school beside St Michael’s church – is sheltered by giant trees including oaks that long predate the school – “it could be one of the oldest oak trees in West Belfast,” said Aidan.He added: “We need to be teaching young ones, today, at home, in school and crucially in the nursery – the formative years – how to appreciate and look after wildle, the pollinators, birds, bats, hedgehogs, vegetables, amphibians, orchards and ultimately ourselves so to be best placed in years to come to deal with all the many complex survival challenges ahead for people and bioersity.” Things were so dferent when Aidan was young. The binoculars which helped instil a love of nature unfortunately didn’t last long. British soldiers based in nearby Casement noticed them being used at an upstairs window and thought they were being spied on. They raided his house, running up the stairs to find Aidan birdwatching from his bedroom.The soldiers confiscated the binoculars. “The gave me a wee ticket, and said I could collect them when the Troubles were over,” Aidan said this week. “I never imagined that would be  years later!” Aidan never got his hands on those binoculars again, but he attributes that short time spent with that special gt from his father to his lelong love of nature. Five years later, his father was killed by a British army Saracen in a crash on the Falls Road.“Those binoculars launched me on the journey that I’m still enjoying. And I hope this eco garden will have the same effect by inspiring the next generation of youngsters,” he said."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38568793.ece/13a07/AUTOCROP/w620h342/Traffic1.jpg","title":"5000 northern ireland drivers miss mots in","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Youre not going to get any border poll as long youve no Executive working.\"He said Sinn Fein had let people who want a united Ireland down by not properly engaging with the intent of the Good Friday Agreement. \"What was envisaged was that it [a border poll] would probably arise in the first  years. The only reason it didnt arise is because the Executive was stop-start. \"It would be hard to believe that you dont get that vote in eight years time, itll be  years since the Good Friday Agreement,\" Mr Ahern said. He believes that the latest Brexit deal offers a big opportunity for Northern Ireland to enjoy \"the best of both worlds\". \"If Northern Ireland handles this right they will do very well, but they need political stability,\" he said. Acknowledging that the new arrangement is similar to that negotiated by his predecessor, the ex-Fianna Fail leader added: \"I do feel sorry for Theresa May. The dference is she didnt have the skills of being able to sell it. I assume the huge effort they will do is square off the DUP between now and Saturday.\"Asked about the possibility of elections in the UK and Ireland as a result of the Brexit deal, Mr Ahern said its hard to see Boris Johnsons Conservative Party losing an election now.

At one stage in  when the pound was at its weakest, the Sainsbury’s there sold more alcohol than any other Sainsbury’s in the world.On Thursday morning, a new Brexit deal was reached between EU and UK negotiators that would avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.The Irish Premier Leo Varadkar has said the Brexit deal reached protects the wishes of the people of Northern Ireland and avoids a hard border. However, the DUP have said they could not support the proposals.While Thursday’s deal has been hailed as a breakthrough, residents living in frontier towns along the border have greeted the news with a cautious welcome.Shop assistant Johny Foster who works in the Costcutter on the Dublin road on the way into Newry says the decline of the pound amid ongoing Brexit uncertainty means business is brisk with shoppers from the south of Ireland calling into the shop on their way through.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Shop Keeper Johny Foster in Newry near the border with the Republic of Ireland Johny says he no longer pays much heed to the radio station in the shop playing headlines on the latest twists and turns in Brexit but his ears perked up again this morning.“It sounds like there was some kind of breakthrough but I’m here all morning chatting with customers about it and we don’t have a clue what it will mean for us yet.“It sounds pretty hopeful though and we hope this ties it up for once and for all so we can have clarity but given the fact you have the DUP saying they’re not happy with it so I don’t know what to make ofit yet,” he says.“Brexit hasn’t really affected us much yet and we’re lucky to have a stream of southern customers and the usual surge coming up to Christmas time for the cheaper drink,” he said.Askedhe fears talk of border checks ing he is emphatic. “Oh definitely. I was never old enough to remember the worst of the Troubles because I was a baby. When I lived in Moira, the police station was attacked but that would be my only strong memory of the violence,” he says.In , an explosive device cause extensive damage to Moira police station in Co Down and a number of civilians were injured in the incident.“Me and my friends would feel lucky to not have lived through the worst of it so when we hear talk of a border and potential attacks or ato violence – I just don’t want to contemplate it,” he says.Down the road in nearby Supervalu, shop manager Michael Downey said he grew up right on the border between Co Down and Co Louth in the Republic of Ireland.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Supervalu owner Michael Downey “I have shops on both sides of the border so I’m very interested in the events playing out with Brexit and we need a clear decision to be made either way,” he said.“Certain political parties and ones saying no to everything are going to have to give everybody  a wee bit of space here because the rest of us have to live,” he says.“Parties need to be thinking  years ahead not just the next election round the corner. Get the deal done,” he said.“We lived through the Troubles and are delighted to see them over and definitely don’t want to see them back. All that craic of army checkpoints and having your car stopped… it was torture,” he said.“People just want to get on with their lives but at the same time, I want to see lasting peace in Northern Ireland. There was a well supported protest up here last night where people stood on either side of the border and that tells you the level of feeling there is here against any kind of a hard border,” he said.Michael says at this point, he and other people living in Northern Ireland have grown tired of political quarrels and tribal dferences. “Let us all live together, who cares where you go on a Sunday. Get on with le,” he says.Over the border in the Irish republic in Omeath, Co Louth residents are reluctant to give their names or comment.A publican in one of the local bars says people living in the town have “Brexit fatigue.”“I don’t really understand much of the detail of what was announced this morning but I’m crossing that border up to ten times a day sothere’s any talk of checks or customs I will leave this area,” he says.“I’ve been here since the early s and have made a le and business here but all people are sick of all the talk and we just want to know on a practical level what it will mean for us because we’re three years waiting on it,” he said.A local woman who was walking her dogs along the scenic Carlingford Lough said she believed the news of a deal was good butit is not supported by everyone then it is “too soon to celebrate.”Local Fianna Fail councillor who represents people living in Omeath and north Louth Erin McGreehan said: “Today’s deal has of course been very welcome however I haven’t been able to have a sigh of relief just yet.”The leader of Fianna Fail, Ireland’s main opposition party Micheal Martin said on Thursday the proposed Brexit deal the “best of both worlds” for Northern Ireland but that some concerns remain for small businesses and exports.“There is an incredible amount of work to do in Westminster. Remember we have been here before, where the EU leaders approved a Withdrawal Treaty, a British Prime Minister approved it, even the UK Cabinet approved it and we all know the rest of that story. I am cautiously optimistic, but it is a real test is yet to come,” she said.She also warned of potential new costs and paperwork for businesses in the Republic of Ireland as a result of the proposed deal.“Brexit of any sort is not good news for this border region. We may have escaped the worst case scenario but there will be dficulties for people,” she concluded."},{"url":null,"title":"recall of northern ireland assembly is a pointless political stunt says sinn fein","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Yesterday, anti-abortion campaign group Both Lives Matter said  MLAs have signed a petition to force a recall of the Assembly to discuss a motion to put the issue back in the hands of local politicians.The move is seen as symbolic, since a Speaker would need to be elected and an Executive formed in order to stop the new law. A Sinn Fein spokesman said it would not participate, which would scupper that happening.\"Arlene Fosters proposal to recall the Assembly on Monday is a pointless political stunt, which has literally no impact unless its business is to appoint an Executive who does have the power to effect legal change,\" a Sinn Fein spokesman said.Dawn McAvoy of Both Lives Matter said: \"Abortion is not and never has been the stumbling block. We hope that it might now be the issue that helps bring the Assembly back. \"We recognise that there is not a unied position on abortion, but there does appear to be agreement that this should be decided at Stormont rather than Westminster.\"We have done all we can to allow each MLA to stand up and say whether they support the Westminster legislation or oppose it. It is over to them now.\"It is understood that the petition has been signed by DUP Assembly members, after DUP leader Arlene Foster threw her weight behind it.It came after former police ombudsman Baroness OLoan wrote a letter to Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith urging him to recall the Assembly before the change to abortion laws comes in next week.However, Mr Smith does not have the power to do so, and the focus shted to a Stormont rule that allows  MLAs to trigger a recall by the Assembly Speaker.TUV leader Jim Allister and Ulster Unionists Robin Swann, Robbie Butler and Roy Beggs signed it.However, UUP MLA Doug Beattie dismissed the move, saying it would have \"zero chance\" of success.UUP MLA Steve Aiken confirmed his party would attend on Monday, as did SDLP leader Colum Eastwood, although he added that an Executive would not be formed. Mrs Foster told the BBC the move will provide an opportunity for MLAs to show their opposition to the proposed law changes. \"Hopefully we will be able to debate the issue on Monday,\" she added.Alliance MLA Trevor Lunn said the move was political \"showboating\".He said: \"It appears those wanting to go back on Monday are only doing so to try and deny LGBTQ people and women the rights guaranteed to them in the rest of the UK. I previously attempted to make some modest changes to abortion law here but that was blocked by other parties.\"There is no doubt there are serious issues remaining unresolved. But serious parties would have engaged intensively on resolving them ahead of Monday, instead of grandstanding. \"Such showboating contributed to the collapse of the institutions and will do nothing to aid their . \"Indeed, they may make that more dficult.\"Alliance is to decide whether or not to attend today.On Tuesday, Sinn Fein deputy leader Michelle ONeill said: \"Arlene Fosters call for the Assembly to sit before Monday is a pointless political stunt\".A UK Government spokesman said earlier this week that the NI Secretary \"has no power or role to recall the Assembly, as thatis conferred on the Speaker for the Assembly. The Assembly can only be recalled by the Spea ker, by agreement of the parties.\" "},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

denied suggestions that the new Brexit deal is a pathway to a hard border on the island of Ireland..pushMary Lou McDonald welcomed the last-minute deal, but warned that it is not a “happily ever after ending” to the Brexit story.The new deal will see the Stormont Assembly vote on whether to stay in or opt out of the new arrangements, which come into effect at the start of .That vote will be carried out in a majority head count, and will not require the support of a majority of unionists and a majority of nationalists under the contentious “petition of concern” mechanism.💬 Sinn Féin President @MaryLouMcDonald: I am satisfied following a meeting with An Tánaiste Simon Coveney this evening, that there will be no hard border on the island of Ireland and no veto will be given to the DUP. #BrexitDeal #Brexit #NoBorisBorder pic PoShaDi— Sinn FéinOctober , Speaking at Leinster House on Thursday, Ms McDonald said she was “pleased” that the deal ensures there is no veto afforded to what she described as “Brexiteer unionism”.“While we welcome the fact that agreement has been reached, it’s important to remember that there is no happily ever after ending to this story,” she said.“Brexit is bad for Ireland, both North and South.”She made the comments after a private meeting with Irish foreign affairs minister Simon Coveney.After poring over the deal’s details, Ms McDonald, who was joined by Sinn Fein deputy leader Michelle O’Neill and MPs Elisha McCallion and Chris Hazzard, said the deal will mean no hard border on the island of Ireland.She added: “I know for some business organisations this idea of rolling consent and the cumbersome nature of the customs arrangements are giving rise for some concern.“What communities and businesses need is certainty and stability.“The majority of MLAs are of the view of remaining, and I believe support these measures.“There is a process whereby every four years this vote will be held and I am very sure there is a majority in the Assembly for these measures.“This happens at a time when the constitutional conversation is under way and I have no doubt that we will have a referendum on Irish unity at some stage, and I have no doubt that it is only that democratic decision that we will fully and finally address and answer the need for ultimate stability on Ireland.”The DUP earlier stated its objection, saying the deal has “departed from the principle that these arrangements must be subject to the consent of both unionists and nationalists in Northern Ireland”.Ms McDonald described this claim as a “ruse” to reject it.Ms O’Neill also welcomed the fact that Stormont’s consent would be provided on the basis of a straight majority vote.“We were very clear to say that there could never be a veto afforded to the DUP, there shouldn’t be a veto afforded to anybody in this regard, because the deal itself has to be between the EU member states and the British Government,” she said.“So yes, I welcome the fact that is the case.”"},{"url":null,"title":"stars tee off at royal portrush to raise 25k for childrens","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

However, at a recent review hearing six months after the original fitness to practise hearing, it emerged that Ms Porter has not engaged with the NISCC.The review  heard that the NISCC wrote to Ms Porter on July  this year asking her to provide information about what steps she had taken to address the \"shocking\" and \"unprofessional conduct\" but she had not responded.It said: \"There is nothing before the committee to give it any confidence that the registrant has resolved or remedied the cause of her misconduct during the period of her suspension.\"The committee noted that the registrant had not engaged with the Council at all and was concerned that the registrant, still at this late stage, had not apologised for her actions. The committee was therefore of the view that there remains a risk of repetition of her previous misconduct, and that a finding of continued impairment was required on public interest grounds.\"During the original hearing, witnesses gave evidence to a fitness to practise hearing, with one claiming she often used foul language and a second former colleague said she described the mum of one family as \"fat\".A third witness told the hearing Ms Porter described the mum of one family in derogatory way, using words like \"stinking\", \"smelly\" and \"greasy\".A fourth witness said Ms Porter used the word \"paedo\" to describe the dad of one family, based on a photograph she had seen.Ms Porter faced two charges - that at some time between May ,  and March , , she used inappropriate or derogatory language in relation to service users, and that she also used an inappropriate sexual gesture in relation to a kinship carer.In its ruling, the fitness to practise  said: \"The committee determined that the facts found proved involved repeatedly using inappropriate and derogatory language about a range of very vulnerable service users and vulgar sexual gestures in relation to a kinship carer.\"This conduct occurred in the work place and the committee determined that it was serious.\"The committee ruled Ms Porters behaviour was \"deliberate and prolonged\" and said it \"was not a mistake or error of judgment on one occasion\".It determined that respect and compassion are fundamental tenets of the social work profession and Ms Porter had breached both of these, concluding that it amounted to serious misconduct."},{"url":null,"title":"eu leaders say door is open for uk to rejoin","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The publication was produced by the Department for Communities Historic Environment Division .The report details how a “large enclosure” was uncovered within a housing development off the Skeoge Link Road in the Ballynagalliagh area of Derry. It was located on a relatively steep, south facing slope.The enclosure was constituted of  post holes with  posts forming a separate arc in the north-west corner of the site. The majority of the post holes were of considerable size, with half of them producing broken bits of pottery, also known as sherds, within their fills.Some of these have been identied as belonging to the Vase tradition of Bronze Age pottery and other sherds have been identied as coming from the Cordoned Urn tradition. The general date provided for the use of the site is – BC.A substantial rectangular Neolithic house was identied at Turmeel townland, Co. Derry during the archaeological investigation of the A road near Dungiven.It measured approximately m long and m wide and contained almost  sherds of Neolithic pottery. The building was constructed during the period when farming and agriculture were introduced almost , years ago.At the Glenshane Road near Claudy a Late Neolithic ritual site was discovered during a quarry extension. This consisted of a timber circle – large wooden posts with an outer fenced forecourt – which dated to circa  BC.Timber circles are likely to have been the focus of elaborate ritualised activities attended by large numbers of people.HED Senior Archaeologist Andrew Gault said: “These excavations have resulted in exciting and important new information about our past, from evidence of the homesteads of some of the first prehistoric farming communities in Northern Ireland to more recent urban archaeological remains and industrial heritage.“It is intended that ‘Unearthed’ will continue as a regular annual bulletin of the most signicant archaeological discoveries arising from development-led archaeology in Northern Ireland.”Discoveries in other parts of the country include a Bronze Age roundhouse at Rasharkin solar farm. It consisted of a post-ring, an internal heath, areas of stakeholes, and a segmented enclosure.Enclosed houses generally date to the Middle Bronze Age, c.  BC. Finds included a possible rubbing stone and several sherds of Late Bronze Age coarseware pottery.An th th-century tannery, a place where animal hides are tanned, was discovered within the centre of the site at Royal Exchange in Belfast. This site is located within what would have been the th-century core of the city, an urban industrial operation where leather would have been produced commercially.This was represented by a series of  tanning pits, the majority of which were constructed of wooden planks joined together by wooden dowels.Mr Gault concluded: “These new discoveries highlight the importance of archaeological mitigation in advance of development, as well as the signicant contributions made by developers and archaeologists in unearthing these new archaeological sites for the benefit of all in society.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: Excavated Enclosure at Ballynagalliagh in Derry."},{"url":null,"title":"derry chamber president welcomes brexit deal","story":"Todays Brexit deal has been welcomed by the president of Derrys Chamber of Commerce said: Brian McGrathsaid: “The Chamber has always been clear that a deal is needed to retain confidence, safeguard our future and help grow our economy.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh “As a border region, businesses in the North West have been acutely concerned about a no deal scenario or any deal that would impede cross-border trade.  “We are pleased to finally be moving forward but we are also cautiously optimistic as we know this deal still has to be ratied at Westminster.

people were shot dead when members of the Armys Parachute Regiment opened fire on civil rights demonstrators on Bloody Sunday in Derry in .An ex-paratrooper, known as Soldier F, is accused of two murders and five attempted murders in relation to shootings on that day.At the August  parade police officers flanked the band to “prevent a breach of the peace” and later stopped their bus, taking the names of several members.In a statement to the Derry News at the weekend, the Police Ombudsman confirmed that numerous complaints and concerns were raised about the policing operation afterwards but, as they weren’t about inidual officers, the matter was referred to the PSNI for review.A spokesperson for the Police Ombudsman said it received a \"total of  complaints about police actions in

operation, rather than allegations of misconduct by inidual police officers, they were not matters which could be investigated by this Office. We have, however, referred these issues to the PSNI for their consideration.”At a meeting of the Policing Board on September  PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne said a “total understanding of the facts” had to be gathered and the policing operation on the day would be reviewed.The PSNI declined to comment on the state of the review, its purpose and what it will do dferentlya similar incident occurs in future, simply saying: “The investigation is ongoing.”Relationsgoogletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshFollowing the controversial incident good relations were said to be “damaged” in the city and there was disharmony between parade brokers.Negotiators, Garvan ODoherty and Donncha MacNiallais of the Bogside Residents’ Group said the Parachute Regiment insignia with the letter F breached an agreement reached ahead of the parade but the Apprentice Boys of Derry were adamant that no such arrangement was in place.The DUP described the policing operation as “heavy handed” and “over the top”. Its representatives and those from the UUP met PSNI officials to question the police response.While Sinn Féin said it was a “deliberate attempt to stir up tension and to hurt the families of the Bloody Sunday victims” and called on parade organisers and the PSNI to explain why the band wasn’t immediately removed.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood, and others, said the Clyde Valley Flute Band should not be allowed to march in Derry again and he believed that future parades must be built upon “respect” for the local community.The Apprentice Boys of Derry said it had no prior knowledge of the bands unorm, or the incident, until the conclusion of the main parade and eventually recognised the potential upset caused by the emblem.At the end of August, the Bloody Sunday Trust and the Apprentice Boys held a meeting that was described as \"cordial and constructive\" aimed at “restoring relationships in the city”."},{"url":"http://www.countytimes.co.uk/ource srcset=/resources/images/10559504.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"uknewsnational","story":"Get involved with the news in your community Send your stories and photos now  d  document.getElementsByClassName.style.display  blockLoading...Most popular         ,Promoted stories       Loading...Most popular Contact UsNewslettersNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

When funding for the bypass has been confirmed, the piece of art will be fabricated.The news comes after it was confirmed recently that the Department of Finance is expected to approve the new roadrsquos economic appraisal by December which is viewed as a critical step in the process ahead of the required capital funding being released.While the required funding has not yet been made available, local politicians are hoping that it wonrsquot be long before contractors are on site.The Department of Infrastructure says the preparation of the schemersquos economic appraisal report is continuing with Department of Finance approval for the document due to be sought before the end of the year.In order to advance the bypass schemersquos state of readiness, preparatory work on contract documents is ongoing in a bid to minimise the time required to initiate a procurement competition, should funding become available for construction.As part of the proposed multi-million pound development, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road. A new bridge will be constructed over the Moss Road.It is also proposed that a section of the bypass will pass under part of the Crossgar Road with a  metre long bridge constructed to take traffic over Ballynahinch River.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the bypass where the major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.The bypass mdash which would be the single biggest road scheme ever constructed in the district mdash is expected to take in excess of  months to build, with roads officials insisting it will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety.Roads officials are also confident that the schemersquos economic assessment demonstrates the bypass would provide a good economic ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Children.jpg","title":"Children from integrated schools listen talk  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH school played host to a conference to mark World Mental Health Day last Thursday.Over  young people from  integrated schools across the province converged on Drumlins Integrated Primary School to take part in lsquoListeningrsquo mdash an event organised by the Integrated Education Fund.The compere was BBC presenter Jo Scott ands guest speakers included Mr Richard Pengelly, Permanent Secretary at the Department of Health, and Kate Beggs, from the Northern Ireland Director of National Lottery Community Fund.Mr Pengelly said afterwards: ldquoYoung people are faced with a number of pressures including social media influences. Online bullying and exam pressure have all contributed to rising levels of anxiety and stress.ldquoIt is important we equip and educate our young people to deal with these issues and to look after their mental health.ldquoThere is support and help available for young people and their families and I urge them to avail of these services.Following talks delivered by young key note speakers, pupils discussed their views on the stresses and anxieties faced by young people.Participants were facilitated in small groups to share their thoughts and generated ideas to help develop support within their schools.Among those taking part were Kori Colgan-Murphy, a GCSE student at Shimna Integrated College in Newcastle, who has been a member of the schoolrsquos Gender Sexuality Alliancegroup for a number of years.ldquoThe GSA is open to all students including LGBTQ students and their allies, she said. ldquoIt is a place where students can come together to socialise, discuss issues, and support one another.Paul Collins, campaign fundraiser with the Integrated Education Fund, said: ldquoSchools in Northern Ireland have seen a dramatic increase in the number of young people with mental health issues.ldquoThese could be anxiety or panic attacks, stress and depression, eating disorders and even, as we sadly know suicidal thoughts.ldquoThe aim of this conference is to provide an open environment to listen to children and young people.ldquoTeachers and parents need to find out what mental health issues are affecting young people in order to provide them with access to the right type of support.ldquoOn the basis of the group discussions, we hope to develop and deliver a plan that can help to address the mental issues impacting on our young people and their wellbeing..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Dads.jpg","title":"Dads helping autistic children enjoy their favourite sports with new project  ","story":"FOOTBALL is often a rite of passage sport for many young boys and girls but for children with autism, taking part in mainstream clubs or school activities can be overwhelming.Two local fathers are trying to make participation a lot easier and stress-free for their children to enjoy this team sport.Gerard McCartan and Daniel Craig from Downpatrick are just two of the many fully involved members of Downpatrick Autism Family Support Group.They have been taking a group of  local children aged between six and with autism for a specially adapted football course for the last three weeks at the Ballymote Sports and Wellbeing Centre.Devised by Gerard, who works for Disability Sport NI, the course aims to build skills in incremental levels in a way which focuses on enjoyment.Gerardrsquos eldest child Cahaacuten, , has autism and was diagnosed just before he went to primary school. He and his we, who are committee members of the support group, have have always tried to integrate activities and sports for all of their three children.ldquoI didnrsquot want football to be a negative experience for my son or any other child, said Gerard. ldquoTeam sports such as football can be overwhelming for children with autism either in school or any local clubs but that doesnot mean they should not be able to participate.Gerard said that he has devised the five-week course which helps build up football skills at the appropriate level for each child.It will finish with a match of children playing against their parents in two weeks time.ldquoNinety-two percent of children with autism have a sensory processing delay so as coaches being able to communicate effectively to the children in a way that they can understand is important, explained Gerard. ldquoWe give the kids reward cards so they and their parents can see their progression which builds up to the match.ldquoThe parents are a brilliant support as some of the children would get very anxious but to have their parents there beside them makes it possible. With the added bit of theatre and drama we try to instil, it heightens the whole experience for them and helps to make memories for both.Gerard hopes to devise further sports courses for autistic children such as boxing.Aacuteine Sloan, chairperson, of the group, praised the contribution of the fathers, not just for helping their own children but for other local children with autism whose parents are members.She said: ldquoNot only is it fantastic that a programme of its kind is now available locally but that itrsquos down to two dads who took it upon themselves to fill the gap.ldquoDownpatrick Autism Family Support Group is % run by parents. Wersquore delighted that Gerard and Daniel have developed this programme so our children can have the same opportunities as their peers. The children can enjoy football in a relaxed and non-judgmental environment.Ms Sloan said that many children on the autism spectrum cannot attend the usual football sessions due to crowds, noises, dficulty following instructions and other considerations.She added: ldquoThis now gives these children the same chance as their peers.This is just one of the many programmes we have running at the minute. We currently have Lego therapy, pony therapy, occupationaltherapy and ious parent training nights.ldquoWe would urge any local families pre and post diagnosis who need some extra support to get in touch via our Facebook page at Downpatrick Autism Family Support Group..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Down.jpg","title":"Down Leisure Centre goes from strength to strength  ","story":"THE success story at the new Down Leisure Centre continues with ious user targets set ahead of its official opening almost one year ago being smashed.Local council officials have revealed that user numbers are ldquoextremely high with membership of the fitness suite particularly impressive.However, the huge demand to use the ultra-modern poundm facility is causing problems for council officials. One of the issues which has arisen is the number of classes it can host and the number of people who can be accommodated in each.Council officials are going to examine the issue, alongside extending the hugely popular leisure centrersquos opening hours.In addition, they are also going to focus on expanding the health referral service which enables GPs to refer people to the leisure centre to engage in fitness-related activities.Over recent months, the local authorityrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Department has been liaising with the Public Health Agency and local health trusts to look at helping address key areas including diabetes prevention.New staff are to be appointed with the posts jointly funded by the health trusts and local authority.

To allow school use of the pool the running costs would jump from pound, to pound, and receipts would only normally be expected to rise by pound,, leaving an additional deficit of pound,.Negotiations are currently in progress with the South Eastern Education and Library Board but councillors are clearly determined not to allow school use unless the Board agree to pay the additional pound, deficit.If the Board agree to pay for school use the pool will open each morning, otherwise it will be open only in the afternoons and evenings.The councilrsquos recreation committee has already accepted a timetable for pool openings and have agreed to open doors from .pm to .pm on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursday and Fridays.On Wednesdays it will open from .pm to .pm for public use and will re-open between .pm and .pm for the use of recognised swimming clubs.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Ballynahinch Business and Professional Womenrsquos Club have written to South Down MP Enoch Powell in connection with the proposed changes in immigration procedures.The club, having been informed through the United Kingdom Federation of B and P Clubs, who were told by Baroness Lockwood of the Equal Commission, want action taken before the proposals are passed by the government.The proposals, that British women wishing to marry foreigners will have to live abroad whilst British men will still be able to marry foreign girls and live in Britain with them, were discussed at greatby the meeting, before it was decided that the secretary should contact Mr Powell.The guest speaker at the clubrsquos recent meeting was Mrs A Nixon, who gave a talk on lsquoHow to be a Good Hostessrsquo.ARDGLASS mdash Ardglass Castle has been put on the market and the asking price is around pound,.The castle, which is believed to have been built in the th century, has  bedrooms and it is thought that one of its guests was the famous songwriter and painter Percy French.Many believe that the talented Frenchman painted several views of Ardglass harbour from the Castle.Other interesting guests, this time more recently were an order of monks who stayed in the castle in the late s and early s.The current landlords, Sean and Bernadette Tracey, and their three children are sorry to be leaving the castle. Sean had ideas to convert it into a hotel and restaurant and there is already planning permission for such a venture.The Fermanagh-born hotelier is moving his interest to another establishment although this time he is tight-lipped about its whereabouts.Sean is aware that most castles are expected to have at least one respectable ghost and he admits that there are many stories locally about

of % in less than  hours.ldquoOne of the big markets has come from the growth of health food shops who are creating a demand for goals milk, said Jim.In charging pound stud fees, Jim believes that it

As you would expect, the course had become a virtual mud bath by that stage and there was a lot of fallers.Finn Gibney ran well to take th place in the same boysrsquo race, which had a field of  finishers and Ky Murray also did well to take th place out of  finishers in the girlsrsquo race.Masters trialsThe weekend saw the Masters cross-country trials take place at the Queenrsquos playing fields. The weather was almost too good for it to feel like cross country with brilliant sunshine and little wind.The well kept grounds enticed one runner to go barefoot which was slightly disconcerting for the remainder wearing spikes, but maybe that was a tactic to get clear passage as the others were afraid to cause him injury.The conditions underfoot may have been kind, but the course was taxing with four long loops and a few rises and s where tactics played a part.Mark winsIt was no surprise to see Mark McKinstry, from North Belfast, surge into the lead from the go, given his recent form, but it was still impressive to watch how hard he continued to push despite the clear gap.Second overall was Eamon White, from the same club, with Glenn Donnelly, of Acorns AC, in third. As this race was a trial for selection for the NI team for the British and Irish XC International in Southport in November, all were out to seethey could do well enough in their age groups to merit a place.Three EDAC runners were in the mix.

He was th overall and fourth in his age category, so stands a good chance of making the team.Martin Willcox, a previous NI team member at the international event, also put his hat in the ring with a gutsy run, coming th and third in his category which should see him nominated to race.Confirmation was not out at the time of writing, but we will keep our fingers crossed for them both. Gareth Reilly was th overall, getting his cross country season off to a solid start.Soggy SaintfieldAs rain swept in overnight and just kept coming, there was the danger of a wash out for the long awaited Saintfield  k, but runners are a resilient lot and so they turned up nonetheless, ready to enjoy the carnival atmosphere laid on by the hardworking members of Saintfield Striders and other coned volunteers.It was no secret that this is a tough route. Described as a challenge, the k started outside the cricket club, rises up into the town, rises again up Main Street and rises yet again after the left turn which takes the runners out into the countryside.Asthat wasnrsquot enough, there are at least three more hills which take their toll, but there are occasional down hills to catch your breath and the biggest compensation of all is the final mile and a half which drops down into the finish.Edie in frontThe pacers were encouraging and the marshals were cheery, so there was plenty to keep runners on track, whether they were chasing a time or just hoping to finish.EDAC had a small, but determined army. First home for EDAC was Edie Carroll, who thoroughly enjoyed the run and finished th overall and eighth female in a time of . which is more than respectable on that course.Kevin Kelly, who has racked up some great racing en route to Dublin Marathon, ran a PBwhich is a real boost in these last couple of weeks of his prep.Clare Carson, also in taper, produced a good time of ..

to -.That victory ensured Downpatrick of a play-off spot and also ped Bryansford into the relegation mire mdash Bryansford won their first meeting at St Patrickrsquos Park - to -.Saturdayrsquos confrontation will be a no holds barred confrontation.Derby affairs between these two old adversaries are always tasty and no quarter will be asked for or given at the weekend.Bryansford will rely heavily on the experience of Davy McKibben, Conor Maginn, Ruairi Wells, Danny Savage and Timmy Hanna, with Downpatrick looking to Gerard Collins, the Turley brothers, Peter and Damian and Jarlath Branagan.Downpatrick received a massive boost last week when Conor McGrady, who was expected to miss the rest of the season, made a remarkably early comeback as a substitute in the game against Bryansford mdash his appearance from the start could be a game-changer on Saturday.Meanwhile, Downpatrickrsquos close neighbours will take on Saval in a Division  relegation play-off, also on Saturday at St Malachyrsquos Park and will act as a curtain-raiser to the ACFL  clash.Saul looked destined a few weeks back to join Tullylish and one other team in Division  next season, but last-gasp victories in recent weeks over Saval and then Darragh Cross on Saturday have given Ronan McCartanrsquos side a leline.Darragh did Saul a favour last Wednesday night when they beat Liatroim, effectively condemning the Fontenoys to Division .Saul mdash in their first season in Division  mdash have a mixed bag of youth and experience, but could well have to beat Saval without the services of the talented Cormac Byrne, out with a knee injury.However, in Cathail Arnold, Lorcan and Ciaran Harney, Pierce Laverty and Rory Mullen they have the players capable of producing the goods when it matters most.Elsewhere, Dromara play St John Bosco tonight in a Division  relegation play-off at Tullylish with the losers joining Glasdrumman in Division  next season.Bright embark on their initial Ulster Club Championship odyssey with a game against Cavan JFC winners Killinkere at Kingspan Breffni on Sunday andthey can replicate the form shown against Aughlisnafin in the JFC final.To complete a hectic weekend, the action s to Pairc Esler on Sunday where the MFC final replay between Kilcoo and Burren takes place with a .pm start..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Kilcoo.jpg","title":"Kilcoo recapture Frank O’Hare Cup  ","story":"CILL Chua regained the Frank OrsquoHare Cup at Pairc Esler on Sunday with a relentless and masterful display of controlled football.The hurt of last yearrsquos defeat to Burren was confined to history as the Kilcoo players and supporters celebrated with unbridled joy on the final whistle.All credit to Warrenpoint for playing their part in an intriguing contest that so could easily have gone either way, but they were made to pay for registering  wides over the hour.As expected, Niall McAleenanrsquos side took the game to Kilcoo with real authority and at times threatened to destroy their vaunted opponents.However, you just canrsquot tie Kilcoo down and they steadfastly refused to be dominated for long periods.With just two minutes on the clock Ryan Mallon gave Warrenpoint the lead with a point from play after some patient approach work. The same player then had a glorious chance for a goal when he got in behind the Kilcoo full back line, but lsquokeeper Martin McCourt made a brilliant save.The lsquoPoint continued to see plenty of the ball with corner forward Aron DrsquoArcy foraging deep, but they wasted a few kickable frees before Kilcoorsquos Ryan McEvoy brought the sides level with a free in the ninth minute.Ross McGarry then found his range and exchanged frees with Paul Devlin before the Kilcoo marksman punished Warrenpoint for another defensive indiscretion with his second point in quick succession.Ryan Johnston started seeing a lot more of the ball for Kilcoo, but it was Warrenpoint who drew level the th minute with a well-taken score from Ruairi McCormack.McGarry pointed Warrenpoint into a - to - lead after  minutes, but Kilcoo responded immediately with a m free from McCourt.Ryan Johnston then went on a searing run down the right flank and bore down on goal, but flashed his shot wide of Gary McMahonrsquos far post when he really should have tested the lsquokeeper.Devlin and McGarry swapped frees as the interval approached, but their was still time for the energetic Aidan Branagan to bomb forward from his full back berth to point Kilcoo into a - to - half-time lead.Warrenpoint were certainly not overawed by Kilcoo and started the second half the same way they attacked from the opening whistle of the game, but it was Kilcoo who edged into a - to - lead after  minutes with another score from the rampaging Ward.A McGarry free quickly negated this score before Kilcoo received a bad blow when Darryl Branagan was black carded and replaced by Shealan Johnston in the th minute.McGarry converted the resultant free to bring the sides level, but the game was really opening up at this stage and McMahon prevented a certain goal at the other end when he saved from Aiden Branagan.Warrenpoint went straight back on the attack and McGarry gave them a - to - lead with  minutes remaining. Devlin then brought the sides level with a rsquo after a Jerome Johnston shot went perilously close.Ryan McEvoy and Anton Magill swapped scores to keep it all square going into the last  minutes, but Warrenpoint kicked for home when John Boyle majestically pointed his side into a - to - lead.Kilcoo responded with venom. Conor Laverty, who had been on the periphery of the game up until this stage, suddenly took centre stage.Nothing looked on when he received the ball about m from goal. However, he checked back inside his marker and somehow spotted Wardrsquos run from deep.An improvised flick-pass, albeit with the aid of a deflection, picked out the big midfielder and he made no mistake with an unerring finish past McMahon.That should have finished Warrenpoint off, but far from it.They immediately attacked in numbers and worked an opening for McGarry, but he sent his effort wide with the goal at his mercy.A McGarry free gave Warrenpoint some consolation and left a single point between the sides with  minutes played.The game was still anybodyrsquos, but consecutive scores from McEvoy and Jerome and Ryan Johnston seemed to put daylight between the entities with  minutes gone.Another McGarry free cut the deficit to three points as the game went into added time. Warrenpoint continued to bombard Kilcoo and further points from Donagh McAleenan and McGarry left a point in it, but Kilcoo won dirty ball when it mattered and ran the clock down to run out worthy winners.Kilcoo: Martin McCourt , Niall Branagan, Aidan Branagan , Niall McEvoy, Aaron Branagan, Darryl Branagan, Miceal Rooney, Ryan McEvoy , Dylan Ward , Anthony Morgan, Paul Devlin , Ryan Johnston , Eugene Branagan, Jerome Johnston , Conor Laverty.

It was crazy. Amber was born in her whole sac, she continued.ldquoI did what the midwives told me to do because she was in the water [the sac]. I was already in early labour when I went for a hospital appointment but while they wanted me to stay, I said that I would rather go back home as I wanted to do everything as natural.ldquoThey advised me not to come back in until my waters broke but they didnrsquot break. I came back around .pm and Amber was born two hours later.

The midwe had to break the sac but Amber also seemed to reach out at the same time with her hand. It was just so special to see.Amber, who is now six days old and is thriving well, is one of a number of famous people down through the centuries who share this honour of being born in the lsquocaulrsquo mdash the thin membrane which covers the baby and its amniotic fluid.Emperors and leaders such Alexander the Great, King Charlemagne, Napoleon, the poet Lord Byron and father of modern psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud, and the late flamboyant entertainer Liberace, are all reputed to have been born this way.Seen in many cultures as portentously luckyborn ldquowith a veil over the face, the child is meant to have a lelong affinity with water.A spokesperson for South Eastern Trust which manages the Lagan Valley hospital, confirmed the auspicious delivery.ldquoThis patient laboured naturally and her waters remained unbroken so as a result the baby was born in the amniotic sac.

He recalls that his mystical experience revealed to him that all people are mutually interdependent and all people are essentially good.Signicantly, the revelation led to him leaving his study of medicine and immersing himself in the study of psychology, social anthropology, sociology and African languages. And, during university vacations, Stan engaged in so-called participant observation research as a nursing assistant in psychiatric hospitals.He also played music with an African group known as lsquoThe Kirela Kidsrsquo, two of whose members, Robert and Joshua Sithole were proclaimed to be a foremost penny-whistler and second best guitarist in South Africa respectively at a jazz awards ceremony.It was through these musiciansthat Stan met his future we, Selin Mahlvane, who was herself a singer of traditional African music and a jazz singer.In , the author was awarded both BA and a BSc Science degrees, also receiving a bursary for being the top sociology student which resulted in his engaging in further studies, leading to him receiving an honours degree.After this, Stan engaged in further participant observation studies, this time as a lsquopretending patientrsquo in a mental hospital in Swaziland, subsequently writing this research up as a thesis, entitled, ldquoSituations: a model for the analysis of mental hospital practicesrsquorsquo. He received PhD degree for this research.While he was in Swaziland, Stan married Selin, a black South African. Such a marriage was illegal in South Africa and was banned under the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act. The couplersquos son, Kenneth, was born in Swaziland and was smuggled across the border into South Africa and itrsquos this backstory which forms the genesis of his new book.Already an acclaimed author, Stan argues that the reason psychiatric hospitals and psychiatry were so signicant was because the way hospitals treated patients was equivalent to the way black people were classied and dominated in apartheid South Africa.All this is described in his new book, along with a way to evaluate the therapeutic value or lack of value in staff-patient interactions.When Stan came to Northern Ireland, he became a clinical psychologist, working in psychiatric hospitals. He was also the co-founder of a self-help group for mastering anxiety, panic and stress.Some of the background to this group is contained in his new book, as well as in another publication entitled lsquoSoul On Firersquorsquo mdash a guide to mastering anxiety, which is also available on Amazon.Together with the process of mastering anxiety, Stan also engaged in research into overcoming depression, put together in a book entitled lsquoRising from the Deadrsquo and the process of recovering from alcohol and drug addiction, contained in lsquoVictory of the Spiritrsquo.All this, he says, forms part of an understanding of the radical alternative to psychiatric colonialism.ldquoThe worst part of psychiatry lies in its process of diagnosing so-called mental illness, along with its prescribing of drugs, supposedly for correcting and lsquochemical imbalance in the brainrsquo says the author.Dr Papenfus illustrates that such a chemical imbalance does not exist. In fact, he argues that the ldquofraud involved in creating and medical basis for psychiatry is no more than a myth and there is shown in great detail in the book.Also demonstrated in great depth is what the author describes as the ldquounscientic basis of pharmaceutical companies supposed lsquotestingrsquo of prescribed psychiatric drugs.ldquoThis fraudulence results in millions of peoplersquos lives being ruined, year after year and in one country after another, said Dr Papenfus.ldquoEven children are now becoming a huge market for prescribed psychiatric drugs and some of their extremely dangerous effects are described. The research involved in this exposure calls for a dramatic and urgent response. This is what lsquoRenewing our Livesrsquorsquo provides.Between  and , Dr William Barrington was the leading psychiatrist at the Downshire Hospital in Downpatrick. According to Dr Papenfus, it was during these years that traditional bio-psychiatry was replaced with social psychiatry.ldquoUnder his guidance therapy always included a social dimension, said the author. ldquoGoals were formulated and realised. The personal empowerment of patients included regular reviews of what was going on and how everyone was making sense of everyone .ldquoThe result was that the Downshire Hospital was widely regarded as the best psychiatric facility in Europe. Because Dr Barringtonrsquos way of working was still strikingly held by many nurses, social workers and others, this is what persuaded me to come to work in the Downshire in .But, when he arrived, the author claimed that the ideology of the medical model of mental illness was in force once again and ldquothe dehumanising processes of bio-psychiatry was prominent once more.Despite this, the author says a transformation was still possible ands this is the hope behind his new book.Two copies of the new book have been placed in Downpatrick Library and it is also available on order, from Amazon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Roy.jpg","title":"Roy Living healthy life to win coveted NI fitness accolade  ","story":"PORTAFERRYrsquoS Roy Livingstone has won the Centra Action Cancer Endeavour Award at the Northern Ireland Health and Fitness Awards.The prestigious event sponsored by Centra mdash held at Belfastrsquos Crowne Plaza and attended by  guests mdash celebrated the outstanding achievements of the local health and fitness industry.The awards were presented by TV personality and fitness advocate Vogue Williams and Q Radiorsquos Ibe Sesay.Roy has gone above and beyond the call of duty to help raise much-needed funds for Centrarsquos charity partner, Action Cancer, cycling from London to Paris and, most recently, a -mile cycle in San Francisco.Congratulating the Portaferry man on his win, Jenner Morton, Centra brand manager, said that over the years, Roy ldquoreally has gone the extra mile when it comes to fundraising for Action Cancer.She continued: ldquoFrom his cycles in Paris and San Francisco alongside local events and initiatives, Roy and the wider team at Centra in Portaferry have made a real impact with the funds they have raised.ldquoFrom everyone at Centra, wersquod like to say a big thank you to Roy.Funds raised by Centrarsquos customers go towards funding the health action programme which educates children of all ages about leading healthier lestyles as well as Action Cancerrsquos so-called big bus which travels across the Province driving home early cancer detection..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Traders.jpg","title":"Traders offered input into Irish Street scheme  ","story":"BUSINESS owners in Downpatrick are to be given a key input into ambitious plans to redevelop the former Irish Street police station site and a number of adjacent empty buildings.Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Department for Communities are helping spearhead a an exciting retail and commercial proposal aimed at transforming the townrsquos economy, with both organisations working alongside the Provincersquos Strategic Investment Board.Last week, the Recorder revealed that a development brief designed to transform the sprawling town centre site as part of a multi-million pound investment was being progressed, with hopes that the document could be completed before the end of the year.During Mondayrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee,council officials confirmed that town centre traders, Downpatrick councillors and relevant public agencies will be involved in discussions to guide the development brief process.When the brief has been agreed, it will be advertised, inviting developers to come forward to transform the site to kick-start a signicant town centre economic regeneration initiative.A formal launch of the brief is also planned before Christmas.Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains are reported to be interested in opening new premises in Downpatrick and view Irish Street as an ideal location as there are currently no other suitable sites available.The development brief will outline what the local authority would like to see developed in Irish Street to maximise the potential of every square inch of available space.Permission has also been secured to purchase an outstanding piece of ground close to the Irish Street car park to allow the ambitious proposal to proceed.Itrsquos almost two years since it was revealed that the former police station site had been earmarked for a major economic regeneration initiative which could potentially include new housing.It is understood that as part of the regeneration scheme, the vacant buildings adjacent to the former police base will be bulldozed to open up a huge area. The development site also includes the council-owned Irish Street car park.However, the former police station mdash which enjoys protected status ndash will not be razed to the ground as part of the ambitious regeneration plan and is set to remain a key feature of the proposed redevelopment project.Downpatrick councillors Dermot Curran and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed progress on developing the brief for the Irish Street redevelopment.Cllr Curran, who has been asking for traders to be involved with helping shape the development brief, is delighted this is going to happen to help shape the future development of the Irish Street site.He said it is critical all key stakeholders are involved in what will be the biggest ever investment in the town centre.Cllr Curran believes that with everyone on board at this early stage, the planned new retail and commercial centre has a signicant chance of succeeding, providing a boost for all businesses in the town.ldquoThis planned development can act as a catalyst for additional town centre investment, increasing footfall and providing a boost for existing businesses who have been at the backbone of the townrsquos economy for generations, he said.ldquoWhile details of the Irish Street scheme were announced almost two years ago, signicant progress is now being made. I have no doubt that the opportunity to redevelop a major town centre will appeal to many in the construction industry.Cllr Curran said the importance of the townrsquos business community being asked for its input into the redevelopment plan which has the potential to attract more shoppers to the town cannot be overstated.Cllr Hanlon agreed that the redevelopment proposal will provide Downpatrick with a much-needed economic boost and welcomed plans to form a stakeholder group to feed into the development brief.She added: ldquoThis forum will be open to all Downpatrick businesses and I would encourage their participation and views to ensure that all ideas are heard and considered.

But such was his passion for Down that there was no way he was going to miss the game.ldquoFor me, that said much about the man he was. He ran the risk of maybe breaking down but through sheer willpower, courage and strength of character he came out triumphant.Doherty, one of the true GAA legends, said Eamonn Burns was never one to look for sympathy or seek comfort.ldquoHe stood on his own two feet and took what came at him. And when the going got tough he was always in there doing his bit for the cause. When you have a man like Eamonn in your corner, how could you fail to come out on top  he continued.Paddy Mo added: ldquoEamonn was a legend. Not just because he was a whole-hearted player who gave everything for the cause at club and county levels, but because he was as honest as the day is long.ldquoHe was a wonderful ambassador for our Association, honourable, dignied and respectful. In my book he was a true legend because of the person that he was. He has left a rich legacy both in a playing context and in the way he carried himself. His memory will linger on.Another colleague of the double All-Ireland winner, Conor Deegan, said he was left ldquonumb and devastated when he learnt of Eamonnrsquos passing.He added: ldquoWe are absolutely destroyed. Only a few weeks ago we were together at Croke Park. He took on the county job when it was not fashionable but nothing was ever about Eamonn there was just no ego with him.

There were breathtaking displays of riders with hoops and torches on fire, made all the more spectacular against the back of the floodlit castle.ldquoThe finale involved le-size inflatable horses, which were manipulated by dancers who moved with the music that filled the air. A spectacular display of culture for all to enjoy.On Sunday morning, the group viewed a historic presentation prepared by one of the historic and cultural associations in Lamorlaye.Ms Patterson explained: ldquoWe were then taken on a walking tour of the old Lamorlaye. The afternoon was free for the group to view a dressage display with ballet dancers at the Diane Stables. There was also a beautul show with Samurai warriors on horseback.ldquoThe activities just went on and on and the group was treated to a visit to a wine-making area in Gouvieux before being taken to the troglodyte quarter of Gouvieux and for a surprise dinner in a cave.The dinner was prepared by member of the committee and made all the more special because of the sing-song started by Herveacute Moula, chairwoman of the Lamorlaye Comiteacute de Jumelage, supported by Cllr Andrews and guests from Ballynahinch. The atmosphere was relaxed and this was the end to a lovely day.On the final day of the visit, the group was invited to view the facilities at the Golf du Lys, an exclusive golf course, which has facilities to host conferences, weddings and events, along with outdoor and indoor tennis courts, an outdoor pool and golf courses.Ms Patterson said: ldquoThe golf club has already hosted some players from Ballynahinch and they have asked uswe are interested in organising a reciprocal golf tournament with the local golf courses in Co Down.ldquoWe hope we will be able to take them up on this proposal when the French visit us in .ldquoOur final lunch was in a redundant factory complex which has been converted in to a stunning hotel and restaurant ndash testament to how an old property can be re-generated for the good of the community.ldquoThe programme for the weekend provided us with ample opportunity to meet up with those who had travelled over to Ballynahinch in July and to meet with some old faces from previous exchanges between Lamorlaye and Ballynahinch. It is our hope we will be able to sign a twinning charter with both the local council for the next five to ten years.Ms Patterson said that the two pilot exchange trips have shown the relationship is still as vibrant as ever, with new people getting involved on both sides.She added: ldquoWe are hoping to be in a position to host a small group over the St Patrickrsquos weekend and to take a small group out to Lamorlaye for the Bastille Day celebrations. We always welcome new families who would be interested in hosting French people and who would be interested in travelling out to France as part of the exchange.ldquoThose travelling pay for their own flights and the Rowallane and Slieve Croob Community Twinning Group has facilitated the visits through the generous support of Newry Mourne and Down Council. We would also like to thank Cllr Robert Burgess for helping us to revive the Lamorlaye Twinning Project and Cllr Andrews for representing the local council and accompanying the group to Lamorlaye and for his rendition of the Marseillaise in French..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/ource srcset=/resources/images/10525568.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"capturing fleeting moment dramatic artwork","story":"JC: What is your artistic background  Are you self-taught or did you go to art school do courses JC: What inspires your art JC: Who what are your biggest in#uences JC: Is there a speci#c place that you do your work JC: What has been your most ambitious piece to date JC: What has been your favourite project to date JC: What dferent artistic mediums do you use and which is your favourite JC: Do you exhibit your work anywhere JC: What are you up to when you arenrsquot painting JC: How would you describe your artistic style JC: What does your art mean to you This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The TUV, meanwhile, described it as a “betrayal”.The prime minister announced the agreement with Brussels yesterday and urged MPs to “get this excellent deal over the line”.But the proposed customs arrangements for Northern Ireland dfer from those for the rest of the United Kingdom. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Under Mr Johnson’s deal, Northern Ireland will remain aligned with European single market regulations on goods. This means checks will be carried out at ports and airports on goods travelling between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. The DUP, whose votes could be crucial in determining whether the agreement will be passed by MPs in the House of Commons tomorrow, is emphatic in its opposition.Deputy leader Nigel Dodds said Mr Johnson had been “too eager by far” to come to an accommodation “at any cost” with the EU.And leader Arlene Foster said the proposals on gaining the consent of the Assembly on a straight majority basis represented a fundamental change to the Good Friday Agreement.UUP leader Robin Swann said: “This deal is worse than the one Theresa May brought forward at Chequers.

This is a charity venture. Itrsquos about providing a wonderful educationfor children who may have been struggling in mainstream and providing an alternative that doesnrsquot cost anything. Wersquore trying to do something which is beneficial to the community.Dinas Powys Community Council and councillor Andrew Robertson have objected to the plans, raising fears over traffic and noise.Ms Church has said justone vehicle will be needed to take children to and from the school.She said: ldquoWe have sent out a letter to our neighbours in the hope they can come to usthey have any problems.ldquoWe had a really positive meeting. We talked about a lot of the issues regarding who has complained and itrsquos a very small group of people.ldquoAs compared to the picture painted for them by neighbours, [the council] were surprised at what we were doing and how compliant wersquore already being.ldquoWersquore hopeful of a positive outcome but we donrsquot know whatrsquos going to happen.ldquoWe have had thousands of messages of support from emails and twitter messages. Mostly itrsquos people seeing itrsquos such a positive thing wersquore doing.Marcus Goldsworthy, head of planning and regeneration at Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoA planning application has been submitted for the temporary use of a former residential annex as a school.ldquoThe application remains under consideration and planning officers have met with the applicant and her agents to discuss the further information that is required to support the application, and allow it to be fully considered. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ministers have attacked our independent judges. The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing. Governments need to be honest about this and act upon the crisis.ldquoWe were over the moon with the response from Penarth residents, who walked with us or cheered us on, the day really gave us hope that the message is seeping in and change can happen. Myself and others had been feeling quite down because climate change is scary, we are worried about our childrenrsquos futures. Lets hope this walk leads to more local action on climate change.The young people on the march also spoke about their concerns.ldquoI went on strike because people cut down rainforests just to be able to eat meat, said seven-year-old Mylo Kitchiner. ldquoIf we keep cutting down trees we wonrsquot have oxygen to breath. I want the government to stop people cutting down trees.

Like the overwhelming majority of Welsh and British people, they are perfectly capable of expressing that view without resorting to threats, aggression or violence.We must all learn to disagree well, however robust our views and remember that we all share this country and this planet - and that we genuinely have more in common.Meanwhile, it has been another extraordinary week in these turbulent political times.After we had the shock news that I wrote about last week ndash that the Supreme Court had delivered a unanimous judgement that Parliament should not have been shut down by the PM ndash we were able to go back immediately.I was straight back to Westminster having meetings with colleagues, holding the government to account, and of course getting back to work not just on Brexit but on many other issues.I was able to raise concerns in the Commons on behalf of constituents relating to the Thomas Cook collapse, which has affected everybody from holiday-makers to pilots to holiday reps and retail workers in the constituency and to call for a debate on the incineration of waste.And on Monday, I joined Allied Steel and Wire Pensioners from the constituency, and others hit by pensions theft, to hand in a petition to the Prime Minister at  Downing Street. They deserve justice on their pensions and have my full support. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

A former head of two other schools in Gwent, he is clearly proud of his school and all they have accomplished.ldquoItrsquos a wonderful school and everyone here has worked so hard to make it that way, he said. ldquoBut it does face challenges.Like other head teachers in Penarth, Mr Rees had signed the open letter to the Welsh Government calling for fairer funding for Vale schools earlier this year. He had discussed coming in to the school on weekends to clean the toilets himself to help balance budgets. But he is firmly optimistic.ldquoBetween kind donations and fundraising efforts from our PTA, renting out the school hall, and younger members of staff taking on some extra burdens we are just about able to balance our budgets, he said. ldquoTo be honest, next year might start looking grim, but wersquore keeping our heads high.ldquoWith that said, wersquove been working hard on incorporating new initiatives and the new curriculum, we have a great crop of pupils and staff morale is high. We are very positive here.ldquoItrsquos also our th anniversary this year, so we have loads of ex-staff and pupils coming through the doors to say hello, a celebratory PTA barbecue and more planned.Taking a tour around the school, this positivity is reflected in students and staff alike. Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This must be investigated.ldquoThis is a deliberate attempt to present a  equivalence between genuine political canvassing and those who would wish to scam vulnerable people.ldquoMany people will be deeply unsettled by this behaviour from Cairns at the same time as the Tories are attempting to suppress votes by making it a requirement to show ID at polling stations- a move that will disproportionately affect working class, ethnic minority and young voters.ldquoThis is not how politics should be done. In contrast, Welsh Labour is opening up politics by extending votes to  and  year olds in future Assembly elections. We must resist Tory attempts to close down our democracy. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We need a UK Labour Government that will stand up for the many.The Tories have been cutting budgets for nearly  years now.Since  they have scrapped over , frontline police officers.In the last year alone more than , children were pushed into absolute poverty.Boris Johnson has sought to ide our country.Labour would immediately raise the minimum wage to pound an hour for all ages, increase funding to Welsh Government for the NHS, and kickstart a green revolution.On Saturday it is expected that MPs willto Westminster to sit for a highly unusual session in Parliament, as we reach the critical stage of the Brexit process.Weekend sittings are very rare, and the House has only sat on four Saturdays since  ndash on September ,  at the outbreak of World War II on July , as a final summer sitting on November ,  to debate the Suez Crises and on April ,  over the Falkland Islands invasion.A Saturday sitting, two days after the EU summit, is likely to be a decisive moment in determining the future of our country.Saturday will also see a lsquoTogether for the Final Sayrsquo march to Parliament Square.When a similar march took place earlier this year an estimated million people of all ages, from every corner of the UK and from all walks of le, took part ndash including many from Penarth and Cardf who travelled to London to make their voices heard.Their message was absolutely clear then ndash and mine remains the same now - that the people must be given a final say on this Brexit disaster. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The puppies currently available for adoption are named: Emmy, Brando, Legend, Jolie, Heath, Goldberg and Leonardo.Oonagh Phillips, Rehoming Centre Manager at Dogs Trust Ballymena, said: “The Rehoming Centre is no stranger to puppy residents however, we do find that Lurcher puppies tend to stay with us a bit longer. We hope to find this litter new owners soon, so they can quickly adjust to being part of a loving family.“Canine carers at Dogs Trust Ballymena have found there is often misconceptions about the Lurcher breed, with people often thinking they require lots of exercise. Lurchers actually don’t require any more exercise than a typical dog and many enjoy staying cozy and snuggling up for a snooze.“At such a young age they will all need homes where they will be given lots of care and attention, as well as ongoing support with their training. Families who adopt any of the puppies will be invited to join Dogs Trust’s Dog School at ious locations across Northern Ireland.”Dog Trust’s Dog School was launched in  to support dog owners and their pets through our reward based training methods, teaching valuable skills needed for everyday le. Dog School is just as much about supporting and guiding owners as it is about training the dog. Classes run over five weeks and each dog owner will receive training homework after the class to practise at home. It is important for owners to continue the training at home on a regular basis to practice what their pet has learned in class.If you believe a dog is for le and would like to find out more about the adorable Lurcher puppies, get in touch with the team at Dogs Trust Ballymena on  or visit www.dogstrust.org.uk our-centres ballymena.

Also, many of the immigrant families are moving where due the uncertainty of their status on the outcome of Brexit.”However Mr Buckley said: ”It is very sad to see that unfortunately Richmount Playgroup has had to close its doors. I would like to pay tribute to the staff and community leaders who had the vision to open up the playgroup.“Having liaised and worked directly with the the Playgroup committee, parents and the education authority to try and save the playgroup it became clear that under the current low numbers it was going to be hard to sustain.“The committee took the decision to inform parents that the playgroup would be closing. I understand this has been dficult for parents and staff involved.“I must stress despite what is being reported, at no time was it indicated by the committee, parents or indeed the Education Authority that this decision was Brexit related.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/2_web.jpg","title":"top  voice of business never stronger or more important","story":"Posted on Friday  September  by Ulster Business John Mulgrew, Michael Neill, Sarah Little and Len OHagan The voice of Northern Ireland’s business community has never been stronger and more important as industry attempts to avoid a hard Brexit, a gathering of top business leaders has heard. The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.  Danske Bank’s Conor Lambe said there were still a number of possibilities for what might happen over the next  days, with the UK due to leave the EU on October . Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said. The .% is down from the bank’s previous forecasts, delivered in June, that growth would hit % in  and .% in . In its latest Northern Ireland Quarterly Sectoral Forecasts report, Danske Bank said that the Northern Ireland economy likely expanded in the second quarter of the year, but the rate of growth over the first half of the year remained modest. “We have revised our forecast for economic growth in Northern Ireland downwards for both  and ,” he said. “This largely reflects the modest data for the first half of the year, increased Brexit-related uncertainty and the weaker global economic environment. “Assuming that a no-deal Brexit is avoided, we expect the Northern Ireland economy to grow by .% in  and .% in , below the .% we expect UK GDP to grow by in both years. “A combination of strong wage growth and more stable inflation is likely to lead to solid growth in consumer spending, but the lack of clarity around the UK’s future relationship with the EU is expected to continue holding back business investment.” It says the information and communication, and professional, scientic  technical services sectors are expected to be the fastest growing parts of the economy over the next two years. Meanwhile, output in the construction sector is forecast to rise by .% in  and .% in , while expected output growth in the wholesale and retail trade sector has been revised down to .% in  and .% in .

Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged. It’s very natural, and it has always been developed from the ground up,” Ian says.He believes this contributes to the huge numbers of staff doing their bit – enabling their own local communities to thrive.  ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease. Her young great niece was also diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in  and is now doing well, but seeing the impact a cancer diagnosis has on a family inspired Christine to get involved with the Relay for Le event.“Our event truly is ‘legenderry’,” she says. It is a -hour relay race that brings the whole community together to celebrate the lives of cancer survivors, to remember those lost to the disease, to fight back by increasing our knowledge of cancer and by raising money to fund le-saving cancer research.”In just three years the event has raised over £, for Cancer Research UK with Christine helping to raise £, in  – not only the most successful Relay for Le event in the UK this year but all funds raised in Northern Ireland stays here.  Christine values the support she has had from the bank who promote the event to the wider community and from her colleagues who enter teams.“Relay for Le is for all ages and stages, all shapes and sizes,” she says. It’s cross community and intergenerational and the atmosphere every year is electric.”Plans are already underway for Relay for Le  which promises to be another massive event. PAUL MAGEEPaul Magee, associate director of the corporate banking team, became involved with the Ulster Region Committee for Wooden Spoon, the Children’s Charity of Rugby, five years ago after he successfully completed the charity’s Four Peaks Challenge, reaching the summits of the UK and Ireland’s highest peaks. He is now an active committee member for Wooden Spoon, helping to raise funds to provide le-enhancing experiences for disadvantaged and disabled children. “All funds raised in Ulster stay in the region and benefit the children here,” Paul says. “For instance, we provided £, to the Mae Murray Foundation to buy specialist equipment for the first fully accessible beach in Ulster at Benone Strand. When we created the access to the beach, one parent was very emotional as he watched his teenage daughter in the sea for the first time. It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference. He says: “The bank has been fantastic – I appreciate the flexibility the team offers in the lead up to events and my colleagues often attend Wooden Spoon fundraisers. I’ve also benefited from the bank’s Give Together initiative, which offers days of paid leave that employees can use for volunteering. The bank’s support has helped facilitate my commitment to Wooden Spoon, where I can really see and be a part of the impact the charity has on the local community.” SALLY IRVINEOver the last  years Sally Irvine’s coffee mornings have become a highlight in the office calendar, in turn raising more than £, for MacMillan Cancer Support and funding  days of specialist nursing care for cancer patients across Northern Ireland.Sally, a business lending and credit governance manager at Bank of Ireland UK, arranged her first Macmillan Coffee Morning in  following a colleague’s cancer diagnosis. She found herself wanting to do something to help people living with cancer and so took the plunge and decided to be a host as part of Macmillan’s biggest coffee morning fundraising event. From the outset, Sally had tremendous support from her team members and the wider business, and this has contributed to the ongoing success of the event.The bank plays a huge part in ensuring Sally can deliver the event each year by giving her support through their Give Together scheme.Sally says: “The coffee morning has become a very special occasion and a great day of fun where people from across the bank come together to have a wee cuppa and a cake and take time to catch up while raising money for a really important cause. One in two of us will face cancer at some time in our lives and I am passionate about continuing to fundraise to provide the specialist nursing care that’s so vital for those living with cancer.”Plans are already underway for this year’s Macmillan Coffee Morning and Sally is hopeful the annual fundraiser will continue to hold a special place in the office calendar. PAUL SLEVINBranch manager at Bank of Ireland UK in Newry, Paul Slevin is someone who embodies the bank’s ethos of community involvement through his role with the charity Space NI.  Space NI offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community. Through its service Home to Hospital, the organisation has helped  elderly people travel to crucial hospital appointments, while its Family Support Hub offers vital assistance to families in distress. Paul joined the charity in  and has just completed five years as chairman of the Board of Directors. He is proud that his background in finance has enabled him to support the charity through its repositioning process to ensure that its activities best serve the community.  Since Paul’s involvement with the charity began, Space NI has won the ‘One to Watch’ award at NI Social Enterprise Awards and the ‘Community Wellbeing Initiative’ at the All Ireland Pride of Place Awards. The organisation has also grown and opened a third premises in Newry and launched a range of volunteer made soy wax candles to raise crucial funds. “Bank of Ireland UK encourage all staff to give back,” Paul says. “Every manager I’ve had was very active in their community, so they were both great role models and great motivators. I think it’s really important to give our time, our expertise, and to do whatever we can to help and support the communities we live and work in.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/12312323.jpg","title":"novosco sold to global services giant for m","story":"Posted on Monday  October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland IT services firm Novosco has been bought by a German-based global industry giant for around £m, it has emerged.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control — now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.\" Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said: “This agreement is a fair compromise between the EU and the UK. It is testament to the commitment and willingness of both sides to do what is best for EU and UK citizens. We now have a newly agreed Protocol that protects peace and stability on the island of Ireland and fully protects our Single Market. I hope that we can now bring this over the line and provide the certainty our citizens and businesses so deserve.” Michel Barnier, the European Commissions chief negotiator, said: “We had dficult discussions over the past days. We have managed to find solutions that fully respect the integrity of the Single Market. We created a new and legally operative solution to avoid a hard border, and protect peace and stability on the island of Ireland. It is a solution that works for the EU, for the UK and for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.” The DUP has said it could not support the deal brokered by Mr Johnson. So, what deal was agreed  A statement from the European Commission says: “In terms of regulations, Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules related to the EUs Single Market in order to avoid a hard border: legislation on goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls , rules on agricultural production marketing, VAT and excise in respect of goods, and state aid rules. “In terms of customs, the EU-UK Single Customs Territory, as agreed in November , has been removed from the Protocol on Ireland   Northern Ireland, at the request of the current UK government. EU and UK negotiators have now found a new way to achieve the goal of avoiding a customs border on the island of Ireland, while at the same time ensuring Northern Ireland remains part of the UKs customs territory. This agreement fully protects the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union, and avoids any regulatory and customs checks at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. “Finally, the EU and the UK have agreed to create a new mechanism on ‘consent, which will give the Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly a decisive voice on the long-term application of relevant EU law in Northern Ireland. The Commission has been in close contact with the Irish government on this point.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
