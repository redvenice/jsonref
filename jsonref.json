One young relative was recently born with an extra urinary tract.Her husband had suffered such a high dose of radiation to his head he went on to have chronic headaches which led him to kill himself in 1976.Eric and Shirley had already had one daughter together before he was involved in the experiment. She was born healthy.However, 37 per cent of their descendants from children born after Eric passed through the radiation cloud were born with defects or unexplained medical conditions.These included skull deformities, missing or extra teeth and spinal problems.          The MoD continues to deny that Eric and his crew were subjects of an experiment, despite the emergence of new papersTwo of his four children with Shirley were born with abnormalities, as were some of their grandchildren and great-grandchildren.RAF hero Eric was involved in early tests into the radiation caused by atomic and hydrogen bombs.In 1958 he was stationed in the Pacific Ocean on Malden Island and Christmas Island - the site of Operation Grapples, which saw the UK carry out some of its earliest nuclear weapons tests.Eric was ordered to fly his Canberra B6 bomber through a cloud left in the wake of a 2.8 megaton nuclear explosion on April 28, 1958, documents reveal.X-ray badges were stuck to his seat to measure the barrage of radiation as he and two others entered the cloud.They were placed behind his head, on both armrests and by his groin.The documents reveal \u0027care was taken to ensure as little shielding effect as possible\u0027 was given to the X-ray badges. Of course, this meant Eric and his crew became vulnerable to the deadly radiation.The document was an Atomic Weapons Establishment paper looking at ways of testing the badges to make sure they were accurate.They detail the exact amount of radiation absorbed by the head, arms and groin and the bomber\u0027s pilot, navigator and wireless operator.They also note the time spent inside the cloud, the height of the plane and the time the bomber entered the cloud after the bomb detonated.The documents goes on to set out the pros and cons of the badges in measuring radiation. They also suggest re-running the experiment with more badges.          One of the documents showed Flight Lieutenant Denson recorded a radiation reading of 13 Roentgens after carrying out the flightWhen Eric\u0027s bomber touched down after the test he began to experience vomiting and developed a rash - common symptoms of radiation poisoning.The documents, written by scientists running the experiments, show that Eric, who was 24 at the time, had his head exposed to 65 years\u0027 worth of normal ­background ­radiation.This amounted to 17,500 dental X-rays worth of radiation during just six minutes of flight.The badge placed near Eric\u0027s groin recorded a dose of 8.8 Roentgens - about 30 years\u0027 worth of background radiation.In total he received 18.8Rs, the worst of the three-man crew which flew that day.Shirley is seeking an apology from the Ministry of Defence, who have insisted veterans were not used as guinea pigs during nuclear tests."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/03/09/4DDEDC4900000578-0-image-a-11_1530606342861.jpg","title":"Toddler gets hand jammed lift playing doors mother watches on","story":"    The boy\u0027s mother was standing right next to him when he got his hand trapped in the lift\u0027This is like Mao¿s China\u0027: Piers Morgan compares schools...Eddie Mair hits back at reports he left the BBC after...Trump threatens WTO, saying the U.S. will respond if it...Remains of burial horses from 2,700 years ago are found in...Share this articleThe boy was seen playing with the buttons and jumping around in the lift prior to the accident, with his mother standing right next to him.She did not appear to stop him playing  in the lift.The toddler then placed his right hand on the doors and they suddenly opened, taking his hand into the side panel with it and snagging his fingers. The desperate mother immediately squatted down and tried to pull her son\u0027s hand out but his fingers remained firmly jammed between the lift wall and the door, which was half open.   The boy was seen playing with the buttons and jumping around in the lift prior to the accident          The desperate mother immediately squatted down and tried to pull her son\u0027s hand out but his fingers remained firmly jammed between the lift wall and the door, which was half open  A passer-by rushed to their aid while the mother repeatedly pressed the alarm buttonA passer-by rushed to their aid while the mother repeatedly pressed the alarm button.Chinese net users have blamed the mother\u0027s apparent negligence for the accident. \u0027This mother does not deserve sympathy,\u0027 one said. \u0027She should take full responsibility of being a poor parent.\u0027\u0027She should take this as a lesson,\u0027 another said."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/03/09/4DDF0F2B00000578-0-image-m-8_1530608396884.jpg","title":"Boardmaster Festival medics ignored teenagers pleas help","story":"    Pictured: George Zographou tragically died after contracting meningitis b A teenager died after festival medics failed to pick up on the signs of meningitis and left him on a tent floor in a coma.George Zographou, 18, was shaking and vomiting but doctors told his parents his illness wasn\u0027t serious with his mother asked to pay for a taxi to take him to hospital.But the sixth form student went into cardiac arrest on the tent floor and died days later in hospital.He had only just completed his A levels at a well-regarded college in his home city of Bristol. A government report released yesterday revealed how George\u0027s pleas for help fell on deaf ears. He arrived at the three-day music event in Newquay, Cornwall, last August and immediately fell ill.The youngster had not been drinking alcohol and spent the first night in his tent being sick with cramps in the back of his legs. He could only crawl on his hands and knees, the report read, and was not able to walk without help.   Security teams called the medics, who took him to the tent on a buggy.

The coroner ruled her death had been contributed to by neglect.After meeting the families, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt apologised and commissioned the report, which makes 12 recommendations. It includes listening to parents, better care at festivals and more awareness to the illness.          Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt apologised to George\u0027s parentsIzzy complained of headaches and not feeling well. There had been a meningitis case two weeks earlier at St Brendan\u0027s Sixth Form College, where both she and Geroge were pupils.Izzy developed a high temperature, became lethargic and soon started vomiting and developed neck and limb pain.She was taken by ambulance to the BRI, with paramedics warning of potential sepsis and meningitis.At triage, the doctor made an initial examination and diagnosed her with gastroenteritis, sending her home with fluids and painkillers, making no reference to meningitis.At home, she worsened and suffered a fit, and she was rushed back to hospital. Izzy fell unconscious by the time she got to A\u0026ampE and doctors said it was serious and she was taken into intensive care. Less than half an hour later, she was diagnosed with meningitis.Izzy was stabilised, but her condition got worse and her organs shut down. An inquest concluded her death had been contributed by neglect.The report made 12 recommendations, including asking all medical staff and volunteers at festivals to to know the signs of meningitis.Those staff and volunteers need to checked through by the Care Quality Commision (CQC) and communication also needs to be improved.The working group also wants Public Health England to review its leaflets on vaccinations and meningitis. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/03/10/4DDDA49E00000578-5912687-image-a-6_1530608740782.jpg","title":"Greek athletes olive oil traditional wrestling rivals hands rivals trousers","story":"    Each one-on-one battle can take from five seconds, to up to 40 minutes including added time, depending on strategy and tactics. The best way to succeed is to avoid the slippery torsos, and aim for fellow competitors’ trousers, called kismet          Limbering up before going onto the grassed wrestling zone, these competitors have already been covered in olive oil for the traditional event, which dates back two millennia. Oil wrestling is believed to be the closest to ancient Greek wrestling in style. However, in ancient times, the Greeks would have competed naked, as they did in all sports          Bare torso, and with bare feet, this wrestler is donning thick trousers made of calfskin leather. Some wrestlers also wear jeans. The trousers the men wear are made of thick leather in a traditional design called kisbet. In recent years manufacturers have changed from traditional buffalo to calfskin. While durable, sometimes they are torn apart in the fighting          Wrestlers covered in olive oil fight in an annual traditional oil wrestling competition in the northern Greek village of Sochos. Muscular men walk around the lawn, which is turned into a wrestling ring, to the tune of traditional music, with their torsos slathered in olive oil for the yearly festival that blends the traditions of ancient Greece and more modern times          Fights take place simultaneously in a large field, and unlike most combat sports there is no set field or arena. The wrestlers are free to roam around as the fight takes them, and are typically followed by a referee. Unlike Greco-Roman wrestling, which relies heavily on technical ability, oil wrestling is more a test of endurance          In tears: a wrestler covered in olive oil reacts after taking part in an annual traditional oil wrestling competition in the northern Greek village of Sochos. The oil makes it harder for the wrestler to grip opponents, so this type of combat needs a certain strategy, besides strength, to succeed          Oil wrestling is one of the oldest sports in the world, which dates back to the ancient city of Babylon but is still practiced across Turkey and in northern parts of Greece. There is no score in the event. The winner is the man who manages to throw his opponent onto the ground so that his shoulders touch the soil          Prior to the matches, wrestlers cover their bodies in olive oil as they prepare to compete in the event. It is not unusual for competitors to oil one another, above, to show mutual respect. The traditional sport of oil wrestling in Greece has continued from generation to generation          Spectators watch as wrestlers covered in oil take part in an annual traditional oil wrestling competition, in the northern Greek village of Sochos. Fights take place simultaneously in a large field, and unlike most combat sports there is no set field or arena. The wrestlers are free to roam around as the fight takes them, and are typically followed by a referee          Wrestled to the ground: the annual event promotes and spreads the sport of wrestling, with spectators, including tourists, watching as competitors test each participant\u0027s strength and skills. Unlike in boxing, isions in oil wrestling do not only take into account weight, but also age and track record - meaning there is often little similarity in physiques between competitorsJudy Murray says tennis faces its own #MeToo moment because...Dramatic pictures capture the moment a tourist who floated...Share this article"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/03/10/4DDED29A00000578-5912749-image-a-32_1530610162081.jpg","title":"The ULTIMATE Grand Designs","story":"    This £30million mansion in Maidenhead, which boasts views of Windsor Castle, has been shortlisted for an international design award voted for by the public and is up against properties in the US, South Africa and the Caribbean          The UK property, pictured, has been nominated in the \u0027Modern Masterpiece\u0027 section of the HGTV Ultimate House Hunt competition and it comes with its own art gallery, a huge dining hall and a games pitch          Pictured are the stables at the property, which also comes with a horse track and a games pitch to make it a very attractive proposition while there is also a huge polo arenaThe competition is a joint venture between Leading Real Estate Companies of the World and Luxury Portfolio International.Of the finalists the most expensive property is a £30million manor in Maidenhead which boasts its own polo grounds and views of Windsor castle.Listed among the other finalists is a serene hideaway in the Hamptons in New York, a penthouse in the Johannesburg skyline, a Caribbean Island retreat.ROBERT HARDMAN: For 100 years, Binns (known as the Harrods...Would you turn this beautiful period property into your own...Householder is forced to put duct tape on his windows to...Share this articleStephanie Anton, President of Luxury Portfolio International, said: \u0027Modern architecture is really having its moment with today\u0027s affluent home buyer. \u0027Marked by distinct characteristics such as clean lines, bold cantilevers, large windows and minimalist style, we continue to see incredible demand for Modern around the world.\u0027As the selection of homes in this category reflect, this style is equally at home in a beautiful countryside or a city setting.\u0027           Another of the properties on the shortlist is this modern design in Hollywood, California, set in the hills that comes with a host of amenities including a bar, wine room and sculptures          The Hollywood home gives great views of the Los Angeles skyline thanks to its hillside location while many of the walls are made from glass, also enhancing the view and giving it a sleek design          Another of the US homes nominated is this \u0027haven in the Hamptons\u0027 in New York, which again features windows instead of walls around much of the property.

This year’s Wimbledon Championships could have one of the hottest days everChief Meteorologist, Will Lang, said: ‘The heatwave conditions will continue to affect pretty much all parts of the UK over the next few days.‘Although peak temperatures may not be quite as high as we have seen this week, we will still see temperatures widely in the mid to high 20’s  with 30C or more still possible across southern and some central parts of England.’However, that is still a few degrees short of the hottest temperature recorded in the UK.That honour goes to Faversham in Kent in 2003. On August 10, the hottest ever temperature in the UK was recorded there, hitting a mighty 38.5C.The summer of 2003 was an incredibly hot one, with Scotland’s Greycook recording 32.9C one day earlier. It was the hottest temperature ever recorded in Scotland until June 28, 2018.That summer wasn’t the hottest overall, however. That title goes to the summer of 1976, where for 15 days towards the end of June, temperatures in all four nations topped 32C and Cheltenham recorded 35.9C at the start of July.In Dorset and Devon, no measurable rain fell for a staggering 45 days, which led to the passing of the Drought Act and water rationing.It is thought that temperatures will climb over the next two weeks, hitting 33C in the first week of July before potentially topping 35C next week.Dr Thomas Waite of PHE of Public Health England said: ‘It’s vitally important that we keep an eye on friends, family and neighbours who may be at risk.‘For others, the best thing to do is avoid the sun during the hottest parts of the day, carry water with you when travelling and if going out to large events, and we know lots of people will be watching football this week: think what you can do stay cool.’See here for more information on how hot the weather has to be for school and work to get cancelled. When Kate Middleton will next wear a tiara revealedIndependence Day: How to keep your dog calm during July 4th fireworksBachelorette\u0027s Chris Randone shares photo of himself at age 13 when he was 230lbs... after another contestant said he used to be a \u0027fat f***\u0027Who is Kyle Edmund?

But he added that no prosecution ever took place.Arthur says he will not call a contract cleaner in case they throw out something valuable amid the piles of papers and dirty dishes."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/03/08/4DDECE7F00000578-0-image-a-7_1530604113677.jpg","title":"Young couple lost passports flight Greece sent home","story":"    Lewis Mundy and Kimberley Floyd, both 27, excitedly boarded a flight to Greece and tucked their passports into the magazine pocket of their seats.

It\u0027s health and safety gone mad.\u0027I was really shocked when I received a letter telling me to take them down because, at the end of the day, it is spoiling the children\u0027s fun and our community spirit.\u0027We\u0027ve never had any problems with these paddling pools out in the past - we\u0027ve been doing it for years and previously housing officers have even come and sat with us while the kids played in them.\u0027There\u0027s nothing in my tenancy agreement to say I can\u0027t put a paddling pool up.\u0027We set them up in the communal area as the gardens are too small and the kids living in flats don\u0027t have anywhere outdoor to play.          Ms Roberts said the pools bring the community together and gives children living on the estate - many of whom do not have gardens - somewhere to cool off and play in the summer\u0027I don\u0027t know whether the housing group think we should have a lifeguard on duty or what, but there are always people present when the children are playing we take the safety of our kids very seriously.\u0027There are 35 kids who all want to use the pools and everyone knows it\u0027s perfectly safe - the housing group are just being ridiculous.\u0027Were the pools in our gardens I don\u0027t think the landlords would have a problem, but we can\u0027t possibly fit them in there.\u0027Out of the 13 houses on the street, only five have gardens while the rest of the residents all live in flats.Ms Roberts said other residents claim they have been filling paddling pools on the same patch of land for the last 15 years with no previous complaints.          Ms Roberts said other residents claim they have been filling paddling pools on the same patch of land for the last 15 years with no previous complaintsIn May, Ms Roberts received a letter from Friendship Care and Housing, which is part of the Longhurst Group, ordering her to take the paddling pools down.Friendship Care and Housing became part of Longhurst Housing Group, Kirsty\u0027s previous landlord, in 2006, but the problem with the pools had never been brought to light until this year.Ms Roberts said: \u0027We have three different sizes of pool, one for the under 7s, one for the under 12s, and one for the older kids.\u0027Everyone looks out for one another and to be told we are using the communal area for something other than its intended purpose is stupid. It\u0027s a communal area we are being a community.\u0027There is a really strong community spirit here in this street and we all look out for each other.

I hope they see sense and let us keep them up.\u0027Local UKIP Councillor for Alvaston, Alan Graves, has said he will support Kirsty and the residents in their fight with the housing group.Cllr Graves said: \u0027It seems a little odd that the housing group are stopping the residents from using a communal area for the purpose it was intended.\u0027It\u0027s a case of Bah Humbug, isn\u0027t it? And here\u0027s me thinking Scrooge was dead!\u0027I fully support the residents in their use of the paddling pools.\u0027We don\u0027t get many sunny days in this country and to stop children in a deprived area having fun - it\u0027s absurd.\u0027A Longhurst Group spokesperson, said: \u0027Within the terms of our tenancy agreements, we set out clear guidelines around the use of communal areas.\u0027Customers are aware that these areas should only be used for their intended purpose and that the safety and comfort of others should be considered at all times.\u0027In this case, we reminded the customer of the terms of their tenancy agreement and asked that items were removed from a communal area in order to avoid further inconvenience to other residents.\u0027At no point has this customer been threatened with the issue of an anti-social behaviour order (ASBO), or anything similar, given that these orders were actually replaced in 2015.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/03/16/4DDF2CC700000578-5913955-image-m-18_1530630055721.jpg","title":"Brazen sunbather ruins couples wedding photos refusing move","story":"    The woman positioned herself  just yards from where the newlyweds had their photos takenMs Ling, from Torquay, said nobody in the wedding party had any idea who the sunbather was.Mr and Mrs Ling\u0027s families all congregated after the service on Saturday in front of an ornamental stone gazebo which stands in Tessier Gardens, a public park popular with wedding parties next to Furrough Cross Church.The backdrop is a favourite among wedding photographers seeking to capture family group shots at the end of a service.Several guests asked the bikini-clad woman to leave so that she wouldn\u0027t intrude on pictures of the couple\u0027s big day.

The UK has limited supplies of tap water, and households that pour hundreds of gallons onto their garden are exacerbating a growing shortage and bringing a hosepipe ban ever nearer.Secondly, it’s a waste of effort better used elsewhere. Grass is a hardy plant which, in our climate, is almost impossible to kill. A lawn that looks parched today will quickly recover during a spell of wet weather.‘Never, ever water your lawn — it’s a complete waste of time, energy, money and everything,’ is the stern verdict of Stefan Buczacki, former Gardeners’ Question Time panellist. ‘As I look out of my study, the lawn has gone from green to cornfield brown. But I know it will return, and in the meantime I don’t need to bother mowing every week.’Getting your priorities rightIn nature, the weakest are always the most vulnerable. That means juvenile and new plants, which have yet to properly establish themselves, need the most looking after.In current conditions, anything you’ve planted in the past couple of years ought to be given extra help.Beyond that your priority should be the vegetables which are most vulnerable to drought.‘Courgettes, lettuces, tomatoes, cucumbers — the soft succulent vegetables where the bulk of the crop is made up of water — are obviously the ones that need it the most,’ says Buczacki.Vegetables such as cauliflowers ought to be left until the edible parts of the plant appear, and then watered liberally. The same goes for peas, beans and sweetcorn. Water them before their flowers appear and you’ll have huge plants with plenty of leaves, but not a lot of what you want to eat.Starve it of water and it’ll worry it’s about to die, so set about the business of reproducing — giving you a bigger crop in the process.Want to sunbathe naked during the heatwave? Make sure to...Britain screams for WATER! UK battles double crisis as taps...Share this articleThe best time to water is... 4 amTurning on the hose when the sun’s beating down is pointless: on a warm windy day, 18 per cent of water can evaporate before it even hits the ground. In extreme conditions, water drops can even act as a sort of magnifying glass, scorching healthy leaves.Logic dictates that gardeners should do the job at dusk, giving water plenty of time to work its way into the soil.But there’s a catch. ‘Typically, people get in from work, have a cup of tea and then turn on the hosepipe,’ says Guy Barter, chief horticulturalist at the Royal Horticultural Society.‘This means there’s a huge surge in demand at about 7pm, so the pressure in the system goes right down, and the job takes longer than it should. A better bet, if you can, is to do your watering when everyone else is in bed.’Barter says 4am is actually the best time for the job: there is very little drying wind at that hour, and lots of pressure in the system.You don’t have to be an insomniac to take advantage of these conditions, either: most garden centres sell timers that can be fitted to taps allowing them to do the job while you are asleep.Technique is everythingWatering little and often might sound like a good idea, but it’s a big mistake. By constantly adding moisture to the upper layer of the soil, you are encouraging plants to develop a shallow root system.For a plant to thrive, its roots need to grow as deep as possible.The correct technique, therefore, is to give each plant a thorough soaking every week or two. ‘Rather than giving the whole garden a light spray, you should concentrate your efforts on a few different plants each night,’ advises Barter.‘And to properly refresh the soil, you need much more water than you think — around four two-gallon watering cans full, for each square metre of ground.’And to ensure sufficient liquid actually ends up reaching your plants’ deep roots, he advises building a small bank of soil around the base of each plant before watering, thereby creating a small pool.    Follow our expert tips for the greenest grass and the prettiest plantsWhich beds need most water?This question ides the crowd. Buczacki takes a pragmatic approach, advising gardeners to water only the flowerbeds they see the most of.‘It’s for aesthetic value,’ he says. ‘So if you have a bed that’s 100 yards from the house, you have to ask yourself whether it’s worth the effort. But if it’s right next to you, and you get pleasure from it, then of course things are different.’Sometimes, as with vegetables, starving plants of water can actually make them flower better, adds Barter of the RHS. He recommends that plants in herbaceous borders get a good soaking every fortnight.‘Things like delphiniums and lupins are surprisingly resilient, even in real heatwaves.‘Then, after they have flowered, you can cut them back to ground level and, hopefully, they will re-flower in September.’Other experts are opposed to watering on principle. The late horticulturalist Beth Chatto, who died in May and laid out drought-resistant gardens for the Prince of Wales, took the view that all gardens ought to be able to survive local conditions, so designed flowerbeds to need no watering once they were established.Can you stop soil drying out?A layer of mulch, particularly made from tree bark, can prevent water evaporating from the soil. But beware, there’s no point laying it down now (unless you’ve first soaked the ground thoroughly for hours) since that will simply lock existing dryness in.If you do fancy mulching, add a small amount to the area immediately around each plant, straight after you have just given it a serious drenching.Best flowers for a heatwaveLook for plants that come from hot countries. Geraniums, for instance, are from South Africa, hate their roots getting too wet and are comparatively drought resistant. Ditto African marigolds.Herbs such as rosemary and thyme do especially well in the heat. So, too, does lavender.Plants in pots - a special caseAn exception to the ban on ‘little and often’ watering are plants in pots, which have comparatively small amounts of soil to survive on, so should be watered every day.If that job gets to be too much, the RHS advises transferring plants to bigger pots, which can retain more moisture, or moving them all into a shaded area.Pot plants standing in a single group are easier to water. And their close proximity to each other can create a micro-climate, helping them to retain moisture while other areas wilt in the heat. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/03/23/4DE5452600000578-0-image-a-30_1530658043054.jpg","title":"British divers known team lost boys","story":"    British cave ers Richard Stanton (left), Robert Harper (centre) and John Volanthen (right) arrive at Khun Nam Nang Non Forest Park near the Tham Luang cave on June 27They were specifically called upon by the Thai authorities to join the vast search due to their expertise. They have well-established reputations as being among the best cave rescuers in the world and the British Cave Rescue Council has even hailed them as \u0027The A-Team of cave rescue\u0027.How will they get those terrified Thai boys out of there?...Two doctors volunteer to STAY with children trapped in Thai...Share this articleCool as cucumbers, they have gone about their work single-mindedly and with absolute professionalism. \u0027We\u0027ve got a job to do,\u0027 was all Mr Volanthen would say to reporters when he first entered the cave.He started caving as a Scout, then progressed to the more dangerous pastime of cave-ing, where, he says, safety depends on remaining relaxed.

What you want is nice and boring. If something goes wrong 10 kilometres down an underwater tunnel, you usually have until your air runs out to find a solution or make your peace.\u0027Mr Stanton, known as Rick and described by friends as \u0027quiet and humble\u0027, has modestly described cave-ing as only a \u0027hobby\u0027, which he started at the age of 18.The pair have often worked together. In 2004, they set a new British cave ing depth record after discovering new caverns and passages at Wookey Hole in Somerset. They also developed the special equipment they are using in Thailand – a modified \u0027rebreather unit\u0027 to enable them to stay under water longer – during exploratory es at Wookey Hole.Such units add oxygen to exhaled air to recycle it and are usually bulky back-packs, so the ers developed a body-hugging version, essential for tight passages.          The boys, aged 11 to 16, and their 25-year-old coach disappeared when flooding trapped them after entering the Tham Luang Nang Non caveMr Volanthen has said of cave-ing: \u0027I enjoy the logistical challenge. Getting us and all our kit to the end of such a long cave… it\u0027s like that puzzle with the fox, the chicken and the grain. It\u0027s not dangerous if you do it right.\u0027Before the Thailand mission, Mr Stanton said his greatest achievement was helping rescue trapped British soldiers from a cave in Mexico in 2004.After being awarded the MBE in 2012, Mr Stanton said: \u0027Who would have thought taking up a hobby in cave ing would take me all over the world and lead to all these awards and now an MBE?\u0027In 2010 he and Mr Volanthen were hailed for their courage after they descended almost 1,000 metres through flooded passages in search of a French cave explorer trapped for more than a week beneath the gorges of the Ardeche in southern France.Eric Establie, who was believed to have been trapped when a section of a cave collapsed, was eventually found drowned. Both men were awarded a bronze medal from the Royal Humane Society in recognition of their attempt.He and Mr Volanthen\u0027s latest mission in Thailand, where they have been accompanied by a third Briton, Robert Harper, saw them navigate their way through flooded caverns to find the 12 boys and their coach nine days after they went missing.Bill Whitehouse, vice-chairman of the British Cave Rescue Council, said: \u0027I gather the actual ing section was about 1.5km, about half of which was completely flooded, and the total e was about three hours.\u0027Mr Harper, from Somerset, began caving in 1968 and is said by Wessex Cave Club to have \u0027extensive experience throughout Britain\u0027, and in Switzerland and France.Yesterday Mr Volanthen\u0027s mother Jill told of her \u0027absolute pride\u0027 in her son. \u0027I felt absolute relief for the children and for the mothers of the children,\u0027 she told the BBC. Mr Stanton\u0027s former fire service colleague Watch Commander Alex Daw, of West Midlands Fire Investigation Prevention, said: \u0027If it was me stuck anywhere, the one person I would want to come and rescue me is Rick Stanton.\u0027  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/03/05/4DD90ABA00000578-0-image-a-59_1530593282680.jpg","title":"How terrified Thai boys there","story":"    How will they get them out?

It will mean they will have to learn how to using e equipment so they can be guided out through the water with the aid of professionals.\u0027    The initial euphoria of finding 12 missing teenagers and their coach (pictured) alive after ten days lost inside the flooded Tham Luang Nang Non cave labyrinth was starting to fade yesterday           Thai soldiers are seen pumping flooded water out of the cave complex during a rescue operation for a missing youth soccer team and their coach at Tham Luang caveThis, it transpired, will be very much harder than it sounds. First, it is understood that none of the boys can swim and at least 1.5 miles of the route is understood to be flooded. It took four hours for the most experienced ers to reach the location.Furthermore, the path involves a narrow 400-yard section now completely underwater and so clogged with mud that visibility is down to nothing. One rescuer described it as \u0027swimming through cold coffee\u0027.In places, there is insufficient space for both a human and an air tank, meaning that ers have to remove the oxygen tanks from their backs and push them in front.The challenges of chaperoning weak and frightened children through such an ordeal are self-evident.Yet, the predicted run of bad weather may force the Thai government\u0027s hand.Throughout yesterday, further tales of heroism continued to emerge following Monday night\u0027s dramatic discovery by the British cave ers.Two Thai medics yesterday nobly volunteered to join the youngsters and remain with them for as long as it takes. Some reports suggest that it could be a four-month wait for the water levels to drop.           British ers Rick Stanton (right) and John Volanthen (left) were the first to reach twelve trapped schoolboys in the waters of the cave system in Tham Luang, Thailand           Foreign ers head to Tham Luang Nang Non cave to continue the rescue operation after the 12 boys and their coach were found alive in the cave          A first meal of rice and pork - packaged up in sealed portions - is being prepared for the youngsters, who have already been given energy gels and paracetamol. Pictured, a huge international team of rescuers has assembled at the mouth of the caveWhile they were all inside, however, a flash flood sealed off the exit forcing the boys to head further into the mountain. Armed with a single functioning torch, they managed to reach the spot where they have subsequently been discovered.We can only begin to imagine the mounting sense of fear and panic as the parents of the \u0027Wild Boars\u0027 football team went in search of their missing sons back on that evening of June 23.To put it in perspective – and we are talking about football-mad teenagers here – it was the night before England thrashed Panama in the World Cup. That is how long this lot have been missing. A local search party finally stumbled across some of the boys\u0027 bicycles locked to a fence and a pile of football boots. The mystery of where they had gone was solved. Now an even greater mystery lay ahead.The following day, the police found footprints and handprints inside the caves but heavy rain had made much of the cave system impassable. Families could only wait and try not to fear the worst, building makeshift shrines, making votive offerings and praying.

At some point soon thereafter, however, Messrs Stanton and Volanthen made their sensational discovery.News bulletins around the world were interrupted to announce their success. Here was a glorious good news story right up there with the great escapes of modern times – like the 33 Chilean miners trapped 2,300 feet below ground for 69 days in 2010. Except, of course, they had yet to escape.Initially, Rear Admiral Arpakorn Yookongkaew of the Thai navy said that there was no rush to move the boys as they were safe where they were. Others have since warned that the rain is the key factor.A \u0027comfort plan\u0027 has been put in place to aid the boys.Diving lines have been laid out so that other rescue team members can maintain deliveries of food, clothing and medical supplies with antibiotics and paracetamol already prescribed as a precaution. Any plan to walk and swim the boys out could take up to six hours per child and energy levels will be crucial.Perhaps even more impressive than their physical condition is their mental state. \u0027Really when you think about it: nine days, complete darkness, no food – that mental will to live,\u0027 said Captain Jessica Tait, a member of the US Air Force rescue contingent. \u0027And these boys have it.\u0027 Their families seem to have it, too. All remained in good spirits yesterday. \u0027I want to give him a hug. I miss him very much,\u0027 said Tham Chanthawong, the aunt of the boys\u0027 coach.\u0027In these ten days, how many million seconds have there been? I\u0027ve missed him every second.\u0027This remote rural hillside near the border with Laos and Myanmar is currently a teeming metropolis of rescue workers, engineers, troops, politicians, relatives, media and local well-wishers producing round-the-clock vats of noodles for all concerned.It has all the makings of a Hollywood epic – and, no doubt, the producers are on their way. Yet that happy ending is still some way off. Our thoughts may be focused on that fetid dungeon deep inside the mountain.For now, though, it is the sky above which will determine what happens next. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/03/22/4DE5079900000578-0-image-m-61_1530652674477.jpg","title":"Explosion relief heard moon","story":"    Pub goers cheer for England\u0027s World Cup victory against ColombiaAfter so many losses on penalties had gouged a scar into the nation’s soul, most of the millions watching were convinced the men in red would fail again. The explosion of relief and delight as the last goal scorched in must have been heard in space. Above all, it was a laying to rest of the demons that dog England’s steps in every major tournament.If it happens all over again against Sweden on Saturday, will England fans finally begin a penalty shoot-out with something like confidence?Away from the pitch, the euphoria triggered by this win has surely fuelled the upbeat mood of the country, already basking in the sunshine of a record-breaking early summer heatwave.Used to drizzle in the skies and defeat on the field, the public now has the unusual chance to experience the warm glow of both Mediterranean-style weather and footballing brilliance.Indeed, the triumph last night was all the sweeter because it came after so many years of humiliation. Incredibly, despite the riches of our national game, this is the first time that England have won a knockout match at an international tournament since 2006.Only two years ago, in the European Championship, England were an international laughing stock after losing to Iceland, whose population is smaller than that of Stoke-on-Trent.But nobody can fail to take the English team seriously today.Now into the quarter-finals, Gareth Southgate’s squad has the chance to write a new chapter in our national sporting history.Partying from Manchester to Moscow! England fans erupt in...Nation erupts in celebration as hero goalkeeper helps...Share this articleThere is even a slim possibility that England could gain the ultimate prize and emulate the achievement of the legendary 1966 team, given how many great footballing nations have already been eliminated, such as Germany, Portugal, Spain and Argentina.Such a prospect would have seemed utterly fanciful a fortnight ago. The baggage of England’s recent dismal record, combined with the players’ relative inexperience, meant that Southgate’s team travelled to Moscow as outsiders. Yet, paradoxically, England may have been helped by the lack of expectations. Unlike the so-called ‘golden generation’, headed by David Beckham, Southgate’s team have been liberated from the burden of exaggerated optimism. This has been reflected not only in their creative style of play on the field, but also in their modest demeanour off it. This is a team that speaks for itself through results rather than celebrity swagger.Just three players – Ashley Young, Jamie Vardy and Gary Cahill – were born at the time of Italia 90, when Paul Gascoigne’s tear-stained magic brought England to the verge of the World Cup final. But the emphasis on youth has brought vitality and fearlessness.The progress so far is also a personal tribute to manager Southgate, a figure of increasing authority. He was only handed the England in 2016, but by combining tactical awareness with shrewd judgment, coolness in the heat of battle and a touch of wry, self-deprecating humour, Southgate commands a natural respect among his players.Watching the scenes of national jubilation last night, some cynics might argue that all this excitement is grossly overdone.After all football is only a game, they would say. But such a lofty attitude betrays a profound unwillingness to understand humanity.The truth is that sporting pride is an extension of national pride, the noble quality that – at its best – promotes a mutual sense of belonging and solidarity.What lifts up the spirits of the public is good for the nation, whether through the feel-good factor that bolsters consumer confidence or through the shared happiness that brings people together. Sport is a far greater force for national unity than all the rhetoric of politicians          The England team made their fans extremely proud as they sail through to the quarter finalOutside football, our country has been lucky enough to have its share of international success, like the tennis victories of Sir Andy Murray and the unprecedented gold rushes of the last two Olympic games in London and Rio. But achievement in international football has been missing for too long. That is a serious problem given the central role the sport plays in our national life. Now, at last, Southgate’s team is beginning to reward that unique level of interest.It can only be hoped the self-belief that drove his team last night might be mirrored by our political class, who show far too little confidence in Britain at all.That is particularly true of Brexit, which should be seen as a golden opportunity for national renewal, but instead is treated by Westminster and Whitehall as a looming crisis to be minimised.Victory over Colombia should be a welcome antidote to the gloom and ision wilfully manufactured by anti-Brexiteers. We have proved ourselves a major player on the football field. We can be the same on the global stage.The progressive metropolitan elite like to sneer at such ideas, but that’s because, in their worship of Brussels and globalist ideology, they loathe the very concept of national identities.The national side, far from encouraging xenophobia, is actually a force for tolerance and integration. Southgate’s team has done more for race relations than all the antics of self-appointed social justice warriors.His squad is truly erse, with 11 of its 23 players of black or mixed race backgrounds. But that ersity is the result of genuine talent rather than the kind of box-ticking exercise in reverse discrimination so beloved of the public sector race commissars. .The ability of football to act as a patriotic force for civic unity was highlighted by the black player Ashley Young, who said how ‘important’ it was that everyone in the squad ‘knew the national anthem and sang their hearts out.’ Thanks to Young and his team-mates, the nation is now singing its heart out – and it’s all thanks to penalties! "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/03/10/4DDED1F900000578-0-image-m-10_1530609325759.jpg","title":"Boy sits edge rooftop 33 STOREY building children 324 feet high","story":"A boy is filmed dangerously sitting at the edge of a rooftop at a 33-storey building in China (left).

This time it was Batty and Ince who missed despite the successful efforts of Shearer, Merson and Owen.In 2006 there was yet more quarter final misery when England faced Portugal. Three players missed this time - Lampard, Gerrard and Carragher - leaving only Hargreaves with a goal for the squad in the shoot-out. England faced similar failures in tournaments at Gelsenkirchen in 2006 and St Etienne in 1998, which were no doubt part of the reason why fans ahead of the Colombia game shared five pictures of Harry Kane, four of which were in disguises, proclaiming the meme to reveal \u0027England\u0027s five penalty takers\u0027. England will play Sweden in the quarter finals after they defeated Switzerland 1-0 this afternoon. Before tonight\u0027s match, hundreds took to Twitter to discuss the familiar England cocktail of expectation, doom, gloom and optimism - with one hilariously asking whether \u0027nerves\u0027 were enough reason to call in sick. Fans had already endured a roller coaster ride of emotions having gone from apathy to elation and then disappointment as England\u0027s World Cup has progressed. Isabella Rodriguez-Lockwood, who is half English and half Colombian, chose to wear the yellow shirt of her father\u0027s home country to watch the game in Lost Rivers, in London\u0027s Elephant and Castle.The 19-year-old from Croydon, who was born in Britain and has an English mother, said it is \u0027amazing having two completely different cultures\u0027 as part of her heritage.\u0027In my heart I do want them (Colombia) to win because they are very underrated,\u0027 she said.Quizzed on what she thought the score will be, she said: \u0027I have been thinking about it all night and day... I am going to say 2-1. It is so nerve wrecking.\u0027Expectations had been low for England following more than a decade of tournament failure, but a barnstorming win over minnows Panama wowed fans and commentators alike - as the nation\u0027s new golden boy Harry Kane netted himself three goals on the way to a 6-1 route.

The SNP has come under fire for forcing votes during England\u0027s World Cup knock-out clash with Colombia. Conservative Sir Bernard Jenkin (Harwich and North Essex, pictured, right) questioned if so many votes would have taken place if Scotland were in action.He raised a point of order to express his frustration as MPs marched through the ision lobbies for a second vote triggered by the SNP.Votes on four motions linked to public spending could only take place from 7pm - the kick-off time for England\u0027s second round tie.An SNP source highlighted before the debate that votes were likely given the party\u0027s frustrations with the estimates process and its lack of scrutiny, plus the fact one topic focused on devolved block grants.Sir Bernard asked: \u0027Do you suppose that the Scottish National Party would be calling so many isions this evening if it were Scotland playing an important football match this evening?\u0027Deputy Speaker Dame Eleanor Laing replied: \u0027I appreciate (Sir Bernard\u0027s) point of order which although it relates to the ision is not of course a point of order. And I just have a fervent hope that one day Scotland will be playing an important football match.\u0027One MP could be heard saying: \u0027I wouldn\u0027t hold your breath.\u0027Culture minister Margot James later approached SNP MP Westminster leader Ian Blackford and SNP Commons leader Pete Wishart as they chatted on their frontbench with Tory business minister Richard Harrington, and was heard to say: \u0027What about the people who work here?\u0027Several of the 35 SNP MPs were not present for much of the 90-minute debate linked to devolution, with numbers growing as it neared its conclusion.The SNP\u0027s Patrick Grady (Glasgow North) earlier joked: \u0027I understand there are hoards of people around London this evening looking for 90 minutes of entertainment on a green playing field.\u0027Where better to look than the House of Commons? I think we\u0027ve been thoroughly entertained and I\u0027m sure there\u0027s nothing else on this evening\u0027s line-up that could be as interesting for people.\u0027Replying for the Government, Treasury minister Liz Truss said: \u0027(Douglas Ross, Tory MP for Moray) asked where were the SNP during the debate. I think they were no doubt getting seats for the England versus Colombia match that we\u0027re all looking forward to later on.\u0027 Both of the nation\u0027s opening wins against Tunisia and Panama were broadcast on BBC, yet the 1-0 defeat was on ITV and led to calls for the game to be switched onto BBC.But ITV football anchor Mark Pougatch Tweeted: \u0027 Yes, yes I\u0027m well aware that apparently England\u0027s fate is all down to which channel they\u0027re shown on.\u0027Well, according to Henry Ford, \u0027History is bunk.\u0027 So come along for the ride with ITV.\u0027          Clive Tyldesley and former England manager Glenn Hoddle will provide the commentary to a programme ITV hope will become the most watched programme of 2018Clive Tyldesley and former England manager Glenn Hoddle will provide the commentary to a programme ITV hope will become the most watched programme of 2018.BBC said 18.3 million tuned in for its coverage of Tunisia v England which ended 1-2, while ITV said its audience peaked at 18.6 million for England\u0027s defeat by Belgium in the third group game.Football Supporters representative Kevin Miles said: \u0027The English FA returned 2000 tickets because there was no interest in them.\u0027The Colombians have sold out there allocation so there will be twice as many of their supporters in the stadium plus the many more who have bought them unofficially.          The Three Lions are heavy favourites to progress, according to bookmaker Ladbrokes, which said it was the most most popular England match ever with punters\u0027I think the game is going to be 50-50 as the Colombians are very confident.\u0027It has been a great tournament without any trouble at all and just like it should be, all the nations mixing and enjoying he football.\u0027England\u0027s record in knockout football is poor, going without a win since beating Ecuador in the World Cup in 2006. For England fans who have made the journey to Moscow, there was confidence but also nerves.          England are 815 favourites to progress to the quarter-finalBut Stuart \u0027Nobby\u0027 Clarke, 60, backed England to pick up the prestigious trophy if the Three Lions beat Colombia at Spartak Stadium.Mr Clarke, from Chilwell in Nottingham, who also travelled out for the three group games, said: \u0027I came here on Sunday on a one-way ticket until we win it - or we not winning it.\u0027If we get through tonight I think we\u0027ll go all the way. Definitely. That\u0027s what we\u0027re here for.\u0027It\u0027s a long time coming home. The first match I ever watched was the 66 final but I was eight and cannot remember much about it.\u0027We\u0027re always going to have nerves about tonight - it\u0027s the biggest game for us.\u0027The group games were relatively easy, really, nobody wanted to win the last game. The Belgians didn\u0027t, we didn\u0027t for obvious reason.\u0027A bit of apprehension for tonight but I think they\u0027ll go at it like they didn\u0027t against the Tunisians, hopefully score in the first 20 minutes.\u0027Onward and upwards. I\u0027ll stick my neck out and go 3-1 England. If I was a betting man I\u0027d put your mortgage on it.\u0027Dan Underhill, 38, from Gillingham, Kent, said \u0027it\u0027s got to be\u0027 when asked if this was England\u0027s best opportunity in decades.          England players appear in high spirits ahead of tonight\u0027s clash when they will face a decisive fixture against their Colombian counterparts in the knock-out stages \u0027Every game\u0027s a tough game but if there ever was a chance for us to progress it\u0027s now,\u0027 he said. \u0027All England fans, even the most optimistic of fans, would agree there\u0027s always that nervousness before a game.\u0027Every England fan I\u0027ve spoken to has said 2-0, but I think Colombia will score so 2-1. It\u0027s coming home, its coming home.\u0027Ben Clarke, 22, said this tournament is England\u0027s best chance in decades. Mr Clarke, an Ipswich Town fan from Needham Market, Suffolk, said: \u0027Let\u0027s hope we don\u0027t slip up because we could be left to rue this chance. I think this is one of the best chances we\u0027ve had to win it since those glory days of 66.\u0027He flew in on Monday with friend and fellow Ipswich fan Laurie Smith, 22, after deciding to belatedly join the World Cup party.He said: \u0027We were a bit worried, a bit apprehensive, \u0027what\u0027s it going to be like?\u0027\u0027We said, well, we\u0027ll come and see what this famous city has got to offer, take in the sights, see the game and hopefully England do the business.\u0027Harry Kane\u0027s off to a flyer so hopefully he\u0027ll make it number six or seven tonight.\u0027 Additional reporting by PA.   Sweden vs England - 2018 World Cup quarter-final: All you need to knowBy Harry Olsen for MailOnline Sweden and England  will meet in the quarter-finals of the 2018 World Cup after being victorious in their round of 16 clashes. The Three Lions won their last-16 clash against Colombia in shootouts (4-3) after Yerry Mina cancelled-out Harry Kane\u0027s spot-kick with a stoppage time goal.

I am technically eligible to become Pope, which is open to all Catholic males, but the College of Cardinals has not elected a non-cardinal since, I think, Urban IV. \u0027I\u0027m very unlikely to be the next Pope and I\u0027m very unlikely to be the next Prime Minister, for exactly the same reason.

One young relative was recently born with an extra urinary tract.Her husband had suffered such a high dose of radiation to his head he went on to have chronic headaches which led him to kill himself in 1976.Eric and Shirley had already had one daughter together before he was involved in the experiment. She was born healthy.However, 37 per cent of their descendants from children born after Eric passed through the radiation cloud were born with defects or unexplained medical conditions.These included skull deformities, missing or extra teeth and spinal problems.          The MoD continues to deny that Eric and his crew were subjects of an experiment, despite the emergence of new papersTwo of his four children with Shirley were born with abnormalities, as were some of their grandchildren and great-grandchildren.RAF hero Eric was involved in early tests into the radiation caused by atomic and hydrogen bombs.In 1958 he was stationed in the Pacific Ocean on Malden Island and Christmas Island - the site of Operation Grapples, which saw the UK carry out some of its earliest nuclear weapons tests.Eric was ordered to fly his Canberra B6 bomber through a cloud left in the wake of a 2.8 megaton nuclear explosion on April 28, 1958, documents reveal.X-ray badges were stuck to his seat to measure the barrage of radiation as he and two others entered the cloud.They were placed behind his head, on both armrests and by his groin.The documents reveal \u0027care was taken to ensure as little shielding effect as possible\u0027 was given to the X-ray badges. Of course, this meant Eric and his crew became vulnerable to the deadly radiation.The document was an Atomic Weapons Establishment paper looking at ways of testing the badges to make sure they were accurate.They detail the exact amount of radiation absorbed by the head, arms and groin and the bomber\u0027s pilot, navigator and wireless operator.They also note the time spent inside the cloud, the height of the plane and the time the bomber entered the cloud after the bomb detonated.The documents goes on to set out the pros and cons of the badges in measuring radiation. They also suggest re-running the experiment with more badges.          One of the documents showed Flight Lieutenant Denson recorded a radiation reading of 13 Roentgens after carrying out the flightWhen Eric\u0027s bomber touched down after the test he began to experience vomiting and developed a rash - common symptoms of radiation poisoning.The documents, written by scientists running the experiments, show that Eric, who was 24 at the time, had his head exposed to 65 years\u0027 worth of normal ­background ­radiation.This amounted to 17,500 dental X-rays worth of radiation during just six minutes of flight.The badge placed near Eric\u0027s groin recorded a dose of 8.8 Roentgens - about 30 years\u0027 worth of background radiation.In total he received 18.8Rs, the worst of the three-man crew which flew that day.Shirley is seeking an apology from the Ministry of Defence, who have insisted veterans were not used as guinea pigs during nuclear tests."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/03/09/4DDEDC4900000578-0-image-a-11_1530606342861.jpg","title":"Toddler gets hand jammed lift playing doors mother watches on","story":"    The boy\u0027s mother was standing right next to him when he got his hand trapped in the lift\u0027This is like Mao¿s China\u0027: Piers Morgan compares schools...Eddie Mair hits back at reports he left the BBC after...Trump threatens WTO, saying the U.S. will respond if it...Remains of burial horses from 2,700 years ago are found in...Share this articleThe boy was seen playing with the buttons and jumping around in the lift prior to the accident, with his mother standing right next to him.She did not appear to stop him playing  in the lift.The toddler then placed his right hand on the doors and they suddenly opened, taking his hand into the side panel with it and snagging his fingers. The desperate mother immediately squatted down and tried to pull her son\u0027s hand out but his fingers remained firmly jammed between the lift wall and the door, which was half open.   The boy was seen playing with the buttons and jumping around in the lift prior to the accident          The desperate mother immediately squatted down and tried to pull her son\u0027s hand out but his fingers remained firmly jammed between the lift wall and the door, which was half open  A passer-by rushed to their aid while the mother repeatedly pressed the alarm buttonA passer-by rushed to their aid while the mother repeatedly pressed the alarm button.Chinese net users have blamed the mother\u0027s apparent negligence for the accident. \u0027This mother does not deserve sympathy,\u0027 one said. \u0027She should take full responsibility of being a poor parent.\u0027\u0027She should take this as a lesson,\u0027 another said."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/03/10/4DDED29A00000578-5912749-image-a-32_1530610162081.jpg","title":"The ULTIMATE Grand Designs","story":"    This £30million mansion in Maidenhead, which boasts views of Windsor Castle, has been shortlisted for an international design award voted for by the public and is up against properties in the US, South Africa and the Caribbean          The UK property, pictured, has been nominated in the \u0027Modern Masterpiece\u0027 section of the HGTV Ultimate House Hunt competition and it comes with its own art gallery, a huge dining hall and a games pitch          Pictured are the stables at the property, which also comes with a horse track and a games pitch to make it a very attractive proposition while there is also a huge polo arenaThe competition is a joint venture between Leading Real Estate Companies of the World and Luxury Portfolio International.Of the finalists the most expensive property is a £30million manor in Maidenhead which boasts its own polo grounds and views of Windsor castle.Listed among the other finalists is a serene hideaway in the Hamptons in New York, a penthouse in the Johannesburg skyline, a Caribbean Island retreat.ROBERT HARDMAN: For 100 years, Binns (known as the Harrods...Would you turn this beautiful period property into your own...Householder is forced to put duct tape on his windows to...Share this articleStephanie Anton, President of Luxury Portfolio International, said: \u0027Modern architecture is really having its moment with today\u0027s affluent home buyer. \u0027Marked by distinct characteristics such as clean lines, bold cantilevers, large windows and minimalist style, we continue to see incredible demand for Modern around the world.\u0027As the selection of homes in this category reflect, this style is equally at home in a beautiful countryside or a city setting.\u0027           Another of the properties on the shortlist is this modern design in Hollywood, California, set in the hills that comes with a host of amenities including a bar, wine room and sculptures          The Hollywood home gives great views of the Los Angeles skyline thanks to its hillside location while many of the walls are made from glass, also enhancing the view and giving it a sleek design          Another of the US homes nominated is this \u0027haven in the Hamptons\u0027 in New York, which again features windows instead of walls around much of the property.

Now, critics it is strewn with rubbish and falling into disrepairBut fresh pictures show now nothing like it was back in its idyllic heyday when it was a popular and crowded bathing spot.Critics blame council cutbacks and say there are no bins which has led to streams of litter and broken bottles on the beach.The entrance path is also overgrown with nettles, brambles and grass so long it has turned to hay in the \u0027depressed and uncared-for\u0027 cove.Torbay Council admits there are no longer any rubbish bins on the beach and budget cuts mean there are no plans to clean it up.But Graham Stephenson, who lives nearby, says it is \u0027shameful\u0027 at what it has become.He has said that urgent action was needed to sort out what he described as \u0027Torquay\u0027s slum\u0027.

The footpaths are alive with weeds and dead palm fronds.\u0027The hedge beside the footpath is being strangled by weeds. The grass, which was long, was eventually cut, but not collected and so it has turned to hay which blows around in the wind. The weeds on this area are flourishing.\u0027The viewing area at the top of the hill has seating and several specially constructed palm islands which are now overgrown with weeds and the granite chips have spread on to the footpath. The black sacking round the palms is exposed and untidy.          Critics blame council cutbacks and say there are no bins which has led to streams of litter and broken bottles on the beach\u0027I walked down the footpath to Beacon Cove and was stung by nettles and scratched by overgrown brambles. I survived the journey to be met by the sight of litter and broken bottles on the beach.\u0027There is no bin which encourages visitors to leave their litter around. This cove has a sign saying no loud music, but most weekends are spoiled by noisy gatherings on the beach, with amplified sound, fires and tents. Not to mention the litter left behind.\u0027This area and the coastal path get a lot of visitors as well as locals. The rubbish collection points are inadequate for picnickers and parties and consequently the rubbish is just dumped and attacked by the seagulls.\u0027If the area is cared for better with adequate rubbish bins and signs showing penalties for leaving litter one could hope that it might improve.\u0027Come on, Torbay Council, get out and about on foot and see for yourselves what tourists see, and endeavour to do something about the shameful environment we find ourselves living in.\u0027Torbay Council said: \u0027Torbay Council strives to try maintain a good standard for all amenity areas, however with continued budget cuts this is becoming increasingly harder.\u0027Regarding Beacon Hill, we have asked our contractor to look at tidying up the planted areas and litter pick the stated area. There is no litter bin on the beach as unfortunately this was set fire to several times, hence the blue bin is now situated at the top of the path.

First, it is understood that none of the boys can swim and at least 1.5 miles of the route is understood to be flooded. It took four hours for the most experienced ers to reach the location.Furthermore, the path involves a narrow 400-yard section now completely underwater and so clogged with mud that visibility is down to nothing. One rescuer described it as \u0027swimming through cold coffee\u0027.In places, there is insufficient space for both a human and an air tank, meaning that ers have to remove the oxygen tanks from their backs and push them in front.The challenges of chaperoning weak and frightened children through such an ordeal are self-evident.Yet, the predicted run of bad weather may force the Thai government\u0027s hand.Throughout yesterday, further tales of heroism continued to emerge following Monday night\u0027s dramatic discovery by the British cave ers.Two Thai medics yesterday nobly volunteered to join the youngsters and remain with them for as long as it takes. Some reports suggest that it could be a four-month wait for the water levels to drop.           British ers Rick Stanton (right) and John Volanthen (left) were the first to reach twelve trapped schoolboys in the waters of the cave system in Tham Luang, Thailand           Foreign ers head to Tham Luang Nang Non cave to continue the rescue operation after the 12 boys and their coach were found alive in the cave          A first meal of rice and pork - packaged up in sealed portions - is being prepared for the youngsters, who have already been given energy gels and paracetamol. Pictured, a huge international team of rescuers has assembled at the mouth of the caveWhile they were all inside, however, a flash flood sealed off the exit forcing the boys to head further into the mountain. Armed with a single functioning torch, they managed to reach the spot where they have subsequently been discovered.We can only begin to imagine the mounting sense of fear and panic as the parents of the \u0027Wild Boars\u0027 football team went in search of their missing sons back on that evening of June 23.To put it in perspective – and we are talking about football-mad teenagers here – it was the night before England thrashed Panama in the World Cup. That is how long this lot have been missing. A local search party finally stumbled across some of the boys\u0027 bicycles locked to a fence and a pile of football boots. The mystery of where they had gone was solved. Now an even greater mystery lay ahead.The following day, the police found footprints and handprints inside the caves but heavy rain had made much of the cave system impassable. Families could only wait and try not to fear the worst, building makeshift shrines, making votive offerings and praying.

At some point soon thereafter, however, Messrs Stanton and Volanthen made their sensational discovery.News bulletins around the world were interrupted to announce their success. Here was a glorious good news story right up there with the great escapes of modern times – like the 33 Chilean miners trapped 2,300 feet below ground for 69 days in 2010. Except, of course, they had yet to escape.Initially, Rear Admiral Arpakorn Yookongkaew of the Thai navy said that there was no rush to move the boys as they were safe where they were. Others have since warned that the rain is the key factor.A \u0027comfort plan\u0027 has been put in place to aid the boys.Diving lines have been laid out so that other rescue team members can maintain deliveries of food, clothing and medical supplies with antibiotics and paracetamol already prescribed as a precaution. Any plan to walk and swim the boys out could take up to six hours per child and energy levels will be crucial.Perhaps even more impressive than their physical condition is their mental state. \u0027Really when you think about it: nine days, complete darkness, no food – that mental will to live,\u0027 said Captain Jessica Tait, a member of the US Air Force rescue contingent. \u0027And these boys have it.\u0027 Their families seem to have it, too.

Yet that happy ending is still some way off. Our thoughts may be focused on that fetid dungeon deep inside the mountain.For now, though, it is the sky above which will determine what happens next. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/03/10/4DDED1F900000578-0-image-m-10_1530609325759.jpg","title":"Boy sits edge rooftop 33 STOREY building children 324 feet high","story":"A boy is filmed dangerously sitting at the edge of a rooftop at a 33-storey building in China (left).

As the Pompidou holds a retrospective, the 93-year-old veteran of street photography praises the power of the ‘instant picture’‘I am coming!” Sabine Weiss shouts as she descends from her studio to greet me. At 93, the Swiss-French photographer is immaculately presented and immediately comes across as a force to be reckoned with – holding court in her Lilliputian home and studio that nestles in a plant-filled courtyard hidden behind a row of 19th-century apartment buildings, in Paris’s wealthy 16th arrondissement.The photographer and her late husband, the American painter Hugh Weiss, built the diminutive structure themselves, gradually converting a disused sculpture workshop measuring 5m x 5m into a place to live and work. This incongruous dwelling – home to Weiss for the last 69 years – proudly endures, much like its inhabitant, despite its perpetually changing backdrop. Hugh found the place in 1949, she says, through a connection in a Montmartre paintshop. “He told me, ‘It has no running water and only an outside toilet – it’s perfect!’” She laughs. “But we were happy. That is the most important thing, no?”Weiss is the last living member of the postwar humanist school of photography that includes such luminaries as Henri Cartier-Bresson, Robert Doisneau, Brassaï and Willy Ronis. Weiss objects to this classification, however, claiming her work is too varied to be reduced to a single historical moment, one that’s synonymous with the mid-century emergence of black-and-white street photography and photojournalism.Born in 1924 in the Swiss-French border town of Saint-Gingolph, Weiss bought her first camera, a cheap Bakelite model, with her pocket money at the age of eight and soon began developing her own film. She knew, before she had even left school, she was going to be a professional photographer. “At the time,” she says, “the idea of being a professional photographer was inconceivable. There were no books, no exhibitions. Maybe there were books in the States for very well-known photographers, but not in Switzerland.”Weiss’s circumstances were somewhat unusual. Her father was a skilled chemical engineer who encouraged his daughter’s aptitude for the technical processes of photography, helping her set up her own dark room in the family home, where she taught herself such techniques as salt-paper and silver-gelatin printing. “My family thought I would be a lab technician,” she says.Weiss completed two lengthy apprenticeships: the first with Studio Boissonnas in Geneva, renowned for its advanced photo processing the second with the German fashion photographer Willy Maywald, after she moved to Paris in 1946. Maywald was a master with lighting, says Weiss. In her three years with him, she learned techniques that would prove critical to her later remarkable versatility as a photographer.The largest exhibition of Weiss’s street photography to date – entitled Les Villes, La Rue, L’Autre – has just opened at the Pompidou Centre in Paris. It consists of images Weiss made mostly for her own enjoyment. “They are my secret garden, my spiritual nest egg, my personal intimate memory.” She never expected to see them in an exhibition, but enjoyed working with the curators. “They have picked some I would not have chosen.”As I sit with Weiss, poring over a lifetime’s work spread out on her coffee table, she has the air of someone who has seen much and regrets little. While many of her mostly male peers pushed their practice as an art form – Cartier-Bresson often insisted he was engaging in drawing or painting by other means – Weiss viewed her image-making as its own craft and embraced the label of photographer.She distinguished herself through sheer range, travelling continuously, photographing for the New York Times, Newsweek, Life, Vogue, Elle, and undertaking commissions for large institutions, notably Nato. But she also did advertising and fashion photography. “My skill, when I began working for myself alone in Paris, was that I already had a lot of experience. I had seven or eight years of photography behind me. When somebody asked me for a picture story – or for advertising, portraits, all kinds of things – I was able to do it.”Unlike Doisneau and Brassaï, Weiss’s street photography and reportage was never staged. “All the pictures I take are entirely instant,” she says. “What I like is to make an instant picture. Even if there are no people, I like the click, click, click. I never wait.”Weiss often had to carry heavy equipment, including multiple cameras, lenses and filters. She also routinely worked with children and animals. “In all these shoots I was alone,” she says. “I was outside in the park looking for babies. I was asking people to make me a glass bubble for one campaign, a wardrobe for another. I had also once to find a suit of armour, all sorts of things. Difficult sometimes, you know?” When I note that she seems equally proud of the photographs she produced for advertising as she is of her street photography, she agrees: “Yes, because sometimes they were very challenging technically.”Weiss has always been ambivalent about being included in exhibitions, viewing print publications as a perfectly suitable showcase. Remarkably, she didn’t even attend her first solo show of 55 photographs at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1954, writing to its curator to say she had too many work commitments in Paris. Nor did she see the celebrated 1955 MoMA exhibition The Family of Man, curated by Edward Steichen, for which the famous photographer travelled to Paris from New York to select three of her photographs.“This was when we still had no running water and I didn’t have a proper darkroom,” says Weiss. She has a simple explanation for her lack of interest in art world recognition: “I didn’t need to have exhibitions. My husband was a painter and he had to show his work. But I was working with all the magazines and they sent me copies, proof that I have done the work. I could see what I have done.”Weiss also concedes that she was too busy to go socialising with her photography peers in Paris and didn’t care to participate in all the mid-century theoretical discussions surrounding photography. These ideas were generated largely by the publication of Brassaï’s Paris at Night in 1933 – to which Henry Miller, Jean-Paul Sartre and other artists and thinkers responded – along with Cartier-Bresson’s The Decisive Moment. In this landmark 1952 publication, Cartier-Bresson outlined his preference for instant photography and dubbed himself “the velvet hand” with “the hawk’s eye”.Perfectly balanced compositions are undoubtedly Weiss’s great strength, but perhaps less well known is her remarkable ability to establish immediate connections with her subjects, no matter how fleeting the encounter. The warmth of her photographs is striking, particularly when compared with the sometimes clinical coldness of Cartier-Bresson’s street photography.Nowhere is Weiss’s ease with people more evident than in her black-and-white shots of children playing in the streets of 1950s Europe and the US. When I ask Weiss to identify her favourite photograph, there is a short pause as she leafs through the pile of contact sheets and prints sitting on the table. She retrieves a black-and-white shot of what looks like a five-year-old boy wearing only a threadbare pair of shorts and pretending to be a horse. The child is staring directly into the camera and is surrounded by his friends, who are looking at him with awe and delight. “I like this picture because he is playing with me,” she says. “He is showing me he is a horse.”Yet Weiss was equally adept at producing classic portraits of celebrated artistic figures, including Samuel Beckett and Joan Miró. She was friends with Alberto Giacometti, having met him in Geneva as a young woman, and photographed the artist, his studio and his work on multiple occasions.She once put a Giacometti sculpture into the back of her car and asked her husband to drive her and their eight-year-old daughter, Marion, to a lake in nearby Bois de Boulogne, where she wanted to photograph the artwork. Weiss placed the sculpture at the edge of the lake and then returned to her camera, put her head beneath the cloth – and suddenly heard a large splash, which terrified her. I expect her to tell me the sculpture had been destroyed, but she laughs and quickly says: “Luckily, it was only Marion. She climbed out of the water covered in tiny little worms!”• Sabine Weiss: Les Villes, La Rue, L’Autre is at the Pompidou Centre, Paris, until 15 October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5363bb672c7255c458d60aa9d2190723b73b0972/446_289_1566_939/master/1566.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a0267d0bea6ea57c73075c3d4f0ea65","title":"theaster gates the male caucasian world as weve known it is over","story":"Whether he’s saving condemned buildings, playing jazz or redistributing Frankie Knuckles’s record collection, the artist wants to spread the word about the black experience – and point the way to salvation“Maybe Basel will believe in black women, ’cos they’re going to see a lot of ’em,” says Theaster Gates with a laugh. He is standing in the middle of a room in the Kunstmuseum Basel, where he is preparing an exhibition on the theme of the Black Madonna. Amid the packing materials and exhibits waiting to be hung stands a roughly life-sized sculpture of a seated Virgin Mary. She holds an orb in one hand. On her lap sits baby Jesus, also holding an orb. Her features are eroded as if she has been cast from a weathered medieval statue. And she is very black – made of a shiny, plasticky-looking material that turns out to be tar. Gates uses tar a lot in his work his father was a roofer and bequeathed his son his tar kettle. “I feel like this is the Mary of my youth, ’cos it’s in tar,” says Gates. He leans in and sniffs her head. “Oh yeah, I know her.”He explains that this tar Mary was not based on a medieval statue but a plastic keyring, just a couple of inches high, that a friend gave him as a good luck charm. “The keychain was already old, so the limbs had been busted off. She was probably carried in someone’s purse or their pocket with their keys, and then the cares of this world tore her apart.”It is often hard to get a sense of scale with Gates’s work. At college, he studied urban planning and ceramics, and his work covers all points in between. He made his name a decade ago with an exhibition of pottery supposedly crafted by a Japanese master, “Shoji Yamaguchi”, who came to Mississippi and married a black civil rights activist. It was an elaborate fiction, complete with a mixed-race actor impersonating the potter’s son, but it got the art world’s attention. “White people love Japanese people,” he later explained. At the other end of the scale, there’s his Rebuild Foundation, which has spent the last six years buying up condemned buildings (including a neoclassical 1920s bank building) in the infamously deprived, predominantly African American South Side district of his native Chicago. With the blessing of the city’s mayor, Rahm Emanuel, Gates has refurbished these buildings and repurposed them as community facilities: workshops for artists, apartments, a library, a black cinema.In between, Gates has made art out of everyday materials, often salvaged from his buildings. He has become a collector and custodian of archives, including the image libraries of the influential African American magazines Ebony and Jet, and the record collection of Chicago house DJ Frankie Knuckles, who died in 2014. He lectures to town planners and is a professor at the University of Chicago. He also makes wild spiritual music with his band, the Black Monks of Mississippi. You never know what he’s going to do next – and you never have to wait very long to find out. “My hope is that people would start to see some through-lines between my works of art,” he says. The Rebuild projects, for example, were not only about community and regeneration. “They were more about one’s ability to understand space and power and politics, and then really be a player, an instigator, in one’s own environment. So even though I was a black man in a black neighbourhood, talking about black power, what I was trying to demonstrate is that an artist who reads the dynamics of a situation can change the situation.” One obvious through-line in Gates’s work is his consciousness of African American identity and experience. Another, which emerges in his work in Basel, is spirituality. “Over the last several years, the work has not shied away from subjects of faith, of what I call the immaterial world,” he says.Basel is an apt location. The city is a centre of the art world (or, at least, the art market) thanks to its annual Art Basel fair, and it is virtually the geographical heart of Europe. And it is not, it has to be said, a place where you see many people of colour – either on the streets or on the walls of its galleries. Kunstmuseum Basel’s permanent collection features a wealth of European representations of the Virgin Mary (who was, let’s not forget, Middle Eastern). One of these, by 16th-century Dutch painter Maerten van Heemskerck, Gates is incorporating into his own exhibition. In the painting, Mary has smooth, rosy-white skin and blond hair. She looks quizzically at the viewer, as if to ask, “Are you sure I look like the Virgin Mary?” Van Heemskerck’s Madonna will be juxtaposed with 13,000 images of 20th-century black women from Gates’s Ebony and Jet archives, including politicians, celebrities, unknown models and everyday people. “When I close my eyes and think of God, I see my mom,” he says. “I don’t see a white Jesus, I don’t see an oblique figure. Maybe there’s something really powerful about these unsung heroes that deserves attention today, or at least deserves my attention.” As well as cultural history, this is Gates reflecting on, perhaps even atoning for, his gender. “The work I make is really heavy, quite a substantial kind of male art – boy sculpture.” He flexes his muscles. But this is more a reflection on “the quiet and graceful power of women and of the mother”, he says. “Maybe, in this moment of the complexities of #MeToo, the retaking of power that women are asserting and articulating, that this male world, as we’ve known it, is over, that this Caucasian world we’ve known is over.” So the exhibition is “also a bit of a redemptive moment,” he says. There are other facets to the show. Gates connects Europe’s tradition of Black Madonna icons to Detroit’s Shrine of the Black Madonna, a black liberation theology group established by Bishop Albert Cleage in the 1960s, which put African American political self-determination into a context of religious faith. It was a big influence on him. Last Sunday, he visited Switzerland’s Black Madonna of Einsiedeln, he tells me. “It was amazing to see the power of this crazy, powerful set of symbols all around. I was like, the Catholic church has this figured out! That people need things, in order to get from themselves to the thing to beyond the thing.” Gates directs me to another piece he is installing: on the walls around his tar Madonna runs a continuous bookshelf that will contain 2,500 volumes, identically bound in black, with gold lettering. The books are another of his salvage missions: they were acquired from bookshops gone out of business and closed-down libraries, and are on African American subjects. He has arranged them so their titles can be read as a continuous poem, an “index to black experience”, as he puts it. Or as a prayer: When We March Come Out Smoking With Cloaks of Invisibility Giants With Wonder Spooks by Doors Martyrs When Necessary, and so forth. “If people have a moment to read my prayer, it means they’re also praying,” he says. Editions of this prayerpoem will be published throughout the exhibition in the room next door, which contains a heavy, 1960s Heidelberg printing press. Gates has borrowed it from the Basel Paper Mill museum, just up the road. “I almost feel like one part of the project is about me being a kind of new jack propagandist,” he says. “I’m Black Madonna Press, and my goal is the redissemination of the black image.”This is another of those through-lines that connects Gates’s work. Much of it concerns history things that might be lost or forgotten – saving them, preserving them, repurposing, reinserting them into cultural narratives, changing the situation. “One way I think about power is the ability to resurrect things that have been sleeping for a long time,” he agrees. It could be a condemned building or shop of discarded books or a 1960s image of an African American model, her hair straightened into a dynamic bob. Or it might be Knuckles’ record collection, which came to Gates simply because of his reputation for collecting things and liking house music. Rather than buying the records, Gates suggested Knuckles license them to him for 10 years. He invites DJs to come to his bank building and spin them and make mixtapes out of them. “It’s not about acquisition. The goal is to have these things keep circulating.”Spreading the word, resurrecting the dead, writing prayers, chanting with his Black Monks, positing his mother as the Virgin Mary (and therefore himself as Jesus) – the connections between art and religion are not lost on Gates, and there is the implication he’s positing himself as a spiritual leader, but he would rather frame it as an ongoing process of enquiry.Gates doesn’t go to church any more, but the church is always in him, he says. As a teenager, he was director of his local church youth choir. He once questioned whether to become an artist or a priest, a preacher or a scholar, a student of religion or of art. To some extent, they’ve all merged, Gates says. “Using the term ‘art’ gives me more latitude.”He develops the thought. “I’m really trying to find my place in a world of forms material and immaterial,” he says. “Even though I may have some questions about the form of God or the form that the immaterial world takes, I have no doubt about the truth of its presence. Eighty per cent of my practice is about reaching those things out of an immaterial world and trying to manifest them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ccf8539ce2e447bdcb694638265dca13fff0738/69_262_4754_2854/master/4754.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9deec1b88e3a9ce2a4f21cf9cbcf3db6","title":"global visions the 49th arles photography festival in pictures","story":"Robert Frank, Laura Henno, and Feng Li are featured at this huge event exploring everything from African spirituality to marriage in China and death in Ukraine"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/808842e28c7042a5fbc714c2fb566feb1a5d3c2b/0_51_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2158495c906dfec0da385c2d30163c4d","title":"all humanity has left the area the cities paying for tesla gigafactory","story":"Tesla’s battery factory brought high-paid tech jobs to Nevada – but is soaking up huge tax breaks that critics say have seriously depleted public servicesWhen Nevada enticed Tesla to set up a gargantuan battery factory in the desert, America’s gambling capital seemed to have hit the jackpot.The factory would have a state-of-the art 5.5m sq ft (510967 sq meter) facility – reputedly the world’s biggest building by footprint – and promised to generate tens of thousands of jobs, as well as investment worth $100bn (£76bn).Cities around the so-called Gigafactory in northern Nevada lined up to reap the bonanza. No longer dusty, provincial versions of Las Vegas, these municipalities would become innovative makers of lithium-ion batteries for electric cars and partners in Elon Musk’s vision of a clean-energy revolution.That was the pitch. These days many residents in Sparks – a sunbaked, low-rise city of 100,000 people located 20 miles from the factory – express humbler dreams: food, shelter, health care.“I’m not used to living this way,” said Katherine Pope, 69, a retired administrator who rents a small motel room and relies on food donations. “I can’t afford to move. Many times I can’t afford meat.” Another impoverished resident, a 70-year-old unemployed transcriptionist with a thyroid condition, faces a recurring dilemma. “Food or medicine, it’s one or the other.” A rent increase may soon compel another grim choice: sleep in her battered 1997 Saturn or in a homeless shelter.Down by the Truckee river you find others who feel cast out – families who have moved into trailer parks, which are packed to capacity, and people sleeping rough. “A year ago I was the caretaker of an apartment building and my wife was a caregiver. Then I lost my job. We couldn’t afford to rent anywhere so now we live here,” said Kevin McCullough, 48, who like his partner, Pixie, was sunburnt from outdoor living. Home is a tent by riverbank reeds.Such testimony conflicts with the official narrative that Sparks is booming – awash with jobs, money and newcomers. But you hear it from a largely hidden underclass which is paying a price for the boom. Some have a term for it: “Tesla’d.”One complaint is that tax credits given to Tesla – and to a lesser extent other tech companies – deplete public services, resulting in potholed roads, overcrowded schools and insufficient affordable housing.The other is that the tech worker influx has sent rents rocketing, tipping residents on fixed incomes, especially seniors, into penury.That was not the pitch in 2014 when Nevada beat rival bids from California and New Mexico to land the Gigafactory. It did so with exemptions from sales-and-use, property and general business taxes for 10 to 20 years, adding up to an estimated and unprecedented $1.4bn. The previous record, to lure an Apple server farm, was $88m. Brian Sandoval, the Republican governor, hailed the deal as transformative for a region still limping from the great recession. Today the factory sits behind a fenced swath of desert known as the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center (TRIC), which also hosts Google, Switch and Panasonic, among others, and bills itself the world’s biggest industrial park.Tesla’s “alien dreadnought” – Musk’s words – dominates. It is unfinished but already produces around 3,000 battery packs per week for Tesla’s Model 3 sedan. Thousands of workers and contractors have moved to Sparks and nearby communities, a boon for local hotels, landlords, builders, plumbers, electricians, taxi drivers and other service providers.Tesla receives credits based on jobs created, Ron Knecht, Nevada’s state controller, said in an interview. “They’re reaching their benchmarks significantly faster than expected.”Current Tesla projections suggest the credits are justified even if the ultimate cost is unclear, said Knecht. “If it pans out the way it looks, it’ll certainly be good for the economy. The state may break even but we’ll never really know.”A Republican, Knecht’s job is to protect taxpayers’ money. Figures from his office, supplied under a mandate for transparency in corporate welfare, show how much tax abatements reduced potential revenues for local authorities in fiscal year 2017. In the case of Tesla it was $68.7m.Credits to Musk’s company will soak up most of a tax revenue excess Nevada was due to record this year.The state compensates local government, said Knecht. Had Tesla never come there would have been nothing to tax, so the costbenefit remains murky. “You can get numbers all over the place.”Here’s one number that applies to Sparks: zero.Stephen Driscoll, the city manager, said despite surging population growth and increased strain on police and fire departments and schools, his annual budget had increased from $65m to $70m in the past two years – about the level of inflation. “So I’m at net zero.”Critics of the system say there is no doubt who ultimately pays. “It’s the working stiffs,” said Bob Fulkerson, of the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada. Schools in Washoe county, which includes Sparks, are overcrowded and deeply in debt, so much so that voters in 2016 approved a sales tax hike to help plug the gap. Even so, fresh budget cuts could eliminate bus routes for nearly 4,000 elementary and middle school students in an effort to save $550,000.Tesla, meanwhile, has sold $131m in tax credits to casinos thanks to transferable tax credits – the cherry on the cake used to lure Musk.“Corporate welfare is a way of life in these parts,” said Andrew Barbano, a veteran commentator. Ordinary people bore the brunt in the form of regressive sales and gas taxes and impoverished services, he said. “Nevada is addicted to hidden indirect taxes.”Robert Fellner, of the Nevada Policy Research Institute, said politicians had warped incentives. Rather than create a fair tax system and balanced growth they wanted to be able to point at giant factories and say “we did that”. Jenny Brekhus, a city planner and member of Reno city council, said Nevada could not afford corporate welfare. “I don’t believe you can be a low tax, low service state and play this economic development game where you give away tax revenue.”In Sparks the result is a stark gap between winners and losers. Home owners have seen values soar – but not property taxes, which are capped. Plumbers, electricians and builders have bountiful job options. “The factory is a good thing,” said Omar Alvarez, 28, a building contractor who earned $18 an hour plus generous benefits at Tesla’s factory. “Well, as long as you actually work there.”Residents on fixed incomes, in contrast, are facing surging rents, driving some to destitution and the brink of homelessness. Trailer parks which were half-empty two years ago are now jammed, said Alicia Siever, who manages the River’s Edge RV park. Motels and shelters have also filled. “I get depressed. All humanity has left the area,” said Pope, who used to work in an architect’s office. Her $700 per month ground-floor motel room is a dramatic comedown from her previous apartments. “But I’m grateful this place exists.”The unemployed transcriptionist declined to be named lest identification sabotage her last-ditch attempt to avoid eviction. Asked to name unaffordable luxuries, she replied: “Ice cream. Bacon. A movie ticket.”A troubling question now hovers over Sparks. Is Tesla itself a winner or loser?Having bet on the Gigafactory, the city’s fate hinges on the company’s success, said Richard Daly, business manager of Laborers’ Union Local 169. “Growth problems are better than recession problems.”But a spate of setbacks – layoffs, a churn of executives, workplace safety complaints, “autopilot” car crashes and a suit against a whistleblower – has put pressure on the firm. “Giving so much to Tesla was risky,” said Eloy Jara, another labour leader. “If they fail it could really hurt.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1102e3f70ac6724fe7789b39bbbd3d1bdc38b446/0_71_3532_2120/master/3532.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f40bcffaff8a0aaa586fa40ff20b7692","title":"a women only private island is not empowering it is elitist","story":"A trip to SuperShe Island in the Baltic Sea costs £3,500. But the trend for exclusive networking groups aimed at wealthy women only sets back gender equalityOff the coast of Finland, immured in the Baltic Sea, there is a private island where men are banned and only a select few women, with suitably large bank accounts, are allowed to set foot. It is called SuperShe Island and it is the international headquarters of the SuperShe society.When I first heard about this women-only island, I thought – rather hopefully – that it might be a SuperSapphic version of Love Island. Desert Island Dykes, perhaps? No such luck. There is nothing filthy about SuperShe Island rather, it is all about the lucre. SuperShe, you see, is basically an upmarket networking group for well-off women. If you have €4,000 (£3,500) to spare and you are willing to undergo a rigorous interview, it offers you the chance to spend the week on a “wellness” retreat miles from men, mingling with other affluent, influential women.Before any men start getting indignant, I should make it clear that SuperShe Island is not the product of a man-hating mind far from it. As Kristina Roth, the founder of SuperShe, explains on the website: “Women need to spend time with other women. Being on vacation with men can cause women to become sidetracked, whether it’s to put on a swipe of lipstick or grab for a cover-up.”It was quite the education reading this I had no idea straight women were so easily distracted by putting on lipstick for men. It made me worry about heterosexual people.SuperShe Island also offers lots of yoga (it is basically illegal not to do yoga at upmarket retreats), organic food and various life-improving exercises, including cognitive exercises to expel negative thoughts. I would love to know exactly how these cognitive exercises work, because the more I read about SuperShe Island (it has had a ton of press lately – there is something about banning men that seems to get people interested), the more my brain was besieged by negative thoughts. What fresh faux-feminist hell is this, I wondered. Please tell me this is not yet another example of a newly minted women-only space painting itself as empowering when it is clearly elitist?I say “yet another example”, because there has been a boom in bouji spaces exclusive to women. There is the Wing, for example, a fashionable women-only co-working space and social club with locations across the US and a space in London on the way. Membership costs from $2,350 (£1,800) a year and there is a waiting list. Then there is the AllBright, an exclusive women-only members’ club in London that opened earlier this year and costs at least £975 to join. There is Women Fest, too, the UK’s first all-female festival, which is scheduled to take place in August. (It costs £225 to attend, but some of the profits will go to a tree charity, so I guess that is OK.) I could go on, but you get the picture: the old boys’ club is being challenged.“Do you think I have big dyke energy?” I asked my girlfriend the other day. She looked me up and down and sighed. “Is this a Twitter thing? You really need to spend less time on Twitter, you know.”While it is true that I should spend less time on Twitter, the social network is also an invaluable source of useless information. Last week, for example, Twitter brought the concept of “big dick energy” into the national consciousness. A single tweet launched a thousand explainers in outlets ranging from the BBC to GQ to the . If you missed the column inches devoted to the concept, it basically means being hugely confident.But enough with the phalluses, please. Let’s talk about BDE 2.0, which is big dyke energy. The internet is yet to settle on an official definition of this, but it involves being comfortably self-assured without being cocky being confident without conforming to gender stereotypes. You don’t have to be gay to have big dyke energy, but you do have to challenge heterocentric norms about womanhood.Big dyke energy may sound like a throwaway internet joke, but trying to conceptualise what it means is a worthwhile exercise, because it gets you thinking about existing female tropes. There is the cool girl the crazy ex-girlfriend the old maid the Stepford wife the gold-digger the femme fatale the scorned woman the cougar the damsel in distress the ingenue and so on. When you start looking at how we categorise women, it quickly becomes apparent that most of these tropes revolve around men.What is great about the idea of big dyke energy is that it reflects a growing acceptance of women deriving their energy not from men’s approval, but from themselves.The political climate offers plenty of reasons to lie awake in a panic. But here is a new one: owls. I have always thought owls look evil, but I had never interrogated their malevolence. That changed when I watched a Netflix true-crime show called The Staircase and started reading about the murder trial it documents. You see, there is a theory that the woman who dies in The Staircase is the victim of an angry owl. While that may sound nonsensical, owl attacks are not uncommon. Indeed, last week, Iain Lee, a TalkRadio presenter, said he was viciously attacked by an owl. I don’t want that to prey on your mind, but please be careful out there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf618b5581afde05293019a4e222c62694b88a91/0_52_2352_1411/master/2352.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc59d23dba8683137500f5af301eb14a","title":"theresa may solution brexit customs conundrum open europe","story":"As the UK exits the EU, it will leave the EU’s customs union. Yet with just months remaining of the article 50 deadline, the government still doesn’t have a clear customs policy. It has not endorsed either of Whitehall’s two existing options, which the EU has pre-emptively dismissed. Theresa May needs to break the impasse at her Chequers Brexit cabinet meeting.Meanwhile the Labour party and some Conservatives demand a new customs union with the EU. Together they may have a majority in parliament, although this has not been tested. Whatever Labour claims, a permanent customs union would mean outsourcing trade policy to Brussels (where we would no longer have a seat at the table), and allowing the EU to sell access to our markets without our control. That’s not a sustainable long-term position.On the other hand, some Brexiteers too readily dismiss the serious and legitimate concerns of business, especially those with supply chains crossing the continent. Equally, both the UK and EU have agreed that Northern Ireland’s unique circumstances require specific solutions to avoid a hard border.A few weeks ago, the Brexit cabinet refused to back May’s preferred option of a new customs partnership, which would mean the UK collecting EU customs levies. The alternative – maximum facilitation (“max fac”) – would have to work as part of a broader customs agreement with the EU and will reportedly not be ready by the end of the transition. A possible third way on customs is due to be discussed at Chequers, but will need to address concerns of business and the Irish border.After Brexit, EU goods trade will cross a customs frontier. If efficiently managed – as much global freight already is – declarations can be completed electronically before goods arrive. Currently just a tiny proportion of non-EU shipments are physically inspected. Future EU trade should be no different. Importers can use bonded warehouses and other schemes to help further alleviate friction, but problems will still need to be resolved.When the UK becomes what EU treaties define as a “third country”, Brussels would require regulatory checks to ensure imports comply with its rules. The non-partisan and independent policy thinktank Open Europe, which I am director of, has proposed ​ that the UK aligns with EU goods regulations (which many British industries will choose to do anyway). This would mean being a rule taker in those areas, but mutual recognition would allow goods to move freely with the EU. It seems likely that the government will endorse our plan at Chequers.A customs union is an agreement by a group of countries, such as the EU, to all apply the same tariffs on imported goods from the rest of the world and, typically, eliminate them entirely for trade within the group. By doing this, they can help avoid the need for costly and time-consuming customs checks during trade between members of the union. Asian shipping containers arriving at Felixstowe or Rotterdam, for example, need only pass through customs once before their contents head to markets all over\u0026nbspEurope. Lorries passing between Dover and Calais avoid delay entirely.Customs are not the only checks that count – imports are also scrutinised for conformity with trading standards regulations and security and immigration purposes – but they do play an important role in determining how much friction there is at the border. A strict customs regime at Dover or between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would lead to delays that will be costly for business and disruptive for travellers. Just-in-time supply chains in industries such as car making could suffer. An Irish peace process built around the principle of entirely unfettered travel between north and south could be jeopardised.A UK-EU trade deal would remove tariffs on goods, and matching rules should eliminate the need for regulatory checks. But the issue of rules of origin remains, which would also have to be checked. These require exporters to demonstrate the proportion of a product’s value that is local. If the proportion “originating” in the UK – made or transformed there – falls below an agreed floor, the product would no longer count for preferential trade.These rules of origin are intended to prevent unfair trading practice. The EU might worry that a future UK-US trade agreement could mean cheaper American car parts ending up in British cars, that then undercut European manufacturers. Rules of origin limits and checks won’t matter much for some product types or industries. But for companies with complex supply chains, they will be an important consideration as well as a potential source of disruption at the border.So for certain industries – cars and chemicals for example – the government could commit to matching some of the EU’s own external tariffs and relevant aspects of its trade policy for a time-limited period after Brexit. The purpose would be to achieve, in return, the most liberal and light-touch regime possible on rules of origin for those sectors.If the government chose to align tariffs in particular sectors, that would reduce opportunities to reduce domestic prices on those products. But the UK would be able to reduce tariffs in non-matched sectors.Future UK customs arrangements will rely on technology that is not yet operational. Reports yesterday that Eurotunnel is developing a new system to clear lorries automatically as they drive through its terminal are encouraging. But it seems likely that UK customs infrastructure will be not ready for the end of the standstill transition, given the government’s slow progress. On that basis it may be necessary, as I’ve already suggested, to remain in lockstep with EU customs policy for a little longer, then to liberalise aspects of our trade policy while agreeing to match specific sectors for a decade or so to help protect those industries.Some will worry that committing to match EU tariff levels on some industries would limit our ability to negotiate trade deals. But this compromise approach, which would work alongside other options to facilitate trade, is clearly preferable to a full customs union which would leave the UK tethered to all EU tariff lines or indeed to an unwieldily customs partnership. It might make sense in the longer-term to pursue general tariff liberalisation but with a hung parliament, and nervous businesses delaying investment, the government needs a way through on customs – and this might just be it.• Henry Newman is the director of Open Europe"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56669387bbe97d8ed3261e9dd6a18627275c1a0a/0_0_650_398/master/650.jpg?w=940\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=48aa3b7ac57608a9355f118bc24407e0 1880w","title":"armani prive celebrates the atelier in haute couture show","story":"Giorgio Armani sets the tone for the awards season with colour pops and voluminous gownsThe loudest conversation at this run of Paris couture shows has concerned two matters: who is couture for and, more pressingly, how exactly is it made? The first can probably be answered by looking at the front row: VIP clients with large chequebooks. But the second is more nuanced, and best answered by designer Giorgio Armani – who emerged from behind a curtain at his Privé show to retrieve a small black feather which had fallen from the cape of the 85th gown before taking his bow. A helpful reminder, then, that couture is made by hand. Otherwise, things ran like clockwork. The Italian designer showed his collection within the gilt rooms of the Italian embassy on Tuesday evening. On thick parquet flooring, under two chandeliers so enormous the models came close to brushing their heads, Armani offered a primer on red carpet dressing. Privé – the exclusive collection that Giorgio Armani shows during Paris haute couture week – is a reliable indicator as to what we’ll see on the red carpet come awards season. The collection was just shy of 100 looks and themed around a cocktail dinner, arriving in several acts, punctuated with colour and a short pause backstage between acts. Things began simply: classic jacquard and velvet suits followed by playful takes on the tuxedo shape came in black and champagne – incidentally the colour of the font on the invitation, a colour scheme which bookended the show. There was even a waistcoat, albeit one more elegant and slick than Gareth Southgate’s.  Then came the gowns, designed, read the notes, “to reveal the refined meticulous work of the atelier”. In short, this meant gowns made from hundreds of metres of tulle voluminous skirts made of feathers a headpiece made from a cloud of chiffon, and an ultra-tight velvet jumpsuit with one cream arm which made a rushing noise as it passed.The Armani colours were fantastical and sweet-like, pairing fuchsia with sapphire, turquoise and jade. Occasionally crystals and sequins decorated a look. Those on the fence of high glamour could go for a harlequin jacket but otherwise colour-wise looks were monochrome or bright – one or the other. The styling tics were more accessible. If Privé is anything to go by, large dangling earrings in pops of colour which clash with your outfit are a safe bet on your night out next season. Costume jewellery and pearls are another go-to. And the hair tuck is the key way to show off your danglers.If this collection goes some way to dictate the mood at the Emmys (which take place in September) then the top line is split neatly in two: minimalism and maximalism. Suits or froufrou. Even the shoes sit in two camps – “sporty moccasins”, Armani’s words, and others heels of a soaring height, both of which were worn with gowns. Business is booming, says Armani, who reported strong demand for his Armani Privé collection. “Our targets have been reached, and this result shows a constant trend,” the Italian designer said recently, adding that his eye was on “the Chinese audience”. Given the state of gender power politics, who knows what will happen on the red carpet. But Armani’s message is simple – go loud or go home."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a0efca1a0d8adb86f998516b772f16a533329ec/0_237_5439_3263/master/5439.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ecf735efc9ca700a384ab346cf76feb2","title":"fashion week image of the day a walk along the seine at chanel","story":"For his autumnwinter 2018 couture show, Karl Lagerfeld recreated those quintessentially Parisian book boothsChanel’s creative director, Karl Lagerfeld, was feeling bookish this season – or so implied the unmistakable Parisian book booths, usually found along the Seine, that he recreated for his autumnwinter 2018 couture show this afternoon.

Eric Dier, England’s fifth penalty-taker was setting off on his victory run, soon to be submerged by his teammates. Gareth Southgate had forgotten, yet again, he was supposed to be nursing a dislocated shoulder and here was the hard proof that England, contrary to the impression they might have given for much of the previous 30 years, did know how to win a penalty shootout, after all.It was a euphoric and nerve-shredding finale and these are the moments, surely, when England’s followers could be forgiven for daring to dream that something special is building, something exhilarating and rare. Yes, it would be dangerous to get too carried away but right here, right now, to hell with anyone who insists it is time for restraint. England have arrived in the quarter-finals and the World Cup is suddenly filled with all sorts of new possibilities.This was their first knockout victory in a World Cup for 12 years. It was only their seventh, in any major tournament, since 1966, and now they face Sweden on Saturday for the right to play Russia or Croatia in the semi-finals.Southgate had told us he wanted England’s penalty-takers to “own the process” and they did just that, eventually. It was a close-run thing but Jordan Henderson’s miss – or, rather, David Ospina’s save – mattered little in the end because of Mateus Uribe hitting the crossbar with Colombia’s fourth effort and Jordan Pickford saving the next one from Carlos Bacca, ensuring Moscow 2018, will be remembered much more happily than Turin 1990, Saint-Etienne 1998, and Gelsenkirchen 2006, and not forgetting the European Championships at Wembley 1996 Lisbon 2004 and Kiev 2012.An hour after the match, England’s supporters were still partying at one end of the stadium. They did not want to leave and who could blame them when, after three penalties each, England were one down and staring at another harrowing story of deja vu?Dier joined Harry Kane, Marcus Rashford and Kieran Trippier in showing why all that practising of penalties on the training ground was necessary. Kane had also scored from 12 yards to give England the lead shortly before the hour and it was not until the third minute of stoppage time that Colombia prolonged the match by concocting the equalising goal. Another team might have wilted after such an agonisingly late equaliser. That, however, was one of the more impressive parts of England’s performance. Dier might have won the match with a free header in the second period of extra time. Danny Rose, another of England’s substitutes, had a golden chance and in the extra 30 minutes there was hardly a single moment when it felt as though Southgate’s players might go under.This was only England’s second shootout victory in eight attempts at major tournaments, the other coming against Spain in Euro 96, and in the process they answered so many questions about their nerve and temperament for the big occasion. Ever since he took the job Southgate has been asked whether his team could cope when the heat of the battle was dangerously close to intolerable. We know now that, yes, they do. Yet the shootout was only part of the story against tough, obdurate opponents – “animals” according to Chris Waddle in his radio commentary – on a night when Colombia’s supporters had filled this stadium in swathes of bright yellow, bouncing and swaying like human blancmange and creating a raucous din.They bellowed the words of their national anthem – Oh gloria inmarcesible – and outnumbered their English counterparts in a way that is rarely seen. Yet just consider, for example, Kane’s competitive courage when he had his first penalty and Colombia’s players, to put it bluntly, lost the plot about the decision to penalise Carlos Sánchez for grappling him to the floor at a corner. The protests were so chaotic Kane’s penalty was delayed by almost four minutes. What nerve the captain showed to improve his position at the top of the Golden Boot scoring chart – his sixth goal and his third penalty.Colombia might have been missing the injured James Rodríguez but they still occupied a superior rung of the football ladder to Tunisia or Panama or the scratch Belgium XI who England encountered in the group stages. But Southgate’s team were never cowed. The manager had instructed them to play with freedom, to show adventure, to hold out their chests and demonstrate they knew how to take care of a football, too. True, they found it difficult to get behind the Colombia defence and looked more dangerous from set pieces rather than open play. Yet their opponents barely troubled Pickford throughout 90 minutes and that in itself felt like an achievement against a side featuring Radamel Falcao, Juan Cuadrado and Juan Quintero.The evening might have been a lot more straightforward if the correct decision was made, towards the end of the first half, when Wilmar Barrios took exception to Jordan Henderson’s proximity to the defensive wall and dealt out his retribution by lifting his head into his opponent’s jaw. Henderson ended on the floor and Barrios was so lucky to escape with only a yellow card he could be seen shaking the hands of the match officials at half-time.The uproar before Kane’s penalty was shocking in other ways but Southgate had told his players not to react to the provocation and, in that respect, the game against Panama was a valuable lesson.Colombia still had more than half an hour in normal play, plus five minutes of added time, to concoct an equaliser. They spent most of that time arguing with the referee, feigning injuries and trying to pick fights. But then, in the 93rd minute the substitute Uribe let fly with a 30-yard volley. Pickford’s flying save was exceptional but it was Yerry Mina against Harry Maguire at the resultant corner: Colombia’s tallest player against England’s. The man in yellow won the header, the ball bounced off the turf and Trippier did not have the height to stop it on the line.Would it be the same old story for England? It felt that way after Falcao, Cuadrado and Luis Muriel scored Colombia’s first three penalties of the shootout. Instead, Pickford had a heroic role in the victory. Dier’s penalty was not entirely convincing but Ospina was face down, distraught, and the victory run was under way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51c131ea04976aba99ddeccb9faaaf1815fd8fb9/0_6_5208_3125/master/5208.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f45e56fd70ee212aa389ea94a0ad221","title":"colombia south london expats england world cup","story":"The air in Elephant and Castle was hot and thick. It has been like this for days across south London and at times it’s been too much. Suffocatingly so. But not on Tuesday, given the breeze that was also whipping around, offering sweet relief to commuters and passersby alike.Nowhere was it stronger than on Elephant Road, a strip of small businesses located underneath the railway station and where this area’s strong Colombian community regularly congregate. There are Colombian restaurants here, such as Lenos \u0026amp Carbon, as well as delicatessens, such as La Fama. And there are bars, none more popular than the Colombian, or so it seemed from the queue of people that had formed outside the venue by 4pm. They stood waiting underneath fluttering flags, most dressed in yellow, blue and red, the colours of Los\u0026nbspCafeteros – excitement building ahead of battle with England.By 5.50pm it was standing-room only inside and, while a smattering of the 350-strong crowd were England supporters, the majority had come to cheer on Colombia, any sense of ided loyalties among a group of people who can trace their lives in London back to the first wave of Colombian immigrants that arrived to the United Kingdom in the early 1980s left at the door.“We’ve had big nights here before but not with this much excitement, and that’s definitely because we’re playing England,” said Mateo Quintero, the 20-year-old son of the bar’s owner, César. “There’s a big Colombian community in Elephant and Castle of the eight arches located on this road six are used by Colombian businesses, so this game is like home versus home. But Colombians are really passionate about their national team and want them to win, no matter who they’re playing.”That much could be taken from the blowing of whistles and banging of tables that broke out when pictures of the team arriving at the Spartak Stadium appeared on the seven wall-mounted screens located across this Tardis-like venue, with fever pitch reached on the playing of the Colombian national anthem, via Moscow, at 6.54pm, Oh Gloria Inmarcesible met by a firing of confetti and the gusto of an army going to war.Pre-kick-off excitement quickly gave way to nervousness given England’s early domination. It was not going how the crowd here wanted and, sensing that, the in-house DJ called for chanting: “Co-lombia! Co-lombia!” The call was met but halfheartedly so and it was not until Juan Quintero’s shot just before half-time that those in attendance rediscovered their excitement. That led to more blowing of whistles – and here’s the thing about lots of whistles being blown at the same time: it’s really annoying. Imagine someone jabbing a pencil into your temple. That.Mercifully the whistling stopped as the second half started, only to return as Harry Kane stepped up to take his 57th‑minute penalty in a cosmic attempt to put the striker off his stride. It did not work and soon Spanish words of fury filled the air.As the mood darkened, César continued to serve behind the bar while Mateo watched from among the hordes with clear despair. Hope was slipping away – but then it all changed, with Yerry Mina’s late header leading to wild screaming, dancing and, yes, those whistles.Colombia Tierra Queirida, a popular song from back home, played in the minutes before extra time, during which the DJ then led a chant of “Olé! Olé! Olé!” and this time was met by an emphatic response. They believed in Colombia in the Colombian but ultimately it was not to be. The lights came on after the penalty shootout and most of those in yellow, blue and red quietly walked into what was now a dark and cool night."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1421c701b2824f67a0f08fb2210183e28368149/0_172_4524_2715/master/4524.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c83f822f616a5d22b39ebf48ab14ed36","title":"england colombia jordan pickford ratings world cup","story":"Jordan Pickford was the outstanding England performer as his key penalty save earned them a World Cup quarter final placeDavid Ospina Failed to stop Kane’s penalty in normal time and saved only one, from Henderson, in shootout. 6Santiago Arias A solid performance but was not able to influence the game.

Written off at the beginning of qualification, they elbowed out the Netherlands en route to a play-off against Italy. Nobody gave them a chance in that contest but, once again, they found a way to win.Spool forward to the finals and did anybody have them down to emerge from a group that contained Germany and Mexico? They did, finishing on top of it. Germany had become their latest big-name scalp.Football fans would not necessarily put Switzerland alongside the Netherlands, Italy and Germany in terms of European powerhouses but Vladimir Petkovic’s team do sit sixth in the Fifa rankings. They entered this last-16 collision as the third-highest-ranked nation left in the World Cup.Now they, too, are gone. Sweden advanced on the back of a moment of good fortune but nobody could say that they did not deserve it. Emil Forsberg, the game’s most eye-catching player, took a pass from the left and he dropped his shoulder to buy a yard of space from Granit Xhaka.The shooting chance had opened up but Forsberg rather scraped the right-footed effort, hitting it low and in the direction of the Switzerland goalkeeper, Yann Sommer, who looked set for a routine save. Then, fate intervened. The ball squirted off Manuel Akanji and it flew into the top corner.Sweden might have added to their advantage in stoppage time when the substitute Martin Olsson was pushed by the chasing Michael Lang as he ran clean through. Initially, the referee, Damir Skomina, signalled for a penalty but it was recast upon VAR into a free-kick. The offence had taken place just outside the area. Lang was sent off and Ola Toivonen’s free-kick was saved by Sommer. It did not matter.Sweden were the more proactive team and the bulk of the clearest chances was created by them. It was yet another triumph for Janne Andersson and there was a moment for the manager to cherish when he emerged 15 minutes after full time to take the acclaim from the delirious Sweden supporters. They clapped in unison and belted out his name. He described it as “surreal” and “quite extraordinary”.Andersson has built this team and it is one in the truest sense, considerably more than the sum of its parts. They were powerful, physical and, once in front, difficult to overhaul. It was also interesting to hear Petkovic suggest that Sweden had taken the sting out of the game and made it impossible for his team to generate any aggression or drive.“I’ve seen Sweden’s other games and all of their opponents have had a hard time developing those emotions against them,” Petkovic said.To dismiss Sweden as passion-killers would be unfair and Petkovic did accept that his team had deserved nothing, having failed to play with fluidity or incision. They were sluggish and sideways, their final pass poor and it was an indictment when Petkovic said that “maybe we were not focused enough”.Something was missing and, although Switzerland pushed in the final 10 minutes, it was too little, too late. The substitute Breel Embolo saw a header blocked on the line by Forsberg – who else? – and Robin Olsen kept out another header from another substitute, Haris Seferovic. It was the only time that the Sweden goalkeeper was seriously extended.Sweden were by far the more threatening team in the first half and, when they went in at 0-0, the worry for them was that they might live to regret their lack of cutting edge.The big chance fell to Albin Ekdal on 40 minutes and he sank to the ground in dismay when he ballooned a side-foot volley when perfectly placed. Mikael Lustig had provided the cross from the right and nobody had tracked the run of Ekdal. It was a grisly moment.Lustig would be booked for a pull on Josip Drmic to incur a suspension for the quarter-final and Andersson reported that Ekdal had hurt an ankle. He will need a scan.Sweden had other first-half flickers, one sparked by a loose clearance from Sommer. Ekdal returned the ball immediately and Marcus Berg had a shot blocked. On the rebound, Ekdal drove high.Moments earlier, Toivonen’s lovely flick had got Berg away to the right of centre. The angle was inviting, if not straightforward, but he sliced wastefully. Berg also forced Sommer into a ing save with a nicely executed side-on shot. The striker remains without a goal at the finals.Switzerland quickened the pulse only once before their late flurry when Blerim Dzemaili swapped passes with Steven Zuber in the 38th minute. The return ball was cut back cutely but Dzemaili blasted his shot high.Forsberg is perhaps Sweden’s only star name and the wide midfielder showcased his touch and quick feet. He had several nice moments, including one shortly after half-time when he wriggled away from the referee, who had got himself into a bad position, before beating Valon Behrami and Dzemaili. The Sweden fans roared. The move ended up with Toivonen shooting wildly.Forsberg looked the most likely player to unpick the stalemate and so it proved, even if Akanji’s role in the goal was prominent. Switzerland had dreamed of a first quarter-final appearance since 1954 but they would depart with regrets. Sweden march on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1aae40f8c21c28ea59991a37a0a2cc8a835a06b1/0_125_3635_2180/master/3635.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=07d7a5afe77baa7adbba93955c30525d","title":"englands penalty heroics sweden march on and quarter finals to savour world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss England’s first ever penalty shootout win at a World Cup, Sweden progressing, a Mrs Granqvist update, Paul Konchesky and which of our panellists dealt with tonight’s football the best"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbf57c9902b2e7771039a0e8c701fdae10e8a731/0_140_4105_2463/master/4105.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc940b3dbfb6175f0153afca0d412278","title":"world cup 2018 colombia v england buildup live","story":"That’s it from me.

Good.Apart, perhaps, from the penalties, here are the best shots taken today:“Fantastic. I think we deserved it, as well. We played so well in the 90 minutes. We’ve shown incredible resilience to come back from huge disappointment at the final whistle. It’s a huge credit to all our players and every member of staff.”“Shootouts are tough but we talked long and hard about owning the process. We kept calm. Again, great credit to all our staff and all the players who’s taken it on board. WE got our rewards tonight ... We looked at inidual technique and how we needed to be as a team.”“This was special but I want us to go on now. Sweden is another team we have a poor record against. We’ve underestimated them for years. They’re brilliant at what they do.”Asked about “provocation” by Colombia during today’s match, he says: “We didn’t rise to it, which was brilliant. In general. There were a couple of occasions when we did. But overall it was exceptional.”Martha Kelner witnessed all the dram in Moscow and here’s what she made of it:And you can add your player ratings here: Trippier reckons he could have done better for Colombia’s goal. “We played really well in the first half. For their goal, it was a mistake by myself I think. I thought he was going to head it straight down but he headed it into the ground and it went over me and in. I was gutted.” He also echoes Pickford’s confidence about how the shootout would end. “You know there’s always going to be a shootout in tournaments like this and we just practiced on the training field when we were fatigued. The lads all took good penalties. There’s no need to keep changing, just put it in one spot.”Dier is momentarily lost for words when asked to describe his winning penalty but eventually holds forth. “I’ve never really been in a situation like that before but I felt like I had to score after that header I missed at the end so I’m thankful I scored.” Then he praises Pickford, who’s standing beside him. “He was incredible. He’s a fantastic keeper with a fantastic attitude. He deserves it.”Pickford then describes his experience and comes across as impressively solid: “I did a lot of research on them, for starters, so we had a fair idea. Falcao is the only one who didn’t really go his way. And I’ve got power and agility to help me get around the goal, I don’t carer if I’m not the biggest ... Our mindest and mentality, we never stopped. We knew we had this game even if it went to penalties.”Here’s a report on that historic match from our man in MoscowIt must be said, all of England’s penalties were well taken - Dier’s was perhaps the worst, funnily enough, even though Henderson missed (Ospina made an excellent save). Recompense, then, for all the work Southgate has put into preparing his team for exactly this denouement. Pickford made one fine save from the spot before Dier clinched victory.Dier steers a crisp low shot beyond Ospina and into the bottom corner.

People should also all be doing tai chi, weight lifting or ballroom dancing – although carrying home heavy shopping bags might do the trick.Aerobic exercise, such as walking or gardening, is good for the heart and improves the circulation. PHE’s review said that muscle and bone strengthening and balance activities are also vital for health and future wellbeing, but they are neglected. “People’s understanding of walking more and doing aerobic activity, keeping up the heart rate, has grown, but the need for us all to do two sessions of strength and balance exercise a week has been the Cinderella of public health advice,” said Louise Ansari from the Centre for Ageing Better, a charity set up with lottery funding a few years ago which co-wrote the review with PHE.In 2011, the UK’s four chief medical officers issued guidance containing three pieces of exercise and activity advice, but only some of it has been well followed. Walking has become increasingly popular. But fewer people have taken on board the need to stand more and sit less and muscle strengthening and balance have been largely forgotten. Muscles tend to be at their peak in our 30s, said Ansari, and the muscle tone is going by the time we reach 40 unless we actively work on it. The best forms of exercise, according to the review of evidence, are ball games, racket sports, dance, Nordic walking and resistance training – usually training with weights, but including body weight exercises which can be performed anywhere.These exercise both arms and legs, strengthening muscles and helping us keep our balance. In Nordic walking, for instance, two poles are used. Ansari said the type of exercise required depends on a person’s fitness.. “If you are a reasonably fit adult and you do walking, you should also do yoga or tai chi or racket sports or resistance training which could be in a structured exercise class. You can do two long sessions a week.“I do an hour and a quarter of tai chi every week. That helps with my balance. I should also do something like badminton and circuit or resistance training.”But exercise doesn’t have to be in a gym, she added. “You can also make sure you go up and down stairs a lot instead of taking the lift. That is resistance training. Your body is providing the resistance. You don’t have to go to the gym. As long as you are feeling the ache in your muscles.”Dance of all sorts is good for muscles and balance, from folk to salsa to ballroom. “If you don’t feel you can go to a full-on dance class because you are a bit frail, standing on one leg for 30 seconds a day or tai chi are very good.”Ansari said she doesn’t use a gym. “I don’t go and lift weights, but I make sure I’m carrying shopping home and carrying things around – consciously lifting weight.”The advice is not just for the elderly. “Alongside aerobic exercise such as brisk walking, all adults should be aiming to do strengthening and balancing activities twice per week,” said Dr Alison Tedstone, head of diet, obesity and physical activity at PHE. “On average we’re all living longer and this mixture of physical activities will help us stay well in our youth and remain independent as we age.”The evidence review now goes to the four chief medical officers, who will update the guidance next year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8eafa44176bd7c30910bc46d943163caa8873ef0/32_61_3934_2360/master/3934.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d71f82eab27b8020de080a6bc61471cc","title":"bbc teen viewers box sets iplayer netflix","story":"New teen section of iPlayer will target younger viewers who currently favour NetflixThe BBC is stepping up its rivalry with Netflix and YouTube to win back teenage audiences by making box sets of bingeable “rite of passage” shows covering subjects such as sex education, cars and alcohol for a new teen section of BBC iPlayer.The new programmes – two of which will be presented by YouTube vloggers – will be available on a new section on BBC iPlayer and – unlike other shows on the platform, which can only be accessed for up to 30 days – will remain there for up to five years.With the corporation recently revealing that more younger viewers are watching Netflix than all of its TV services, BBC Children’s head of content, Cheryl Taylor, said the proliferation of new platforms highlighted the gap in the choice of programmes available for those too old for children’s channels CBeebies and CBBC and too young for BBC3, which is aimed at 16- to 34-year-olds. “You don’t see ordinary teens that much on the BBC or shows about those kind of coming-of-age, sensitive subjects, which are key at a really important time in children’s lives … it’s important we remain relevant to all children,” said Taylor.The BBC has traditionally been deterred from airing more grown-up programmes on CBBC – which is for 6- to 12-year-olds – and on iPlayer because, Taylor said, “we don’t want to upset children and show them inappropriate content”. Other highlights range from summer-camp drama The A List, to Teen Taxi – a sort of Gogglebox meets Car Share real-life series that “will shine a humorous and engaging light on the conversations had between teenagers and their parents as they travel in their family cars”. Also on offer is a “junior Panorama”-style documentary series covering subjects such as teenagers emerging from foster care, boys becoming men, and life in eco-communities. CBBC doctors Chris and Xand van Tulleken will front special programmes on mental health and alcohol. Taylor said the YouTubers were chosen because they were already role models who influence children, but both she and BBC Children’s head of discovery, Stuart Rowson, said they hoped the BBC would grow its own influencers of the future. It is vital for the BBC’s future to bridge the gap for teenagers to stop them deserting the corporation as they are the licence fee payers of the future. Tony Hall, the director general, recently said that with the rise in power of US tech giants such as Facebook, Amazon and Netflix, the BBC had “a fight on our hands … a fight for the future of not just the BBC, but public service broadcasting in Britain”.Hall said the corporation risked being overtaken by competitors after finding that 16- to 24-year-olds spent more time with Netflix in a week than with all of BBC TV including the BBC iPlayer. Rowson said: “We need to react to the way young audiences are consuming content. This will give them bespoke content they can access on iPlayer, which has traditionally been a catchup service but is now working to become a video-on-demand service that we hope teenagers will go to as their default destination.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa92a0511397bf93a439973f9feb01242614c357/0_121_3496_2097/master/3496.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63d8acd7b68eeb61826adbf830acaf58","title":"the sun go kane colombian ambassador complains world cup england","story":"Headline refers to country’s links to drug trade before World Cup match against EnglandColombia’s ambassador to the UK has complained after the Sun published a front page that referenced the country’s links to the cocaine trade in the run-up to Tuesday’s World Cup clash with England.The headline reads: “As 3 Lions face nation that gave world Shakira, great coffee and er, other stuff, we say … GO KANE!” next to a picture of England striker Harry Kane.“It’s rather sad that they use such a festive and friendly environment as the World Cup to target a country and continue to stigmatise it with a completely unrelated issue,” said the ambassador, Néstor Osorio Londoño, who is hosting a party for Colombian fans in a traditional English pub on Tuesday.“Respect, fair play and joy for the game is all that matters tonight.

As children, it was the place our parents took us when they needed to shop, where maybe there was the hope of a trip to the toy shop or a drink in a cafe. As adolescents, it was the place we would mooch around on Saturday afternoons, flitting between the handful of shops that might interest us, killing hours over a Coke in McDonald’s. As an adult, my local high street is a place not just to shop but where I know people – the barber, the cafe owner, the fella in the hardware store, the pub landlord, the drunk guy who is always hustling for a quid to buy more lottery tickets. It’s a place of local characters as much as it is two parallel rows of buildings.The high street is woven into the fabric of the lives of everyone living in a town or suburb, which is why the concept of “the high street” has its own place in the news. Just the past few days have brought us stories such as “50,000 jobs lost or threatened on high street this year” “How to mend Britain’s broken high street” “Costa owner blames falling sales on high street decline”, and that’s before we even get to the travails of John Lewis. The high street is a cipher for everyday life. Despite that, and despite British pop’s celebration of the mundane and the parochial, the high street has never been a central location for pop. There is High Street by Blood Orange, which isn’t really about the high street – despite its references to Ilford Lane, a high street in north-east London – until the end, when Skepta raps about the everyday sights: “Single mom struggling with the pushchair  She had a bad mouth but she had good hair  Stole a phone in the shop getting looked at  Barbershop, hairline’s getting pushed back  Guys looking at me like they wanna fight me  Just another day on the high street.” The reference to the barber links it to one of the greatest pieces of English pop parochialism, Penny Lane by the Beatles, where there’s “a barber showing photographs  Of every head he’s had the pleasure to know”. Paul McCartney’s is an idealised high street, where no one is looking at him like they want to fight him.In Shopping, the B-side to the final single by the Jam, Beat Surrender, Paul Weller wasn’t bothered about the high street as any kind of metaphor for a life either contented or disappointed. He was, as the on-the-nose title suggests, out shopping: “As I flit from window to window  I’m trying to pick out a friendly bargain.” It’s an odd little song, and it’s not hard to work out why it was a B-side rather than even an album deep cut. In pop, the high street usually serves as either a token of the everyday, or a locator for songs about the wider metaphorical horror of the suburbs. Ignoring the fact that lots of people live in suburbs because they like them, the idea of the outer districts of cities as wastelands has long preoccupied British songwriters. In Suburbia, Pet Shop Boys are “lost in the high street, where the dogs run … in this suburban hell”.That idea of the suburbs as somewhere to escape from permeates British pop, with the writers willing themselves into lives surrounded by People Like Them, rather than salarymen with narrow horizons, frustrated housewives (the two go hand in hand in much British pop) or the violent thugs of songs such as Everything But the Girl’s Hatfield 1980.Hop across the Atlantic, though, and it’s often a different story. Where Britons have high streets, Americans have main streets, and it’s often a rather less depressing place. “Down on Mainstreet” is where Bob Seger goes to watch “this long, lovely dancer in a little club downtown”, and where Blood, Sweat and Tears see Lucy, who “looks like a Wow!” when she’s “walkin’ down Main Street, lookin’ down”. It’s where people go cruising in Carole King’s Main Street Saturday Night.But US writers saw their main streets ripped apart by the flight to out-of-town malls, similar to how British high streets are now being hit by internet shopping, Brexit and economic uncertainty. In 1984, in My Hometown, Bruce Springsteen noted “Now Main Street’s whitewashed windows and vacant stores  Seems like there ain’t nobody wants to come down here no more.” In Nobody Home, Amy Grant sang of “Main Street USA boarded up and dry  Knowin’ what once was here just makes me want to cry”.Those lyrics speak of an empathy for and love of Main Street that isn’t as present in British songs. When British high streets are boarded up in song, as in the Clash’s Groovy Times, it’s a symptom of how we live in a terrible dystopia. The obvious explanation for the differing tones lies in geography: the US is a nation of small towns, or at least a nation whose art, from Norman Rockwell to Thornton Wilder to Harper Lee to Springsteen, has paid attention to the lives of those small towns and the communities that live in them. When your nearest big city may be hundreds of miles away, it concentrates the mind on looking for positives as well as negatives.To British ears, that can signify a sentimental streak that isn’t there when British writers remember growing up in Huddersfield or Crawley or Oswestry, or wherever. But it makes for a less wearying perspective than the endless procession of British songwriters disparaging the (usually) comfortable lives they led before the city called, and bemoaning the narrow minds of the millions who choose not to live in the city.If you want a British pop song that captures both sides of the high street – the American promenade and our own rather more desolate view of it – try Vicky Verky by Squeeze. Chris Difford’s couple “really trooped the colours  When walking with each other  And all her mates would giggle  As ladylike she’d wiggle  All along the high street  They’d splash out on an ice cream.” Except he’d got the money by robbing people, and ends up in borstal.Vicky Verky doesn’t end on a bleak note, though: back together, the pair go camping and to the coast, where she tells him: “I think I want that chance back  To be perhaps the one  Who will forever love you.” Of course, they couldn’t rekindle their love on the high street: the shops were probably all boarded up by then."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a350261bc65513ef5f2f31707589d51f097fed2d/3663_701_747_448/master/747.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12a806db0dec6cdf1bd7e68cd234bbe1","title":"ministers look quell backlash plan lift freeze fuel duty","story":"Treasury officials say Tory MPs must accept that taxpayers will have to pay more to fund NHSTory backbenchers anxious about plans to lift the freeze on fuel duty have been told by Treasury ministers that they must accept taxpayers will have to contribute “a little bit more” to help fund a £20bn cash boost for the NHS.Mel Stride, the financial secretary, suggested that the public could expect taxes to go up “in their different ways” so that the prime minister’s spending pledge could be met while continuing to reduce the deficit.The government faces a furious backlash from some Tory MPs over the proposal, revealed by the , to scrap the eight-year long freeze which could raise £800m extra for the Treasury next year – and billions more over subsequent years.Former minister Robert Halfon, a longstanding critic of lifting the freeze, claimed it would be “absolute madness” to restart inflation-linked increases. He predicted that MPs would launch a vociferous campaign from the backbenches against any move.“There will be huge amounts of opposition from colleagues in marginal seats to this, to asking the public who are already struggling, to pay more taxes. I think there will be a big backlash against the government,” he said.However, Stride told MPs: “We will of course be looking at taxation and everybody in their different ways paying a little bit more to make sure that we fund the significant amount we have now committed to our NHS.”Ministers have been grappling with how to fund the prime minister’s health service promise without ripping up the Tory manifesto pledge to eliminate the deficit by the mid-2020s, set against the backdrop of the so-called Brexit idend. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, told MPs that any net benefit from the return of money paid to Brussels would “depend intrinsically” on the final deal Britain managed to strike. He said hoped the sum would make up the “largest possible” proportion of NHS funding. Senior government sources told the  that the plan to scrap the freeze, first enacted by George Osborne but continued by Hammond, was “under serious consideration” as it would ease pressure on public finances, with a number of ministers lobbying for funding for their own departments. Ministers are also understood to be considering lifting the freeze on alcohol duty announced in last year’s budget, which costs the Treasury more than £200m a year.The prospect of lifting the fuel duty freeze, which has saved inidual motorists hundreds of pounds over the last eight years but cost the Treasury in the region of £46bn since 2011-12, prompted a furious response from Tory backbenchers.Halfon said: “It would be a disastrous thing to do. We’re supposed to be a party of workers and instead we think about slapping a hefty tax on them. I don’t think that putting a tax on working people should be the way we pay for the NHS. In particular a tax that has such implications for the whole economy.”Another backbencher, Kirstene Hair, who sits on the all-party group on fair fuel, said: “I cannot underestimate the impact a fuel duty rise will have on families, small businesses and haulage firms. “The cost for iniduals getting to work every day and the costs for small businesses and for logistics firms will all rise. All this means is that people’s disposable income will be squeezed further as prices increase.”However, many Tories believe that the public mood has shifted in favour of investing in the NHS and other public services, and see the proposal as the best way of fulfilling the party’s pledge to eliminate the deficit. The prime minister’s official spokesman said he would not comment on tax plans before the budget. He added: “But we have frozen fuel duty for eight successive years, at a cost of £46bn, and we have a continuing commitment to help families keep more of what they earn.”Howard Cox, of group lobbying Fair Fuel UK, warned that the proposal would be politically disastrous. “The UK’s 37 million drivers are still the highest taxed in the world despite eight years’ freeze. Any emotive hike to fund the NHS will be suicidal for the government,” he said.“The deliberate leak of a potential fuel duty hike to a pathologically environmentally focused newspaper that hates four wheels, is evidence that the government is testing public opinion.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d4ab370bdba0b27b44ce70292b9997b7fdeda29/0_144_2340_1404/master/2340.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a2ccc3567a730fc336f85863ed61837","title":"philip hammond comes clean on brexit","story":"Chancellor wants the world to know that no one can point the finger at him if it all goes belly upIt’s hard not to feel a little bit sorry for Philip Hammond. He has a prime minister who would have sacked him if last year’s general election had worked out as she had planned. Then there are the cabinet colleagues who cannot stand the sight of him, either because they think he’s some kind of soggy Remoaner who is deliberately trying to thwart the “One True Punishment Brexit” or because they suspect he’s starving their departments of cash. Or both.To make things worse, he’s been lumbered with a Treasury team of Liz Truss, Mel Stride and Robert Jenrick that doesn’t even qualify as B list. Barely even capable of managing an Instagram account, let alone the economy. So Hammond is a man alone. The closest you are a likely to find to intelligent life in the current government. Not that the bar is very high.There was a brief moment back in March when the chancellor tried to pretend he didn’t care. If the party wanted him to be Tigger, then Tigger he would be. He would reframe austerity as a period of unparalleled growth, low-paid part-time work as full-time employment and Brexit as the springboard for the UK to become the world’s leading player. That window has long since closed. He just couldn’t maintain the act. In his heart, he was a natural Eeyore. Someone who understood there was no bad situation that couldn’t get worse. He was Lurch the Undertaker.At Treasury questions, Hammond was almost demob happy, secure in his inner miserabilism. As every other minister seemingly now felt free to pursue their own agendas, then he could, too. No need to sugar coat the news. He could just tell it like it was. And it was going to be bad. Very bad.How much of the extra £20bn per year for the NHS was going to be funded by the prime minister’s “Brexit idend”, asked Liberal Democrat Tom Brake. A half-smile crossed Hammond’s lips. He shrugged. To be completely honest he really didn’t have a clue. But his best guess was almost none, partly because we would still be paying into the EU budget for the next couple of years but mainly because all the Treasury forecasts pointed to Brexit costing the country £20bn per year. So it was going to cost everyone more in tax.The shadow chancellor is an unlikely champion of global capitalism but he is also not a man to look a gift horse in the mouth. So when almost every business organisation has taken to issuing panicky warnings about the state of the Brexit negotiations, John McDonnell couldn’t resist reading them out. The charge sheet against the government ran to several pages, but the Undertaker couldn’t have been more grateful. This was music to his ears.Yes, he was well aware of the cost of a no-deal Brexit and the likely loss of jobs, the Undertaker said. But he couldn’t say anything on the current state of the negotiations because no one really had a clue what was going on. The prime minister herself could not even remember if she had come up with a third customs solution that the EU had rejected and, if she had, she certainly hadn’t told anyone else. It was her little secret. One that she was even keeping from herself.But he would be happy to keep everyone in the loop after the Chequers sleepover. Providing he got out of the place alive. The way that was shaping up, there were no guarantees of anything. It could be a bloodbath in which everyone died and nothing was decided. Come to think of it, that was the most likely outcome. But if and when he could, he would. Not least to cover his own back. If Brexit all went belly up and the UK crashed out with a bad deal, he wanted to make sure no one would be pointing the finger at him.It was a surreal moment. One that even silenced the Brexiters in the chamber who wisely chose not to ask a single question. Because they would get answered. Ministers usually regard departmental questions as a potential minefield, one through which they have to tread carefully to say as little as possible. Instead, Hammond had come clean. Loud and proud."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcaaefe7f6ca98a7ea498a47f38d32252f1e310e/25_349_4070_2443/master/4070.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d666b27c6ecc0a5a55983bd29b81b37e","title":"brexit greatest negative impact regions outside london","story":"Price rises will disproportionately affect people in Northern Ireland, Wales, the Midlands and the north-east, reports sayBrexit will make people outside London worse off, two reports have found.Household bills will rise by between £245 and £1,961 a year after Brexit, with a disproportionately adverse impact on lower-income groups and people in Northern Ireland, Wales, the Midlands and the north-east, they say.The Institute for Public Policy Research found that a hard Brexit might reduce inequality between low- and high-income groups, by hitting higher earners in the pocket most.“Our findings suggest that post-Brexit price rises will squeeze incomes more in parts of the UK outside London,” said Marley Morris, IPPR senior research fellow. Wales and the north-east were most at risk because of their disproportionate reliance on producing goods and food for export to the EU including Welsh lamb, Airbus wings, and cars.Flintshire, Wrexham, Sunderland, Telford, Wrekin, south Derbyshire, the home of Rolls-Royce, west Derbyshire and Luton were also identified as potential losers. “All income groups, including the poorest, will face negative impacts,” said the IPPR.A second report by consultancy Oliver Wyman reached similar conclusions. It modelled post-Brexit costs on a basket of 150 imports and found that prices would rise for all consumers regardless of income or where they lived. But in poorer areas the impact of increased costs in goods that attract higher tariffs such as meat and dairy products would be greatest because a greater proportion of household income would go on weekly shopping bills and transport, for example. It calculated that almost £1,000 a year would be added to household spending under the worst-case scenario of a hard Brexit, which it said would cause significant red tape and have World Trade Organization tariffs and increased labour costs. It assessed the supply chain costs for all 150 goods, analysing everything from tariffs to non-tariff barriers such as transport, rules of origin certificates, pre-shipment inspections, delays and administration. It also looked at the cost of labour in each region. The price of a restaurant meal would go up because of increased cost of imported food and labour because of trade and non-trade barriers in every Brexit scenario, it said. While some items may be cheaper on paper such as Argentinian beef or New Zealand butter, the overall impact on the cost of the weekly shopping would be marginal. A soft Brexit would cost households an extra £245 a year, a typical meal for four would go up by £9 and the cost of a price of trainers would rise by about £7.Oliver Wyman concluded Northern Ireland, which has the poorest economy of the 12 regions of the UK, would be hit worst by increased costs.Reaching the same conclusion as the IPPR, Oliver Wyman found that the savings in importing goods from non-EU countries did not outweigh the increased costs of EU imports under every Brexit scenario.“Even if we had free-trade deals with every single country outside the EU and went to no tariffs, there is no way things will be cheaper. It is still a negative situation for everybody,” said Duncan Brewer, partner at Oliver Wyman and head of its retail and consumer team. It found the post-Brexit picture was complex but that if certain households spent a greater share of their income on goods expected to cost more because of trade barriers, they were more likely to be exposed to price changes. “Given that the EU will continue to negotiate trade deals with third countries, it is hard to see how the UK could significantly outpace the EU in negotiating agreements that lower consumer prices,” it said.The Oliver Wyman report illustrated the point with the cost of Irish beef, commonly sold in supermarkets. It wholesales at about £3.70 a kilogram. Argentinian beef, which is currently £5.50 per kilo because of EU protectionist tariffs, would come down to £3.50 a kilo after Brexit. At the same time, Irish beef would go up to £3.90 per kilo if tariffs were imposed. But as Brewer pointed out, such a free trade agreement on Argentinian beef would only result in a 20p per kilo saving on beef – not enough to compensate for the higher cost of imports of other goods such as dairy, cars parts or electronics from the EU.A third report published on Wednesday by local councils found that Brexit was creating a “perfect storm” for rural communities, with unaffordable homes, poor connectivity, skills gaps and health inequalities threatening the future success and prosperity of those areas.“If Britain is to make the most of a successful future outside of the European Union, it’s essential that our future success is not confined to our cities,” said Mark Hawthorne, chairman of the Local Government Association’s people and places board.A majority of business leaders want post-Brexit customs arrangements that avoid the need for new customs processes with the EU, even if they take longer to put in place, a survey of 800 business leaders by the Institute of Directors found. Avoiding customs-related disruptions was IoD members’ number-one priority for the UK’s negotiations on its future economic relationship with the EU. Continued regulatory alignment was another clear priority.

But what about the vital role of backroom staff?If a week is a long time in politics, four months seems to be an aeon, as least as far as charity donations from inidual givers are concerned.At the start of year, when scandals broke about Oxfam and the Presidents Club, dire consequences were predicted. Thousands of donors were, it was reported, cancelling direct debits as a result of their disillusion with charities. Charity leaders felt they had been dealt another body blow, just as they were starting to recover from the collapse of Kids Company and questionable fundraising practices.This is not to minimise the consequences for Oxfam, which has been forced to make cuts of £16m to its aid programmes and lay off staff, after losing government funding. And Sports Relief saw a big fall in the amount it raised on the night of its televised appeal in March, from £55m in 2016 to just £38m this year – the lowest for a decade. But many in the sector are breathing a sigh of relief that the general impact seems to have been less cataclysmic than predicted.Part of the problem is that funders continue to believe they maximise their impact by giving every penny to the frontline, and they want charities to be able to demonstrate that almost every last penny they raise goes directly to the projects and people they support. This is in line with the narrative peddled by all UK governments since 2010 that public services are “bloated” with administrative staff. In the public sector, this has resulted in vital support staff being valued much less than those on the frontline. For charities, this focus could be lethal, as a new report by the thinktank, Charity Futures, makes clear. In the report, Stephen Bubb, the former chief executive of the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations, points out that charities need to spend money on administration and monitoring in vital areas like safeguarding. He singles out Comic Relief, but there are plenty of other examples where charities shy away from any idea that they have admin costs: Crisis, asking for £26.08 last Christmas to cover the “exact cost” of funding a place at one of its Christmas centres, Combat Stress’s pitch for £21 to pay for an hour of its helplinefor veterans suffering mental health problems, or the RSPCA’s winter appeal request for £8 to feed a cat over three days of the holidays, £10.40 for a rabbit, or £12 for a dog.Bubb and Daniel Fluskey, head of policy and research at the IoF, believe the way forward is to change the language used around fundraising. The Charity Futures report says charities should attach a “warm glow” to core costs by identifying the backroom staff who are integral to a charity’s function.Warm glow or not, more has to be done on the narrative about how charities operate and spend donors’ money.Jane Dudman is the ’s public leaders editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c01d5cd6116f4c6b338504ba42c1c05f2ff07dc1/326_44_2657_1594/master/2657.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5ea7a2a8eab15613b6dd075d96390c0","title":"andre agassi novak djokovic listen advice elbow injury","story":"Andre Agassi has said his parting of the ways with Novak Djokovic stemmed largely from the player’s reluctance to embrace his guidance and ideas.Agassi, who said when the pair parted company in April that they had too often found themselves agreeing to disagree, cited the Serb’s initial unwillingness to have surgery on the chronic elbow injury that put him out of action for the final six months of last year as the chief stumbling block in a collaboration also undermined by differences over training and nutrition.“I only knew him with a hurt elbow, so it was always plasters and big problems,” his former coach Agassi said. “I\u0026nbspthink there was a real hope his elbow could heal naturally, holistically. I personally wasn’t a fan of that choice. You can’t force someone when it comes to their own body, you have to understand their hesitations, but health is a function of taking care of your body, making the hard decisions, giving yourself the time and then moving forward methodically. Rest wasn’t going to do it in my estimation.“When I saw the results of his MRIs in August, I was very clear with him: I advocated surgery right away, because that could end the issue once and for all.”Djokovic underwent surgery in February, after losing to South Korea’s Chung Hyeon ng at the Australian Open the previous month. By then Agassi and his fellow coach, Radek Stepanek, had worked to remodel the 12-times grand slam title winner’s serve with the aim of reducing stress on the injured joint. Implementing the change was not easy – “there weren’t two healthy days in a row,” said Agassi – but Djokovic’s motion became more compact, even if its fluidity and accuracy perhaps suffered, particularly on the wide kick serve to the advantage court.“That’s a hyper-extension movement. If something hurts, that’s the one that you’re going to be hesitant with,” Agassi said. “If you have an elbow issue, you’re going to be a little hesitant to throw that arm as aggressively as you have to.”Agassi was able to see through technical change, other areas proved more challenging. John McEnroe and Martina Navratilova are among observers who believe Djokovic might benefit from gaining bulk, and Agassi, whose commitment in the gym under the guidance of the American fitness trainer Gil Reyes reaped idends in the later stages of his career, apparently thought likewise.But while he floated the possibility of changes to the 31-year-old’s conditioning and nutrition programme Djokovic was slow to embrace proposed changes. “I think his learning curves could be quicker but they have to be his,” Agassi said. “He’s just that kind of guy – he needs ownership over his own process. So if he’s not having the energy or the strength, that’s something he’ll figure out on his own. I’ve always believed in strength training, I’ve always believed in eating a healthy range and a quantity of protein. But for years, he did it his own way.“You get to a point where if you’re not part of the solution you’re part of the problem. We agreed to disagree far too often for me to feel like I was helping him, and I cared too much about him to just watch him go through something I felt I could help him with.” Les RoopanarineAndre Agassi spoke to the  courtesy of Lavazza, official coffee of the championships at Wimbledon, as its global ambassador for the second year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2447541f23cc57d8f695b7716ee5664528ca3b63/830_162_2605_1563/master/2605.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0804009b0108a9a25283540fad9fd136","title":"chris froome team sky leader tour de france","story":"The World Anti-Doping Agency’s head of science has sought to play down fears that Chris Froome’s salbutamol case may raise questions about other tests dependent upon threshold levels of banned substances. Dr Oliver Rabin said that he was not concerned about further fallout from the verdict, in which Froome was cleared of any potential wrongdoing after showing a high level of salbutamol in an anti-doping test at last year’s Tour of Spain.Wada had been “well aware of salbutamol’s variability”, Dr Rabin said. “That is why an adverse finding only opens the door to further study – it’s not an automatic sanction.”“Given all of this we decided an excretion study was impossible and the finding was not inconsistent with therapeutic dosages. It’s not a unique case but because it was Froome, a sporting celebrity, and it was put in the limelight, it appears to be unique. For now, we have no reason to question the rules. We can see no reason that previous cases have not been handled fairly.”News of the Froome verdict was coolly received in the French media, with both L’Équipe and Le Monde – which revealed the story with the  in December – unwilling to let the four-times Tour winner completely off the hook.With full details of the decision yet to be released, L’Équipe’s verdict was that, “for the moment, the explanations that have been provided do not allow all doubt to be removed”. Le Monde, for its part, speculated that Wada might have feared a costly legal battle against Team Sky and Froome.As expected, Froome was named on Tuesday in Team Sky’s eight-man lineup for the Tour, with the big surprise the selection of the young Colombian climber Egan Bernal alongside old hands Luke Rowe and Geraint Thomas.Speaking to the Times, the four-times Tour winner refused to be drawn into a war of words with the five-times winner Bernard Hinault, who had called for the peloton to strike if Froome were allowed to start the race without the case being resolved. “I can’t say anything bad about Bernard,” said the Team Sky leader. “He’s one of the great champions. I imagine with age sometimes your wires get a little bit crossed, but if I see him I’ll very happily explain it all in a bit more detail.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d7bb79853d99268925a6be7a8d8babb7f059ca8/0_66_5808_3485/master/5808.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c440dc9defd49f5d661172138a677b04","title":"christian horner questions mercedes tactics at austrian grand prix","story":"• Red Bull principal thinks team can still win title• Horner calls Mercedes strategy in Austria ‘bizarre’The Red Bull team principal, Christian Horner, has described Mercedes’s decision to have their chief strategist, James Vowles, publicly apologise for a strategy error at the Austrian Grand Prix as Vowles throwing himself under the bus to motivate Lewis Hamilton. Speaking before this weekend’s British Grand Prix, Horner was also optimistic Silverstone would remain on the F1 calendar but hopeful that London might still become a venue.Red Bull’s Max Verstappen won in Austria, which Horner believed proved they were still outsiders with a shot at a title, but it was Hamilton’s team that attracted scrutiny. Mercedes opted not to pit the British driver under the virtual safety car, costing him the lead and leaving him angry and frustrated. They took the unusual step of having Vowles admit it was his fault over the radio, saying that he had “thrown away the win”. Mercedes said it had been an attempt to refocus Hamilton on the task at hand.Hamilton has four world championships and is in his 12th season in F1 and Horner could not understand Mercedes’s strategy. “It seems a fairly bizarre thing to need to do,” he said. “For somebody to throw themselves under the bus to motivate a driver to go from fourth back into the lead.”Horner, who has won four drivers’ and constructors’ championships with Red Bull since he became principal in 2005, insisted his team was run differently.“One thing you have to do is win as a team and lose as a team,” he said. “That’s why we hardly talk about iniduals. Because that puts an unfair amount of scrutiny and pressure on that inidual. Our philosophy is that as a team, it is collective responsibility.”Mercedes have been largely dominant for four years. However, they now face a tight fight with Ferrari and Red Bull. Indeed the latter are increasingly competitive and have three wins this season, equalling both their rivals. The competition was proving tricky for Mercedes, believed Horner.“Obviously Mercedes have got so used to being at the front it becomes easy to become complacent,” he said. “And there is an adjustment when that isn’t happening and you are having to fight and having to scrap.“The management of the team have never been in a position where they have had to go head to head for an entire season and the closer you get to the end of the year the more the pressure builds, so it is a new experience for them.”Silverstone is currently contracted to host two more grands prix and is in negotiations with Liberty Media about a new contract, having activated he break clause on their previous deal, unable to meet rising costs. Horner was optimistic that an agreement would be reached, however he also believed Liberty maintained a realistic ambition for London to be a venue.“From a personal point of view Silverstone is the natural home of the British GP,” he said. “But it would be great to complement it with another race even if it was not a permanent fixture, a one-off race in London would be phenomenal. Why not have a race in London one year and one in Paris one year?“Like a European Grand Prix that toured different venues, if the economics worked for Liberty it would be fantastic.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5324fc63825dc16a9f02d01bc1f676d175a01638/0_127_2843_1706/master/2843.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42d98007fb1151a2e8b1088b1fee9a0c","title":"donnacha obrien classics racing","story":"While he has proved superbly effective in big races this season, nothing better shows the maturity of Donnacha O’Brien and the quality of his upbringing than his response to a somewhat unexpected line of criticism directed at him this weekend. “I think he might be the wild one of the family, from what I hear,” a British‑based trainer said on Sunday, live on Racing\u0026nbspUK. “I wish he’d stop snapchatting my 16-year-old daughter.”Perhaps the 19-year-old jockey gets this kind of thing from a lot of fathers. He was, after all, described as “darkly handsome” by one recent interviewer. But he puts a bit of thought into formulating his answer as we talk in The\u0026nbspCurragh’s weighing room, taking care to avoid caddishly causing embarrassment to anyone else and eventually settling for: “He made me sound worse than I was.”It is a mildly amusing ersion for a young man who, like the rest of his family, is all about horses. Raised at Ballydoyle, the dominant stable in Irish Flat racing, and a son of Aidan O’Brien, he was always likely to get some enviable chances in big races when he took out his jockey’s licence but surely no one expected the sudden success he has enjoyed in the past\u0026nbsptwo\u0026nbspmonths.The highest point yet came when he won Saturday’s Irish Derby on the 14-1 shot Latrobe. The winning trainer was his brother, Joseph, who credited Donnacha with a race-winning move in the early stages, the jockey having quickly realised the pace was slow and eased forward into a much handier position than had been planned.It is hardly common to see a jockey so obviously making the difference when it matters most and many a rider would rather stick to the original script. But Donnacha’s situation gives him some freedom. “Joseph kinda leaves it up to me,” he says.“When I’m riding for Joseph and Dad, I know that if I do mess up I’m not going to get a bollocking, I’m not going to lose any rides. When it’s like that, it makes it a lot easier.“There’s no one in the world understands racing better than Joseph and he knows that the more you’re tied down to instructions, the less adaptable you are in a race. So he leaves it up to me a lot. We have a talk beforehand, what might happen and things like that. But once the gates open I know that I can change whatever I want and I’m not going to get in trouble.”Following the famously modest example set by his father, Donnacha wants us to accept that his recent victories are to some extent the result of chance. He was “lucky” to be drawn wide on Latrobe and therefore able to move forward at will. It was “pure luck” that he was on the right horses in both the 2,000 Guineas and the Oaks, when the stable had other fancied runners some suggest, however, that he has become a fair judge of equine talent and that his familiarity with the\u0026nbspBallydoyle horses will continue to be a help to him.He is as phlegmatic about his weight. Being tall, he is likely to get heavier and be forced out of the weighing room, as Joseph was. “I could have only this year left, I could have five years left. My weight’s good at the minute but I don’t know when it’s gonna change.“We’ll see. I’m very lucky to be in the position I’m in at the minute and I’m very happy, but I don’t know what’s going to happen in an hour, never mind in five years.”Tips by John O\u0027Hara"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d86354271347749ddd4af61ecd3e5300181ae9c/0_105_4398_2639/master/4398.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=abab2ad004f3c1cbf043c5c0b2cd79c0","title":"england india twenty20 international match report","story":"Kuldeep Yadav’s left-arm wrist-spin proved an indecipherable code for England’s batsmen as a sea of blue at Old Trafford roared India on to victory in the first of three Twenty20s between these two sides.Indeed the impact of England’s footballers simultaneously taking on Colombia in Moscow was barely felt here. The bulk of the 23,000 to pitch up were cheering for Virat Kohli’s newly arrived tourists, who repaid the cacophonous support by chasing down 160 for a comfortable eight-wicket win and a significant statement of intent.KL Rahul’s unbeaten 101 from 54 balls may have brutally knocked off the target with 10 balls to spare in a blaze of 10 fours and five sixes but there was no question where the difference lay Kuldeep’s earlier figures of five for 24 had reduced a befuddled England to 159 for eight from their 20 overs. Little wonder Kohli is so pleased with the current heatwave.“Kuldeep’s a very good bowler,” said Eoin Morgan, one of three victims in four balls to the left-armer’s predominantly googly-based wizardry. “He’s obviously going to be a big threat. Everything seemed to happen very quickly, which is a credit to the bowling. It’s something we’ll assess before the next game and hopefully play it better.”England’s meagre total, after Morgan had seen a seventh successive toss go against him this home summer, was propped up by the latest masterclass from Jos Buttler – a 46-ball 69 made up of sumptuous pulls and wristy drives – but his was essentially a lone hand.They had started at a decent lick, with Jason Roy’s frenetic 30, but his demise – chopping Umesh Yadav on to the stumps via the pull shot that had met fresh air a couple of times previously – brought Alex Hales to the crease for what proved a torturous 18-ball eight.While Buttler had taken Hardik Pandya for 18 off the 11th over to put England on 95 for one, the inability of Hales to get going was applying drag before he fell to Kuldeep, bowled trying to sweep what would have been his first boundary. With Ben Stokes eyeing Sunday for a return from injury, Hales needs a score in Cardiff on Friday.Kuldeep’s true impact would come in his next over – the innings-changing 14th – when he ripped out the guts with three victims in four balls. Morgan was caught in the deep off a slog sweep and then both Jonny Bairstow and Joe Root were stumped for golden ducks. When MS Dhoni whipped off the bails for the latter, having fumbled initially, it was a record 33rd such dismissal for their former T20 captain.Kohli decided to keep Kuldeep’s final over back but the left-armer returned for the 18th and, with Moeen Ali having already gone for six when slicing Pandya to cover, he wrapped up his maiden five-wicket haul when Kohli held Buttler at long-on. It should have come two balls sooner too, after Rahul had given the Englishman a life.While Chris Jordan was the third man out first ball – caught and bowled by Umesh off his pad – David Willey was in no mood to go down with a whimper, blasting 29 from 15 balls, adding a touch of fight in some verbals with Bhuvneshwar Kumar, and an early breakthrough in the chase when Shikhar Dhawan played on in the first over.Willey should have had a second, too, with Roy putting down Rahul on 17 at backward point. But from there the No\u0026nbsp3 took full control, putting on 123 in no time with the more sedate Rohit Sharma to break the back of the chase in a flurry of long-levered blows.Sharma’s departure with 30 runs required gave the partisan crowd a final chance to chant Kohli’s name and, after Rahul completed his second international century in this format, the Indian captain smoked Moeen over long-on to wrap up the one-sided win."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/213d2130700c2e995900f9124f193744f4087a1e/0_49_4446_2667/master/4446.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8a04817e0a07e1342d0bd282688eaba","title":"spun review rabiah hussain young muslim women friendship","story":"Arcola, LondonThere are storming performances in this play about two British Pakistani Londoners whose friendship is tested after the 2005 terror attacks‘What do you see when you look at me?” asks one friend coyly of another in the opening scene. Safa and Aisha are best friends, about to take erging paths into adulthood, and the question sounds like coming-of-age angst. But it becomes bigger, and far more fraught, when the 2005 London terror attacks erupt into the play and complicate their sense of belonging.This fierce and at times furious play, a two-hander on an almost bare stage, dramatises female Muslim identity in contemporary Britain, which is rarely seen so intimately, and from the inside.They tell their stories through dual narration, each looking back to key moments in their lives and conjuring memories in direct address to the audience. These testimonies are interspersed with sparks of dialogue between them, which is light and zany to begin with but grows combative as they contest each other’s choices, post 77.There is nothing on stage to distract us from their storytelling. Only a set of chairs and two rings of light inhabit the space, with portentous music used sparingly.This is Rabiah Hussain’s first full-length play and her script showcases an utterly distinctive voice: playful yet profound, rooted, class-conscious and effortlessly poetic.Humaira Iqbal (Safa) and Aasiya Shah (Aisha) give storming performances, capturing at first the confident swagger of close friendship and then its vulnerabilities as it fractures. Like Zadie Smith’s urban young women, their identities are embedded in their specific corner of London, and their friendship splintered by the differing paths they take into the wider city.Their questions, hurled at each other, are complicated interrogations of Britishness and belonging and the play – masterfully – resists a simple answer to any one of them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fbfab11ca98ab38425501b21cdee7233666b2c2/172_282_3822_2293/master/3822.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6a33cde8a3f3f33683e61a97850552a","title":"the king and i review london paladium","story":"London PalladiumThe Broadway revival of Rodgers and Hammerstein’s musical comes to the West End with fine acting, handsome staging and inescapable overtones of western imperialismThis 1951 Rodgers and Hammerstein show may be a Broadway classic but it presents a constant difficulty: it seems to endorse the idea of the civilising influence of the west on the barbarian east. Bartlett Sher’s much-lauded Lincoln Center production is handsomely mounted and boasts two star performances from Kelli O’Hara and Ken Watanabe but, in addressing the musical’s dated premise, it creates further problems.Normally we see the show as a closet romance in which a spirited young governess, Anna Leonowens, wins the heart and mind of the King of Siam whose children she has been hired to educate. In this version, however, the real battle goes on within the soul of the king himself. He is partly a testy patriarch, partly an anxious politician who sees his neighbours succumbing to colonialism. The conflict is expressed in the number A Puzzlement, which Yul Brynner often arbitrarily cut when he played the role. Watanabe makes it clear, however, that the king faces a dilemma as he asks: “Shall I join other nations in alliance, If allies are weak am I not best alone?” All this is fascinating and Sher’s production is at pains to point up the isions within the kingdom. In Western People Funny, the monarch’s wives highlight the absurdity of being dolled up in alien underwear. The celebrated ballet based on Uncle Tom’s Cabin – which, although derived from Jerome Robbins’s original choreography, goes on far too long – also seems like a calculated provocation: I was reminded more than once of the play scene in Hamlet. But the focus on regal insecurity and the threat to Siam’s integrity only serves to complicate the musical. I found myself asking a simple question: why on earth would Mrs Leonowens want to stay? If there is one thing worse than a despot, which the king undoubtedly is, it is a neurotic despot. Even if I never felt there was much kinship between the story’s dual protagonists, O’Hara, who won a Tony award for her performance, is a delight. She suggests a woman who is both spirited and sweet-natured and not only enunciates every syllable of her songs but invests them with emotion. I’ve never heard Hello Young Lovers better delivered: when O’Hara announces “I know how it feels to have wings on your heels” a light comes into her eyes as if she is reliving her past. O’Hara’s Anna is also at ease with the king’s multiple children, whom she swings merrily around, underscoring the point that her commitment is less to the king than to future generations. Watanabe presents us with a troubled tyrant who, in his idea of building a wall around his kingdom and his condemnation of “a false lie”, momentarily reminded me of you-know-who. It is a fine piece of acting but, aside from a moment when Watanabe mischievously smiles as he sees Anna courting his attention, it rarely made me feel the king was emotionally entangled with his employee. In a predominantly Asian cast, there is good work from Na-Young Jeon as a renegade lover and Naoko Mori as the king’s head wife Michael Yeargan’s colourful designs avoid false exoticism and the pit band, under Stephen Ridley, plays excellently. The musical itself, however, remains, a problem to be solved as much as a show to be enjoyed. •The King and I is at the London Palladium until 29 September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da679d274723164b1554390889eae2ee1e9a64d5/137_0_3400_2040/master/3400.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db6730310859c5334ae530477100cc5f","title":"samsung galaxy s8 s9 phones sent photos random contacts","story":"Firm is investigating reports that default messaging app sent pictures without consent Samsung is investigating reports that its default text messaging app on the Galaxy S8 and S9 smartphones is sending photos to random contacts without permission.Users posted complaints on Reddit and Samsung’s support forums about a strange issue that appears to be silently sending photos to random contacts.

How lucky we were. The music of Louisiana, Tennessee and Georgia provides an incredible trip through the rich history of the US, exploring the way Americans express themselves through jazz, soul, country, pop and blues. Even though I’m now an old married soul, these tunes still resound loudly in my life, and I want to jump on a plane every time I hear them.We start with a blast in New Orleans, and the life-affirming noise of the brilliant Rebirth Brass Band. They’ve been mixing jazz, hip-hop and funk with the city’s centuries-old second line tradition (of brass band music at funeral parades) since 1983. Catch them at their regular haunt, the Maple Leaf, as I did, and you won’t be disappointed. Then we head to Nashville, to meet country’s first huge star, Kitty Wells with It Wasn’t God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels – the genre’s first No 1 single, in 1952. She laid the groundwork for later Nashville-made stars such as Dolly Parton, Carrie Underwood and Taylor Swift, and her lyrics are impressively forthright to boot: “Too many times married men think they’re still single,” she burrs.The first ever rock‘n’roll song was also made in Tennessee, down the Interstate 40 in Memphis. Rocket 88 was credited to Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats, but the band were actually Ike Turner’s (who the world would know more of later). Their song jangles and shudders like the promise of a new dawn. The first song about rock‘n’roll fame came from the south too – enter Louisiana boy Johnny B Goode. He lives “among the evergreens”, Chuck Berry tells us, and plays his guitar down by the railroad track his mum says someday he’ll be the leader of “a big old band”, and the song’s still so thrilling, you believe her. A few years later, a white boy from Tupelo came to Memphis too soon after, Elvis Presley was a worldwide sensation. Memphis, Tennessee is about a longing for home that has a sad twist in its tale, but the tune has a wiggle in its hips, as do Presley’s vocals. Staying in Memphis with Stax Records – one of America’s most supreme soul labels – it’s Sam and Dave, and what is arguably the greatest song they ever released, Soul Man.A quick dash across states follows, with Ray Charles and Georgia On My Mind. His 1960 single is even more moving when you realise he’s talking about his home (although the 1930 original was written by Hoagy Carmichael and Stuart Gorrell about Carmichael’s sister, Georgia). The south can be intriguingly rural too. Georgia boys R.E.M. made Automatic for the People in New Orleans, and their gorgeous instrumental named after the city is full of Louisiana’s heady strangeness. Then we zip back to their old friends, the B-52s, “heading down the Atlanta highway” to find their Love Shack. A party spirit thrives on open roads of the south, and it’s here in spades – and in squeals.Next, we venture into downtown Atlanta, where so many rappers made their names. Elevators (Me \u0026amp You) tells the story of how Outkast made it in the city, years before international fame hit with Hey Ya! Another tale of how the south leaves you wanting more, Tennessee Song, comes from contemporary country star Margo Price, who’s signed to Jack White’s Third Eye Records in Nashville. We finish our journey with one of today’s greatest pop stars, Atlanta’s Janelle Monae, who reminds us how America’s rock‘n’roll spirit lives on in our time. Play all these songs loud. You’ll probably fall in love too.For more inspiration and to book your trip to the US, visit bausa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e946f935464c4cc9e2dd854d59712ff0e7261ec/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03b386ed19db8ae1549228afbb57bc93","title":"need some vitamin sea heres the ultimate beach playlist","story":"Wax down your surfboard, roll up your jacket sleeves and let this music transport you to the west coast waves of Cali and the rich heat of MiamiAmerican beaches are hot, hazy places, as well as woozy states of mind, especially if you’re dreaming about the west coast around LA and San Diego, or the sun-baked strip of Miami.

Make it real your summer dream.”Then let’s have Marlena Shaw, and the west coast’s own surfside creation myth. “And if you listen carefully  The winds that ride  On the high tide  Whistle a melody,” Shaw explains. “So the people started to sing  And that’s how the surf gave birth untold  To California soul.” A dubious theory, Marlena, but when you’re wearing sunglasses, it’s totally convincing. After that euphoric rush, let’s go for full American heat with Jan Hammer’s Miami Vice Theme, guitars forcing balmy winds through your lustrous 80s hair, and hot, shiny synths rolling up your jacket sleeves.Catch your breath with the Thrills – whose Deckchairs and Cigarettes is an ode to the slowed-down loveliness of San Diego and the soft glow of youth – and the beauty of Through My Sails from Neil Young and Crazy Horse’s Zuma. Named after LA’s long, sandy beach, the album ends on this beautiful, seaside song: “I’m standing on the shoreline  It’s so fine out there,” they sing. We hear more of these feelings in Miley Cyrus’s Malibu, from her latest album Younger Now, where peace comes from the ocean, literally and metaphorically: “Next to you  The sky is so blue  In Malibu.”Now it’s time to wind down as the sun slowly sets. Before we do, let’s remember that the biggest summer hit of recent years was made in Miami. The earwormy Spanish guitars and sweet nothings of Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee’s Despacito took it to No 1 for a record-breaking 16 weeks in the US. Then we fade out with two more beachside classics, all about the memories and promises the golden shores of America give us: Don Henley’s the Boys of Summer and the Mamas and Papas’ California Dreamin’. Even when the sun goes down, we’ll be safe and warm with these songs. Our love for them will still be strong.For more inspiration and to book your trip to the US, visit bausa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd84e2e39b4ac5870c61a1ab52055bd6cbfb7517/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10472673534ba47aa11bdcedb6d38955","title":"pacific hymns the definitive hipster playlist","story":"Seattle, Portland and San Fran aren’t just cities – they’re states of mind, man. So if you’re looking for counterculture sounds, it’s here you’ll find songs that spoke for a generationImmersion in Seattle’s music scene begins minutes after disembarking at Sea-Tac, the city’s international airport, which houses a store devoted to the record company Sub Pop. In 1988, the then shoestring Sub Pop Records released Nirvana’s debut single it subsequently became as synonymous with Seattle as Motown is with Detroit. Opening our hipster playlist is Nirvana’s fourth single, Smells Like Teen Spirit, released three years later. It became a massive hit across the world, igniting the rock phenomenon that would transform Seattle, a hitherto obscure enclave in America’s far north-west, into an epicentre of cool.Previous generations of Seattle musicians took for granted that they would have to leave their hometown if they wanted a successful career. Arguably the greatest electric guitarist of all-time, Jimi Hendrix is up next – he was born and raised in Seattle, although only found fame after moving to London.Right now, Seattle’s music has never been so rich or erse. Witness the contrast of Fleet Foxes’ Sun it Rises, a yearning choral-Americana hymn to frontier spirits, with avant-hip-hop duo Shabazz Palaces. Shine a Light hails from their futuristic twin Quazarz album – released in 2017 by a certain indie record label with its own airport shop.Portland has become renowned in recent years for its ultra-progressive attitudes – as satirised by the comedy series Portlandia – but the city’s hippy roots have long attracted free-thinkers from all over America. Emerging from the city’s early 90s underground rock scene with his disarmingly catchy dark-folk confessionals was Elliott Smith. Here, we trace the Texan native’s troubled quest around Portland in Needle in the Hay.Other musicians who rocked up in Portland included feminist trio Sleater-Kinney, formed in the Washington state capital Olympia during the mid-90s, by guitarists Corin Tucker and Carrie Brownstein, alongside drummer Janet Weiss. From their 2015 comeback album, No Cities to Love confounds the adage that radical voices mellow with age – or, in the case of Portlandia co-creator Brownstein, fame.Next up, we have the Shins, who formed in New Mexico but became Portland residents following their 2002 breakthrough hit New Slang (as featured in the film Garden State). Then, Laura Veirs – who was called to the city via Colorado and the midwest to craft her contemplative modern-folk tapestries – offers a revelatory version of the Grateful Dead song Mountains of the Moon, from her latest album the Lookout.The Grateful Dead were, of course, a flagship band for 60s counterculture. From San Fran, tremors from the Summer of Love rippled up the west coast of the US – and then around the world. While the Dead were busy soundtracking Ken Kesey’s Acid Tests, the 1967 Haight-Ashbury scene’s commercial powerhouse was Jefferson Airplane, a relatively straightforward folk-rock band until the recruitment of siren vocalist Grace Slick. Her vocals on White Rabbit – with its exhortation to “feed your head” – alongside other songs, such as Somebody to Love, helped the tracks become anthems for the ages.A decade later, the punk revolution was under way, and San Francisco’s North Beach district harboured the latest manifestation of the city’s nonconformist heritage: the Dead Kennedys. They deployed caustic satire in songs like California Über Alles to debunk mainstream American culture and politics.Our penultimate track is Why Won’t You Stay, by one of San Francisco’s greatest songwriters, Mark Eitzel, chronicler of the city’s luckless and heartbroken for the past 30 years – both with legendary band American Music Club, notably on Everclear (Rolling Stone’s Best Album of 1991), and in his more recent solo work. Eitzel’s lachrymose voice is the perfect accompaniment to a Mission bar crawl.Carrying the city’s freak flag proudly into the present day to round off our playlist are Thee Oh Sees, a twin-drummer psychedelic juggernaut led by wild-eyed John Dwyer – proof that San Fran isn’t merely a place, it’s also a state of mind.For more inspiration and to book your trip to the US, visit bausa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df4732e75ee5bf6e7769a7b83156e4ee9574308a/0_0_5309_3186/master/5309.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=911ef4c56f092258607a6fb43a312ac5","title":"us immigration family separations parents children","story":"Form gives parents two options, prompting objections from immigration advocates who say families are being misledUS immigration officials have been instructed to ask parents separated from their children under Donald Trump’s “zero-tolerance” immigration policy to choose whether to return to their countries with – or without – their offspring.The instructions, laid out in a government form, come one week after a judge ordered the Trump administration to reunite the roughly 2,300 migrant children who were ripped apart from their parents at the border.The form, which was first reported by NBC News, presents two options to migrant parents as part of a notice for removal from the United States: “I am requesting to reunite with my child(ren) for the purpose of repatriation to my country of citizenship” or “I am affirmatively, knowingly and voluntarily requesting to return to my country of citizenship without my minor child(ren) who I understand will remain in the United States to pursue available claims of relief”. was able to obtain the form and verify its authenticity. The form stipulates that immigration enforcement agents must read its contents to detained parents in a language they understand. The majority of border crossings in question pertain to migrants fleeing violence in Central America and seeking asylum in the US.More than 2,300 children were separated from their parents under the Trump administration\u0027s zero-tolerance immigration policy. Although the policy has been halted after international opposition, there are concerns that promised reunions won\u0027t happen any time soon, if at all.The Department of Homeland Security says the government knows the location of all children in its custody and is working to reunite them with their families. But attorneys with the Texas Civil Rights Project, which represents hundreds of separated families, said it has “grave concerns about the government’s ability to track parents and children who have been caught up in this crisis”.Connecting families presents an enormous challenge because once they are detained at the border, children and parents enter two separate systems: for parents, the US Department of Homeland Security and criminal prosecution meanwhile, children are given “unaccompanied alien child” status and transferred to the US Department of Health and Human Services. With no clear process in place, it’s possible some families will never be reunited. By\u0026nbspLauren Gambino and Olivia Solon.\u0026nbspDisturbing reports have already emerged about parents deported involuntarily without their children.Immigration advocates have objected to the form, citing asylum laws that allow for migrants to pursue their claims even if they have been issued an order for deportation. Lee Gelernt, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), said the form did not provide an option for migrants to challenge their removal before a judge.“The government is misleading parents into thinking they can only get their child back if they agree to removal,” Gelernt told the .The ACLU is leading a lawsuit to stop the Trump administration from separating families and to swiftly reunite parents and children.The issue has emerged among the most controversial of Trump’s presidency. Last week, a judge in the southern district of California ordered the US government to reunite parents with children under the age of five within 14 days and ordered that all other children separated from their parents be reunited within 30 days.The Trump administration has nonetheless provided little clarity on its plans to reunite families. The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately return a request for comment when reached by the  for more information about the process or how it was complying with the federal judge’s order.“Right now, we don’t know of any comprehensive plan the government has,” said Gelernt. “We’re concerned both about whether they’re going to meet the deadlines and whether there is noncompliance.”The ACLU is in the midst of negotiating with the government to get a list of every parent separated from a child. The parties are scheduled to appear before a court in San Diego on Friday, which marks another deadline set out by last week’s preliminary injunction – that detained parents be allowed to speak to their children over the phone within a period of 10 days.In the 26 June ruling, Judge Dana Sabraw ordered the Trump administration to stop deporting parents without their children unless the parent “affirmatively, knowingly and voluntarily” agreed to being removed from the country alone. It is not known how many parents were deported without their children prior to the judge’s decision.Government officials have privately acknowledged they are struggling to meet the judge’s deadline to reunite families. According to a report in Politico published on Monday, staffers at the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the federal ision that oversees unaccompanied migrant children, said they had yet to receive instructions on how to proceed.The health and human services secretary, Alex Azar, testified before Congress last week that “several hundreds” of children who were being held in detention centers and migrant shelters had been reunited with parents or relatives. Azar estimated that as of last Monday, 2,047 children remained in the custody of the US government. Those numbers have not been independently verified.A group of Democratic senators demanded further updates in a letter sent to the Trump administration on Monday.“We are deeply concerned by reports of chaotic attempts to reunify parents and children that have been separated at the border,” the letter, which was addressed to Azar and the secretary of homeland security, Kirstjen Nielsen, stated. “The hastily-signed order provided no clarity on how to reunify families, or how to handle families that have already been separated or new families that cross the border seeking asylum.” The letter sought a list of separated children, names of parents or adult relatives, and another list linking the two."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69bfaee41ee2f082caaf089d346f92af7ac41734/89_4_4508_2706/master/4508.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5283e8bc7d43d224132246c384f5556","title":"doubts raised over merkel compromise on border controls","story":"Junior partner in coalition has previously objected to plan, and Austria may retaliateA plan for a new border regime in southern Germany, struck on Monday night by Angela Merkel and her hardline interior minister to defuse a bitter row in the coalition government, is coming under heavy scrutiny.The border deal, hailed by the German chancellor as a “good compromise”, foresees setting up so-called transit centres on the country’s southern border, where asylum seekers who have already been registered in other EU countries will be held until they can be sent back to those countries.Like “airside” areas at international airports, the centres would be located on German soil in geographical but not legal terms, making it easier to deport people held in them.The interior minister, Horst Seehofer, had threatened to resign over the issue of immigration on Sunday night, but the deal has allowed Merkel to avert a fallout between her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its sister party in Bavaria, the Christian Social Union (CSU).However, critics say the scheme is at worst unworkable and at best merely moves the political crisis to another part of the coalition.The transit centre scheme was proposed in 2015 by a CSU politician, Stephan Mayer, but was rejected in the strongest terms by the Social Democratic party (SPD), then and now a junior partner in Merkel’s grand coalition government.Three years on, the centre-left SPD, wary of fresh elections, may feel less inclined to provoke a new crisis, but it could again reject the proposal at a meeting with members of Merkel’s bloc in Berlin on Tuesday. The party leader, Andrea Nahles, said on Tuesday morning that she opposed the term “transit centres”.The proposal could also shift the political crisis south to Austria, where the government said it could take its own measures to protect its borders.The compromise deal between Merkel and Seehofer suggests refugees arriving at the Austrian-Bavarian border who were first registered in EU states that now refuse to take them back, such as Hungary, should be sent back to Austria.At a press conference on Tuesday afternoon, the Austrian government poured scorn on the proposals. “This agreement does not exist, and to be honest I find it hard to image how such an agreement could come about,” said the interior minister, Herbert Kickl, of the far-right Freedom party.The Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, said it was not yet clear to him what exactly Germany was planning to do on its borders. “We are certainly not prepared to sign deals that come at Austria’s expense,” added Kurz, until recently seen as a supporter of Seehofer’s hardline course.Seehofer said on Tuesday he had already started to discuss a possible solution with Kurz and would travel to Vienna for further talks on Thursday.Meanwhile, migration experts have criticised the border arrangement proposed by Merkel and Seehofer. “The German government has truly made a mountain out of a molehill,” said Gerald Knaus, the architect of the 2015 migration deal between the European Union and Turkey.Knaus, the director of the thinktank ESI, said the deal struck by the German government could have the unintended consequence of increasing migration into Germany, if for example the Greek government used the new agreement to unite families with people who had already arrived in Germany, while in return taking back some asylum seekers who have been fingerprinted in Greece.In addition, Knaus said, the emphasis on transit centres would mean Bavaria bearing most of the administrative burden of registering and processing refugees and migrants who arrive in Germany.Additional reporting by Jennifer Rankin"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a9a7ede55a99d625a2d39ffbc410ed8427e366d/0_58_3722_2233/master/3722.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3ef46e85dbbfd765ae453e354681f9f","title":"german border deal how might it work and what are the obstacles","story":"The CDU and CSU have proposed setting up transit centres but questions remainAfter weeks of tensions within the conservative alliance of the Christian Democrats (CDU) and the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) over Germany’s handling of refugees and migrants, the chancellor, Angela Merkel (CDU), and her interior minister, Horst Seehofer (CSU), claim to have reached a compromise.  Germany is to establish so-called transit zones along the southern border in Bavaria to facilitate the accelerated removal of refugees and migrants who have no entitlement to seek asylum in Germany. The decision aims to bring to an end a longstanding row over Germany’s asylum policy, sparked by the refugee crisis of 2015, which has proved the biggest challenge in the almost 14 years of Merkel’s chancellorship. But questions loom over a deal that both Merkel and Seehofer are claiming as a victory, not least how it can be effectively implemented and whether it will get the approval of the CDU and CSU’s other partner in the grand coalition, the Social Democrats. The SPD roundly rejected a similar proposal by the CDU in 2015. The deal follows weeks of conflict, with Seehofer threatening to unilaterally close the Bavarian border to people who had applied for asylum elsewhere in the EU – a move that Merkel rejected because of fears it would threaten the EU partnership and could lead to the end of the passport-free Schengen zone. The row has threatened to bring down Germany’s coalition government. The CDU and CSU have agreed that so-called transit centres are the most effective way to secure Germany’s southern border, through which most of the newcomers have arrived, and to ensure that refugees whose asylum cases are the responsibility of countries other than Germany can be prevented from entering German territory. According to the plan, asylum seekers who have already registered in other countries with whom Merkel has secured a bilateral deal can be deported back to the relevant country after a short stay in the transit centre. There they would have their case for asylum heard according to EU rules. Others would be returned immediately, without entering the transit zone, if the EU country from which they have travelled has not signed up to a bilateral deal. The main obstacle to this is that so far no deal has been secured with Austria, from where most refugees arrive in Bavaria, and it remains unclear whether Austria will be prepared to sign up to such a deal. So far the Austrian government has said it will wait to see details of the German proposal before deciding how to proceed, but a government spokesman said the country was preparing to tighten its border controls. The rules are confusing and likely to be complicated to implement. The zones or centres could feasibly be fenced or guarded metal container accommodation or tent camps. They would be located directly on the border in so-called exterritorial zones – that is to say, on German soil but, legally speaking, not in Germany. The asylum seeker would be obliged to live and sleep in these contained buildings and would undergo a fast-track administrative process. During this time the asylum seeker would not be entitled to leave the transit zone. It remains unclear for how long an asylum seeker would be detained at the border. There are some suggestions it could be around a week.  The SPD has to agree on the compromise. In 2015 when something similar was proposed by the CDU, it rejected the idea, likening transit zones to detention centres for refugees, and in some cases comparing them to concentration camps. Criticism has also come from the police, whose presence will be vital in ensuring the transit zones work. Jörg Radek, deputy chair of the police trade union, has called the idea “an old chestnut”, pointing out that its main flaw is that it is limited to the 500-mile German-Austrian border. Germany’s remaining stretch of border is around 1,860 miles long. The police argue that many people enter Germany outside of the main control points (there are currently three of them) on the German-Austrian border. Legally, those who do so will not be able to be put into transit centres, as they will already be miles away from the border. Arguably the new system would encourage people to enter Germany illegally along the vast swathes of so-called “green border”. In the short term, maybe, but after such a personal and chronic squabble, which has exhausted any trust that may once have existed between the long-term rivals, it is hard to see how they can continue to work together effectively.  As to whether it was worth it to have pushed the coalition government to the brink of collapse, the CSU will have to wait until 14 October, when Bavarians will go to the polls for a state election, to find out. The CSU wants to claw back the thousands of votes it has lost to the rightwing populist Alternative für Deutschland, but opinion polls suggest the row has done little to increase trust in the party.

Photograph: Bryan O’Brien Far from printing election leaflets and posters, most TDs are spending the last days of this Dáil term counting the hours until the start of the summer recessat the end of next week.A general election this year is still seen as unlikely despite recent speculation, but the deal underpinning the Fine Gael-led minority government is coming to an end.The question of what succeeds it – an extension to the current arrangement or an election – will have to be faced in the coming weeks.Varadkar has said talks on any extension should begin before the third and final budget of the deal, but Martin has consistently countered that the arrangement allows for a review at the end of the year. It is not yet clear if Varadkar will formally request that such talks begin over the remainder of the summer, but such a request is certain to be rejected.Fianna Fáil believes the Taoiseach is attempting to create the circumstances in which he can call an autumn election. “The aggressor has been Leo,” said one party frontbencher. “He is the Taoiseach, his words matter. He knew exactly what he was doing.”However, it was said the “majority view” among the Fine Gael parliamentary party is that the deal should be extended until the summer of 2020. Fianna Fáil – in a weak position after the referendum to repeal the Eighth Amendment – has also largely come to the view that an extension to the confidence and supply deal is preferable to an election. It has agreed with the budgetary parameters set down by Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe, and Martin has also said there should be no instability as the Brexit process reaches a conclusion later this year. The remaining sticking point between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael is over when talks on an extension should begin. Another member of the Fianna Fáil frontbench said the process could begin before the budget, although nothing would be agreed until the budget is passed. This view is not, however, shared by other senior sources.If he wants to call an election in the autumn – those close to him insist he does not – Varadkar will have to break the confidence and supply agreement. The text of the deal, which Varadkar helped negotiate, is clear: “It is agreed that both parties to this agreement will review this Framework Agreement at the end of 2018.”The Taoiseach has argued that post-Brexit Britain may not be trusted to strike future trade deals if it does not keep its commitments on the Border. “How could anyone make a deal with a country that doesn’t stand by its commitments?” he recently asked. A similar question could be asked of him and his party if he tries to agree another government pact after breaking his word on this one. Such reputational damage would be a big price to pay for calling an election in September, because Martin will not agree to substantive talks until November, a distinction likely to cause bafflement among the electorate. Martin, after all, has agreed to the passage of the Finance and Social Welfare Bills, which usually take up until Christmas.Varadkar needs a compelling argument to call an election if he intends to do so, and Martin has done his best to deprive him of one. Against the backdrop of the crucial October summit of the European Council – anticipated to agree an EU-UK withdrawal treaty – there is an extremely weak basis on which to seek a mandate.“It is difficult to see that call being made,” said a Fine Gael TD close to Varadkar, before adding: “That doesn’t mean it won’t happen.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3552720.1530633768!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"fast track housing delivery seriously wrong council chief says","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDublin City Council chief executive Owen Keegan said the lengthy delays meant the housing projects would “be difficult to describe” as rapid build. Photograph: Cyril ByrneThe head of Dublin City Council has said something is “seriously wrong” in the delivery of rapid-build modular housing, with projects delayed by nearly two years.Delays due to design, planning and procurement issues have held up two modular housing schemes, which are billed as being quicker than traditional construction projects.Internal emails show council chief executive Owen Keegan said the lengthy delays meant the projects would “be difficult to describe” as rapid build.One 70-unit “rapid” development on Bunratty Road in the north Dublin suburb of Coolock and another five-unit city centre development on Fishamble Street were announced in November 2016. Originally scheduled to be completed by the end of this year, both projects are now not estimated to be finished until late 2020.The two “volumetric build” projects are pilot schemes, that involve stackable, factory-built apartment units, to allow for shorter construction periods.Last April, Mr Keegan wrote to Brendan Kenny, the head of the council’s housing services, saying it appears “there is something seriously wrong” with the delivery time frame.Responding to the concerns, Mr Kenny said several of the current rapid-build scheme sites were “problematic,” and that the rapid aspect “does not kick in until the contractor goes on site”.“I do accept that is has taken far too long to get to where we are now and it is essential that we speed up all such projects within the pipeline,” he said in an email on April 25th.Speaking to The , Mr Kenny said the two modular apartment projects were the first of their kind, which had led to design and procurement taking longer than expected. “Public procurement is as slow as it ever was. It’s faster when we get on site,” he said.Internal emails, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, also reveal Mr Keegan questioned the accuracy of the local authority’s estimated housing delivery figures.A draft submission prepared for Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy in January said the council planned to return 800 “voids” a year, for the next four years. Voids are vacant local authority homes that require a significant amount of work to be brought back into use.Questioning the estimates, Mr Keegan said he “would have thought that we have eliminated most of the backlog of voids at this stage”. More than 2,866 voids have been refurbished in the last three years by the council.The 3,200 voids the local authority plans to return to use over the next four years are not units that were long-term vacant, as previous voids had been, Mr Kenny told The .“Our social housing stock is quite old. We still anticipate we will have houses where an older tenant may die, who had been living there for maybe 30 years. That house has to be seriously renovated,” he said.The majority of voids that had been returned to use in recent years had been vacant for several years, he said.Mr Keegan also said it was “disappointing” the local authority estimated it would directly build fewer homes this year compared with 2017, down from 235 to 217, emails from late January show.There was “very significant political importance” behind hitting social housing construction targets in 2018, he said, and asked if any rapid-build schemes could be brought forward to help meet the targets."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3552898.1530646231!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government to proceed with referendum on woman s place in home","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Justice Charlie Flanagan is to seek Cabinet approval on Thursday to proceed with a referendum on the Constitutional reference to a woman’s place in the home. Photograph: Eric Luke  The The Government is to proceed with plans to delete the reference to a woman’s place in the home from the Constitution.Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan is to seek Cabinet approval on Thursday to proceed with the referendum, scheduled for October 26th alongside a vote on the offence of blasphemy.Mr Flanagan’s decision is in spite of concern raised as to why the Government chose to ignore the advice of the Constitutional Convention and its own departmental taskforce on the matter.Both the convention and the Department of Justice had advised against repeal simpliciter, instead recommending making the Constitutional clause gender neutral or including carers both “in the home” and “beyond the home”.The proposal came before Cabinet two weeks ago but did not pass as the Minister for Children Katherine Zappone and Minister for Social Protection Regina Doherty argued for input from the Oireachtas women’s caucus.Mr Flanagan met with the grouping last week and outlined his proposal. The group will meet again on Wednesday to decide how to proceed.Government sources said it is their belief amending the wording would be a “legal quagmire for the Department of Justice and Social Protection”.“It would open the State open to a number of unintended consequences. A straight forward deletion is the best option available to us.“There is a financial implication but in reality, the main argument was that amending it would create a series of difficulties that the State is not prepared to take,” the source added.Article 41.2 of the Constitution refers to a woman’s place in the home. It says the State “recognises that by her life within the home, woman gives to the State a support without which the common good cannot be achieved”.“The State shall, therefore, endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home,” it continues.The Constitutional Convention examined this issue and reported to the government in 2013. Some 88 per cent of members voted against its inclusion in the Constitution.Meanwhile, 98 per cent voted in favour of amending the wording to render it gender-neutral. It was also proposed to include other carers both “in the home” and “beyond the home”.The proposal for deletion has been questioned by a number of female TDs and Senators privately.Fine Gael TD Marcella Corcoran Kennedy, deputy chairwoman of the woman’s caucus, said members would discuss the matter in detail today.Ms Corcoran Kennedy told The  some TDs and Senators questioned the Minister’s decision and others raised whether carers should receive another form of Constitutional protection.“Some people think repeal simpliciter is fine, others think that there should be a plan to insert caring in another section in the Constitution. This is what we will discuss in detail and decide the course of action,” Ms Corcoran Kennedy added.Fine Gael Senator Catherine Noone said she was in favour of straightforward deletion, arguing the 81-year-old clause should never have been inserted in the Constitution.It was inserted in a different era and reflects a patriarchal society that no longer exists, Ms Noone added.The vote will take place at the same time as a referendum on removing the offence of blasphemy from the Constitution. The votes on the two topics may coincide with a presidential election, if one takes place.Voters will be asked whether Article 40.6.1 (i) should be retained in the Constitution.Blasphemy is defined as “matter that is grossly abusive or insulting in relation to matters held sacred by any religion, thereby causing outrage among a substantial number of the adherents of that religion”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3552896.1530646682!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"lack of women at top level in department of finance unacceptable","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Finance Paschal Donohoe acknowledged there is ‘a lot of progress to make’ to address the disparity between men and women in the most senior positions. File photograph: Nick BradshawThe gender gap at the top in the Department of Finance is “unacceptable”, Paschal Donohoe has admitted.He acknowledged there is “a lot of progress to make” to address the disparity between men and women in the most senior positions there, but said he expected that to change over time. Mr Donohoe said there was greater equality at principal officer and assistant principal officer level and he expected to see that over time at the highest level.He pointed out that women were in senior positions in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, at a level “above the Civil Service average”.But he agreed that women at all grades who take time out to have children are paying a penalty in terms of promotion, status and pay.He said the time taken for maternity leave and, to a far lesser extent for paternity leave, “is a sliver of an entire working life” and all Government departments are working to “ensure nobody is penalised in any way for taking maternity leave”.Mr Donohoe, who is Minister in both departments, was responding to Labour finance spokeswoman Joan Burton who said the cliché of “male, pale and stale” came immediately to mind in relation to the Department of Finance.During question time in the Dáil, the former tánaiste said in Finance “the men occupy a disproportionate amount of the senior positions while women are congregated in the lower pay scales and grades”.Figures released by the Minister show that four of the nine most senior positions in Public Expenditure and Reform are held by women, which is above the average for the Civil Service.But “the seven equivalent positions in the Department of Finance are all currently occupied by men”, he said.The statistics also show that women make up 54 per cent of all staff in Public Expenditure and Reform and just under 43 per cent in Finance.There is a clear majority of women (70.9 per cent in Public Expenditure and 62 per cent in Finance) working at clerical officer and executive officer grades.Women make up 47 per cent of those serving in the management roles of principal officer and assistant principal officer in Public Expenditure and 39 per cent in Finance.Mr Donohoe said a target of 50:50 gender balance in new appointments at senior level is now in place. The ‘best person for the job’ approach is still in place but where candidates are of equal merit, then priority is given to a female candidate.Ms Burton, referring to her own time in government, said she knew what it was like to sit in Cabinet where only four of about 18 people were female.She added that for every extra woman appointed “one changes the conversation and the lived experience of those who are making the decisions”.The Minister said the ision of leadership positions between men and women in Finance “is not where it needs to be” and he agreed with Ms Burton that “the leadership of our Government departments needs to reflect the ersity and strength of our country”.He said in Finance “we clearly have a lot of progress to make in that at senior level” but not in Public Expenditure."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3552873.1530645056!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"simon coveney to meet top level soft brexiteers in london","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney: to meet  UK cabinet office minister David Lidington and chancellor of the exchequer Philip Hammond in London on Wednesday. Photograph: Cyril ByrneMinister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney will visit London on Wednesday where he has scheduled meetings with cabinet office minister David Lidington and chancellor of the exchequer Philip Hammond, regarded by the Government as two of the leading “soft Brexiteers” in the British government.Mr Coveney will also meet Northern Secretary Karen Bradley and Michael Gove, who was one of the chief campaigners for Brexit. Mr Coveney is also scheduled to meet Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer.His spokesman said that Mr Coveney would be “hammering home the consistent and identical message from the Taoiseach, Jean Claude Juncker, Donald Tusk, Michel Barnier and the EU27 that Britain must deliver legally on the commitments made in December and in March and in all circumstances must protect peace in Northern Ireland with the guarantee of no hard border.”Meanwhile, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said that avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland after the UK leaves the EU was about “much more” than trade and money.Speaking to reporters at the New York Stock Exchange on Wall Street, Mr Varadkar was asked which was more important: a resolution to the Border issue that has ground down talks between the EU or UK, or a post-Brexit EU-UK trade deal.“They’re both important, but the issue of avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland is about much more than trade and about much more than money,” he said.“It is about maintaining our peace process and allowing people that live on either side of the Border to continue to lead normal lives and to lead peaceful lives.”He would not comment on the UK government’s so-called white paper on London’s latest proposal that is reported to keep the UK tied to European market rules for goods post-Brexit until he saw it.British prime minister Theresa May is aiming to sign off on the UK’s plan at a key meeting of her Cabinet on Friday.Mr Varadkar said that he believed a hard border would be avoided.The tricky part in Brexit negotiations was, he said, ensuring free trade between the UK and the EU, including Ireland, post-Brexit.“The only barrier to achieving those things is the UK’s own red lines, but if they soften, Europe will be flexible,” he said.Mr Varadkar said there were “real risks” from the potential impact of Brexit which was why it must be “as soft as possible and to have a transitional period.”“Any move towards protectionism is something that we oppose and a real risk,” he said.The Taoiseach said that he was unaware of reports that the Revenue Commissioners were scouting locations for possible border checkpoints in the event of no Brexit deal to avoid a hard border under contingency plans.“If they are, they are certainly are not doing it at the direction of Government and if they are, they can stop,” he said.“We are not contemplating a physical border between Northern Ireland and Ireland that is simply not going to happen.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

The vote for Brexit was a cry for greater opportunity from those who feel that they and their children are mired in lives that offer little hope. \u0026nbspBrexit is a done deal, and the exact parameters of exit from the European Union will have limited and short-term bearing on the UK’s economic performance.The basic facts are uncontroversial. Britain will trade somewhat less than before, at least until British businesses redirect some of their trade away from the EU to more dynamic Asian and US economies.The expected decline in the extent of international trade will, for a while, reduce Britain’s overall economic welfare. But, as the Harvard economist Dani Rodrik has repeatedly emphasized, citizens’ economic welfare changes only modestly when countries with extensive trade relationships increase or decrease the extent of their international trade.Estimates of large (sometimes very large) costs of Brexit rely on the wildly unreasonable assumption that British productivity will decline precipitously and permanently.True, the UK\u0026nbsphas been growing slower than other advanced economies since the Brexit vote but that slower growth is almost entirely explained by senseless fiscal austerity being pursued by Prime Minister Theresa May’s government while other countries have neutral or even expansionary fiscal policy.There has been much handwringing about the depreciation of the pound triggered by the Brexit vote. Currency depreciation normally makes citizens poorer: they pay more for foreign products and receive reduced prices for their exports. But the UK was running a large (and growing) current account deficit.Put simply, the UK was not richer it was living beyond its means. Prolonged current account deficits would eventually have caused a sharper and, therefore, potentially more disruptive exchange rate depreciation. For now, the depreciation has helped narrow the deficit (precisely by making British exports less expensive for trading partners – stimulating demand for British goods – and making imports dearer for British consumers). Britain is on a more sustainable growth path.Moreover, as I noted at the time, the pound’s depreciation reflected an abrupt decline in “hot money flows” into the UK\u0026nbspThese foreign funds were being used by Russian oligarchs and Indian billionaires to bid up prices of property in London. After the Brexit decision, the rate of rise in London property price increases slowed markedly recently prices have actually dropped.Since the modest trade costs of Brexit are at least partially offset by favourable developments, it is crucial to recognise what is really at stake. The Brexit vote expressed the anxiety of those who felt that their prospects of rising up the income ladder were vanishing. In her October 2016 address to the Tory party conference in Birmingham, Theresa May seemed to understand that the vote was a plea for greater opportunity and fairness. But she seems to have lost track of that insight.As my student Rachel Lurie and I find in ongoing research, those who voted against Brexit were predominantly low-skilled workers stuck in dead-end jobs or unemployed in Britain’s rust-belt areas. As former Prime Minister Gordon Brown wrote in the days after the Brexit referendum, unable to face Asian competition, British manufacturing “collapsed,” and industrial towns “hollowed out,” leaving semi-skilled workers “on the wrong side of globalisation.”But rust-belt parents had a deeper reason to worry. They were bequeathing poor education and work opportunities to their children. Thus, not only were they themselves stuck, they also felt powerless to create more opportunities for their children and grandchildren.The children, for their part, are as dispirited as their parents. Commentators commonly point out that young British citizens voted more so than their elders to remain in the EU. This ignores the large numbers who did not vote: these were young citizens typically unemployed in socially dysfunctional urban communities.For example, in Greater London, the voter turnout was 79 percent in affluent Kingston upon Thames borough but only 65 percent in Hackney, where large pockets of deep poverty and alienation persist. The non-vote of the young living in bleak urban areas was as much a sign of hopelessness as the exit vote of older rust-belt citizens.Theresa May’s early reading was right: UK\u0026nbspcitizens were indeed pleading through their vote (and non-vote) for a fair shot at the future. They were urgently calling on British leaders to revitalize decaying industrial areas and bring hope to failing urban communities in which they were trapped.The message of the Brexit vote – and of similar protest votes in other western democracies since – was that if citizens do not feel economically secure at home, they will reject international commitments.That crucial message has been lost amid the frenzied Brexit negotiations. Until it is heard, it will continue to haunt, and be repeated again and again.Ashoka Mody\u0026nbspis Visiting Professor of International Economic Policy at Princeton University and former deputy director of the International Monetary Fund’s European and Research Departments.

The setting is spectacular, at the eastern end of Lake Geneva, on the edge of the Swiss Alps. Palm trees line the promenade, there are snowcapped peaks above. You can sit and look at it all day, but when the sun goes down the town shuts down. The vistas here are heavenly, but there’s not a lot to do.Yet for a fortnight each summer, this torpid paradise is transformed. Lighting rigs and big amp stacks spring up along the lakeside. Grizzled musos replace prosperous OAPs. A tax haven for wealthy pensioners becomes the centre of the world music scene, as the Montreux Jazz Festival comes to town.The Montreux Jazz Festival has always been a bit of a misnomer. It started as a jazz festival in 1967, the brainchild of Swiss impresario Claude Nobs. Keith Jarrett played the first festival, Nina Simone played the second, but it’s always doubled as a rock fest, ever since Ten Years After played here in 1969.Since then, Montreux Jazz Festival has become increasingly eclectic. During the 1970s, there were shows by Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry, Carlos Santana, Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, Ella Fitzgerald, Aretha Franklin and Roberta Flack. James Brown came here in the 1980s. Miles Davis played here 11 times between 1973 and 1991. In the Noughties, Montreux hosted Stevie Wonder, David Bowie, Leonard Cohen, Run-DMC and Radiohead.This year’s line-up is similarly erse: Rag ‘n’ Bone Man, Nine Inch Nails, Jamiroquai, Massive Attack, Jamie Cullum, John Cale, Iggy Pop, Nick Cave, Steve Winwood, Van Morrison… and the band that put Montreux on the hard-rock roadmap, heavy metal veterans Deep Purple.Even at their headbanging peak, Deep Purple were never really fashionable. They lacked the mystique of other hard rock bands like Led Zeppelin or The Doors. However, in Ritchie Blackmore they had a lead guitarist to rival Led Zep’s Jimmy Page, and in Jon Lord they boasted a keyboard virtuoso the equal of The Doors’ Ray Manzarek.Montreux started as a jazz festival in 1967, but has doubled as a rock event since 1969 (Claude Nobs Archives)Blackmore left the band long ago, and Lord died in 2012, but the three other core members are still going strong: vocalist Ian Gillan, bassist Roger Glover and drummer Ian Paice (the only ever-present since the band started out, 50 years ago). Along with Lord and Blackmore, this trio recorded Deep Purple’s most famous track, in Montreux in 1971, with one of the most familiar riffs in rock history – “Smoke on the Water”.Blackmore’s immortal riff would have been enough to ensure the song’s longevity, but like all the best rock songs it also tells a story. Thankfully, unlike a lot of heavy metal anthems, there’s nothing mystical about it. Instead, it’s a straightforward account, almost journalistic in its brevity, of how Deep Purple recorded their finest album, Machine Head, in Montreux.Formed in 1968 in Hertford, Deep Purple enjoyed some success with their first two albums, but it was when founder members Ritchie Blackmore, Jon Lord and Ian Paice brought in Ian Gillan and Roger Glover that the band took off. Their Concerto for Group and Orchestra (recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall) attracted heaps of publicity, and their fourth LP, Deep Purple in Rock (with its iconic Mount Rushmore cover, featuring the anthemic “Child in Time”) made their name.Cale and Nick Cave (Emilien Itim)Yet for Deep Purple, like so many bands before and since, this breakthrough album brought a different set of problems. Recording sessions for their fifth album, Fireball, had to be fitted in around a busy schedule of live dates, from the autumn of 1970 until the summer of 1971. The album wasn’t as successful as its predecessor, and was widely regarded as a sideways step.Consequently, the band resolved to record their sixth album without any interruptions or distractions. Montreux Casino would be empty for three weeks that winter, and Nobs had offered them the use of it. All the recording equipment they needed they could take with them, in a mobile recording studio (borrowed from The Rolling Stones).With Swiss punctuality, Deep Purple arrived in Montreux, ready to start recording. Frank Zappa and his band, The Mothers of Invention, were playing the Casino that afternoon, and then the venue would be theirs. It couldn’t have been any simpler. What could possibly go wrong?Great music documentaries to watch nowGlastonbury is taking a fallow year but if you’re still craving your Pilton fix, look no further.

Part two takes a closer look at the Seventies - from Zandra Rhodes’ Queen costumes to the DIY punk explosion.Ian Gillan went to see the show with his girlfriend. He saw a man in the crowd behind him wielding a couple of roman candles. Gillan wasn’t too perturbed – compared to most fireworks, roman candles are usually fairly harmless – but then the bloke chucked them into the air, and they lodged in the rafters. In no time at all, the building was ablaze. “There’s a fire, please stay calm and make your way out,”\u0026nbspannounced Zappa from the stage.The band retreated to their hotel, and watched the fire from the bar. At first, it looked like the blaze might spread to the surrounding buildings, and set the entire town alight, but thankfully the wind blew the flames towards the lake, sending smoke billowing out across the water. It was like a special effects scene from a movie. They sat up late, watching the Casino burn to the ground.The title came to Glover the next morning, as he woke up in his hotel bedroom, but the other band members laughed it down – they said it sounded too druggy. But then Blackmore came up with a riff, that riff, on the spur of the moment, and they had the beginnings of a song.However, right now, their most pressing problem was finding somewhere – anywhere – to record. Mercifully, no one had been hurt, but the Casino was a smoking ruin. Nobs found a vacant theatre called The Pavillon, which seemed fine, but the sound-proofing was useless. They’d just started playing “Smoke on the Water” when the police arrived to shut them down. Luckily, the roadies kept them out, as the policemen hammered on the doors.There was only one thing wrong. There wasn’t quite enough material. They’d recorded six classic tracks, including “Lazy”, “Highway Star”, “Pictures of Home” and “Space Truckin’”, but it still came up a bit short for a full LP. Then they remembered the demo they’d recorded at The Pavillon, just before the Swiss police threw them out. And so belatedly, “Smoke on the Water” ended up on the LP, almost by accident. Today, it’s not only the most celebrated song on the album, but the most celebrated song they’ve ever played.Léon Francioli played Montreux in 1971 (Claude Nobs Archives)Yet even after it scraped onto the LP, “Smoke on the Water” still took a while to become a classic. The main single from the album was “Never Before”, which only reached number 35 in the UK singles chart and never became a live staple. Only in 1973, when “Smoke on the Water” was released as a single in the US and started getting airplay on American radio stations, did it finally begin to break through.But although “Smoke on the Water” has now acquired legendary stand-alone status, it still sits best amid the album for which it was intended, as track five (if you’re listening to it on a CD or some other rubbish modern format) or – far better – as the first track on side two, if you’re listening to the proper vinyl LP. It tells the story of the album, and that’s where it ought to stay.Deep purple: There are hellebores- and then there are Rodney Davey’sDeep Purple looks ready to rock old star DenmanDeep Purple made some fine LPs before and some fine LPs thereafter, but they never made anything quite as good as Machine Head. So what made it click? The tight timeframe was one factor – adversity was another. Far from home in the dead of winter, in a quiet resort in low season, there was an element of “all hands to the pump”\u0026nbspas everyone mucked in together.This no-nonsense attitude was reflected in the production. Sound engineer Martin Birch did a brilliant job. The sound he created was clean and sparse, never overly ornate or fussy. He gave each instrument room to breathe. There was very little overdubbing. It was such a palaver getting out of the hotel and into the mobile studio that they often didn’t bother listening to the playback. By modern standards, this was virtually a live album.Nobs died in 2013, after a skiing accident, aged 76. The Jazz Festival is his enduring testament (he also gets a shout-out as “Funky Claude”\u0026nbspin “Smoke on the Water”). The Casino was rebuilt on the same spot, but sadly they didn’t recreate the Belle Époque splendour of the original structure. The modern replacement is a Seventies eyesore.

blacklist communists information research department ird","story":"Created with Sketch.In 1949 the man who conceived Big Brother gave a semi-secret government department a list of 38 ‘crypto-communists’\u0026nbspand ‘fellow travellers’ –\u0026nbspa revelation that has given rise to a peculiar revisionism of his legacyClick to followThe Independent OnlineGeorge Orwell’s cooperation with the government’s Information Research Department has led to some on the hard left branding him a ‘reactionary snitch’To many, he came close to being a secular saint.George Orwell, born 115 years ago on Monday, was the writer who challenged the iniquities of imperialism and capitalism, who took a bullet in the throat fighting fascism, and who taught a Western audience about the horrors of Stalinist communism.That he died young, of tuberculosis at the age of 46, in 1950, served only to enhance his posthumous reputation.\u0026nbspHe became, in the words of one astute critic, “the James Dean of the Cold War,\u0026nbspthe John F\u0026nbspKennedy of English letters”.Death may also have saved him from curdling into the kind of bitter, contrarian conservatism that seems to have been the fate awaiting many a one-time youthful socialist.Instead, Orwell is often remembered as a man of “genius”, the “greatest political writer of the 20th\u0026nbspcentury”.The commonly accepted view of the man is encapsulated in the aims of the foundation bearing his name.\u0026nbspThrough the coveted Orwell Prize, the Orwell Foundation seeks “to celebrate honest writing and reporting, to uncover hidden lives, to confront uncomfortable truths, to promote Orwell’s values of integrity, decency and fidelity to truth”.And yet there is one blemish – or complication – in the reputation of St George.It lay hidden until 1996 when Foreign Office file FO 111189 was made public under the 30-year rule.The hitherto secret file revealed that in 1949 the great writer had, via his friend Celia Kirwan, given a semi-secret government propaganda unit called the Information Research Department\u0026nbsp(IRD) what became known as “Orwell’s List”.Orwell effectively handed over to the British authorities the names of 38 public figures whom he thought should be treated with suspicion as secret communists or “fellow travellers” who sympathised with the aims of Stalin’s Russia.When the existence of Orwell’s List was revealed in 1996, and when the Foreign Office finally ulged who was on it in 2003, the initial reactions seemed tinged with sadness and hedged about with qualifications.But the internet was young then.Now it has grown into a giant bristling with social media channels and anger\u0026nbspswift to judge, slow to reflect.And so George Orwell, a hero to so many, is now demonised online as a “fake socialist”, a “reactionary snitch”, a traitor, a McCarthyite “weasel”.“Orwell’s List is a term that should be known by anyone who claims to be a person of the left,” declares one fairly widely circulated condemnation.\u0026nbsp“At the end of his life, he was an outright counter-revolutionary snitch, spying on leftists on behalf of the imperialist British government.”“He was an anti-socialist,” asserts another indictment, “corresponding with British secret services and keeping a blacklist of writers.”So widespread has the vilification become,\u0026nbspthat “Orwell as snitch”\u0026nbspis sometimes played with – not entirely seriously – as an internet meme.“I can’t get very worked up about the list,” he says mildly.\u0026nbsp“I don’t see it particularly as a mistake. \u0026nbsp“You just have to see it in the context of the time.”And that context, reveals Taylor, was explained to him by the left wing former Labour leader Michael Foot.Taylor recalls: “Foot told me that the great difficulty if you were a left wing Labour MP in the 1940s was working out exactly where your friends stood.\u0026nbspYou didn’t know whether some were listening to you and agreeing, and then going straight to the British Communist Party’s headquarters in King Street and telling them everything.”“Another example of the kind of thing they were facing,” says Taylor, “was the man who worked in the Foreign Office in the room next to Orwell’s IRD friend Celia.\u0026nbspHis name was Guy Burgess.“There were at least a dozen elected parliamentarians taking their orders from a foreign country,” adds Taylor.\u0026nbsp“What could be more traitorous than that?”Years after Orwell listed him as giving the “strong impression of being some kind of Russian agent”, the Mitrokhin Archive of KGB documents revealed that journalist Peter Smollett had indeed been a Russian agent.Driberg, who was\u0026nbspnamed on Orwell’s List as well as the KGB papers (Getty)Also listed by Orwell, and as a KGB agent by Mitrokhin, was the leading Labour MP Tom Driberg.Laying aside the irony that Michael Foot was himself once falsely accused of being a KGB agent, it is, then, perhaps no coincidence that the IRD was in fact set up, not by a headbanging Tory, but by Labour foreign secretary Ernest Bevin.“This was at a time when the Soviet Union was swallowing up what had previously been independent East European states,” says Taylor. “The IRD was producing reasoned expositions, pamphlet literature, telling people on the ground in Eastern Europe why they should resist this kind of stuff. \u0026nbsp“But a lot of British people were still seduced by the idea of our ally ‘good old Uncle Joe Stalin’, when in fact the bloke was a mass murdering psychopath.\u0026nbspAnd you were also dealing with some really hardline ideologues.“So Orwell’s idea was, if you are going to get somebody to write these kinds of pamphlets, they have to be genuine democrats.“He was a democratic socialist who wanted democratic socialists, not right wingers, to be writing this propaganda.\u0026nbspBut he wanted them to be people who had seen through the Soviet illusion, not covert stooges for Stalin’s Russia.”And so Taylor’s anger – such as it is – is reserved, not for Orwell, but for those like the late Labour MP Gerald Kaufman, who greeted the revelation of the list with the “pathetic” remark: “Orwell was a Big Brother too”.“This wasn’t Orwell denouncing anybody,” says Taylor.\u0026nbsp“He wasn’t writing public articles in the press saying ‘these people are evil’.It should perhaps be noted that Celia Kirwan was a bit more than just a friend.\u0026nbspThree years earlier, Orwell had actually proposed marriage to her in the emotional turmoil that followed the death of his first wife Eileen.Kirwan rebuffed his advances, but some have suggested that Orwell, aware of his failing health, might have been seeking the comfort of a beautiful woman when\u0026nbspon 6 April 1949\u0026nbsphe wrote offering to name those who “should not be trusted as propagandists”. \u0026nbspHe certainly knew the list was not for Kirwan’s eyes only.\u0026nbspAs noted by Timothy Garton Ash, the historian who persuaded the Foreign Office to reveal the document in 2003, Orwell sent his list to Kirwan with a reference to “your friends” who would read it.And as Garton Ash also noted, the IRD did not confine itself to relatively innocuous pamphleteering.In the New York Review of Books article that formed the first detailed analysis of the list’s contents, Garton Ash wrote: “By the late 1950s, IRD had a reputation as ‘the dirty tricks department’ of the Foreign Office, indulging in character assassination, false telegrams, putting itching powder on lavatory seats\u0026nbspand other such Cold War pranks”.When he sent his list to Celia Kirwan in 1949, Orwell might not have known that this was the IRD’s direction of travel, but of all people, the author of 1984, who envisaged the Ministry of Truth, should surely have been aware of the possibility.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThat said, as Garton Ash also wrote, not much seemed to have happened to the people on Orwell’s List (apart from missing out on the IRD pamphlet-writing gig).\u0026nbspIt seems their names weren’t even passed to MI5 or MI6.In America, Hollywood actors blacklisted during the McCarthy era\u0026nbsphad their careers and lives ruined.\u0026nbspIn England, Michael Redgrave appeared on Orwell’s List in 1949 and starred in the film adaptation of Orwell’s novel 1984 seven years later.Peter Smollett, named by Orwell as a likely Russian agent, got an OBE.2017 isn’t ‘1984’ – it’s stranger than Orwell imaginedREAR WINDOW: COLD WAR:The British Ministry of PropagandaBig Brother with a high moral senseIn other words, what happened to those on Orwell’s List seems to have borne no comparison to the fate of Big Brother’s fictional victims or the real millions who died in the purges and repression ordered by Stalin.“The list invites us to reflect again on the asymmetry of our attitudes toward\u0026nbspNazism and communism,” wrote Garton Ash, whose own experiences of being spied on by the communist East German Stasi informed his book The File. \u0026nbspWhat if Orwell had given the government a list of closet Nazis, he wondered.\u0026nbsp“Would anyone be objecting?”And in truth, there does seem a certain asymmetry in the online articles of denunciation.Indeed it is hard not to sense the inspiration of Private Eye’s (fictional) veteran class warrior Dave Spart in some of the articles condemning Orwell as “a social democratic traitor collaborating with the capitalist state against revolutionaries trying to create socialism.”“Sure, the USSR did a lot of objectionable things,” says one writer.\u0026nbsp“But … Western imperialist countries commit much more heinous crimes throughout the world every day.”Which is one way to gloss over the Gulag.The 15 best opening lines in literature115 Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen“It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a

The first time Yossarian saw the chaplain he fell madly in love with him.A stronger charge against Orwell might be that of antisemitism.\u0026nbspThe private notebooks that formed the basis of the list he sent to the IRD included labels like “Polish Jew”, “English Jew”, and “Jewess”.But Orwell did also devote an entire 1945 essay to discussing how best to combat antisemitism, while having the honesty to admit – and regret – his own occasional lapses into jokes at the expense of Jews.And at the moment, antisemitism might be a problematic charge for some left wingers to level.Taylor, though, is convinced that some amongst “the newly emergent hard left” would secretly love to unleash something against Orwell.And yes, by “newly emergent hard left”, he does mean some Corbynistas.Younger party members, Taylor concedes, might not have the personal memories of the Cold War, still less an instinctive understanding of the context in which Orwell produced his list in 1949.But, he adds: “I am a Labour Party member.\u0026nbspI have been to hear Corbyn speak and noticed how an awful lot of the people there were aged left wingers for whom there had not really been a place in the Labour Party for the last 20 or 30 years.“An awful lot of the hard left these days would pay lip service to Orwell as a beacon of sanity, while secretly having doubts.“There are still a load of extreme lefties out there to whom Orwell is this snivelling little Trotskyite telling them things they don’t want to hear and pointing out things that shouldn’t be pointed out because they get in the way of the revolution.”And to the ideological, Taylor would add the psychological: “Tall poppy syndrome – Orwell is this secular saint, so let’s have a go at him.”This battle over Orwell’s reputation, of course, is more than just a matter of idle literary historical curiosity.Its relevance to the political struggles of today is suggested by the remark of one of the more ferocious online critics.“George Orwell,” he says, “was the first in a long line of Trots-turned-neocons”.It is certainly true that far-right commentators have started trying to co-opt Orwell to their cause, even to the point of suggesting that the man who once chased a fascist across a battlefield with a fixed bayonet would deplore the Antifa movement.This, says Taylor, is pretty much what Orwell feared.“At the time he was giving Celia Kirwan his list, 1984 was about to be published.\u0026nbspOrwell’s great fear was that right wingers would use it as a piece of anti-communist propaganda, and that’s what happened.\u0026nbspImmediately after\u0026nbsp1984 was published, it was used by the CIA as a propaganda tool.“Orwell wrote a very interesting letter to people in the US saying: ‘Look, this is not so much anti-communist as anti-totalitarian.’“He feared what right wingers would do with 1984, but thought it was the price you had to pay for exposing evils like totalitarianism.“And a writer can’t be blamed for how their books are used by people who are determined to twist meaning for malignant ends.”Taylor, though, can’t help wondering whether Orwell would really have been that upset by the comments of “slightly disconnected people” on the far left of the internet.Orwell himself, he points out, never sought secular saint status.\u0026nbspQuite the reverse: “He was very wary of that kind of thing.\u0026nbspIn an essay on Gandhi he effectively says that when people start being referred to as saints there is something very odd about them and it usually ends in disaster.”Instead Taylor has a sneaking suspicion that Orwell might have been rather amused by his online detractors.“People undervalue Orwell’s wry sense of humour,” he says.\u0026nbsp“David Astor, who used to edit the Observer and employed him, told me about the time Orwell came to him saying, ‘You should hear the abuse I have been getting from some of the communist newspapers.’“Orwell said: ‘They call me a fascist octopus.\u0026nbspThey call me a fascist hyena.“Then he paused: ‘They’re very fond of animals’.”\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

We’ve done everything we could but no one seems to care.“It was a nightmare, the biggest you could imagine.”The couple booked their week-long holiday to the five star Atki Hotel on the island of Kos with First Choice and flew out on a TUI jet from Gatwick in June.Mr Mundy, from Portsmouth,\u0026nbspsaid: “It was the first holiday we had together.“We boarded the plane to go to Greece, it was very exciting. We sat to watch a film and chilled out on the plane to pass the time.”They put their passports in a transparent plastic bag and tucked them into the seat pockets for the duration of the four-hour flight.But within minutes of stepping off the plane they realised they didn’t have the documents and instantly tried to backtrack, but were told they couldn’t re-board.Instead a member of staff conducted a search but quickly emerged to say they could not be found.The couple pleaded with staff to have another look and gave detailed instructions about where the passports were, but still they could not be found.Ms Floyd, also from Portsmouth said: “I realised as soon as we got off the plane, it could only have been two minutes tops.“They told us we couldn’t get back on the plane and the made us wait by the door to the airport while someone went to look but they said there was nothing there.”Their surprise turned to horror when they were told they would not be allowed into Greece and would have to return to the UK.UK weather: Temperatures soar as heatwave intensifiesPeople relax in the warm weather on the beach in BrightonPeople enjoying the hot weather and sunshine on the banks of the River Thames in PutneySpectators enjoy the hot weather during day seven of the Nature Valley International at Devonshire ParkHot and sunny day in Hyde Park\u0027s Serpentine lakePeople relax in the warm weather on the beach in EastbournePeople sunbathe as they enjoy the warm weather on Bournemouth beachA person sunbathes on a blow up mattress in the sea off of Bournemouth beach in DorsetA couple relax in the sunshine on the beach in BrightonPeople play in water fountains in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in east LondoChris Bryant from Basingstoke paddle boards at Boscombe Beach in DorsetPeople shelter from the sun beneath umbrellas as they walk in St James\u0027s Park in LondonArianna Espiritu Kelly, 2, eats an ice-cream in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park Victor the Polar Bear enjoys a dip in the water at Yorkshire Wildlife Park People on the beach in BrightonWoman relax in the sunshine on the beach in Hastings, SussexPeople enjoy their lunch break in the sunshine near Tower Bridge in LondonPolice horses drink from a water fountain during the hot weather in Green ParkAnglers fish on New Brighton beach on the Wirral, Merseyside as the sun rises over the Port of Liverpool and the River MerseyA family of lemurs enjoy an ice lolly at Yorkshire Wildlife Park People enjoy the sunshine in St James\u0027s Park in in LondonA duck swims in the algae covered lake in St James\u0027s Park, LondonA couple cycle in the sunshine around Bewl Water in KentA man takes a break in the sun on Southbank, LondonPeople relax in the warm weather on the beach in BrightonPeople enjoying the hot weather and sunshine on the banks of the River Thames in PutneySpectators enjoy the hot weather during day seven of the Nature Valley International at Devonshire ParkHot and sunny day in Hyde Park\u0027s Serpentine lakePeople relax in the warm weather on the beach in EastbournePeople sunbathe as they enjoy the warm weather on Bournemouth beachA person sunbathes on a blow up mattress in the sea off of Bournemouth beach in DorsetA couple relax in the sunshine on the beach in BrightonPeople play in water fountains in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in east LondoChris Bryant from Basingstoke paddle boards at Boscombe Beach in DorsetPeople shelter from the sun beneath umbrellas as they walk in St James\u0027s Park in LondonArianna Espiritu Kelly, 2, eats an ice-cream in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park Victor the Polar Bear enjoys a dip in the water at Yorkshire Wildlife Park People on the beach in BrightonWoman relax in the sunshine on the beach in Hastings, SussexPeople enjoy their lunch break in the sunshine near Tower Bridge in LondonPolice horses drink from a water fountain during the hot weather in Green ParkAnglers fish on New Brighton beach on the Wirral, Merseyside as the sun rises over the Port of Liverpool and the River MerseyA family of lemurs enjoy an ice lolly at Yorkshire Wildlife Park People enjoy the sunshine in St James\u0027s Park in in LondonA duck swims in the algae covered lake in St James\u0027s Park, LondonA couple cycle in the sunshine around Bewl Water in KentA man takes a break in the sun on Southbank, LondonShe added: “We had people around us making sure we didn’t leave.“We were waiting for about 30 minutes for a flight back, we had to wait by the door.

Ms Merkel had feared that Germany toughening its stance could cause a wave of border closures across Europe and threaten the integrity of the EU’s\u0026nbsppassportless\u0026nbspSchengen Area.“We will be obliged to take measures to avoid disadvantages for Austria and its people,”\u0026nbspthe Austrian government said in a statement. The statement called for Germany to clarify its position. Under the\u0026nbspSchengen agreement countries can impose temporary border controls for security or other reasons.Speaking at the European parliament Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz called for a “paradigm shift in migration” and claimed “a Europe without internal borders” would only be possible “in-the long term” with changes.“We need to focus on the safeguarding of our external borders as the prerequisite for a common border-free Europe,” he said.“We will be obliged to take measures to avoid disadvantages for Austria and its people”But Mr Kurz’s comments attracted criticism from Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission.\u0026nbspIn an apparent swipe at Austrian and Germany, the president said in response: “In 2008, protection of the external borders was proposed by the commission to the member states and there where those then who opposed the idea of a European border protection force and several German speakers refused to allow this.”The new German policy was struck to resolve a dispute between Ms Merkel’s CDU and their allies, the Bavarian CSU party, who had originally wanted some migrants to be turned back at the border.Mr Seehofer had threatened to unilaterally go ahead with his new policy of sending police to the German border to turn away refugees who had registered in other EU countries – effectively challenging Ms Merkel to sack him and bring down her own administration.The pair agreed a compromise policy of setting up so-called “transit centres” which would allow asylum seekers who had already registered in a different EU country to return with the agreement of that country.The CSU and Ms Merkel’s more moderate CDU, who do not stand candidates against each other, have been inseparable allies since 1949 and the split over migration would have been a historic break in German politics.The deal comes after Ms Merkel got the backing from MPs of both parties at a parliamentary meeting on Monday. Mr Seehofer did not attend.The CSU, which only stands candidates in the south eastern state of Bavaria, has long had a reputation for being more conservative than the CDU which organises in the rest of Germany.It has tried to reassert those right-wing credentials in recent months after the far-right AfD made gains in last autumn’s Bundestag elections – notably in Bavaria.\u0026nbspThe focus on migration by the CSU comes ahead of local elections to the Bavarian regional parliament, or Landtag, which are due later this year, with the AfD expected to do well. Bavaria’s geographical position means it is on the overland migration route from the Middle East and Balkans, traversed by many refugees and migrants taking advantage of Angela Merkel’s welcoming borders policy.Despite a major fall in the number of refugees and migrants coming to Europe, and in particular Germany, in the last year, the issue has rocketed up the political agenda after gains for the far-right in elections across the continent.World news in picturesRescue workers come out from the Tham Luang cave complex, as members of under-16 soccer team and their coach have been found alive according to a local media\u0027s report, in the northern province of Chiang Rai, Thailand.Firefighters scramble to control flames surrounding a fire truck as the Pawnee fire jumps across highway 20 near Clearlake Oaks, California.Presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador greets supporters as he arrives at a polling station during the presidential election in Mexico City.North Korea leader Kim Jong Un inspects Unit 1524 of the Korean People\u0027s Army (KPA).Mount Agung\u0027s crater glows red from the lava as it spews volcanic smoke on Bali Island.

Tension increased dramatically as the Tottenham forward waited while the Colombian team tried to argue the decision with the referee despite video replays showing it was clearly a foul. \u0026nbspThe South Americans even tried to scuff the penalty spot up but Kane, the tournament\u0026rsquos top scorer, remained ice-cool to spark wild celebrations in the stadium and back home.In Brighton Kane\u0026rsquos 57th minute conversion triggered wild celebrations, with groups hugging one another, climbing on top of tables and chairs and flooding on to the streets in delight.

Risk of thundery showers in the south.Thursday to Saturday - Staying largely dry, sunny and very warm for the remainder of the week. Perhaps some isolated thundery showers in places. Probably cloudier and cooler in the northwest Thursday.The World Meteorological Organisation definition of a heatwave is when the daily maximum temperature of more than five consecutive days exceeds the average maximum temperature by 5C, the normal period being 1961-1990.They are most common in summer when high pressure develops across an area.High-pressure systems are slow moving and can persist over an area for a prolonged period of time such as days or weeks.They can occur in the UK due to the location of the jet stream, which is usually to the north of the UK in the summer.This can allow high pressure to develop over the UK resulting in persistent dry and settled weather.The scorching summer of 1976 was the hottest summer since records began.It led to a severe drought owing to the exceptionally dry conditions, although it is thought that 1995 was drier.In the summer of 1976, Heathrow had 16 consecutive days over 30C from June 23 to July 8, and for 15 consecutive days from June 23 to July 7 temperatures reached 32.2C somewhere in England.But the single hottest temperature of 38.5C was set on August 10, 2003.When the mercury shoots up there are several obvious precautions to take.It is advised to make sure you drink a lot of water to make sure you stay hydrated during the hot spell.Keeping a bottle of sunscreen with you to soak up those UV rays is also highly advisable as is ensuring you have a hat to prevent sunstroke."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-9.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\" height=\"720\" width=\"960","title":"get all our great stories with the suns newsletters","story":"So if youre after the news that always drives the conversation of the nation, the showbiz scoops that will shock you, all the goings-on in football from the clubs to the players to the fans, look no further.Sign up to our newsletters today by clicking here now. Key Features:Sun 10 - Receive the 10 biggest and best stories of the day, as selected by our editors, sent straight to your inbox so you’re always in the know.Money - The best deals and advice for you and your family.Fabulous - All the hottest trends in fashion and beauty, celeb news and juicy real-life stories.Football - The best columnists, unmissable highlights from your favourite players and clubs and more.TV\u0026ampShowbiz - Get all the latest celebrity and TV news directly into your inbox.Even better, the newsletters learn what you like, so over time you’ll see more of what you want and less of what you don’t.

They havent done anything wrong.“So rather than letting our emotions rule, please, lets be mature about this problem.“Now, how can we break the taboo? Well, first of all, lets stop with hate.”Child abuse campaigner Matan Uziel, who founded the Real Women Real Stories campaign group, said: “In this twisted video, Ms van der Bruggen is trying to acclimatise people to paedophilia and weirdly and dangerously enough, TEDx allows it.“Paedophilia is not merely a sexual orientation. It is a very serious psychiatric disorder.“Children are always harmed by being involved in premature sex acts for which they are neither fully physically, mentally, or emotionally ready.“I have been inundated with comments from victims of abuse who are angry and upset that TEDx allowed this to be aired.“We are calling for TEDx to remove the video from their YouTube channel immediately.”TED is a US-based non-profit group that posts free talks under the slogan “ideas worth spreading”.A spokesman told The Sun Online that TEDx talks “operate independently” of the main organisation and they don’t usually remove videos unless the speaker requests it.There were no plans to remove this one but organisers “reserve the right to”, the spokesman said, adding: “TED does not support or advocate for paedophilia.”We have reached out to Madeleine van der Bruggen for comment.Earlier this month a similar TEDx talk called “Why our perception of paedophilia has to change” was removed because the speaker “had serious concerns about her own safety in its wake”."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tp-image-cartoon.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"pm theresa may retreats to country bolthole chequers to thrash out brexit plan with cabinet","story":"For on Friday, Theresa May is summoning the entire Cabinet to Chequers, her country retreat, to thrash this out.Cabinet Brexiteers, though, are already nervous about getting bounced — of being presented with a done deal they will have to either accept or resign over at a Chequers meetingThis meeting is taking place far too late. Last October, this column urged Mrs May to get the Cabinet to Chequers and not let them leave until they had agreed on the final deal with the EU they should be aiming for.This delay in setting out what the UK wants is one of the many mistakes that have handed the initiative in these negotiations to the EU.In an attempt to prevent any walkouts at Chequers, the Prime Minister will spend the next few days seeing senior ministers individually. “She’s peeling off people one by one,” I’m told.But I understand there has still not yet been a “model that has been selected to go forward for adjudication by the Cabinet”. I am told the approach at the meeting will be “to rule things out rather than rule things in”.Cabinet Brexiteers, though, are already nervous about getting bounced — of being presented with a done deal they will have to either accept or resign over.One of those co-ordinating the Brexiteer response tells me: “She’ll have to show her hand before Chequers. The idea of bouncing people with papers they haven’t seen is completely unrealistic as to where we are.It might have been possible six months ago, it is not possible now.”Brexiteers are worried about Downing Street’s direction of travel.One tells me: “They’re prepared to give away things, but they don’t understand what they are giving away.”The expectation is that the Government will essentially propose staying in the single market for goods.But what won’t be addressed is what this means for immigration.The EU will — at least initially — demand free movement in exchange for the UK staying in the single market for goods.I understand the current plan is for the white paper to say the UK acknowledges that labour mobility deals normally go alongside trade deals. But there won’t be much more detail than that.Sajid Javid, the new Home Secretary, takes the view that the Government shouldn’t put immigration on the table in these talks until it knows what it wants.He is also of the view that if the EU want a deal on immigration then they should have to ask for it.As a former banker, with experience of commercial negotiations, he — unlike too many people in the Government machine — understands the difference between bid and offer.Among Cabinet ministers there is a growing view that they will all be back at Chequers in September to discuss how much they are prepared to move on immigration.But any attempt to get the UK to allow any EU citizen with a job to come here will encounter resistance.“If you can come if you have a job, that’s basically free movement,” one ally of Brexit Secretary David Davis tells me.Getting the Cabinet to agree at Chequers, though, is only the first challenge for Mrs May.The next — and even more difficult one — is to get the EU to engage with what she is proposing. CONCERNS are mounting in Whitehall about the Nato summit, and what Donald Trump might say and do.Compounding the issue is that Trump will go straight from the summit to a dinner in Britain to mark the start of his visit here – meaning Theresa May won’t be able to avoid having to say what she thinks of his comments.One well-placed Government source insists to me that the Trump/May relationship is better than it is portrayed.But this source admits his telephone manner can be rather surprising.I am told that, in reference to Brexit, he regularly starts their conversations with: “Are you out yet?Mrs May hosts his UK visit on July 13, right after he’s laid the law down at the Nato summit and before he flies out to meet Vladimir Putin. She must stress that lives are at stake. That the West’s security has relied on Nato for 70 years.And that it would be a disaster for the President to undermine it now, with Russia an increasing global menace.THE restoration work at the House of Commons has hit a snag.Some of the oil paintings, which need to be moved, are too big to go through the doors of the rooms they are in.This means that the oil will need to be rehydrated, a complex process, before the canvases are rolled up so they can be moved.This is another reminder of how difficult it will be to do these restoration works without going way over budget. MICHAEL GOVE has ripped up Theresa May’s plan for a new customs partnership with the EU.To the surprise of officials present, Gove tore the document in two at a meeting on Wednesday.After the Brexit inner Cabinet couldn’t reach a consensus on what customs relationship to have with the EU after Brexit, it was split into working groups to look at the two options.Gove was looking at the new customs partnership, which is Theresa May’s preferred model and would see the UK collecting tariffs on the EU’s behalf.Nearly all Brexiteers, including Gove, see this model as bureaucratic, unworkable and fear it will make Britain a far less attractive country to do a trade deal with.Gove and Liam Fox, the two Brexiteers on the three-man working group, had made these points repeatedly in the six weeks of meetings they have had on the subject.But on Wednesday night, when they were presented with the civil service summary of their discussions, they found these points had been downplayed to almost nothing.Instead, the document implied the group thought the new customs partnership was workable.Gove was livid about this and physically ripped it up to show he wasn’t prepared to accept the document as a summary of their discussions.This flash of anger shows that Downing Street would be making a very big mistake if it assumed Gove will accept – and sell to fellow Brexiteers – any deal with the EU, no matter how flawed it is and how much it tied the UK’s hands for the future.Customs will be one of the biggest bones of contention at Chequers.I understand there is talk the model favoured by Brexiteers MaxFax might be altered to include tariff alignment with the EU.But if that’s the case, then Britain WON’T be able to have a proper, independent trade policy.One of the Brexiteers close to the discussions warns this is the “breaking point of what people are prepared to accept”. THERESA MAY is making it clear to everyone in government that she intends to stay on as Prime Minister after Brexit day, March 30, 2019.Yesterday afternoon, Downing Street summoned the Government’s political advisers and told them to start working on measures to be included in the next Queen’s Speech, to take place in spring and after Brexit day.A Downing Street source tells me: “As you would expect, the Government is focusing on a comprehensive programme of domestic legislation for the next session of Parliament.This will include new plans for the country’s future outside the European Union.”This Queen’s Speech will be huge for Mrs May.It will be her last best chance to show her party she has a domestic agenda that justifies her staying on as Prime Minister.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

To which the EU’s Michel Barnier will inevitably reply: “No. It’s full single market membership, including free movement of migrants, or nothing.”Then what? What else has No10 got?There are red lines Theresa May must not cross: free movement, independent trade deals, our courts’ supremacy. She won’t survive conceding on any of them.We weep for Downing Street’s tactics.They seem ­terrified that the PM might have to walk out of talks. Why? If the EU continues to demand everything on its terms, she must do exactly that.They’ll call back.GOBBY Irish PM Leo Varadkar has no idea how much damage he does with every Brexit utterance.His latest salvo revealed a patronising, pompous arrogance as misplaced as it was sickening.The mighty EU won’t change its rules for little Britain, Varadkar sneered.“We’re 27 member states — the UK is one country,” he said. “We’re 500million people, the UK is 60million. That basic fact has to be understood.”The Sun has some more basic facts:Ireland’s population is 4.8million. The UK’s is 66.5million.Ireland’s economy relies on us so heavily that a “no deal” is forecast to throw 2.5 per cent of its workforce on the dole. It is far more exposed than any other EU country, or the UK.Our billions bailed out broke Ireland in 2010. Has Varadkar forgotten?Is he happy to sour relations with millions of UK customers with long memories, who may take against Irish goods?A wiser man would have acted as peacemaker, constructively helping both sides forge a historic deal in all our interests, including those of his country and its wonderful people.Instead he chose another role . . . as the snivelling suck-up egging on the playground bullies.THERESA May must seize her crucial opportunity to save Nato next month.Donald Trump is rightly berating Europe’s major powers for failing, unlike Britain, to fund their defence. But Nato is not some unfavourable trade deal he can abandon at a stroke.Mrs May hosts his UK visit on July 13, right after he’s laid the law down at the Nato summit and before he flies out to meet Vladimir Putin. She must stress that lives are at stake.

They must also achieve an outcome which allows the UK to take back full control over our laws, our borders and our money.Any wavering or compromise that keeps Britain as a cash cow for Europe, and our people and businesses subjugated to EU laws that hurt our interests, would be a spectacular own goal.Instead of pandering to those who want to keep Britain in the EU, the Single Market and Customs Union, the team at Chequers must now stand firm and not back down.Their strategy and game plan must be to stand up to the EU and stop letting their negotiating team walk all over us.So far we have been negotiating with the EU in good faith and we have conceded too much ground for little in return.We have pledged a divorce settlement totalling £40billion and while we have advanced a package to ensure that the rights of EU citizens currently in the UK are protected, the rest of the EU have made alarmingly little progress on protecting the rights of British citizens living elsewhere in the EU.Conceding further ground to the EU now will leave Britain exposed at the back and will let the greedy undemocratic EU leaders take advantage of our open goal.The country also decided to take Britain on a new path to future prosperity.Outside of the EU the world is growing at a fast pace.Expanding consumer markets present new opportunities for exciting trade and investment partnerships. Technological change and innovation happens worldwide and the EU’s place in the global economy is falling fast.Ministers must not allow Britain to slip in the world trade league by being chained in any way to Brussels as the EU sinks.Without the straitjacket of EU rules Britain will stand out as a strong place for businesses to invest.While an out-of-touch elite who want to keep Britain in the EU continue to spread fear and doom and gloom, in the real world our economy is doing well.We have some great foundations and since the referendum Britain has seen a surge in foreign direct investment to record levels which shows the high degree of confidence investors have in Britain.They see that outside of the EU Britain will be successful and everyone in the Cabinet should stop playing defensively and commit to that vision too.We are at a crucial moment in our history and Cabinet members need to understand the magnitude of the decisions   they are making.Now is not the time for grandstanding or for egos to get in the way. Ministers need to tighten ranks and play as a united team to achieve victory.The future of our country is far too important to leave to chance and if the Cabinet gets its act together this week then we will be in control of our own destiny.In years to come, people will look back at the decisions we make today and judge members of this Government on whether they have advanced the cause of freedom, prosperity and democracy with a well-executed match- winning plan . . . or left our country to the fate and uncertainty of a penalty shoot-out.Priti Patel is a Conservative MP, representing  Witham in Essex. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Way better, in fact, without wanting to sling mud, than many other commentators who — regardless of their gender — can barely string two words together.Because, of course, whether or not you are good at your job has got absolutely nothing to do with your gender, right?Until, that is, you are a woman in football, or some other realm that men consider belongs to them.Then, it turns out, it’s a problem. For some men at least.Just to be clear, the idea that football is a “guy thing” is totally outdated. More women watch football in the UK than watch EastEnders (and that’s when there isn’t a World Cup on).And that’s just watching it. I’ll get on to playing it in a minute.Still, Simon Kelner, the former editor of the Independent, wrote in a column this week that women talking about World Cup games “is like getting a netball player to discuss major league basketball”.Then former player Jason Cundy gave his five cents worth, saying that women are unsuited to commentate on football matches because “their voices are too high”.And — although I had to watch it from behind a cushion because I was cringing so much — former Manchester United defender Patrice Evra gave Eni Aluko an actual round of applause for her analysis of one match. . . because he was so surprised that women, you know, know stuff about football too.(Her face when he did so was priceless: Withering look personified.)In case you didn’t know, Eni Aluko has more than 100 caps for England as a player. She also has a first-class degree in law. She is super brainy, bright and articulate — and she knows an awful lot about football.I am full of admiration for her. She is such a strong woman. She is also more than qualified to comment on a football match.Sadly, “more than qualified” is often what women need to be to get ahead in a male world.Eni Aluko is a high-powered lawyer, a professional sportswoman who adds serious value to the commentary of any match.Patrice Evra must know her credentials. But some men, when they feel threatened by a woman, respond by patronising her. They try to put her down. Diminish her. Banish her back into her box.As a woman working in sport I am familiar with this.Lots of men who think women in football are encroaching on “their” territory do the same to me. The number of suggestions I’ve had to get back in the kitchen — and far worse — are too many to count.It doesn’t bother me. But it is tedious and annoying.Men who respond to women in this way can’t quite accept that a new generation of women are coming to the fore and using their voice.They really can’t get their heads around the changes that are happening so quickly — the emergence of women who are using their voice, taking “their” jobs.Luckily, they are a dying breed, these men who want to keep women in the Victorian ages.Plus, it is beginning to dawn on them that we aren’t going back into the box.And they’d better get used to it because it’s not just women commentating on football who are being taken more seriously. It’s women who are playing it too.I’m proud and excited to say that West Ham is one of 11 clubs with new Women’s Super League licences.This really is going to change the face of women’s football.Tier one, the Women’s Super League, starts next year and West Ham is part of that.And the Super League is going to mean a lot more money, professionalism and structure for women in football.So to anyone who is worried about female match commentators all I can say is: Hold on to your hats, boys.REBEKAH Vardy got slammed this week for speaking out about being in Russia.She said that she took the role of supporting her husband – and being there for him before a match – very seriously, saying: “I would be mortified if I was pictured leaving a bar absolutely p***ed, knowing that my husband was going to play one of the biggest games of his life the next day.”Of course, some wasted no time laying into Rebekah’s version of feminism since it included being present for her husband which – according to comments I read – undermines feminist values.I have to say I really disagree.Whoever said that you can’t be a feminist and also stand by your man?I LOVED reading about Christine Lampard, who is pregnant, saying she, “couldn’t care less” about putting on weight as long as everything’s OK inside.In an age when many pregnant women barely look like they are expecting, only to “snap back into shape” within days of giving birth, that’s such a refreshing attitude. I felt the same way and allowed myself to eat what I wanted.I know some women crave chalk and coal when they are pregnant but my craving was for Wagon Wheels.At one point I was on about 12 a day. Those were the days.JOOLS Oliver says that being a stay-at-home mum is ten times harder than Jamie’s job running a multi-million-pound cooking empire.She described her role as “brain numbing” and “hell on earth” and said no one respects her in the household. I’m sure lots of eyes will roll at that idea, but I have to say that I agree.The brief run-in I had with being a stay-at-home mum left me full of nothing but admiration and respect for those women who do it on a daily basis.And it made going back to work feel like a walk in the park.LET’S congratulate New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, for being only the second woman ever to give birth while in such senior office.Some people have questioned whether Jacinda can do the job as a new parent. Would that same question ever be asked of a man?WELL this is exciting.

Not Piers, who went on to issue a further challenge: “On Thursday night, you can watch England destroy Belgium, then watch me destroy Love Island straight after.”So I did. No further comment is needed on the first bit of Piers’ equation. But, hell on TV earth, I can’t ignore the second.A “one-off special” called Good Evening Britain which attempted to cash in on the breakfast magic and must have seemed like a great idea until England v Belgium became a loser-takes-all non-event, the wardrobe department shoved Susanna Reid into a Spanish Flamenco dancer’s outfit and someone lost control of the guest list.’Cos all of the pre-publicity for this one assured me there’d be just three present: Danny Dyer, the Labour Party leader and a slightly spooked Pamela Anderson, who set the first alarm ringing by claiming: “When they told me Jeremy Corbyn’s going to be here I thought this was going to be a serious political ­programme.”Why the hell a dissembling old fool like Corbyn would make anyone think that is a bit of a mystery, but ­serious was the last word you’d use to describe Good Evening Britain.They weren’t alone either. The joint was jumping, in fact, with David Ginola, Amir Khan, Ed Balls, Tory MP James Cleverly, Harry Redknapp, BGT comic Daliso Chaponda and live feeds from a reporter in Russia and Andi Peters at Emmerdale’s Woolpack pub.As GEB quickly demonstrated, of course, the reason chat shows don’t invite nine guests to appear is that you instantly have nine chaotic voices clamouring for attention and often talking at cross-purposes.All it then takes is one guest to throw a spanner in the works and the whole vibe collapses, as it duly did when Piers and Susanna started asking Pammie about her French footballer boyfriend, Adil Rami, who she claimed was “doing really well”.Susanna: “He’s not played yet.” I haven’t been watching, I’ve been looking after my father who’s just had a stroke.” When someone drops a bombshell like that, clearly, you need to steer the conversation away pretty sharpish which, in fairness, Piers did by asking Amir Khan: “Do you have a sex ban before fights?”Only with his wife, I’d imagine, Piers, but thanks for asking. It set the perfectly awkward tone for the entire evening. For GEB to be classed as a true TV disaster, though, it still needed three other things to happen.The first were technical glitches, which duly arrived when the satellite link to a bunch of drunk England fans went down. The second was Andi Peters referring to Emmerdale as “Coronation Street”. Check.The third and most important, however, was for one of the guests to get a bit sweary and lairy. Enter Danny Dyer who ensured GEB will enter TV folklore, when he launched into Brexit, asking: “What’s happened to that t**t David Cameron? He’s in Nice with his trotters up. He should be held to account for it . . . t**t.”The far more pertinent bit of his ­contribution, though, was the moment he addressed the host: “Just stop talking, Piers. Just talkin’ talkin’, ramblin’ on.”Breakfast TV would be a hopelessly dull, molly-coddling chore again without Piers’ ego and all his boastful predictions, which just for the record, ended with the following score, on Thursday.Good Evening Britain — 2.91million viewers. Love Island — 3.2million. Boom.Martin Keown: “When you play in midfield you’ve got to have legs.”Guy Mowbray: “We haven’t seen anything of Di Maria in Argentina’s first three games. Although he only played in two of them.”Alan Shearer: “Portugal were very much like Portugal.”And Lee Dixon: “We’ve had five balls that have gone flat. Three times that’s happened.”(Compiled by Graham Wray).WHATEVER our differences elsewhere, I hope there’s one thing on which we’re all agreed.The greatest quiz show in television history is Bullseye.An opinion confirmed when I tapped those magic eight letters into my Sky Planner’s search engine last week, and its back catalogue unfurled before me, including episode one of series one, which, for a TV critic, is like finding the source of the Nile.I don’t expect you to watch every episode, obviously, but if you have time for one, make it episode eight of series two. It’s as funny, heart-warming and brilliantly formatted as you remember. But the most remarkable thing is, hardly any of it would now be considered fit for broadcast.For not only is Jocky Wilson smoking a fag as he attempts the 301 or more challenge, Jim Bowen, can’t help drawing attention to a facial scar on a contestant’s face.“You’ve obviously had an accident, tell us how.” “I was 11 years old, it was a petrol can blew up on a building site.” “Lovely to be able to talk about that, smashing.”Broadsheet newspaper columnists, right-on comedians and other handbag-clasping s of the nation’s morals will, of course, say: “Well thank goodness we’ve moved on since then.” Which is precisely the reason none of them will ever create a show as beautiful as Bullseye or say anything remotely as funny as the bellowing climax to the prize board, on show eight.Bully’s special prize?“What every woman dreams of. A full-length Scandinavian mink coat.”RANDOM TV irritations: Jeremy Corbyn’s insanely annoying habit of giving a triumphant little sniff every time he thinks he’s made a good point.BBC presenters turning Aneurin Bevan into the L Ron Hubbard of their NHS cult. News ­reporters describing everything that’s happened quite a lot as being: “On an industrial scale.”Over-familiar BBC continuity announcers suddenly greeting me with a: “Hi, I’m Russell.” (Don’t care.) And a bite massage therapist from Hollywood called Doctor Dot failing to provide the necessary health and safety warning before she told This Morning’s Eamonn Holmes: “Ruth’s going to be biting you tonight.”’Cos she’d have bitten off more than she could chew if she did.The Chase USA, Brooke Burns: “Alphabetically, what day of the week comes first?” Andy: “Tuesday.”The Chase Australia, Andrew O’Keefe: “In which decade of the 19th Century was the Crimean War fought?”Simon: “The 1950s.”Andrew O’Keefe: “TV series Twin Peaks is set in which fictional town?”Dan: “Transylvania.”“No, Twin Peaks.” NHS cultists gathered last week to applaud, grovel, sing, dance and grin like madmen in its honour.I exaggerate a bit, obviously. The singing and dancing doesn’t begin until tomorrow night on ITV.It was still an unsettling experience though, watching BBC2’s NHS At 70: Live, from The Queen Elizabeth Hospital, in Birmingham, hosted by Anita Rani a level eight cultist from The One Show, Nick Robinson and Helen Skelton, who was in the maternity unit warning that we may “hear screaming”.As well as the massed ranks of staff, there were also NHS bigwigs and former patients who were encouraged to stand, clap and thank nurses, doctors, ambulancemen, chemists, the woman on reception, everyone.The nasty suspicion is, of course, that all this BBC worship, which makes Kim Jong-un’s birthday celebrations look really half-ar*ed, carries a political edge and is designed to shut down every single argument apart from the ones that say:A)The NHS needs more money. Or B) the NHS needs a s***load more money.As righteous as it might make them all feel, however, deep down they know it makes for wretchedly dull television.Hence the presence, on this one, of Britain’s Got Talent winner Lost Voice Guy, who not even the resuscitation unit could help with gags like: “Laughter is the best medicine.

The plans set out today demonstrate the bright future in store as we build UK fishing industry for future generations by putting the importance of a healthy marine environment at its heart.”Environment Secretary Michael Gove will publish the plan in the Fisheries White Paper today.Mr Gove added: ““We will be able to put in place our own systems, becoming a world leader in managing our resources while protecting the marine environment”.Fishermen’s groups were delighted with the blueprint.National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisation CEO Barrie Deas dubbed the plan “clear and cogent”. He added: “I am sure that it will attract wide support across the industry and Parliament.“Outside the EU, the UK will be an independent coastal state and this will provide the basis to rebalance quota shares and implement effective and adaptive management measures for our fisheries.”Non-UK vessels currently take more than 50% of British fishing stocks, in a set up they have attacked as deeply unfair for years. EU Member States currently land around eight times as much fish in UK waters than the UK does in EU Member States’ waters.Under the plan, foreign vessels will be allowed some fishing in British waters, but only in exchange for access to their nation’s. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But they do.Remarkably, one in 20 British nurseries is banning superhero costumes because they believe these colourful outfits are making our children aggressive.This attempted taming of tots doesn’t stop there though.Four in five nurseries won’t allow any weapons — whether they are plastic pirate ­cutlasses or harmless pop guns.This is totally wrong.When I was with my mates on the school yard or messing about on building sites I ­pretended to be Superman or ­a soldier, replaying what I had seen in John Wayne war films.These games teach you vital lessons that you will carry on into later life, like I did with the military.There is kinship, holding your own and negotiating with the kid who is getting a bit rowdy.I learned right and wrong, how to ­interact with others and when I was ­stepping out of line.But it didn’t make me think: “I want to join the Army and kill everyone.” ­Everyone plays those games, and some become accountants.I certainly allowed my daughter to play “fighting” and there is no evidence such activities make people more violent.When kids get out their toy swords or bows there is laughter and joy.This is about the normal competitive urge. Whether it’s sport, watching The X Factor or wishing to be top in your class, there is a desire to win.It is wrong to pretend ­otherwise, because when these kids enter the real world of work they will face a very ­competitive atmosphere.If you don’t fight to get to the top, you will go under.We can’t all be soft and cuddly. ­Societies need people with different talents and attitudes.There is a clear antipathy towards the armed services as a career in these ­nursery bans.Britain is struggling to find new recruits at the moment, and the last thing we need is children growing up believing this is a bad choice.Being a soldier, sailor or part of the RAF are valid ­professions. We need these real-life superheroes.My daughter considered ­joining the Armed Forces. She looked into the idea of a ­military scholarship when she was 18.I was all for that, but in the end she decided upon ­something else.There is an idea that these games are just for boys, but girls want to be involved as well.Warfare is part of our genetic make up.It has been like this since the time of hunter-gatherers who had to defend their food sources — first their hunting grounds then later, when we became farmers, our lands.The reason we have been so successful as a species is the ability to defend ­ourselves.Back in medieval times kids would play with wooden swords and it was once ­obligatory for all males aged over 14 to practise the longbow on Sundays.We all go “ahhh” when we see puppies or kittens tussling and rolling about with their siblings, but what they are doing is learning to defend themselves.The idea that stopping any gameplay which involves ­fighting is going to change hundreds of thousands of years of human development is ­nonsensical.The complaint that toy weapons fuel a chaotic atmosphere in our nurseries is nothing more than a sign of laziness among the employers and employees.They are taking the easy route by simply banning lively games. This is more about making life easier for the staff than it is about helping our kids. They just want the ­children sitting there passively, possibly watching television or playing on a tablet.That is not what young ­children are about.

The staff could ask why one person is always the baddie and what the kids enjoy about being the goodie.Superhero movies always contain a ­positive moral tale that children can learn from.

Everything we did was within the rules.The Vote Leave chief executive does admit that the donation was paid directly to data marketing company Aggregate IQ.But he insists Darren Grimes asked him to do that, and the marketing company only reported back on how it was spent to Mr Grimes, not to Vote Leave.Solicitor Tamsin Allen of Bindmans LLP, who represents the whistleblowers, told Sky News: \"In March this year we submitted to the Electoral Commission 3 lever arch files of evidence, and a 50 page legal opinion prepared by senior QCs at Matrix Chambers.\"This strongly suggested that criminal offences were committed by members of Vote Leave and Beleave during the Referendum campaign.

The vulnerable children face a daily risk of becoming victims of attacks between their warring parents. Overall, two million children in England are growing up in families with serious risks to their wellbeing. The Children’s Commissioner, Anne Longfield, said the most vulnerable in the country are being let down by a system that leaves them to “fend for themselves”. Her report into childhood vulnerability estimates that 2.1 million of England’s 11.8 million children - one in six - are living in families with risks so serious that they need some level of help. Some of the risks these children face include parents with mental health problems or parents who are alcoholics or have substance abuse problems.  Of the 2.1 million children, there are 890,000 with parents suffering serious mental health problems, 825,000 living in homes with domestic violence, and 100,000 children who are living in a family with a “toxic trio”, mental health problems, domestic violence and alcohol and/or substance abuse. The report widens the groups of children associated with forms of vulnerability or risk from 32 to 37 (with 70 sub-groups) after identifying new groups of vulnerable children. Ms Longfield said: “Over a million of the most vulnerable children in England cannot meet their own ambitions because they are being let down by a system that doesn’t recognise or support them, a system that too often leaves them and their families to fend for themselves until crisis point is reached.

Politicians from every party have joined forces in a dramatic drive to bring in proportional representation in a major overhaul the current electoral system. Labour, Lib Dems, Tories, Greens, Plaid Cymru and the SNP are all represented in a newly-formed parliamentary group targeting radical reform, the Daily Mirror can reveal. It aims to push for “the adoption of a system of proportional representation at all levels of governance in the UK”. The move comes amid a growing distrust in politics, with real reform needed to give voters a stronger voice, according to the new All Party Parliamentary Group for Proportional Representation. Labour MP Daniel Zeichner, chair of the cross party group and MP for Cambridge, said: “In swathes of the country, Labour voters currently go unrepresented on local councils.  It is similar In Cambridge, where Conservative voters are unrepresented on the city council. This cannot be right - we need to introduce a new way of voting in this country which will make all of our votes count, and enhance our democracy.” Lib Dem MP Wera Hobhouse, group vice-chair and MP for Bath, added: “Our current voting system disenfranchises far too many people and creates an adversarial political culture which does not allow for constructive discourse in which good decisions are made. Electoral reform is essential to create a better democracy in which we fully engage with all our citizens and allow them to participate.” It comes as a poll shows fewer than one in three voters think they make any difference to the general election outcomes. An ICM survey of 2,000 voters commissioned by campaign group Make Votes Matter to mark National Democracy Week shows most have no faith in the process. Two thirds believe the share of seats should match the share of votes. More than half want the first-past-the-post system replaced by proportional representation.

There’s lots to celebrate because we can be proud the UK is a world leader in LGBT rights. But I know that, in 2018, many LGBT people still have to deal with discrimination, hatred and even violence and I’m determined to do something about it. Last year we launched the first national LGBT survey which attracted more than 108,000 responses, making it the largest survey of its kind anywhere in the world. Some of the findings make for difficult reading. I was shocked to learn that two-thirds of people avoid holding hands in public with same-sex partners for fear of a negative reaction.  That so many people fear the consequences of this simple gesture shows that a society in which we are all treated equally and fairly is still some way off. Two in five of the people surveyed had experienced verbal harassment or physical violence simply because of their sexuality. Worse still, 90% of those people felt they couldn’t report it because “it happens all the time”.

Guests paid up to \u0026pound1,500 a head for the annual Summer Party, held on Monday at London’s exclusive Hurlingham Club and hosted by PM Theresa May. As her Cabinet teetered on the edge of implosion over Brexit, desperate ministers had to rattle the Tory donation tin. Boris Johnson, David Davis, Michael Gove, Liz Truss and Gavin Williamson were seen “working the room”, getting rich supporters to part with their cash. Scroll down to see the items up for auction  But Labour Party chairman Ian Lavery said: “Rather than swanning about at fancy dinners, ministers should be hard at work fixing the mess they are making of Brexit, the crisis they have created in our public services and the falling living standards of people across the country.” Anger among Remain-backing City donors has made this year’s fundraiser all the more crucial for Mrs May. Contributions from the party’s biggest hedge fund backers have collapsed as they fear she is “botching” Brexit. One Conservative donor reportedly said yesterday: “A group of us were at the Tory bash last night. We were all asking why we fund this sh**show.”   Speaking at the event, Mrs May pleaded with her party to “stand together”. She said: “The stakes are high - perhaps higher than we have ever known in our political lifetimes. We each have a choice to make. Will we come together and stand together as a party, as a government and as a country? “Or will we be divided, and allow the scale of the challenge, the complexity of the questions to overwhelm us?” Desperate Tories pulled out all the stops to appease disillusioned backers during the event, with guests dining on smoked trout and beef fillet. And I’m A Celebrity winner Georgia Toffolo posed for selfies with activists and ministers.    MPs and guests at the Conservatives’ Summer Party were served a starter of Oak smoked trout, semi dried tomatoes, avocado cream, shallot and lemon oil dressing. The main course was Scottish beef fillet, mini cottage pie, creamed spinach and oyster mushrooms. A ‘mix of desserts’ was served to finish the meal. The meal was accompanied by a choice of a 2015 Mas Rabell white wine, from Torres in Catalonie and a 2015 Montes Classic Series Merlot from Chile’s Colchagua Valley. Both wines retail for around \u0026pound10 a bottle.  The fundraiser was held at the Hurlingham Club, a Georgian private sports and social club set in 42 acres of grounds along the Thames in Fulham, West London. Originally a gun club which boasted King Edward VII as an early patron, it is also famous for having published the original rules of polo. The Duchess of Cambridge and her sister Pippa Middleton regularly play tennis on the club’s , and Prince Philip is the current patron. There is currently a thirty-year waiting list for membership, and new joiners must be proposed and seconded by two current full club members. And the items up for auction A ride in Jacob Rees-Mogg\u0027s Bentley  One paid thousands to be driven around Somerset by leading Brexiteer Mr Rees-Mogg in one of his vintage Bentleys. The sale’s brochure boasted the posh MP would also serve a “home-cooked meal”. Labour MP John Mann said: Rees-Mogg can only afford a Bentley through his second job. He should have it embossed with the logo ‘paid for whilst moonlighting’. My raffle prizes are being donated by retired miners, cleaners and textile workers. The price may differ, but the value is greater. Lib Dem leader Vince Cable added: I imagine the drive around his estate alone would be a long one - giving nanny plenty of time to prepare luncheon.” Dinner cooked by Michael Gove, in his kitchen  Environment Secretary Mr Gove and journalist wife Sarah Vine offered up a “fascinating evening of dinner and discourse” – including a meal prepared by them and served at their kitchen table. University Challenge with David Lidington  Mrs May’s deputy David Lidington auctioned off a chance to challenge him to a round of University Challenge. He was captain of the Sidney Sussex College team that won the 1979 series of the TV quiz. \u0027Women and the Conservative Party\u0027 with Esther McVey  Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey promised a tour of the Conservative Party archives, with particular focus on female Tories. She will also join the winner for lunch. A Museum tour with Boris Johnson  And Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson offered the chance to benefit from his “vast historic knowledge” with a guided tour for five around a Central London museum.  Among the memorabilia sold in the silent auction was a signed portrait of Margaret Thatcher and a lectern used by David Cameron. The auction brochure boasted the lectern could be used “to inspire your own speech practice at home!” Luxury holidays  Luxury holidays on offer included a private villa for 12 on the Caribbean island of Mustique, a stay in a five-bedroom converted barn designed by supermodel Kate Moss and a “cheetah experience” in Namibia.

Then she suddenly drops to the floor, grinding and thrusting as if her life depended on it. Unsure of where to look or how to react, I opt for a contemplative expression, pen in hand - relieved at least that the smoky room and flashing lights are hiding my blushes. Then, when her three minutes are done, she blows over a kiss before gliding off the catwalk - and I look down at the score-sheet in front of me.  Having to mark a woman’s bottom between 0 and 10 makes me feel like the worst kind of person. But as a judge at Brazil’s bizarre Miss Bumbum competition, this is exactly what is expected of me - and as I put pen to paper the hundreds packing the room strain to work out which score I’m awarding her. One of the strangest, yet most fiercely-fought beauty pageants on the planet, in Brazil the annual contest to find the nation’s sexiest bottom is taken deadly seriously. And with the chance to become an overnight superstar at stake, hopefuls famously go to desperate lengths to take the title - from stripping off in public to bribery and even sabotage. Some candidates have been known to sell cars and even houses to finance their campaign for public votes. And now for the first time, butt-proud women all around the globe will be able to compete for an even more illustrious crown - Miss Bumbum World. Organisers said they decided to launch an international version of the contest after being inundated by messages and photos from big-bottomed women around the world begging for a chance to take part. And emotions are expected to reach fever pitch at the star-studded event in Miami in March next year, when Brazil’s national winner will compete against representatives from other countries around the world to find out who has the best butt on the planet. As the only non-Brazilian ever to be a judge on Miss Bumbum, in November last year, I was able to get a unique insight into what the race to next year’s ultimate best bottom award might be like - as well as behind-the-scenes antics and intrigue. As a journalist working in Brazil, I’ve reported on the craziest aspects of the competition - which today makes more headlines around the world than every other beauty pageant put together.  They included one hopeful who strutted naked through a shanty town controlled by gun-wielding gangsters to canvass for votes, another who was caught paying a witch doctor to cast a voodoo spell on a rival, and others who upset the Catholic country’s Christians by recreating the Last Supper scene wearing sexy lingerie at Easter. And no Miss Bumbum season is complete without a fair share of scandals and intrigue. Previous high(low)lights include allegations that one contestant had paid organisers around \u0026pound18,000 for second place others caught using computers to cast thousands of online votes and claims some women had cheated by having butt implants - the competition’s only rule is you can\u0027t. The mix of big bums and bizarreness is a recipe for unprecedented media attention. According to organisers, there have been more than 10.3 million articles written about the contest since it first began eight years ago, as well as 48 TV documentaries, including one for the BBC due to be aired in September.  And according to Brazil’s government, only the Rio carnival generates more international news about Brazil than the annual best bottom competition, where winners often go on to become household names at home and abroad. The event is so huge that Miss Bumbum’s creator, Cacau Oliver, now has his own reality show on Brazil’s E! TV channel, called Fame Maker. But nothing could have prepared me for the pressure cooker final of Miss Bumbum in a Sao Paulo bar last November, when the last 15 hopefuls - whittled down from over 2,500 candidates - got their last chance to impress before a panel of judges. Expectation was in the air as hundreds of reporters, photographers and TV cameras packed in to the Noo Bar in the city’s famous Vila Madalena district. As a guest judge I was ushered by security guards into the VIP area, where free food was laid out and I mingled with famous Brazilian stars such as funk DJ Mr Catra and Youtuber Caue Moura. I was one of ten judges - others included TV presenters and reality show stars - invested with the power to send one of the women waiting nervously in the wings to stratospheric heights. As the clocked ticked down to the long-awaited ceremony, excited showbiz reporters rushed to quiz us about our bottom preferences in the hope of gleaming some clue as to which of the 15 finalists might be crowned Queen. But the actual judging process, for such a huge national event, was surprising less rigorous than I had imagined. Each of the judges were giving a sheet with the names of the women, in the order they would appear, first fully dressed in an outfit or costume of their choosing, and second shaking their booty wearing as little as they wanted. For each appearance we were to give a mark between 0 and 10. Most notably, though, it was all about the bumbum. Forget inner beauty, personality, or even a pretty face, we were told, the only thing that mattered was the shape, size, shake and aesthetic of the ass.  By the time the first bottom wiggled on stage, this one belonging to the candidate for Rio de Janeiro, the crowd were in a state of near frenzy. Before each candidate appeared, a video showed her wiggling her bottom on a beach, as the show’s glamorous presenter Gracyanne Barbosa announced their name, age, and ass size. Gracyanne herself, while not being a great presenter, does have a 43-inch wide backside, which appeared to matter more. While some women opted for an evening gown, others were more creative, like the representative of the state of Amazonas, Rosie Oliveira, who strutted the catwalk dressed as an Indian with a huge feather headdress, before unfurling a Brazilian flag with the words “Temer Out!”, a reference to the country’s hugely unpopular president. Some of the other judges squealed excitedly and immediately scribbled ’10’ in her box.  But it was the ‘free dance’ sequence, during which the women returned to the stage to wiggle, thrust and grind their prize asset to the beat of pounding booty music, which brought the crowd to delirium. Excited photographers climbed on top of each other to get the closest shot and each of the contestants made the most of their three minutes to convince us they should be the next Queen of the Brazilian bumbum. One contestant slowly untied her bikini top as she danced provocatively to a slow ballad, another flew onto the stage as Wonder Woman and another strutted down the catwalk dressed as a sexy angel. This time Amazonas’ Rosie was dressed as a sexy jester with harlequin bikini and feathered tickle sticks hanging from her arms. When another wearing the tiniest silver G-string suddenly got on on all fours furiously thrusting her backside to the pounding beat of her chosen funk anthem, the crowd erupted in whistles and applause.  And after each performance, the room fell quiet and all eyes were on me and my fellow judges as we discussed everything from their twerking technique, roundness of their bottom, number of thrusts per second, even the amount of cellulite - before each scribbled down their score. Meanwhile, social media was going into overdrive as Miss Bumbum fans around the country followed the evening’s events, desperately wanting to know who their next bumbum idol would be. Once all the performances were over, the women retired backstage, where many sat nervously biting their nails, or pacing up and down, knowing that one bum wriggle could have made or broken them. On the competition floor, presenters made live broadcasts with their impressions and predictions. It was past midnight when, with all votes counted, the moment finally came for Miss Bumbum found Cacau Oliver to declare the winner. First, an award was made to the candidate who was the least bitchy to the others during the competition, Miss Sympathy, who was voted for by the other women. Then, as the 15 hopefuls lined up on stage, he opened the envelopes containing the name of the runner up, and the winner. And as - unsurprisingly - Rosie Oliveira was declared Brazil’s next Miss Bumbum, there were gasps of surprise and looks of sheer hatred from the other women. The 28-year-old gasped in disbelief and wiped tears from her eyes as the news sunk in, while the remaining 15 women, barely able to hide their disgust, marched off backstage without even stopping to congratulate her. But she didn’t care - suddenly hundreds of photographers were crowded around her, yelling for her to look their way as flashbulbs popped and reporters shouted questions while scribbling in their notepads.

The Duke of Cambridge took to Twitter via Kensington Palace\u0027s official account to share his jubilation with the rest of the country. I couldn’t be prouder of @England - a victory in a penalty shootout, he wrote. You have well and truly earned your place in the final eight of the World Cup and you should know the whole country is right behind you for Saturday! Come on England! W. England football supporters were put through a spectrum of emotion as they roared their team to the narrowest of World Cup last-16 victories from more than 1,500 miles away.  The passion on the pitch in the Russian capital was replicated at fan zones across England, as substitute Eric Dier\u0027s decisive spot-kick in the penalty shootout sent the Three Lions through - and fans into raptures. Earlier, skipper Harry Kane\u0027s second-half penalty against a dogged Colombia side saw the team come within seconds of setting up a quarter-final tie with Sweden on Saturday afternoon. But a stoppage-time equaliser from Colombia\u0027s Yerry Mina put paid to England\u0027s hopes for a steady passage to the next round, and the mood back home became much more subdued.  Joe O\u0027Neill, 27, of Hastings, who was cheering on his home nation - winners of the 1966 World Cup - from a huge screen on Brighton beach, said: I thought it was all over just before Colombia scored. I was so upset, I felt quite deflated. When the screen cut out I thought this was a classic English thing to happen. But then when we won the penalties that was the best moment in the history of English football. I felt exhausted, stressed, elated. It was unbelievable.  He was one of more than 2,200 people to have piled onto Brighton beach to watch the match on the Luna Beach Cinema big screen. Fans wearing replica shirts chanted football\u0027s coming home, the refrain which has long been adopted as an unofficial national anthem for the England football team, at various points during the match, most notably after Spurs striker Kane\u0027s opener and Dier\u0027s cool decider. There were cheers and celebrations from a small number of Three Lions fans inside Lost Rivers in Elephant and Castle in south London where, just like in Moscow\u0027s Spartak Stadium, the majority of those watching were supporting Colombia.  England fans were less outnumbered in Times Square, Newcastle, where the 2,000-odd crowd was overwhelmingly and unapologetically partisan. Beer sprayed high into the blue Tyneside sky as Kane scored England\u0027s spot-kick. Fans hugged and danced when the penalty was given and the fans\u0027 zone erupted when it was tucked away. But joy turned to anxiety and gave way to despair as Colombia equalised in injury time.

Loose’s Cookshop has been owned by just two families since Jimmy Loose began trading back in 1791. But sensing difficult times ahead as high streets across the UK crumble, owner Bruce Crane reluctantly shut up his cookery-ware shop for the final time at the weekend. It is the latest in a string of independent and large retailers across the country to feel the pinch as Britain’s high streets suffer amid crippling Government business rates – while online giants get tax breaks.  The Mirror this week launched its High Street Fightback campaign and we are demanding fairness for small businesses and town centre retailers. Mr Crane, 57, said he “jumped before he was pushed”, and cited soaring business rates and the increasing popularity of internet shopping as the main reasons. He said of the business in Norwich: “It’s a landmark, an iconic business. It’s the end of an era. It was emotional. Our customers were sad to see us go but recognised why. “We’re one family working out of one shop, in one town – that model is dead.”  Mr Crane, whose grandfather Gerald Brett bought the business from the Loose family in 1933, took over the store from his uncle in 2004. He is starting a new online business in knife sharpening and repair. But he said the Government needed to stop showing favouritism towards huge, out-of-town internet firms. He said: “All of these big internet companies – surprise, surprise, they’re not in the city centres. Why? Because it’s the most expensive place to be.” "},{"url":null,"title":"gloating gangster sam walker claims","story":"NewsGloating gangster Sam Walker claims police didn\u0027t recognise him due to \u0027fake accent\u0027 after \u0027sneaking back into UK\u0027The convicted drug dealer claims he had to \u0027put on the worst accident fake accent so they didn\u0027t get on it was me\u0027\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByTom DavidsonOnline Reporter19:41, 3 JUL 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A convicted drug dealer and gangster claims he was \u0027sneaked back into the UK\u0027 and was pulled over by police - who failed to recognise him because he changed his accent and used a fake name.   Sam Walker , from Liverpool, has clocked up more than 100 crimes, and fled to Sierra Leone using private jets and a cargo ship to avoid arrest.  He says he is now back in the country after \u0027sneaking in\u0027 but a car he was travelling in was pulled over by traffic police. However Walker was able to avoid detection after one of his friends in the car claimed he was a singer and Walker himself gave police a fake name and declined to give any more details.  Walker regularly uses his Instagram page to mock the attempts of Merseyside Police to arrest him. His most recent post says: BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME. This was a close call with police. Sneaked back into UK the other day. Matrix Police swoop on us last night.

Unlucky Merseyside police better luck next time In the footage an officer asks: Are you boys known to the cops?. Both say no.  In the footage posted on social media, the police officer then jokes to the driver: Are you the getaway driver? The unknown man responds: In this?! It\u0027s not known what car the group were travelling in - or when the footage was taken. The police officer then quizzes them about their music career and when he asks Sam about his name he says it is \u0027Michael Johnson\u0027. When he\u0027s asked about his date of birth Sam says: We don\u0027t need to give our details, do we?  The officer confirms he does not and Sam says he\u0027d rather not: If we don\u0027t have to give our details we don\u0027t need to. We\u0027re passengers we don\u0027t have to. I\u0027ve got nothing to worry about mate but at the end of the day I\u0027ve seen it on the internet loads of times. The officer warns him Be careful with that mate because it\u0027s not always true what you see on the internet  After a discussion the officer then appears to say goodbye by saying: Right boys have a good night okay? Safe journey. Take it easy. In a separate video the gang in the car are gloating at getting away.   Walker has clocked up more than 100 crimes - from drug dealing to possessing fake cash. But amid the crimes and prison sentences Walker has also enjoyed courtroom success. He was cleared in 2013 of being involved in a plan to smuggle drugs and mobile phones into Doncaster prison while an inmate there - after which he unveiled a black T-shirt bearing the slogan “Not Guilty” beneath his jacket.

The 24-year-old, from Great Barr, Birmingham, has been suffering from the incurable condition for seven years. Paige’s pain began after her nerves were shattered during what was meant to be a routine kneecap alignment operation. She is now planning to spend \u0026pound9,000 for a private limb amputation op which would see her need a prosthetic leg.  She said: “It’s just the constant battle. The pain is getting worse and I\u0027ve thought about having an amputation. “It will cost \u0026pound9,000 to go private because the NHS doesn’t treat my condition.

This summer, we should be trying to leave a heaped one in the garden as often as pssible.  It sounds bizarre - and unhelpful, given that sugar attracts ants and wasps , and we tend to not want them crawling and buzzing around too much.   But there is one creature who will really thank you for it.  Whether you think they\u0027re a nuisance or love them, the fact is we rely on bees a lot. In fact, almost a third of the food we eat is pollinated by these insects who are responsible for feeding 90 percent of the world’s population.  Remove them from the ecosystem, and we have a serious problem. Unfortunately, that\u0027s what we appear to be doing, as a combination of pesticides, urbanisation and climate change are causing bee numbers to drop dramatically. If bees were to disappear from the face of the earth, humans would have just 4 years left to live, Attenborough has said in the past.  Here\u0027s where a spoonful of sugar comes in.  This time of year bees can often look like they are dying or dead, however, they’re far from it, Attenborough said according to Country Living .  Bees can become tired and they simply don’t have enough energy to return to the hive, which can often result in being swept away.

I had always planned to go to the farm to see him but never got round to it so it was amazing that he came to me.“People driving past must have thought I was mad having a donkey in my garden. It was just fantastic – I couldn’t have wished for anything more for my birthday.“We also went out for dinner and visited friends to celebrate but Donkey Bond was an extra special surprise.”Scott said he knew he had to do something special to mark the occasion.“I have been with Sandra for about two and a half years and I was stuck about what to get her for her 50th birthday,” he said.“I was really struggling because she couldn’t tell me anything she wanted and I knew I needed to do something big and a bit different.“My friend’s aunt owns the farm and when we found out there was a donkey being hand-reared in their house because his mother had disowned him, we just thought it was amazing and he was so cute.“Donkey Bond – who is named in honour of James Bond actor Sean Connery – has his own Facebook page and I thought, ‘I wonder if they would bring him to surprise Sandra?’.“We both absolutely love animals anyway and had been following all his social media posts so I knew Sandra would love it.“It was also the first time that Donkey Bond had ever come out for a birthday surprise like this and he was absolutely fantastic.”Scott added: “Sandra is still speaking about it now and I think she will be for the next 10 years.“It really is something for her to remember and I am really glad she liked it.“I also got her a voucher to go up to the farm and walk the alpacas which will be fabulous.“It is even better because I wanted to do it as well so I will able to go along with her.”Nicky said: “Sandra’s reaction when she opened the door was amazing – absolutely brilliant.“Scott got in contact with me because he wanted to do something different for her birthday and he knew my aunt owns Balnuith Farm.“He is a very cute donkey – he lives in the farmhouse kitchen and is toilet-trained like a dog.“There is no chance that Sandra will forget her 50th.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b39ef603b912.jpg ","title":"dundee is football crazy i want to earn my shirt says new united keeper siegrist","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe mix of ambition and expectation is why Benjamin Siegrist jumped at the chance to up sticks and join Dundee United.The giant Swiss keeper wanted to quit Swiss football for a new challenge and believes the Tangerines tick all the boxes.“Obviously the expectations here are high, but I believe it is good to be part of something when expectations are high,” said the 26-year-old, who was an U/17 World Cup winner with Switzerland.“The gaffer is very ambitious and very focused on details as well. I like that about him.“When I knew I was moving, these things were very important to me and that’s why I came here.“The tradition of the club I know and I’ve heard good things about it as well. It should be in the top division and I want to be part of helping the team to go up.”Siegrist confirmed a chat with his team-mate at last club Vaduz, Thomas Konrad, was a big help in him making up his mind to move to Scotland.Where he does disagree with the former Dundee defender is which is the No 1 outfit in his new home city.“I’ve played alongside Thomas for the last two years, so when I did make contact here I called him and asked him about the city.“It’s always good to get some information. He has told me some nice things about the city and he was very complementary about the place.“He tried to tell me the other team was the big one, so I didn’t listen. Obviously he played for them, but it’s all good.“He told me about some derbies but I believe he got sent off in one and did well in others. That’s him.“He did tell me that everyone is football crazy here and, when I arrived in the city myself, I couldn’t believe the stadiums are literally across the road from each other.“It’s good to be in a city where football is really a big thing.”With Slovakian goalie Matej Rakovan also signing up, Siegrist’s first challenge is to claim the No 1 jersey.It’s something he’s up for and believes having two keepers battling for a place in the team will prove a good thing for both men.“You come into a new club and you have to prove yourself. You’ve got to do all you can to earn the shirt. We’ve got to make it as hard as possible for the gaffer to pick one of us.“It’s his decision at the end of the day but I will be putting everything I can into making sure I play.“Everywhere you go you have to have competition. Especially the goalie position, there is only one who can play and, in every time you go, that’s how it is.“It is good to be on your toes, it’s good to have someone pushing you either way, so it makes you train that little bit harder.“It’s a long, tough pre-season and obviously my ambition is to be the No 1 goalkeeper and that’s Matej’s ambition as well. That’s how it should be.”Whether he’s between the sticks or on the bench, his focus is already on what every United fan wants to see – the team getting promotion in the coming season.And after a week working with the new-look squad, he’s feeling optimistic about that.“The main focus of the club is promotion. The first few meetings I had with the gaffer, it’s all about getting promotion.“It’s a hard task, obviously it’s a hard league to get out of, but it’s good to be part of an ambitious club that wants to achieve something.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee lift firm acquires competitor","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee’s Caltech Lifts has announced the acquisition of Coupar Angus-based competitor Scotlifts Scotland for an undisclosed sum.The cash deal means the Dundee firm will maintain more than 1,000 lifts across the UK.Caltech was founded in 1978 by engineer Howard Renwick and is now run by his sons Andrew and Fraser.Scotlifts Scotland owner Scott Murray will join the management team as Caltech’s new installations manager.Scotlifts’ 50 contract clients, employee and company assets will also transfer to the Dundee firm.Caltech managing director Andrew Renwick said: “Over 15 years Scott has built Scotlifts Scotland into a highly-regarded company.”Based at Stannergate Road, Caltech Limited’s clients include the public and private sectors and cover local government, health, construction, oil/energy, renewables and property.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/AB8U9280.jpg-582x564.jpg ","title":"dundee new boy nathan ralph happy to complete switch but wanted his move sooner","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee new boy Nathan Ralph has revealed if he’d had his way he’d have been at Dens Park at the turn of the year.Back in the January window, the Tele reported the Dark Blues were keen on the left-back after being impressed by his performances at National League South outfit Woking.So, too, were several English league outfits but when he heard there could be a chance to head for the Scottish Premiership, the 25-year-old wanted to jump at it immediately.Rather than take the huff when it didn’t materialise, the former Ipswich Town kid, resolved it would happen this summer.“The thing happened in January when Dundee were interested and I said to my manager at the time, look I want to play higher,” he explained.“I don’t think at the time they were keen on me going, so I just thought if I can get a good season under my belt, hopefully, it will still be there at the end of the season. Thankfully, it was and I’m here now.”Over the past week he’s been getting to know his new team-mates in pre-season training.He’s liked what he’s seen of them and is loving the workouts under his new boss Neil McCann.“I’m enjoying it a lot. The training has been very good. Sometimes you feel you are just running and running during pre-season but, to be fair to the manager, he’s had us doing ball work straight away.“With running as well, of course, but it’s been with the ball and match specific stuff so I am really enjoying it.“You can get that hard work when you have the ball as well and it is important because, at the end of the day, we are footballers.“We need to control the ball and things when we are tired in games, so, to me, it makes perfect sense to be training this way.“And I’ve only been here a few days now but already I’ve been impressed with the players. Technically, and in terms of the morale of the squad, they are very good.”While he wouldn’t claim to be an expert on the Scottish Premiership yet, what he’s already realised is that it’s a good place to be right now.With top English Premier League boss Brendan Rodgers already at Celtic and Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard taking the reins at Rangers, he knows it’s a league that’s being noticed.“I don’t know too much about the Premiership up here yet but what I do know is that it’s a good standard and it’s something I’ve been really looking forward to being a part of.“I’m stepping up and it will be a challenge, for sure, but I don’t think I will be out of my depth and I am looking forward to playing in it.“I’ve been told it’s definitely a good time to be coming to this league. There are a lot of good players and a lot of attention with what’s happened at Rangers.“Even without that it is still a good standard and a top league and this has all the makings of a good season for me.”Fans will got their first chance of a first look at Ralph last night when Dundee’s friendly programme kicked off with the short trip up to Brechin.Having finished playing at Woking back in April, he can’t wait to get back to a game situation.“I’m very keen to get started with the games and I’m looking forward to them, that’s what I came here for.“The Betfred Cup is coming soon but I feel with the fitness work we’ve been doing and, with the friendly games coming, we will be ready for them.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people job opportunities","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA local manufacturer has several positions available.Due to the steadily increasing demand for its products, the firm is looking to recruit city and guilds qualified bench joiners and wood machinists/CNC operators.Applicants who can demonstrate relevant experience of working in a joinery workshop environment may also be considered.The firm is also also seeking to appoint an experienced project coordinator to take responsibility for the preparation of the documentation necessary to enable manufacture to take place.

They are Lewis Toshney, William Edjenguele, Stewart Murdoch, Fraser Fyvie, Deniz Mehmet, Billy King, Paul McMullan, Tam Scobbie, James Keatings and Sam Stanton. How many of them play a meaningful role in the push for promotion this coming season, however, is certainly up for debate.In the past two campaigns under McKinnon and Laszlo, United haven’t been a million miles away from getting themselves up through the play-offs.Add in a bit of continuity through their playing squad and around it surely can only help the club get back to where they feel they belong.A list of those 86 transfers, who have arrived, departed or done both: Harry Souttar, Darko Bodul, Eiji Kawashima, Chris Erskine, Michal Szromnik, Callum Morris, John Rankin, Paul Paton, Florent Sinama-Pongolle, Henri Anier, Edward Ofere, Guy Demel, Ryan Dow, Gavin Gunning, Toshney, Frank van der Struijk, Nick van der Velden, Willo Flood, Cammy Bell, Edjenguele, Murdoch, Tope Obadeyi, Alex Nicholls, Tony Andreu, Thomas Mikkelsen, Cammy Smith, Wato Kuate, Paul Dixon, Coll Donaldson, Simon Murray, Sean Dillon, Charlie Telfer, Luis Zwick, Blair Spittal, Brad Smith, Ali Coote, Grant Gillespie, Fyvie, Emil Lyng, Patrick N’Koyi, Paul Quinn, King, Scobbie, McMullan, Keatings, Craig Slater, Scott McDonald, Jordie Briels, Harry Lewis, Stanton, Brandon Mason, Anthony Ralston, Bilel Mohsni, Clark, Booth, Wardrop, Aird, Curran, Frans, Siegrist, Rakovan and Rabitsch.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b39ef8cb8f78-848x564.jpg ","title":"locals slam a complete lack of planning as asbestos sees community centre demolition costs soar","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe price of demolishing the Damacre Centre in Brechin has rocketed after more asbestos was found in the building.The centre closed in early 2016 following the opening of the £26 million community campus, despite a petition from 20 groups to keep it open.Work started on clearing the site at the start of March and was due to be completed by the end of July.Councillors were told last month the cost was £172,293.However, Angus Council said “additional asbestos” has been found resulting in extra costs of £82,000 and bringing the total cost to more than £250,000.The schedule for the work has also slipped and it is now due to be completed in late August or early September.Andy Wilson, a member of the Damacre Centre residents’ committee, said: “This is the latest stage of what’s been a shoddy process all the way.“Damacre was built in the 1800s so there’s no surprise there’s a lot of asbestos in the building.”Fellow committee member Jill Scott also hit out saying: “This shows a complete lack of planning, all of which costs the taxpayer money.“I’m at a loss to see how this additional asbestos was not known about and wonder if demolition would have been agreed if the true costs were known.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b39f01324c04-e1530527591774-817x564.jpg ","title":"new boy elton looks to rocket dundee up the premiership table and says the skys the limit","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNew boy Elton Ngwatala insists the sky’s the limit for Dundee as they look to make an assault on the Premiership top-half next season.The French midfielder, signed from Kidderminster Harriers earlier in the summer, made his second appearance in dark blue in last night\u0026#8217s 1-0 win at Cowdenbeath.This followed his debut on Friday night in a 1-1 friendly draw with Brechin City at Glebe Park.Fellow summer arrival, Senegalese striker Jean Alassane Mendy, got the visitors’ only goal just before the hour-mark as Kharl Madianga, Jack Hamilton, Nathan Ralph and trialist Brian Nana-Sinkam also got their first run-outs for Dundee.And 25-year-old Ngwatala believes there is no stopping him and his new team-mates from scaling the heights in the top flight next term – with a top-six finish a known aim of manager Neil McCann.“Friday night was my first game and it felt good to play with the new lads,” he said.“They are all new team-mates for me but, with 45 minutes in the tank, now I can improve.“Hopefully, within the next couple of weeks it will be perfect.“I think there is no limit next season.

changes to a funding formula which he claims leaves busy urban routes at a serious disadvantage.Milton Crescent in Hilton is to be completely resurfaced at a cost of \u0026pound100,000 and the work is due to start on Monday.Other roads across the city \u0026ndash including Midmills Road in the Crown area and Caledonian Road and Montague Row in Dalneigh are also set to have their potholes filled in.But Ness-side councillor Ron MacWilliam has called for a rethink on the way damaged roads are prioritised.At present, funds are allocated according to a formula which gives more weighting to length of road than traffic volumes.As a result, Mr MacWilliam said roads in Inverness were having less money spent on them than rural roads in the far north of Sutherland. He also said more needed to be done if city drivers were going to notice any significant difference.\"The fact the council is now looking to repair roads within the city is a start, but there are a lot of routes \u0026ndash particularly in areas such as Hilton and Lochardil \u0026ndash which are still very bad,\" he told the Courier.\"The roads budget is woefully inadequate. The roads office has a fantastic team but they are fighting a losing battle.\"With regards to the funding formula, Mr MacWilliam said he was continuing to press the matter but he faced strong opposition from the much larger number of Highland councillors who represent rural wards.However, residents in Milton Crescent are just happy that work there is finally going ahead.Edward Dyce (76) relies on his vehicle to get around and said: \"I have had a lot of problems with my car because of the road surface. It\u0027 getting worse because of the amount of traffic.\"A lot of people use the road and the potholes have become a real problem.

struggling with loneliness","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA children\u0026#8217s charity has said its Aberdeen counsellors have handled more than 200 calls from youngsters who feel isolated.The NSPCC’s Childline in Aberdeen has carried out 202 counselling sessions with children experiencing feelings of loneliness – and the number is up from 164 the previous year.The organisation has stated that mental health issues, bullying and social media are all contributing factors in a growing number of young people struggling with feelings of isolation.The latest figures reveal the NSPCC-supported service delivered 4,636 counselling sessions to UK children for loneliness in 2017-18 – a 14% rise on the previous year.Teenagers accounted for the majority, but the youngest person was aged just 10.Leanne Ferries, Aberdeen Childline service manager, said: “These Childline figures show that although we might not think of loneliness as something that affects young people, children are increasingly seeking support from our counsellors about feeling alone and isolated.”Figures also showed almost 80% of calls were from girls, who said the use of social media and comparing themselves to others online made them feel “increasingly isolated”.The news comes after the NSPCC’s Are You There campaign called on the UK Government to fund Childline so it can help more children and teenagers struggling with mental health issues.Childline founder Dame Esther Rantzen said: “Loneliness needs to be taken seriously because it is potentially damaging to children’s physical and mental health.“The crucial question is what is causing this rise among the young?“Are we all too busy to make space and time for our children?“Is it that we have lost the habit of eating together?“Or is it the illusion created by social networks that everyone else is liked, popular and enjoying a far more exciting life, so they feel lonelier than ever?“Whatever the reason it’s crucial that young people know they can always contact Childline to speak to someone who will listen and care about them.”For more information on how to volunteer visit bit.ly/2rfkGJc\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"decision on community speed watch bid on

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a poignant prizegiving for tarbert afc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/06/18, 6:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert AFC’s annual football dance was held on Saturday June 16 in the Islay Frigate Hotel.Players and their partners were joined by the wider circle of people who are involved with the club.This annual dinner dance is also the end of season awards presentation.Nikki MacDougall took home awards for Top Goal Scorer and Referees\u0026#8217 Player of the Year.

This is the same distance Mark averaged every day during his epic cycle round the world in 80 days last year.In other words the team of 80 intrepid cyclists will pedal the equivalent of Mark’s incredible feat – taking them around the world in a day.Participants are asked to raise a minimum of £240 each for the STV Children’s Appeal, which supports children and young people affected by poverty in Scotland, with the hope of raising as much as £80,000 for the charity.Mark said: \u0026#8216This stunning route from Argyll to Aberdeen was my last 16-hour training ride before I set out on the world challenge and it holds fond memories \u0026#8211 but it is very long and very hilly, so I’ll be impressed by everyone who signs up for this epic day of endurance.\u0026#8216The STV Children’s Appeal has gone from strength from strength, supporting so many brilliant charities and causes across Scotland. The last time I crossed Scotland for the appeal I was swimming and running, so cycling has to be easier… right?\u0026#8217He added: \u0026#8216Thanks to everyone who gets involved and I look forward to riding with you.\u0026#8217Mari Slavin of the STV Children’s Appeal said: \u0026#8216Mark is a fantastic ambassador for the Appeal and we are all in awe of the gigantic challenge he’s about to take on, together with cyclists from across the country.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

Sheryl is a Lochgilphead woman \u0026#8211 middle-aged, celibate without choice and with plummeting self-confidence and a loathing for her body shape. Belly dancing appears to let Sheryl, and Kerrie, rediscover a love of their own body.\u0026#8216You’re using parts of your body, probably out of commission for a while, like the pelvis and it makes a part of the body, you’re maybe not keen on, sexy.\u0026#8217The female characters in the book get up to what loud ladies in a small town would enjoy gossip and drama.\u0026#8216There is an element of bitchiness about it, which I exaggerated in the book. Or maybe it was just me that was bitching.\u0026#8217But two books later in the series, Kerrie is changing direction. Her new book, Rebel Without A Clue, is a sci-fi dystopian novel about a male alien from a female-dominated planet landing in Glasgow.\u0026#8216There’s actually not a lot of sex in my books,\u0026#8217 says Kerrie. \u0026#8216Except maybe nobody having any.\u0026#8217The story starts out as a reversal of The Handmaid’s Tale, with women of this planet no longer needing men to reproduce and evolves, through a plot described as \u0026#8216mad\u0026#8217, into an outsiders perspective of Glasgow.\u0026#8216The male alien Legless goes down to earth and goes around fertilising all these women, and doesn’t understand this world where he’s in charge.\u0026#8216Most of the time I was the only woman living in a culture different from my own. I began to see stories in outsiders.\u0026#8217Being an Australian in Scotland \u0026#8211 and on top of that marrying into a Bangladeshi family \u0026#8211 would give that outlook, of everything being familiar but just off a little. The language is the same, with the accents different. The rural community is the same, only with less terrifying monsters to deal with in Argyll. This is the outlook Legless finds himself in as a dominated man in a world of dominant men.Such an off-the-wall plot with no clear message makes the book an ink blot test \u0026#8211 you take what you’re looking for from it. Maybe you even see something else with another look.Kerrie explained: \u0026#8216Originally I wanted it to be all humour. I suppose I’m driven about power and control and it’s really fascinating when you start to think about it because people dominate in quite small ways.\u0026#8217So maybe the point was to gain the women’s perspective for men to relate to?Kerrie is currently working on her fifth book, the sequel to her dystopian sci-fi named Rebel Without A Bra, and she will keep belly dancing around Lochgilphead.\u0026#8216At the beginning you just write, and you just open up your mind and stuff comes out and you’ll find that all this stuff comes out that you didn’t realise you were thinking about.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"its gonna be a close shave gavin","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 29/06/18, 7:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowIt\u0026#8217s been eight months in the making, but it\u0026#8217s getting hairy now.The razors, however, will soon sort that out for Gavin Allan.He has been growing his flowing locks and bushy beard since October last year, but Gavin will be shorn for charity on Saturday June 30.Gavin\u0026#8217s head and beard shave is being carried out in aid of Motor Neurone Disease (MND) research and the Doddie Weir Foundation.Former Scottish rugby international lock forward Doddie Weir revealed in June 2017 he was suffering from MND, a degenerative condition affecting the nerves in the brain and spinal cord that tell your muscles what to do.

The star of the show for Brian and Janet, however, was a home-bred ewe which took first prize in her class and was reserve female champion.Campbeltown\u0026#8217s John MacLachlan was there showing Blue Faced Leicester sheep for J\u0026ampM Turner, Killdalloig with the help of Gavin Semple and Scott Thomason.He came home with a first place and reserve male champion rosette for his tup lamb, sired by Mossvale Masterplan (AI) from a mother out of a Hazelwood ewe.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s the first time out for this lamb, said John, and this is the first time I\u0026#8217ve won with a male at the Highland Show, it\u0026#8217s normally females we do well with.\u0026#8217Kildalloig also secured sixth places for their tup and ewe lamb and fourth for a shearling tup.In the coloured Bluefaced Leicester ring, Lochgoilhead\u0026#8217s Andrew Campbell came second with a tup lamb and sixth with his ewe.

This year Queenie Strickland\u0026#8217s Cladich fold from the banks of Loch Awe \u0026#8211 brought out by farm manager Stuart Campbell \u0026#8211  took home a second prize with one-year-old heifer Princess Mairi 4th of Cladich. There was also a third for Capleadh Buidhe Beg 4th of Cladich in the four-year-old cow section and a fourth for one-year-old bull Monadh Mor of Cladich.A native of Kilfinan, Catherine McKechnie farms with husband Jim at France Farm, Gartocharn. Their three-year-old heifer Kirsty 2 of Gartocharn, by Brogach 1 of Balmoral and out of Kirsty Morag of Ubhaidh, won her class and also secured the reserve overall female title. The McKechnies also took home a second for a home-bred cow and her February-born calf.Catherine said afterwards: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s satisfying when you come to the show with two beasts and they go home with red and blue tickets \u0026#8211 and a reserve female champion \u0026#8211 so we can\u0026#8217t ask for much more.\u0026#8217The majestic heavy horse classes are a sight to behold, and there was a prize for a Clydesdale which has won both Kintyre and Mid Argyll shows in recent years.

Collapsing ceilings and water leakage have led to a further deterioration in the fabric of the Victorian pile.  Now it is understood South Ayrshire Council bosses want to step in before it is too late. It is believed a last minute paper may go before councillors at full council in County Buildings on Thursday. The paper would ask politicians to approve the repair work. The council slapped a Dangerous Building Notice on the hotel in March, which gave the owners 21 days to respond. There are fears Ayr train station could end up shut if no action is taken. And it has been slammed a risk to the public. The Post revealed earlier this month how the hotel has been bought by new Malaysian owners from Eng Huat Ung.  Station Hotel Action Group founder Esther Clark believes the hotel could be turned into a community centre and accomodation. She said it should be “split up and dispersed” but must generate an income. She has uncovered research, which reveals the hotel was built to a “high standard” with luxurious materials. One idea mooted by Ayr Renaissance is for a part of the building to be demolished and a new train station built. Others folk have called for the council to adopt the landmark for offices. It was hoped a big hotel group would step in and carry out refurbishment but it has failed to attract interest so far. Network Rail carried out scaffolding work on the building to safeguard the operation of the station and line in 2015. The hotel, a Grade 2 listed building, has remained shut since it closed suddenly in 2013. Glasgow and South-Western Railway Company built the hotel, designed in the style of a French chateau, at a cost of \u0026pound50,000.

And one glance around a packed Troon Town Hall said everything about the young woman Vanessa Riddle had become. Her impact was deep, her reach was far. “Vanessa would wonder why everyone was here for her,” said dad Chris. “That’s just the kind of person she was.” Friends, family, school pals and members of the community all touched by Vanessa’s courage joined for the special service.  Her battle with neuroblastoma had been one that ensured she will never be forgotten by all lucky enough to know her. Speaking to more than 400 people at her memorial service, Chris said: “She lit up our world. “And in her short life, she packed in so much happiness. “Vanessa was a thrillseeker with a soft side – great with old and young alike. “She had the Midas touch.” And he added: “No words can describe how utterly proud we are to have been your father, mother and sister.  “This is not the end for you, you have now moved on to something new.” The emotional speech came as the Town Hall paid tribute to Vanessa, of Loans, who lost her brave battle just days short of her 18th birthday. Some of Vanessa’s closest childhood friends took their feet to recount memories of happy times of the girl with a smile for everyone. And Vanessa’s infamous parking skills and ability to make everyone laugh were just two of the themes to strike a chord. Graham Hobson, deputy head at Marr College, was another to speak warmly of an immensely popular pupil. Chris said afterwards: “I thought the speeches were great, especially Vanessa’s friends, who at only 18 spoke so eloquently and passionately about Vanessa - they belied their age doing this.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12713526.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_070618ecrepont_10JPG.jpg","title":"talented youngster finn ecrepont walking","story":"NewsTalented youngster Finn Ecrepont is walking on AyrDubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:00, 18 JUN 2018NewsAyr United\u0027s Finn Ecrepont (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMost success stories in football start with a rejection somewhere along the line. And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton. He said: “Unfortunately we lost the game 1-0 from a penalty, but I played the full game and it was a great experience and the boys played really well.  “There was quite a few Ayr United fans there so they gave us a great support.” But Ecrepont refuses to forget where he came from, he is sure to consistently help his dad Eddy in Cafe Ginger. Ecrepont said: “I signed for Ayr on the Tuesday, I was washing dishes for my dad on the Friday and on the Monday I was training with Scotland. “I work with my dad at the cafe which has been key to keeping me grounded. I know for a fact he wouldn’t let me get big-headed so I couldn’t thank him enough for that. “I’ve been asked before where I see myself in five years, but the honest answer is I don’t know. “For all I know I could get injured tomorrow and break my leg. “I have been told many times that I haven’t made it, and I know that. “My hard work starts now, so I just need to take everything as it comes and take each day on its own.” "},{"url":null,"title":"little-stars-shine-bright-at-the-eastgate","story":"A TOTAL of 50 \u0027Little Stars\u0027 took to the stage recently for their annual showcase.\nAged between two and five years old the youngsters are pupils of the Peebles-based Fiona Henderson School of Dance (FHSD).\nAnd after weeks of rehearsals, the children impressed a sell-out audience at the Eastgate with their skills \u0026ndash a venue usually reserved from senior dancers.\nDuring the performance they performed a range of routines, including Highland, modern and ballet before all ending up on stage for the traditional free-style finale, where they took their applause from a very appreciative and proud crowd of mums and dads, aunts and uncles and other family members who came along to watch them for their big day.\nAfter the curtain came down the youngsters then collected their certificates for completing their classes for the year or graduating up in the next class in the FHSD dance school.\nFiona Henderson, principal of the FHSD told us: \"We are so incredibly proud of our Little Stars and how well they performed.\n\"They had been practising their routines for many weeks and this certainly showed when the curtains opened, the lights came up and they performed so wonderfully for their audience.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"nostalgia-formation-of-peebles-first-gas-company","story":"THIS week, Ronald Ireland brings us the history of Peebles\u0027 Gas Works...\nThe use of coal gas was pioneered by a Scottish Engineer called William Murdoch, who was born in Old Cumnock in Ayrshire in 1754.\nHe moved to Cornwall in 1779 and experimented with the use of coal gas as a source of energy for lighting his own house.\nBy the early part of the nineteenth century, his technology had been developed to the stage where it could be used for street lighting, first in London in 1807 and then in Edinburgh in 1819.\nOn January 9, 1829 a meeting of the burgesses was held which agreed to form a company called the Peebles Gas Company. Before that, in December 1828, Peebles Town Council had agreed that if a gas company was set up, it would be allowed to open up and lay pipes in the streets and if that proved successful, it would then have the street lamps lit by gas.\nInitially a site for a gasworks on the Old Town Green (now Greenside) was chosen, but it proved to be unsuitable. A site was found on the area of ground lying to the west of the Parish Church. Today the site is still visible and forms part of the parkland and walkways close to the modern swimming pool.\nOne of the factors which made the development of a gasworks feasible was the great improvement in major roads serving the town following the Turnpike Acts. That allowed coking coal to be brought to the town from the coalfields of Lanarkshire and Midlothian.\nTo begin with gas was produced for only ten months of the year and the street lights were lit for only about a third of the year, during the darkest winter months.\nBy the end of the 19th century, the demand for gas had greatly increased and as well as street lighting, was beginning to be used for household appliances such as gas cookers. In 1898 the assets of the Peebles Gas Company were acquired by the Town Council. Within a few years demand was outstripping supply and in 1905 it was decided to build a new gas works at Eshiels as the existing site, which also served as the council yard, was too restricted to allow for expansion. By then the existence of railways made it possible to import coal directly to the Eshiels site.\nIn 1948 the Town Council starting converting all street lighting to electricity. The gas works at Eshiels became part of the national system and continued in operation until the advent of North Sea gas in the late 1960s.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"were-so-proud-of-him-parents-of-galashiels-scout-with-adhd-hope-to-inspire-others-to-join-group","story":"THE parents of a Galashiels Scout with ADHD hope others will be inspired after the youngster won a prestigious award.\nAfter weeks of working hard to complete an array of challenges and tasks, Blair Valentine took home the Reiver Award at the Gala Scout Group annual general meeting last month.\nThe 10-year-old, who attends St Peter\u0026rsquos Primary School in Galashiels, received the award in recognition of his hard work after being nominated by numerous members of the Scouts.\nProud parents Dave and Mandy now hope their son\u0026rsquos success story will inspire other parents of children with ADHD.\nThe youngster was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in July 2013 at the age of six.\nBlair\u0026rsquos mum Mandy told the Border : \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore so proud of him, Blair has worked very hard to get where he is, and we want others to know that just because a child has ADHD, it shouldn\u0026rsquot hold them back from going on to do great things.\n\u0026ldquoBlair gets especially inspired when hearing that celebrities have the same condition as him.\n\u0026ldquoUntil we looked into it, we had no idea just how many well-known people were also affected by it.

SS took his portion of fish after his family were fed and satisfied.\nLater that same day, SS returned with more fish and he was certainly making up for lost time.\nHe began to feed the youngsters himself while Mrs O was preening. The chicks were visibly stronger and more energised than the day before when they were hungry.\nAfter the first chick was full it lay down on its side while the other chick fed and when it had had enough to eat, chick number one would get up and come back over for seconds.\nThe week progressed into warm weather and scorching sunshine and the chicks ranged from being sleepy and still, to being far too adventurous, toddling about the nest using their budding wings as little stilts to enable them to clamber around.\nThese little excursions led them to venture too far to the edges and the parent birds used distraction with fish to bring them away and back into the middle.\nThey also began to pay more attention to the nest construction, by moving sticks around and building up the edges, like little safety barriers to prevent any toppling over the edge.\nSadly, for one osprey family in the Borders, two chicks did fall to their death from the nest during the recent high winds.\nBut the attentive Mrs O and SS seem to have metaphorically red taped the danger zone by building stick walls just high enough to prevent any earnest climbing from a curious young osprey wanting to peer over the side.\nvar panels = panels || []var panel = {    name: \u0027RelatedArticles\u0027,    target: \u0027related-articles\u0027,    params: {ns: \u0027redesign\u0027, \u0027article_ids\u0027: \u002716330450,16330121,16330013,16329951,16329068\u0027, \u0027more_articles_heading\u0027: \u0027More articles\u0027}}panels.push(panel)\nBy now, the young ospreys have grown stronger and the fluffy down is spotted with the onset of growing feathers.\nThey no longer look feeble and weak and their fortunes have rapidly turned around since the fish supply has picked up.\nWe finally have news of PX1 (Paxman\u0027s bird) whose satellite tracker alerted us to the fact that he had died in the north of Scotland near to the Helmsdale River.\nThe carcass and tag have been recovered and it seems that his neck was broken, we believe, from colliding into newly erected deer fencing along the side of a forestry plantation.\nIt is such a terrible shame to lose this wonderful, healthy, two-year-old male osprey.\nJeremy Paxman was very saddened to hear of the loss of this bird and we are very grateful to him for his interest and support for the Tweed Valley Osprey Project.\nHe has agreed that his involvement will continue in the future, through the tracking of further ospreys.\nThe volunteers for the osprey project were invited to attend the ringing of goshawk chicks this week in Tweed Valley Forest Park and they were privileged to witness them being fitted with red darvic rings with white letters of JP and PL, by Tony Lightley, after Eve Schulte climbed the fir tree to lower them to the forest floor.\nRhona Anderson took some great photos of these magnificent birds and she has also been filming pine martens in the forest.\nThe captured footage of the whole pine marten family together and the antics of the three little kits with their mum and dad can be viewed in the video above or at \nhttps://www.flickr/photos/borderslass/28099626057/in/photostream/\nRead the latest Tweed Valley Osprey News every week throughout the summer in the Border  and Peeblesshire News newspapers\n"},{"url":null,"title":"500-mile-cycle-across-scotland-raises-20k-for-charity","story":"AN INNERLEITHEN man has cycled 516 miles in five days \u0026ndash raising \u0026pound21,000 for charity.\nMountain biker Kevin Marshall recently completed the mammoth challenge around the north Scottish coastline \u0026ndash all in aid of a cause close to his heart.\nThe idea to take on the challenge originated during a mountain biking trip to Glencoe last August, when Kevin, and his friend Steve, both agreed they wanted to do something to support the charities Macmillan and Friends of Anchor, who helped Steve\u0026rsquos mum and dad, and Kevin\u0026rsquos mum, before they passed away.\nKevin said: \u0026ldquoWe agreed that the North Coast 500 (NC500) was a suitably tough challenge, both to raise awareness and hopefully raise a reasonable amount of cash.\n\u0026ldquoThe team that completed the ride with me are all very close friends, the majority of us met when we were 18 when we started university in Aberdeen and have been close friends ever since.

closed, listening to the soothing sounds of tranquil music, gently guided by their teacher as they breathe deeply, exhaling all worries away and their minds drift off\u0026hellip\nNow, I know you must be wondering, what on earth are they teaching at Peebles High School? What about prelims, exams, studying, grades?\nBut what do all these pressures bring to the fragile mind of a young person, and how do they process the stress to ensure their mental wellbeing?\nIn steps Suzi Gibson, who has been running mindful meditation sessions with Peebles High pupils as part of Health Week for the past five years.\nAnd so a group of pupils dropped their pencils, calculators and chemistry tools and walked through the doors of a more unique classroom setting, kicking off their school shoes and leaving their cares behind them as the lay in the comfort of Space 108 in Peebles.\nCan mindfulness meditation really help pupils concentrate amid the distractions of 21st century living?\nI decided to experience for myself the sessions offered freely to the pupils by Suzi, who guided sessions at the high school before opening her studio at Greenside, Peebles, in January 2016.\nAdmittedly I had always been a bit sceptical about meditation. I mean seriously, how can sitting on a floor in the lotus position, inhaling the pleasant oil aroma while the ambient sounds of dolphins singing and ocean waves crash, bring me peace of mind?\nI\u0026rsquom a wife, mother, writer, and like most people, my life is busy and my head is bursting with thoughts from which there\u0026rsquos no escape.\nBut I entered the beautiful airy studio with an open-mind and intrigued about the experiences of the pupils.\nOn this particular afternoon, I feel like I\u0026rsquove got the weight of the world on my shoulders. Thoughts are racing through my head like a train out of control. But immediately I feel a sense of calmness speaking to Suzi, as she explains the techniques she is using and gently guides me through the smooth ride to a quiet mind\u0026hellipand I am, going, going, gone\u0026hellip\nI am in a state of deep peace and the mind is calm, so much so, when I hear Suzi\u0026rsquos soft instruction to open my eyes \u0026ndash I don\u0026rsquot want to. I love it here.\nSo now I can see why meditation could potentially tackle a myriad of problems suffered by young students, including mental health. This is a growing problem in the Scottish Borders, with evidence suggesting almost 2,000 children and young people in the region will experience mental ill health at some point in their lives.\nThe sessions are offered to groups of pupils from S1 to S3, who arrive at the studio giggling with excitement and anticipation for their new experience.\nSuzi explained: \"There are some nerves and awareness of peers, especially if there is a mix of ages. The great thing is, once they close their eyes, it becomes completely about their own experience. Fidgeting and chatting stops, there is a sense of calm, and some sleep which is great because they perhaps need it.\"\nEach group is given an insight into the benefits of meditation, as well as exploring how stress becomes unhealthy, warning signs, and how to build resilience through practical techniques that can help reduce anxiety.\nThe meditation guru shared skills with the pupils which, if put into practice daily, can be life-changing.\nSuzi said: \"They are all very relaxed and quite amazed at the experience. I hope they leave with the knowledge that they have the ability to create calmness within themselves using some of the techniques they have learned, leading to greater concentration, focus, creativity and well rested teens.\"\nThe visible difference in the pupils during the session at Space 108 has astounded school staff. \"Some of the teachers and staff who have attended over the years can\u0026rsquot quite believe the quiet and calm that begins to settle in the room. I\u0026rsquove had a few parents afterwards tell me how much their kids enjoyed it,\" said Suzi.\n\"There is a lot of anxiety and tension in our kids today, sometimes a feeling of being relaxed is a little alien to them, then they experience it. That\u0026rsquos the important bit, they have an experience of relaxation and calm, not an intellectual understanding that it is good for them, but an actual experience.\"\nResearch has proven that mindfulness and meditation is very beneficial to a person\u0026rsquos mental health, and many schools are incorporating it into their classrooms, teaching philosophies, and disciplinary programs.\nIn fact, some schools are choosing to replace detention with meditation with it even being used as behavioural therapy in classrooms.\nWhether this trend will catch on remains to be seen, as there are many parents who still prefer traditional discipline, with youngsters being given their marching orders to the principal\u0026rsquos office for unruly behaviour.\nBut one thing is certain, the pupils of Peebles High School reaped the benefits of their mindful meditation sessions with Suzi during Health Week last month.\nPrincipal teacher of pastoral care Kirsteen Robertson, said: \"The studio is beautiful, the students immediately notice how soothing the space is, the lovely smell and lighting. The sessions give our students strategies to relax, think calmly, reducing stress and anxiety and improve sleep. It\u0026rsquos just amazing to see how some of them react.\"\nHaving embraced meditation and its healing benefits, I leave the studio feeling renewed, carefree and a little lighter on my feet. The everyday worries and thoughts I described like a train racing out of control? They\u0026rsquod disembarked at station 108, where Peeblesshire\u0026rsquos very own princess of peace resides.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"community-pharmacists-travel-to-westminster-in-bid-to-save-network","story":"Northern Ireland\u0026rsquos Secretary of State is being urged to intervene to save community pharmacies.\nA delegation of community pharmacy representatives will be in Westminster on Wednesday to meet with Karen Bradley over the funding crisis in the network.\nEarlier this year Gerard Greene, Community Pharmacy NI chief executive, claimed \u0026pound20 million underfunding by the Department of Health had left the industry in a critical state.\nSome\u0026nbsp75,000 people have signed a petition urging the department to save the community pharmacy network in Northern Ireland.\nWith the continued collapse of devolved government at Stormont, Mr Greene said they are now taking their case to Westminster.\n\u0026ldquoWe have brought our fight to Westminster as the current political vacuum in Northern Ireland means we are getting nowhere fast, he said.\n\u0026ldquoThe engagement so far with the Department of Health and HSCB (Health and Social Board) has been less than useful.\n\u0026ldquoWe are constantly told that community pharmacy is to play a crucial part in the Health Transformation Programme, yet we are still working off an out of date contract that the previous Health Minister made clear needed to be urgently developed.\n\u0026ldquoPharmacy contractors are providing services with insufficient funding being provided by the Department of Health and HSCB and this is neither acceptable nor sustainable.\n\u0026ldquoWe are calling on the Secretary of State to intervene urgently to address this growing crisis before the damage done is irreversible.\nThe meeting with Ms Bradley on Wednesday is being facilitated by DUP MP Ian Paisley.\nHe said: \u0026ldquoAssembly and Executive paralysis means that the Department of Health is burying its head in the sand on the critical issue and the Secretary of State must urgently intervene before we start to see community pharmacists having to close their doors across Northern Ireland.\n\u0026ldquoThe implications for public health are not good if this situation continues in this way.

fertility treatment could give them the confidence to find a partner, experts said.\nSome women have their eggs frozen before undergoing medical treatments such as chemotherapy, which can damage the ovaries.\nHowever, so-called \u0026ldquosocial freezers are motivated for reasons including the lack of a stable partner and desire to pursue a career, not medical reasons.\nThe researchers used data from the Brussels Centre for Reproductive Medicine in Belgium, one of the biggest fertility centres in Europe.\nThey analysed the experiences of 563 women who froze their eggs between January 2009 and November 2017 in anticipation of \u0026ldquoage-related fertility decline.\nOnly 72 (12.8%) have since returned to the clinic for reproduction treatment and of these, just 43 had their eggs thawed, fertilised and transferred, the analysis showed.\nThe group had a mean age of 36.5 years when their eggs were collected.\nDr Gillian Lockwood, medical director at Midlands Fertility Services, said the data reflects trends in the UK, with most \u0026ldquosocial freezers finding themselves in a relationship \u0026ldquowithin a relatively short space of time.\nShe said: \u0026ldquoWe are very careful

which must become community hubs that include housing, offices and some shops, according to an influential independent review.\nRetail expert Bill Grimsey said it was time to accept that there was already too much retail space in the UK and town centres needed to be \u0026ldquorepopulated and re-fashioned with libraries and public spaces at the heart of each community.\nThe review is the second from a team led by the former Wickes and Iceland boss and comes amid a wave of closures and restructurings from major high street names including Toys R Us and Maplin and an ongoing shift to online shopping.\nGrimsey Review 2 is coming together in final editing stage.

download from Asthma UK’s website, and share this with anyone who will be looking after them as using one means they’re less likely to end up in hospital for their asthma.Track your child’s asthma symptoms using a diary or a symptom calendar.Prepare for going back to school by arranging for your child to have an asthma review with their GP or asthma nurse to check your child’s medicines and make sure your child has spare, in-date reliever inhalers to take into school.Parents whose children have asthma can access support through our nurse helpline.Last year we helped nearly 1,000 parents who called on behalf of their child with asthma.For information and support on how to manage your child’s asthma during the summer or to download a written asthma action plan visit

Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.

During a recent Holyrood debate, he said: \u0026ldquoPeople meet the queues of traffic heading on to the bypass on the main roads around my constituency before they are even near the bypass. This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution. I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity. We are continuing to progress the detailed design development and assessment of the preferred option and expect to publish draft orders in 2019."},{"url":null,"title":"in-pictures-prestonpans-childrens-gala-day","story":"  Gala Queen Grace Millar was crowned by Honourable Gentleman Eric Yule before leading her court to the playing fields.

Inspectors found the following strengths in the school\u0027s work:  - Strong relationships exist between staff and children across the school and nursery which are based on shared values  - In the nursery, children are motivated and confident, and are able to make choices about their play, particularly outdoors. Across the primary stages, children are committed to and proud of being part of their school community  - The committed staff team, led by the headteacher, work well together in their goal to secure positive outcomes for children. Wellbeing is central to the whole school community and staff provide a nurturing learning environment where children receive effective support.  Areas for improvement were identified and discussed with the headteacher and a representative from East Lothian Council.  They were:  - Increasing the opportunities for children to be more active and independent in their learning  - Continuing to improve attainment, ensuring that the pace and challenge of learning meets the needs of all children  - Continuing to develop the opportunities for leadership at all levels to support the school improvement. Increasing the scope for all members of the school community, including parents, partners and children, to be involved in discussions about aspects of the life and work of the school.

She has had both her feet amputated after they suffered tissue damage due to sepsis \u0026ndash a serious complication of an infection.\u0026nbsp It was also feared that Ruth, who taught art at Knox Academy in Haddington and Preston Lodge High School, Prestonpans, might also lose her hands.  She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe kindness of people has been overwhelming. They want to help so much.

The school is still going ahead with the daytime activities planned as part of the camp but asked parents to pick up their children from Yellowcraig at 7pm.  Mrs Wareham told parents in an email: \u0026ldquoYou may be aware that there is a group of people camped near the field at Yellowcraig where we usually hold our camp out.

The camping trip is usually held in a field on the left of the road leading into the car parks at Yellowcraig.  An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWhile the pupils will be taking part in all of the planned activities, arrangements are being made for them to be picked up at 7pm instead of camping overnight.  \u0026ldquoThis decision has been taken as the school understands there may be a number of people already using the area.

A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos cabinet heard that high schools had historically been given considerable autonomy in planning their school days and \u0026ldquocurricular arrangements. But this had resulted in \u0026ldquosix different structures, length of the school day and different levels of access in terms of experience and opportunity. And there was \u0026ldquosignificant variation throughout East Lothian in the range of Advanced Higher and Higher courses offered and the number of qualifications available in S4.  The report, backed by councillors, said the feasibility study would aim to lead to the creation of \u0026ldquoa common secondary school day and a common curricular structure.  The move would also see a change in hours for primary schools to match the new secondary day, with proposals to extend P1 and P2 pupils\u0026rsquo week from 22.5 hours to the same 25 hours that their older school-mates follow. A failure to synchronise primary school start and finish times to match the high school changes would cost the council an estimated \u0026pound190,000 in additional transport costs.  A public consultation will now be launched with the schools to establish the best standard timetable, with options for a 27, 32 or 33-period week. A 33-period week, for instance, could see secondary students\u0026rsquo first period of the day start at 8.30am, with a finish time of 3.40pm Monday to Thursday and 12.55pm on Fridays.  The council said a common school day would lead to joint delivery, mutual support, sharing of best practice and collaborative professional development opportunities, as well as meaning greater equity of resource and opportunity for young people across East Lothian and barriers to travel would be reduced.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokesperson for education, said: \u0026ldquoThese proposals are all about improving inclusion, wellbeing and equality. We\u0026rsquore always keen to look for new ways of raising attainment and improving positive destinations for our children and young people.  \u0026ldquoThere are a number of potential practical benefits associated with such changes. It\u0026rsquos important that we listen to the views of staff, pupils, parents, carers and other stakeholders.

Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is.

Residents such as Seona Mason-Chadburn, who lives in Dunbar town centre, contacted the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) and Tarmac, which operates Dunbar Cement Plant to the south-east of the town, about the discharge.  She told the Courier how she had attempted to use her window wipers to clear her front windscreen, only to discover the dust.  She said her windscreen felt like \u0026ldquosandpaper and compared the dust to the \u0026ldquobloom on a black grape.  A spokesman for SEPA added: \u0026ldquoEvery day SEPA works to protect and enhance Scotland\u0026rsquos environment and we are clear that compliance is non-negotiable.  \u0026ldquoIn response to local complaints, SEPA officers responded to reports of significant dust in the Dunbar area.  \u0026ldquoOfficers identified the source of the dust and are working with Tarmac to prevent a re-occurrence.  \u0026ldquoWe would advise members of the public to contact our 24-hour pollution hotline on 0800 807060 to report pollution events.  Tarmac has confirmed that the dust escaped, with an internal investigation being carried out.  Oliver Curtin, plant manager, said: \u0026ldquoIn the early hours of May 24 we experienced an isolated and brief incident where a small amount of limestone-based dust escaped from the site.  \u0026ldquoWe took action quickly and have been working with SEPA and conducting our own investigations to prevent a recurrence.

As soon as the discharge was detected, the process was \u0026ldquoimmediately shut down but \u0026ldquounfortunately some dust had already escaped into the atmosphere, said Tarmac.  The dry weather and wind direction resulted in the dust being carried towards Dunbar.

A large number of residents left East Lothian in service of their country \u0026ndash many of whom, tragically, would never return.  \"Sadly, in the 100 years since, the world has seen all too many conflicts \u0026ndash some on a large scale, others more confined.

Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"  Stars of the movies will be taking part in the summer event which is being held at Loretto School and raising funds for Children\u0026rsquos Hospices Across Scotland (CHAS).

I love nature and believe it is a powerful part of all of us, which is why going to the woods or the beach, or just the general \u0026lsquocountryside\u0026rsquo, is an antidote for the stress of life.

Yet it is so easy to rush past all the magic which is just on our doorstep.  And as I watched the wee frogs swimming in the pond last week, I discovered just how much I don\u0026rsquot know and have missed.

In the day-to-day living of life I suppose it\u0026rsquos understandable it is not an issue we will spend too much time thinking about.  But as I watched the wee frogs come up from the mud to the surface to breathe, then swim down again, I realised we were looking down on a simple but fascinating miracle of nature.  Then a wee frog literally jumped from a stone onto my son\u0026rsquos hand.  He could have squashed it or even been frightened by it, but instead he said \u0026ldquowow.  The wee creature jumped from his hand onto mine, obviously looking for a way back to the safety of the water.  Carefully, and a bit reluctantly, he helped the wee \u0026lsquobaby frog\u0026rsquo back into the water where it swam back down to the mud.  That\u0026rsquos when I realised I knew about the process without knowing about it.  There were some frogs which looked like late developers compared to their cousins, for they seemed to be more tadpole than frog, still swimming about with a tail between their developing frog legs.  The whole spectacle was, honestly, fascinating. I found myself being in awe at the process that we all know about but don\u0026rsquot really know about.  And so as summer has reached us, I am determined to make it a Safari of Discovery on our doorstep.  I will share this journey with you the places, stories and folklore attached to them. And while I cannot claim to be an expert on nature, I know its spiritual importance and I think that is a good beginning.  My first port of call will be the wood of what my kids call the \u0026ldquoserpent trees.  Where is that? You\u0026rsquoll find out next week!  In the meantime, I will have to keep this week\u0026rsquos page short as it is my daughter Manja\u0026rsquos ninth birthday and I have mermaid tails to connect. . ."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7697530.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"council-calls-for-rejection-of-substation-plans","story":"  East Lothian Council will submit its formal objection to the proposals to a Scottish Government reporter after officials were given the unanimous support of elected councillors at a meeting of the local authority on Tuesday.  A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.  The reporter is due to visit Cockenzie on Monday as part of her investigation into the application."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7994954.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"glory-days-of-golf-remembered","story":"  Musselburgh Museum on High Street is hosting an exhibition called \u0026lsquoMusselburgh \u0026ndash Cradle of Golf\u0026rsquo which is aimed at reasserting the Honest Toun\u0026rsquos importance in the sport\u0026rsquos rich heritage.  Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.  The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.  Organisers say the display shows Musselburgh\u0026rsquos leadership in developing golf and exporting it.  The museum is open on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays from 10.30am to 4pm each day."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8006789.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"coast-road-closed-after-car-overturns","story":"  Police said one person was trapped in a car which has overturned and they have closed the road while work to free them is carried out.

The land had previously been owned by Sainsbury\u0026rsquos who had permission for a new supermarket there but their long-stalled plans were finally ditched when they sold the land earlier this year.  A public exhibition took place at the town\u0026rsquos John Gray Centre last Tuesday where those behind the plans were on hand to answer local residents\u0026rsquo questions.  Alex Mitchell, director of Zander Planning, admitted there had been a \u0026ldquomixed reaction from the people who turned up.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have had a great turnout \u0026ndash some people have been supportive and think that it will be of benefit to the town but others are worried about what it will do to the town centre.  Alastair Dickie, development director at Ediston Real Estate, which are behind the plans, added: \u0026ldquoI think there have been a lot of valid comments.  The names of the businesses looking to move into the site have not yet been revealed but it is hoped that their identities will become public by the time a planning application is submitted to East Lothian Council.  Mr Mitchell hopes a detailed planning application will be lodged before the end of the summer. He said: \u0026ldquoIf we can get an application in by about September then we\u0026rsquore probably looking at six months for planning [approval]. If we get [that] we could be on-site in spring 2019.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure retailers would want to be open before Christmas but that is probably a bit tight so we\u0026rsquod be looking at early 2020.  Mr Mitchell also attempted to allay fears over the volume of traffic on the road by adding: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore looking to create a filter lane so people coming in [to the new retail park] would not cause queues for people getting into the town.  Paul Darling, one of the planning liaison officers at the town\u0026rsquos community council, attended the exhibition.  He said the buildings proposed were \u0026ldquougly but added: \u0026ldquoI am not against the plans, I just think the buildings have to be more in-keeping with the rest of the town.  \u0026ldquoI think that it could actually bring people to the town but it is a bit of a worry what could happen to the shops in the town centre.  The site had long been earmarked for Sainsbury\u0026rsquos after it won a lengthy battle with Tesco to build on the site in 2013."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8009220.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"dunbar-student-heading-off-to-the-olympics-of-tech","story":"  A games development team, made up of students from Abertay University, will take on the best in the world at the Microsoft Imagine Cup in Seattle.  The competition \u0026ndash dubbed the Olympics of Tech \u0026ndash seeks out the most innovative and potentially world-changing software solutions and comes with a first prize of $100,000.  Among those representing the Dundee university is Emily Peterson, from Dunbar.  She said: \u0026ldquoThey are sending the first and second place teams out to Seattle for the competition, which is in the last week in July.  \u0026ldquoIt is quite exciting, I\u0026rsquom just the artist on the team.  \u0026ldquoI do the models and particular effects and textures.  The team, who make up Blacklight Games, created Firepoint \u0026ndash a first-person mixed reality simulator which aims to bring a new level of realism to firefighter training.  Using HoloLens and Windows Mixed Reality technology, the game allows trainees to see through the eyes of a firefighter as they make their way through a multi-storey training ground tackling a variety of different issues.  It is hoped the simulator can eventually be used at open days or recruitment fairs.  The former Dunbar Grammar School pupil told the Courier the idea had evolved over time before resulting in the final product.  Originally, proposals looked at creating a game involving a maze.  However, a discussion with a firefighter saw the focus of the project, which is the work of eight third year students, change.  Emily said: \u0026ldquoMatthew McAuley, from our team, had a friend who worked for the fire service.  \u0026ldquoI think he got the initial from there and said why don\u0026rsquot we come up with that.  \u0026ldquoWe had been making the initial concept like a maze and it is something you can still see in the final build of the game.  In April, the team from Abertay University took part in the UK finals of the Microsoft Imagine Cup in London.  A team from Manchester University was crowned the overall UK winner with Abertay finishing as the runner-up.  Now, both universities will send teams to the final.

The young people would like to re-build the shelter with wider community involvement.  But Kathryn and Douglas Paul, who live at Glasclune Gardens, would prefer to see the shelter demolished.  Mrs Paul said that, while she was not against giving young people a place of their own, she felt the shelter \u0026ndash which sits to the rear of the home the couple have lived in for 18 years \u0026ndash was not the right location.  The couple told the Courier they had experienced long-standing anti-social behaviour from youngsters who already gather at the shelter.  Mrs Paul said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had bottles thrown into the garden \u0026ndash they are loud and they get up to all sorts. It\u0026rsquos been going on five or six years.

Some\u0026nbsp75,000 people have signed a petition urging the department to save the community pharmacy network in Northern Ireland.  With the continued collapse of devolved government at Stormont, Mr Greene said they are now taking their case to Westminster.  \u0026ldquoWe have brought our fight to Westminster as the current political vacuum in Northern Ireland means we are getting nowhere fast, he said.  \u0026ldquoThe engagement so far with the Department of Health and HSCB (Health and Social Board) has been less than useful.  \u0026ldquoWe are constantly told that community pharmacy is to play a crucial part in the Health Transformation Programme, yet we are still working off an out of date contract that the previous Health Minister made clear needed to be urgently developed.  \u0026ldquoPharmacy contractors are providing services with insufficient funding being provided by the Department of Health and HSCB and this is neither acceptable nor sustainable.  \u0026ldquoWe are calling on the Secretary of State to intervene urgently to address this growing crisis before the damage done is irreversible.

Many women find it \u0026ldquoempowering to boost their chances of one day becoming a genetic mother and undergoing fertility treatment could give them the confidence to find a partner, experts said.  Some women have their eggs frozen before undergoing medical treatments such as chemotherapy, which can damage the ovaries.  However, so-called \u0026ldquosocial freezers are motivated for reasons including the lack of a stable partner and desire to pursue a career, not medical reasons.  The researchers used data from the Brussels Centre for Reproductive Medicine in Belgium, one of the biggest fertility centres in Europe.  They analysed the experiences of 563 women who froze their eggs between January 2009 and November 2017 in anticipation of \u0026ldquoage-related fertility decline.  Only 72 (12.8%) have since returned to the clinic for reproduction treatment and of these, just 43 had their eggs thawed, fertilised and transferred, the analysis showed.  The group had a mean age of 36.5 years when their eggs were collected.  Dr Gillian Lockwood, medical director at Midlands Fertility Services, said the data reflects trends in the UK, with most \u0026ldquosocial freezers finding themselves in a relationship \u0026ldquowithin a relatively short space of time.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe are very careful not to suggest that freezing eggs is like buying fire insurance \u0026ndash because we can\u0026rsquot guarantee that it\u0026rsquos always going to pay out.  \u0026ldquoBut many women have said they do find it empowering that they\u0026rsquove done something that might help the possibility that they will be able to become genetic mothers one day.  Professor Nick Macklon, medical director at London Women\u0026rsquos Clinic, said: \u0026ldquoI think that many women are using this because they want to wait for Mr Right, rather than go with Mr Alright.  \u0026ldquoMaybe what this is telling us is that it works for many of them, that having had the confidence to do that, they are finding and they are getting into a relationship.  \u0026ldquoWhat we need to understand is to what extent having had access to this technology has given them that \u0026ndash has empowered them to actually give themselves more opportunities to find a partner they want to settle down with.  Dr Michel De Vos, who carried out the research, said most \u0026ldquosocial freezers who did return to the clinic had found a suitable partner to pursue motherhood.

After all, it\u0026rsquos with thanks to them I am here in the first place.  Dr Lennox said she has no degree, but could be described as \u0026ldquoan honorary graduate from the school of life.  She added: \u0026ldquoI come from a long line of hard working Scots, from the times when class boundaries, economic identities and gender roles were very firmly established.  \u0026ldquoYoung women from working class backgrounds gaining university degrees were as rare as kangaroos in the Antarctic.

Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  We were inundated with hundreds of votes from across Scotland, the UK and as far afield as the Netherlands, Sweden and the US, and our quest got folk talking and reminiscing in offices, pubs and on social media, revisiting and celebrating the music that has been the soundtrack to their lives.  So, here we have it: Scotland\u0026rsquos top 10 favourite albums.  10 \u0026ndash Raintown, Deacon Blue, 1987    The band\u0026rsquos debut is packed to the rafters with sheer quality and from beginning to end simply never lets up. Dundonian singer-songwriter Ricky Ross showcased his talent, intent and also a keen political and social awareness across 13 songs, among them Scotland\u0026rsquos other national anthem, Dignity.  9 \u0026ndash High Land, Hard Rain, Aztec Camera, 1983    Could Roddy Frame really only have been 18 when he recorded Oblivious, Walk Out to Winter and We Could Send Letters? East Kilbride\u0026rsquos boy wonder emerges fully formed on this astonishing debut album from 1983, having soaked up the pop, soul and punk influences of his prodigious musical youth and reimagined them as perfectly-crafted jangle-pop. The sound of young Scotland has rarely sounded this fresh.  8 \u0026ndash Strange Kind of Love, Love and Money, 1988    Though Love and Money\u0026rsquos particular brand of literate, glossy soul-pop looked to America for inspiration, lyrics about \u0026ldquoraining on Jocelyn Square were resolutely, affectionately Glaswegian. In another place, another time, Love and Money could have been the biggest band in the world.  7 \u0026ndash If You\u0026rsquore Feeling Sinister, Belle and Sebastian, 1996    Second albums are supposed to be difficult but Belle and Sebastian arguably never surpassed the stunning collection of songs that comprised their sophomore effort, giving a masterclass in how to mix melody, melancholy, nostalgia and humour.  6 \u0026ndash Bandwagonesque, Teenage Fanclub, 1991    The album that thrust Teenage Fanclub into the indie big league. From opening track The Concept to the closing echoes of Is This Music?, it is jam-packed with all the qualities fans have come to love about Bellshill\u0026rsquos finest four-piece: Byrds-influenced, melody-rich songs delivered in an endearing, gently shambolic fashion.  Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  5 \u0026ndash Heaven Or Las Vegas, The Cocteau Twins, 1990    Elizabeth Fraser\u0026rsquos otherworldly voice set over Robin Guthrie\u0026rsquos ethereal soundtrack is one of Scotland\u0026rsquos greatest musical pleasures and treasures, and this most accessible of Cocteau\u0026rsquos albums is simply awash with blissed-out grandeur. Could they really have been from Grangemouth? Oh yes.  4 \u0026ndash A Walk Across the Rooftops, The Blue Nile, 1984    Sounding nothing like anything else that came out of Scotland, the UK or indeed anywhere else in 1984, this debut fused spare synth precision with exuberant vocal sincerity to stunning effect. Tinseltown in the Rain, that bittersweet slice of cinematic perfection, remains the ultimate ode to Glasgow.  3 \u0026ndash The Midnight Organ Fight, Frightened Rabbit, 2008    Since Scott Hutchison\u0026rsquos untimely death in May, listening to the music he and his bandmates created has been a particularly sad and difficult task. But this album is simply too good to stop listening to. Revisiting is painful but cathartic, and like all of the \u0026nbspHutchison\u0026rsquos work, it makes you feel like it\u0026rsquos okay to be sad.\u0026nbsp  2 \u0026ndash I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything, The Trashcan Sinatras, 1993    From post-Smiths jangleism on their debut the Ayrshire gang blossomed to reveal an emotionally rich and enduring marriage of musicality and lyrical nous never before seen within spitting distance of Irvine or anywhere else, crowned by flawless performances by one of Scottish pop\u0026rsquos most devastating singers, Eddi Reader\u0026rsquos younger brother Frank.  1 \u0026ndash Hats, The Blue Nile, 1989    Only seven songs in length, Hats is a masterpiece of love, loss and redemption writ large over a lush, soulful and at times overwhelmingly beautiful soundscape, inseparable from the city of its birth, Glasgow. For almost 30 years it has offered endless inspiration and comfort. \u0026ldquoWhen all the rainy pavements lead to you, sings a heartbroken Paul Buchanan on From a Late Night Train. The rainy pavements of Glasgow will always lead to Hats.  Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  Here\u0027s what you said about Hats:  Christine Gardner, Rotterdam: Head and shoulders above the rest. A magnificent album that I continue to listen to regularly after almost 30 years. It is quite simply a masterpiece. It continues to draw you in, delight your senses, touch your emotions and somehow mirror your own very personal experiences. And yet it is also essentially Scottish \u0026ndash maybe something to do with our collective psyche, despite all our individual differences.  Martin McCarthy: Hats has so many layers, from dreamy songs like Over the Hillside and Let\u0026rsquos Go Out Tonight to more upbeat songs like Headlights on the Parade and \u0026ldquoThe Downtown Lights.  Saturday Night is just a sublime song, I love the pitch perfect bass, the stunning keyboards and Paul Buchanan\u0027s emotional voice. This was played at our wedding to a full dancefloor and will always be so special. The songs on Hats convey love, beauty, pain and loss, and can push me to tears of utter joy and euphoria.  Alex Watkins: It\u0026rsquos the album I always return to just something about the memories and emotions it always conjures up.  Kevin Jackson: Hats is the best album ever recorded anywhere by anyone. It touches you in a way that others must stand back in awe and adoration of. It is a thing of perfection. When some of the finest innovative talents of our time see it as one of the greatest albums ever, it is because it has no peers.  Peter Morgan: I\u0027m going to plump for Hats, that lush, aching, bruised and battered homage to love and loss.  John Reader: I listen to a lot of music, including lots of new stuff but always have Hats on at some point every week. Still hooks me in with its lush simplicity. I remember saying to someone more than 25 years ago that of all the music around at that time I reckoned I\u0027d be listening to Hats for the rest of my life. Not wrong so far.  Colin Lunn: I love A Walk Across the Rooftops, the best first album by any group, not only in Scotland but worldwide. However, Hats was probably a better, more perfect album although it didn\u0026rsquot have the same influence. Tough, tough choice but I\u0026rsquoll go for Hats by a very, very fine margin.  Here\u0026rsquos what you had to say about some of the other music on the list:  Kyle Wallace: I\u0027ve Seen Everything by the Trashcan Sinatras is part of the soundtrack to my life. Listened to it through my dad\u0027s death and the college years. So many great songs associated with great memories.  John Richards: This was a very difficult choice. Scottish groups (I\u0027m Welsh) have a disproportionately large place in my music collection \u0026ndash particularly those who came to prominence in the 1980s. My top 20 regularly features the work of the Blue Nile, Danny Wilson, Aztec Camera, Deacon Blue and Love \u0026amp Money. However, it\u0027s got to be an album from the year I turned 19, when I went to university and the myriad possibilities that life had to offer opened up before me. The song (and album) that soundtracked that life-changing period is still my favourite Scottish album: Strange Kind of Love by Love \u0026amp Money.  Stuart Duncan: My vote is for The Midnight Organ Fight by Frightened Rabbit. An album that, as your writer said, \u0026ldquomakes it feel it\u0026rsquos OK to be sad. The lyrics hit home more than any album I\u0026rsquove ever listened to. Scott Hutchison gave me a feeling that everything was going to be OK, that I would get through things. I\u0026rsquod say he helped changed me as a person. It still hasn\u0026rsquot stuck in that he\u0026rsquos no longer here [Hutchsion took his own life in May] but my vote would be the same regardless of the circumstances.  Danny Tennyson: My favourite album by a Scottish band \u0026ndash or any other band for that matter \u0026ndash has to High Land Hard Rain, by Aztec Camera. The fact that Roddy was probably only 15 or 16 when he wrote most of the tracks for the album makes it all the more remarkable. He continues to be a genius to this day.  Shane Brown, Illinois: Why is it that I live in the centre boring part of America (the states you fly over to get somewhere else interesting), and should by location and birthright be a huge fan of Slipknot, but instead find myself with a vast collection of Scottish indiepop? From the Cocteaus to the Fannies, Belle \u0026amp Sebastian to Teen Canteen, Scottish indiepop has been the soundtrack to my life. How and why the music of your land speaks to me, I\u0027ll never know, but no album speaks to my soul more than Cake by the Trashcan Sinatras \u0026ndash a record I find as comforting as a cup of coffee on a cold winter morning. I really, really love it to this day, and why those lads aren\u0027t universally revered as musical genius is beyond me to this day. I\u0027ve travelled hundreds of miles to see them live and I\u0027ll continue to do so as long as they grace us with the occasional American tour.  John Jauchler, Connecticut: Lots of good stuff on your list, but my vote goes to the Trashcan Sinatras\u0026rsquo I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything. Outstanding musicians and really nice guys as well. Their music has made a difference in my life.

The former prime minister said the NHS would be a \u0026ldquodiminished service after separation, and repeated his claims that the SNP\u0026rsquos latest independence blueprint would lead to austerity.  Statistics reveal GPs charged as much as \u0026pound1,400 per day for cover in Orkney in 2016/17, the latest year for which figures are available, while in NHS Lanarkshire charges were as high as \u0026pound1,132 per day.  Average daily rates for locum GPs varied across Scotland, from just \u0026pound90 in Dumfries and Galloway to \u0026pound851.52 in Lanarkshire. Five health boards \u0026ndash including Greater Glasgow and Clyde and the Lothians \u0026ndash failed to provide information.  Earlier this year, it emerged NHS spending on agency workers had reached more than \u0026pound300 million for the first time ever.  Scottish Labour, which obtained the latest figures through Freedom of Information laws, insisted it was \u0026ldquoutterly shocking that the SNP GP crisis has created a situation where locum costs are over a thousand pounds a day.  Shadow health secretary Anas Sarwar said: \u0026ldquoThe reality is the SNP has underfunded primary care for over a decade and as a result family doctors are left over stretched, overworked and under too much pressure.  But a spokesman for new Health Secretary Jeane Freeman accused Labour of talking down the NHS instead of celebrating its achievements as it turns 70.  He said: \u0026ldquoInvestment in our health service is currently at a record high, and we aim to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over ten years to ensure a sustainable service that meets increasing demand.  Writing in The Scotsman, Mr Brown argued Scotland\u0026rsquos health service is currently \"under-staffed, under-equipped and under-financed\", despite Theresa May recently announcing a \u0026pound20 billion funding boost, translating to an extra \u0026pound2bn north of the Border.

Structural engineers David Narro Associates and the contractor, Reigart, have prepared plans for the work that will need to be undertaken on the Mackintosh Building.  Plans have been shared with Glasgow City Council Building Control and Historic Environment Scotland.  Bosses for the GSA said work had been carried out over the weekend to assess the condition of the Mackintosh building, with further drone footage collected.    Final preparation work for the dismantling of the elements of the building that have been deemed dangerous begin today. The main crane has been relocated to the corner of Sauchiehall Street and Dalhousie Street, and a second crane is expected to join it tomorrow.  The work to begin dismantling the south fa\u0026ccedilade will start as soon as possible following approval of the methodology by Glasgow City Council Building Control. Work is needed following a devastating fire that ripped through the building \u0026ndash known as the Mack \u0026ndash on June 15.  For more than a century this majestic building which sits on a hill above Sauchiehall Street has been the beating heart of Glasgow\u0026rsquos cultural life.  It survived two world wars and one almost catastrophic fire four years ago.  Now, large sections of the Mackintosh building will be \u0026ldquodismantled starting today following a second inferno two weeks ago, with fears it will never be rebuilt with the bill estimated to be as high as \u0026pound200 million.  No-one could have predicted the turn of events which led to the almost-renovated building being destroyed in a fire, with new pictures yesterday revealing the full extent of the damage.  It was late on a Friday night when the fire was spotted by a passing policeman. Within an hour, it had spread like wildfire with the flames carrying over to the adjacent O2 ABC where the roof soon caved in Today, there is both physical and mental turmoil.  People have been unable to return to their homes in the area around Garnethill and Sauchiehall Street since the devastating blaze. Businesses have been locked out, with owners and staff facing penury.  But council bosses have condemned people who breach the GSA cordon as \u0026ldquodeeply stupid.    The words come as locals claim to still be seeing people climbing the fence \u0026ndash despite warnings the Mackintosh building is at risk of imminent collapse. A member of Gartnethill Community Council told how one man brazenly walked up to the fence mid-afternoon and tried to pull it down.  Other locals said they saw men climb the fence in the early hours of both Saturday and Sunday.  Ian Khan, of the community council, said he had to chase away a man who tried to enter the cordon on Sunday at around 4pm. He said: \u0026ldquoWe had a meeting on Sunday afternoon and then walked around to the front of the Mackintosh building to take a look. There was a man walking up Renfrew Street with headphones in. He walked right up and started trying to pull away the fence.  \u0026ldquoI said to him, \u0026lsquoWhat are you doing?\u0026rsquo and he said, \u0026lsquoI\u0026rsquom just going in.\u0026rsquo \u0026ldquoWe told him he couldn\u0026rsquot do that but he ignored us and went in anyway.  \u0026ldquoThe cordon around the art school is not good enough.  The blaze ravaged the Mackintosh building on June 15, as well as spreading to the O2 ABC venue and Campus nightclub.  There have previously been arrests after individuals tried to breach the safety cordon put up in the wake of the fire.  Art school bosses have said the site is extremely dangerous with brick work at risk of collapse.  A council spokesman said: \u0026ldquoThe exclusion zone exists for one reason \u0026ndash to protect life and limb. Anyone entering the area, other than a trained and accredited expert, is not only putting their life at risk but also deeply stupid.  Meanwhile, council leader Susan Aitken has said it is likely to be weeks, rather than months, before residents evacuated from their homes by the fire can return.  She said council bosses are in contact with the Association of British Insurers to smooth out issues for the now homeless residents.  This week there will be a clinic hosted by legal firm Harper Macleod to provide information to businesses on certain insurance and legal issues."},{"url":null,"title":"we-invested-our-life-savings-in-top-end-housing-scheme-and-lost-everything","story":"  The two 70-somethings are visiting the new-build housing scheme in Cleland, North Lanarkshire, for the first time, chatting in the sunshine as they wander past five-bedroom detached homes behind freshly laid lawns and drives full of spotless BMWs.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom really impressed, Ms Tatters tells Ms Wilkinson. \u0026ldquoThis is really top-end. Ms Wilkinson agrees: \u0026ldquoIt is just as I imagined it would be.  Ms Tatters, 71, is a businesswoman from Elgin. Ms Wilkinson, 74, is an actor from Sussex. The pair are among more than two dozen small investors who put up some \u0026pound1.2 million to get the Bellside Brae scheme off the ground. Their money has gone. They want to know where. So do politicians.  Ms Tatters and Ms Wilkinson and their fellow Bellside Brae investors were among hundreds of people to put money through a UK business called Cavendish Moore.  Now closed, this firm hit the headlines back in 2011 after Britain\u0026rsquos financial services watchdog launched a probe into its conduct. Cavendish Moore had placed adverts in the press offering returns of \u0026ldquoup to 50 per cent in two years in land and property investments. \u0026ldquoCan you afford to miss out? its publicity asked.  Cavendish Moore insisted it was different to so-called land bank scams \u0026ndash schemes where investors, often elderly, are enticed to invest in plots which had still to get planning permission. Instead the firm said it specialised in finding investors for land that was ready to be developed. And it grouped together investors into limited liability partnerships or LLPs to carry out individual projects.  The old Financial Services Authority (FSA) thought this amounted to an unlawful collective investment scheme. Its successor body, the Financial Conduct Authority by 2014 did a deal under which Cavendish Moore had to pay some of its investors back just 10 per cent of their money. Some of those who did get cash were already dead.  The firm is now being wound up. Its liquidator, Paul Allen of FRP Advisory, late last month said he had discovered a number of large transactions carried out by Cavendish Moore before it was shut down. In a formal report filed at Companies House, he said: \u0026ldquoI have thus far been unable to establish the ultimate beneficiaries and/or the rationale for a number of such transactions..  The investors in Bellside Brae were just one group of many who formed an LLP called Cicada under the guidance of Cavendish Moore.  After payments to Cavendish Moore, this firm representing 27 investors in 2009 put \u0026pound700,000 into a joint venture with a developer called Clydebrae Developments to put up the homes now called Bellside Brae.  Matt Blair, a retired Scottish engineer who now lives in England, was as impressed as Ms Tatters and Ms Wilkinson with the new homes.  He said:It is slightly better than I expected. The finish is fabulous. They have done a great job. But we have been excluded from benefiting from this project. I think it is inconceivable that you can build quality homes on a site like this and that your money could disappear.  \u0026ldquoWhen you make an investment you know there is risk. You might not get all of your money back, but to lose all of it?  The problem for Mr Blair and his fellow investors is that Clydebrae Developments went under before the project was finished. The business was struck off in 2015. It had no assets. Clydebrae was owned by another 70-something man, Robert Kirk of Helensburgh. The land it was developing, it turned out, did not belong to Clydebrae, it was held by a business registered in the British Virgin Islands called Crannoch Investments, in trust, according to lawyers for Cicada, for Mr Kirk.  The Herald asked Mr Kirk if he could explain what had happened to the investors\u0026rsquo money. Speaking at his sandstone home in the leafy west end of Helensburgh, Mr Kirk said he could not say. He added: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom retired and I have been out of it for seven years. I don\u0026rsquot know what the situation is now. \u0026ldquo  Mr Kirk had more to say in a letter last year to a lawyer hired by the investors, most of whom lost \u0026pound35,000 in the scheme. He said he did not have any interest in the offshore firm Crannoch and that Clydebrae had made no profits and owed the investors nothing.  He said money from the joint venture had gone to complete groundwork at the site.  Bellside Brae, he added, was \u0026ldquounsuccessful for a number of reasons, predominately market related. Clydebrae was forced to sell its right to develop the land by its secured creditors, he explained.  Rights were bought by another business called Calder Developments. One of its former directors, Mark Thompson, had also served as a director of Clydebrae. The Herald was unable to reach either Calder or Mr Thompson for comment.  Mr Kirk wrote: \u0026ldquoI did not benefit financially from [this] transaction. I have lost a significant sum of money. I do not own my home as a result and am living in rented accommodation.  Ms Wilkinson, who featured in the 1960s soap Compact, is also now renting, a single room. \u0026ldquoI thought I was going to get a little flat. That has all been taken away from me. Now I live on benefits.  Aberdeen North MP Kirsty Blackman said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom concerned that those who invested in Bellside seem to have lost significant amounts of money, and there is almost no ability to seek redress, or even to get information about where their investment has gone."},{"url":null,"title":"annie-lennox-named-first-female-chancellor-of-glasgow-caledonian-university","story":"  The\u0026nbspsinger-songwriter and social activist said she was \u0026ldquohumbled and awed beyond measure to be appointed to the position at the university.

Genetically engineered mice given the drug had reduced levels of a key hallmark of Alzheimer\u0026rsquos in their brains, sticky clumps of beta amyloid peptide.  Impaired clearance of the protein building block from the brain is thought to be one of the main causes of the disease.  A US team led by Professor Kalipada Pahan, from Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, found low-dose aspirin stimulated the formation of lysosomes \u0026ndash\u0026nbsptiny sacs in cells filled with digestive enzymes that help break down and clear away unwanted or harmful material.  The scientists wrote in the journal JNeurosci: \u0026ldquoStimulation of lysosomal biogenesis and reduction of amyloid plaque\u0026nbsppathology by low-dose aspirin holds promising therapeutic potential for treatment of AD (Alzheimer\u0026rsquos disease).  However British experts urged caution.\u0026nbsp  Professor Tara Spires-Jones, deputy director of the Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences at the University of Edinburgh, said: \u0026ldquoWhile this work is scientifically interesting, it is at very early stages.  \u0026ldquoThe amyloid reducing effects of aspirin were shown in cells in a dish and in a single mouse model of Alzheimer\u0026rsquos disease with relatively few mice per group.  \u0026ldquoFurther, the study did not show whether aspirin helped the brain function in this disease model.\u0026nbspMore work will need to be done in order to know whether low-dose aspirin could help prevent or treat Alzheimer\u0026rsquos.  Rob Howard, Professor of Old Age Psychiatry at University College London, added: \u0026ldquoClinical trials of aspirin have already been performed in patients with Alzheimer\u0026rsquos disease.  \u0026ldquoThe drug had no beneficial effects on outcome measures and was associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal haemorrhage.  The American researchers pointed out\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspmechanism appeared to be dependent on a protein called PPAR-alpha, levels of which fell significantly with age.  This might explain why trials looking at the effects of aspirin on elderly Alzheimer\u0026rsquos patients had produced disappointing results, they said.  Dr Sara Imarisio, from Alzheimer\u0026rsquos Research UK, said: \u0026ldquoAspirin is a commonly taken medicine for a number of health conditions, but there has been little research to examine potential benefits for Alzheimer\u0026rsquos disease.  \u0026ldquoThis early-stage research suggests aspirin may help improve how the brain removes amyloid, a protein known to build up in Alzheimer\u0026rsquos. The study reveals important insights into the mechanisms through which aspirin may impact brain health, however this is a small study in mice so it\u0026rsquos too early to draw conclusions about whether aspirin could be used to treat Alzheimer\u0026rsquos in people."},{"url":null,"title":"queen-formally-welcomed-to-edinburgh-at-start-of-holyrood-week","story":"  The annual Ceremony of the Keys saw the monarch handed the keys of the city and welcomed by Edinburgh Lord Provost Frank Ross.

Teenagers accounted for most of the sessions, with the youngest person being just 10.  The NSPCC\u0027s Are you there? campaign is calling on the UK Government to provide funding to Childline so it can help more children and teenagers struggling with mental health issues.  Childline founder Dame Esther Rantzen said: \"Loneliness needs to be taken seriously because it is potentially damaging to children\u0027s physical and mental health.  \"The crucial question is what is causing this rise among the young?  \"Are we all too busy to make space and time for our children?

Ministers will be kept at the mansion until they have reached agreement.  \u0026ndash What do they need to decide?  The Government has to set out what it wants its future relationship with the European Union after Brexit to look like. This includes issues relating to customs and trade which have triggered furious rows within the Tory ranks.  \u0026ndash What about customs?  On customs, two models have been considered by ministers: the \u0026ldquomaximum facilitation system favoured by Brexiteers, which would use technology to help reduce friction at the border or the \u0026ldquocustoms partnership where the UK would collect duties on behalf of the EU.  Because of problems with both models, a \u0026ldquothird way may now be under consideration, although details are scant on what the compromise could be.  \u0026ndash What about the single market?  The Prime Minister has ruled out remaining in the single market, but fundamental questions need to be resolved about how far the UK will deviate from the standards set by Brussels.  Businesses fear that if domestic rules after Brexit stray too far from those set by the EU, it will hamper their ability to work and trade in those markets.  But some Brexiteers favour divergence, arguing that it will enable the UK to compete on the global stage and slash red tape. They question what the point of leaving the EU will be if the UK remains bound by rules over which it no longer has a say.  \u0026ndash Will decisions be reached?  Mrs May has so far managed to hold together the mix of Brexiteers and former Remainers in her Cabinet, but descending from the fence on one side or the other of the debate is likely to strain that fragile truce.  A further slice of Brexit fudge is a possibility, but the Prime Minister has promised the White Paper that will emerge after the talks \u0026ldquowill set out detailed proposals.  \u0026ndash Could there be resignations?  Tensions are undoubtedly running high. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson could face a difficult decision if the Cabinet comes down in favour of close alignment with EU rules and the \u0026ldquocustoms partnership model.

Since then customer numbers have soared, with up to 200 hour-long sessions now running each week.                                                    Clients, who suffer from a range of respiratory issues, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and allergies, spend their time relaxing in one of two treatment rooms where the walls and floor are clad in salt. A specialist machine then finely grinds medical grade salt that is released into the air at prescribed concentration levels for the duration of each session.                                                    The therapy, also known as halotherapy, dates back to the ancient Greeks who sought the benefits offered by naturally occurring salt caves for improved health and wellbeing. Providing a 100% natural and drug free complimentary treatment, halotherapy, derived from the Greek alas, meaning \"salt\", is believed to loosen mucus and reduce inflammation making breathing easier.        Donna said: \u0026ldquoWe were increasingly aware of the vulnerability of the oil and gas industry, and although we both had good jobs, our working days were getting longer and more stressful which began to impact on our family life, so the timing seemed to lend itself to a total lifestyle change.\"My mum and grandmother are regulars at Salt Caves in Inverness and Edinburgh, and both had seen a significant reduction in their respective symptoms and an upturn in their general wellbeing.

When we realised there was a local Salt Cave franchise available we jumped at it. It hasn\u0026rsquot been an easy journey, and securing the right premises was difficult.\"It was at this point we met with Business Gateway. Our adviser undertook a property search on our behalf and provided invaluable information on commercial leasing and the documentation we needed to provide to secure it. Since then we\u0026rsquove had help with our business plan, HR, marketing, and have attended workshops on sales and customer care. Having access to impartial advice like this has given us greater confidence in our own abilities.

It will provide on-board workshops, spare parts storage, crane and office facilities but will get supplies from another large vessel. By contrast the BOWL project will use smaller crew transfer vessels on a daily basis to provide crew and supplies.\u0026ldquoIt is just a different strategy being used at MORL and we could not accommodate that size of vessel at Wick as we do not have the shelter and water depth required, he said. \u0026ldquoIf we had our new quay at Shaltigoe we would have been able to accommodate it.But Mr Watt is confident the harbour will still play a part in servicing the MORL project and in other renewable projects in the Moray Firth basin. He pointed out that Wick is 33 kilometres from the wind farm while Fraserburgh is 70km away.\u0026ldquoWe wish Fraserburgh and Moray East well and will continue to develop Wick harbour, Mr Watt said. \u0026ldquoWe will move forward on a strong footing in the renewables market as well as in the fishing and cargo sectors.He added that work on the BOWL base is progressing well and will create upwards of 150 jobs.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay said: \u0026ldquoIt is very disappointing news. Hopes were high this project could come to Wick. There have been a lot of improvements going on at the harbour which has the potential for a positive future.\u0026ldquoI hope other projects can come to Wick and I look forward to seeing improvements on the platform the BOWL project creates for the town and the community in general.

He will be succeeded by Ian Ross, the former East Sutherland and Edderton Highland councillor.Sir Anthony\u0026rsquos decision to step down ends a long association with the area which started in 1993 when he was appointed as chairman of the then UK Atomic Energy Authority.

He took on the role and says it has been \u0026ldquoan honour and a privilege to do it.\u0026ldquoI have enjoyed all my time here in my various jobs, he said. \u0026ldquoI do think the partnership has made a major contribution.\u0026ldquoTen years ago the mood was pretty depressed. People were very gloomy. I would say the mood now has changed and is pretty optimistic, although there are challenges. That will always be the case.\u0026ldquoThe big advantage we have here is that it will be a number of years before Dounreay is closed so we had an opportunity to plan for the future.

That was disappointing. They will now have to find another way forward but are looking at opportunities.Sir Anthony decided to retire as he felt 10 years as chairman was long enough. \u0026ldquoI wanted to leave before people wanted me to, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was time for a change.\u0026ldquoI am delighted with the choice of Ian Ross as my successor.

All we are now waiting for is confirmation that it’s fully legal and then we can get on with implementing it. Our lawyers have told us that because we are a commercial operation and currently receive no subsidy whatsoever, we have to be 100 per cent sure that this scheme complies otherwise our whole business is at risk. We are not sure why it is taking so long to get simple confirmation.“Although not one penny of the proposed subsidy comes to us, it goes directly to the passenger, we would be forced to pay it all back if it doesn’t comply, that could ruin us and we can’t take that risk. All we are asking for is for the Scottish Government to check that it’s legal with the EU and UK and then we can get on with it. We have written to the new Minister Michael Matheson MSP and invited him to visit the island and meet our staff so we can share our concerns with him directly and hopefully he will visit soon so we can get this unlocked.“We have also today asked for a meeting with our local MSP Liam McArthur to see if he can do anything to get things moving forward on our behalf. This is extremely frustrating but as a family run, fully commercial Orcadian business, employing 70 people and with exciting expansion plans, we cannot put at risk our business until we are certain the Scottish Government’s proposal fully comply.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

That is simply not acceptable.Whatever the outstanding disagreement there may be between the government and commercial operators, Mr McArthur feels that people in Orkney have every right to expect both sides to get this sorted without delay.\u0026#8220The Transport Secretary also needs to confirm that the fare reductions, once agreed, will be backdated to 30 June, in keeping with the firm promises made by his predecessor and the First Minister,\u0026#8221 he said.“This sorry saga has rumbled on for far too long.

Invasive Species Initiative is being led by Scottish Natural Heritage to tackle alien species.Lynn McKelvey, Cromarty Firth Fishery Board project officer, said: \"Here at Garrie Island, in the River Conon, we have fantastic wet alder woodland, which is designated as being important at both a UK and European level.\"However, the woodland habitat has been under threat from invasive species, particularly Himalayan balsam, which spreads so quickly growing in dense stands, meaning no native wildflowers can grow.\"Head teacher Tania Mackie said: \"Outdoor learning is fundamental to the curriculum at Ben Wyvis Primary School, as is working with local partners.\"We are delighted to be working with Cromarty Firth Fishery Board and the SISI project.\"Not only are the children being supported by experts, but the pupils of Ben Wyvis Primary are also learning about their local environment.\"Learning in context is a valuable experience for all our young people and as a school we are

Pam\u0026rsquos paintings are absolutely fantastic and we hope this event is a great success.\"Since the age of 63, Pam\u0026nbsphas painted hundreds of pictures, been a member of art groups and exhibited locally.Until recently she also\u0026nbspknitted clothes for infants in the special baby unit at Raigmore Hospital in Inverness and was a puzzle enthusiast, winning the Ross-shire Journal crossword at the age of 99.She celebrated her 100th birthday surrounded by friends and family at the Church of Scotland Hall in the village last year after a neighbour of 36 years\u0026rsquo standing, Joyce Fraser, decided to organise something special to mark the milestone event.Mrs Foster was also joined by friends from the local WRI and art group, along with\u0026nbspstaff and residents of the care home she was about to move to.

Her husband passed away in January 2012.Asked the secret of her long life, she said: \"I\u0026rsquove been asked this before and I always say \u0026lsquopure living\u0026rsquo, but of course it\u0026rsquos not!

The new investment is a vote of confidence in a thriving local community and will create and sustain local jobs for some years forward.\"The new homes will range from two-bedroom semi-detached through to four-bedroom detached homes.Tulloch will also stage an open day next Saturday for its Chanonry Park scheme in Fortrose where homes have a price tag of between \u0026pound225,000 for a three-bedroom detached villa and \u0026pound268,000 for a four-bedroom detached home with garage.She described Chanonry Park as \"an excellent development for us\" and expects the Fortrose scheme to sell out this summer.She said: \"This will bring to an end eight years of Tulloch Homes involvement with Fortrose, during which it has assisted in local population growth.\"The developer said it was looking for prospective development sites on the Black Isle as the area has witnessed a steady demand for housing in recent years.Wednesday 4 Jul 2018 2:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It also found that 62 per cent of posts are in professional occupations.Eilean Siar, Glasgow and Highland are the three areas with the highest number of jobs in which Gaelic is considered essential, together accounting for 93 per cent of the Scottish total.The study was welcomed by Deputy First Minister, John Swinney, who commented that the growth in desirable and essential jobs making use of Gaelic language would provide young people with a wealth of exciting career choices.\"I hope that this report will encourage more people to consider learning Gaelic,\" he added.As well as looking at the demand for Gaelic language skills, the report looks at Gaelic education, analyses the opportunities and challenges, and suggests future action.Damien Yeates, chief Executive of SDS, said: \"Developing a detailed evidence base of current and future skills demand is essential for all parts of our economy, and the Gaelic language labour market is no exception.\"Last year SDS published the second edition of its Gaelic language plan, and this study was one of the key commitments contained in that plan.\"The evidence will help inform future investment aimed at promoting the Gaelic language and culture.\"Shona MacLennan, chief executive of B\u0026ograverd na G\u0026agraveidhlig, commented: \"B\u0026ograverd na G\u0026agraveidhlig is clear that growing the number of Gaelic-essential jobs and jobs which use Gaelic is important in ensuring that Gaelic is used more often, by more people and in a wider range of situations.\"The key challenge is to ensure that the flow of people with high quality Gaelic language skills entering the labour market is matched to the demand from employers across the public, private and third sectors, and from across Scotland.\"\u0026nbspFuture actions proposed in the report include forming a national group with responsibility for Gaelic language skills, and increased monitoring and evaluation of the activities supporting the language.Charlotte Wright, Chief Executive of Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE), said: \"Gaelic is fundamental to HIE\u0026rsquos unique remit which integrates economic and community development throughout the Highlands and Islands.\"Our support has helped numerous organisations which enable Gaelic to flourish, and we look forward to continuing to work with businesses, social enterprises and community organisations that can add value through using Gaelic to help realise its full potential.\"Wednesday 4 Jul 2018 2:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

A number of new schools have been built, which is brilliant for the pupils and communities that benefit.\"Despite receiving more funding than nearly all other local authorities, Highland Council still has the worst school estate in Scotland.\"The funding recognises the rurality of Highland Council, but most schools have been built in more densely populated areas like Inverness. It is of particular sadness that this funding has not gone further so that more school buildings could benefit.\"But Highland Council leader Margaret Davidson has defended the local authority\u0026rsquos track record, pointing out that it has 204 schools to maintain \u0026ndash more than any other area in the country. She added that Scottish Schools for the Future funding was welcome but added that current levels of funding from Holyrood are \"simply not enough to adequately invest in our schools\".She urged the Scottish Government to provide funding levels which recognise the unique challenges facing the Highlands, \"and in particular the very large number of schools, many of which are smaller schools, requiring urgent investment\".And she called for it to consider capacity pressures when allocating funding.\"If Kate Forbes wants to help Highland schools, then she should support our asks from government.\"Wednesday 4 Jul 2018 2:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4763547.1530648906!/image/image.jpg","title":"mps miss england match as snp forces commons vote during game","story":"\t\tMPs took to Twitter to voice their displeasure after the SNP forced a vote in the Commons during the England game.\t\t\t\tThe vote was forced by the SNP over estimate spending of government departments, something that does not usually involve a vote by MPs.window.twttr = (function(d, s, id) {            The move means that MPs have spent most of the evening in the voting lobbies rather than watching the England v Colombia match.

I’m so tired I could cry. \u2028In the morning, we’re taking my son to Thomas The Tank Engine Land and we decided to drive down on Sunday evening to avoid the traffic.             I don’t want to have to work on what should be the first day of a family holiday, which means pulling an all-nighter, so I can file without missing quality time with my children.            This time last week, I was in another hotel in London. The week before that, Edinburgh. Or was it Salford? Or Dundee? It’s hard to say, if I’m honest. The workload has fried my brain to the point I often cannot recall the prior day’s events when asked what I’ve been up to. I feel like I am losing my mind. Every day bleeds into the next, with no respite in sight. But complaining about the fact I feel like I am on the cliff-edge of a mental health crisis seems utterly futile because, from the outside, it appears I am enjoying wonderful, unprecedented success. Success for which I ought to be grateful.Of course, I am grateful. If anything, I am in a state of permanent disbelief about what is going on. The truth is I haven’t had a minute to reflect on or even savour anything that has happened since November last year when the publication of my book began a chain of events that culminated, last Monday, in being awarded the coveted Orwell Prize.More people than ever seem to want to speak to me, for different reasons. Some just want to say, “well done” and others want to share their stories. Some want to me to come and visit their projects and others want to buy the film and TV rights to my life story.             I did some business in London last week that will make your eyes bulge out of their sockets when its announced, yet somehow, in this haze of physical and emotional exasperation, nothing feels real. I don’t even feel real.READ MORE: Scotsman columnist Darren McGarvey wins Orwell Prize for political writingPeople love a good rags-to-riches story. Hell, I know I do. But imagine how surreal it feels when you become the centre of one. You are suddenly inundated with requests, calls, offers and correspondence, without any frame of reference for what is going on. It’s incredibly disorientating and sometimes frightening, if I’m honest. But there is rarely an opportunity to express that truth, because you are always being prompted to describe how it feels to become “successful”. People want to hear a specific story. The story about a diamond in the rough, escaping poverty, surviving neglect and abuse to become an award-winning author. People are less interested in what it took to get into this position.             The fact I am struggling mentally and emotionally is even less interesting. The details about my cluster migraines, abscesses and insomnia are met with looks of confusion, as people instinctively attempt to direct me away from what I want to say and back to the “narrative”: my capitalist hero-journey. They don’t want to hear about the thousands I’ve spent on hotels, trains and flights, travelling this island by myself, with a heavy bag over my shoulder and a box of books under my arm, literally selling hand-to-hand. The hundreds of books I’ve purchased with my own money, to sign and post all over the world to plug gaping holes in my finances. They don’t want to hear about the anxiety attacks I often experience as notifications flood my devices or the fear I suffer every time I give an interview to a newspaper or broadcaster. Nobody cares that I live in constant dread that I will misspeak on a sensitive issue and become a target for people online. Nobody is interested in me describing what it feels like to come home after weeks of being on the road, to find my two-year old sitting with his back to me – his way of letting me know he isn’t pleased with my absence. I haven’t made a penny off my book yet. I am living off advances. But any time I try to express that these overwhelming mundanities – and not the successes – are what currently consume every moment of my waking life, I feel the weight of other people’s expectations bearing down on me. READ MORE: Darren McGarvey: Journalists must leave their ivory towers to gain respect            To the extent that I am learning it’s best to simply conceal the reality of my life, or risk appearing ungrateful or worse, spoiling the vicarious thrill others might experience when they enquire, “how does it feel?”I don’t know how it feels. I haven’t had a minute to take anything in. I run around like a mad-man, I fall asleep somewhere, and I wake up and do it all again. Every. Single. Day. No matter who I speak to, my constant refrain – that I am in urgent need of rest and fear I may be heading for a fall – never seems to be heard. The only thing I haven’t been offered in the last seven days is a good night’s sleep. I feel obligated to so many people, for different reasons, that my own needs fall to the bottom of the hierarchy of concern. My problems are marked as low-priority and so must remain hidden, revealed only in late-night social media outbursts when I feel trapped on Scotland’s decrepit public transportation network.All I need is a few days where I am not expected to do anything. Where I am not obligated to speak to anybody. Where I can gather my thoughts and rejuvenate after two years of non-stop, high-pressure work, couched in constant financial insecurity and stress. Anybody getting any ideas that I’m too far removed from the working class to write about it, ought to refer to my seven-day-a-week schedule for proof that I am more working class now than I ever was – with no holiday entitlement. It’s 3.10am. The kids will be up in four hours.

These have now reportedly been ditched with the belated realisation that they were either practically or politically impossible to deliver.

He has warned they will not sign up to anything short of a clean break, prompting fellow Sir Alan Duncan, a fellow Tory MP and Government minister, to criticise Rees-Mogg’s “insolence”. “The ideological right are a minority despite their noise and should pipe down,” he tweeted.

If the UK cannot decide what it wants, it will end up getting exactly what they want. Politicians of all parties need to realise the old fault lines do not apply on this issue and that, for the sake of the nation, they must form an ad hoc ‘national coalition of the sensible’ to secure a Brexit deal that will outrage the hardliners but save the economy from disaster.READ MORE: Lesley Riddoch: Doomsday report exposes Brexit vulnerability"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4762976.1530605815!/image/image.jpg","title":"paris gourtsoyannis media is doing its job over brexit dark money","story":"\t\tDUP Brexit spending raises concerns about the law, not about how it was reported, writes Paris Gourtsoyannis.\t\t\t\tIn the final days of the EU referendum campaign, the Democratic Unionist Party paid for a wrap-around advert in the , calling on voters to “take back control”.            The message reached far beyond Northern Ireland, where the  isn’t even distributed, and should have been far beyond their means – an advert like that costs more than a quarter of a million pounds. The DUP spent less than £100,000 on an entire devolved election campaign in 2016.            In fact, the party that now keeps the Conservatives in power spent an incredible £425,000 on Brexit, buying a lot besides newspaper advertising. How they came into that money might have remained a secret, but for intense political and media pressure.Electoral rules in Northern Ireland did not, until recently, require parties to declare where they had got their money from – a legacy of the Troubles. We might never have found out that the DUP’s Brexit campaign was bankrolled by the Constitutional Research Council (CRC), a shadowy group headed by a former Scottish Conservative Party chairman and parliamentary candidate, Richard Cook.The CRC doesn’t file accounts and has no public face. We have no idea where it gets its money – and the only person who knows, Cook, isn’t saying. Meanwhile, his own business dealings have come under intense scrutiny.READ MORE: SNP calls for investigation into ‘shady business’ of Vote Leave fundingAll of this has been reported over the past 18 months. The journalists Peter Geoghegan and Adam Ramsay, writing for Open Democracy, have been the most dogged, but they’ve been abetted by other outlets.            The latest revelations about Cook’s previous activities were the product of an investigation by BBC Northern Ireland, and were picked up and reported by BBC Scotland. Cook is an elusive character, but was doorstepped by Channel 4 News and challenged to reveal where the CRC’s money came from. When the CRC was first named by the DUP, the news was splashed on the front page of the Herald, and the story had also been reported by its sister paper, the Sunday Herald, and other publications.The DUP donation has been linked to wider claims of cooperation between different Brexit campaigns in breach of electoral spending law, stemming from the widely reported Cambridge Analytica controversy. The central allegation is that money was passed to different groups to avoid legal spending limits – a claim that has been denied, but which is under investigation by the Electoral Commission.The facts are that the DUP spent £32,000 with data firm AIQ, which also received 40 per cent of the official Vote Leave campaign budget, as well as nearly £675,000 from another campaign group, BeLeave. When the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Chris Wylie told MPs he was “absolutely convinced” the spending represented a breach of electoral law, that was reported in The Scotsman.All this serves as a lengthy run up to this: when Nicola Sturgeon echoed the Twitter hordes by saying she was “surprised there aren’t more media questions being asked” about what the SNP is calling ‘dark money’, I shared her surprise.            Engaging with people who question the how, why and why not of stories in the Scottish media is usually pointless – they are almost always motivated by political partisanship, a deep attachment to conspiracy theory, and a lack of understanding about how the news today works. Those traits shouldn’t be encouraged.If critics want to see what is a complicated story delved into more deeply, then they have to accept that the biggest problem with the so-called ‘mainstream’ media in Scotland is that there isn’t enough of it – that sort of work takes resources, mainly time. Many of the wounds of the media industry were self-inflicted. It doesn’t help for elected politicians to keep punching them. Above all, the details already uncovered in the story of the DUP’s Brexit cash have amply demonstrated that rules around political donations lack transparency, particularly in relation to Northern Ireland. In a world were ‘calling out’ something is seen as akin to political action, the media’s critics have somehow convinced themselves the problem is that not enough is being written. Actually, it’s that not enough is being done. That’s not our department."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4763433.1530627465!/image/image.jpg","title":"snp mp dismiss scottish people s voice on brexit at your peril","story":"\t\tTheresa May\u0026#8217s Conservative Government is \u0026#8220hopelessly divided against itself\u0026#8221 as the UK faces its \u0026#8220biggest challenge\u0026#8221 of Brexit, an SNP MP has said.\t\t\t\tPatricia Gibson warned the people of Scotland “will not have their voices overridden by Westminster without consequence, dismiss them at your peril”.

Ms Gibson argued the “hostile environment” created would drive EU citizens to leave the UK.She warned of the consequences of a breakdown of trust over the SNP’s “power grab” concerns in relation to the Government’s Brexit legislation.She said: “Those who value the Union beware, beware that whenever the next referendum on Scottish independence comes - and come it will - the debate has been crystallised... like never before.“Every day this Tory Government demonstrates just a little bit more that they cannot be trusted by the people of Scotland...

Responding, Brexit minister Robin Walker said: “The Government is clear that we want a deal that works for the whole UK.”On EU citizens, he added: “I think the environment has been welcoming.”Four times as much of Scotland’s business was with the UK compared with Europe, he said, adding that the worst thing for Scottish jobs and businesses would be to split from the UK.He said: “The UK Government made substantial and reasonable modifications to provisions in the EU (Withdrawal) Act during its passage, those changes were the result of joint working that we undertook with the Scottish and Welsh Governments.”The legislation he said “does respect” the devolution settlement, adding the Government was “disappointed” the Scottish Government did not choose to give consent.Throughout the process he said the UK Government had acted in line with the Sewel Convention, adding the interests of the people of Scotland were best served when Holyrood and Westminster worked together."},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers. But not causing them.I would venture to suggest that long after life has ceased on  this planet there will still be episodes of change which will also be natural and normal except there won’t be anyone around to grumble, fret or lead campaigns !!\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 19 ","story":"Shetland’s young sports competitors retained their hold on the Stuart Cup at the weekend, with the margin of victory, in the end, being fairly comfortable.\nGoing into the last event of the junior inter-county, the netball, Orkney had to win by 32 points to overhaul the visitors’ lead. Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct. It’s a crass act by Sterling and just as daft a move by those who support him.\n: : : : : : : :\nTo end on a more postitive note, surely cyclist Chris Froome has to be one of the UK’s best ever sports performers.\nThe way he destroyed the field to secure the recent Giro d’Italia, the third Grand Tour title he currently holds along with the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, was incredible.\nSadly this country has not really taken to Froome, otherwise he would have surely already been a recipient of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.\nIf he wins another Tour de France this year, which would be his fifth victory, it would be a travesty if he didn’t receive the personality trophy.\nBarring Harry Kane scoring a hat trick in the final and lifting the World Cup for England next month, which I can’t really see happening, hopefully this will be Froome’s year at last.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"kia pro ceed ","story":"3dr Kia pro-ceed sr7, 4 year warranty remaining, one owner, full Kia service history, VGC inside \u0026amp out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve. My line-up is: Russia v Portugal, Spain v Uruguay, France v Argentina, Croatia v Denmark, Brazil v Sweden, Belgium v Japan, Germany v Switzerland and Senegal v England.\n: : : : : : : :\nThere has already been a healthy entry for our competition to name Shetland’s greatest football team of the past 60 years, but potential selectors still have a week and a half to make their minds up.\nThe main prize, a return trip for two people with car and cabin courtesy of NorthLink Ferries, is definitely not to be sneezed at. And there are also leather footballs from Cee \u0026amp Jays Intersport for the runners-up.\nSo whether you are a subscriber to the theory that the best players all hung their boots up decades ago, or you believe the standard of today is much better than yesteryear, get your thinking caps on and have a look at the details above. If the price of a stamp puts you off just email your entry to editorial@shetlandtimes\n: : : : : : : :\nEven those who detest cricket most may have raised a modest eyebrow last week when the Scottish team shocked England with victory in a one-day match at Edinburgh.\nReaders, whether they follow the game or not, may be interested that there was actually a player in the home side’s ranks with Shetland connections.\nA glance at the Scottish team sheet may suggest possible contenders – how about Michael Leask, Mark Watt or even Dylan Budge for instance?\nBut it was none of those. The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"health board in talks for better airport waiting area in aberdeen ","story":"NHS Shetland has been in talks to look at an alternative waiting area for patients flying back from Aberdeen Airport – rather than what has been described by a councillor as \u0026#8220a drafty corridor\u0026#8221.\nHealth board chief executive Ralph Roberts raised the issue during a Zetland Transport Partnership meeting on Tuesday afternoon.\nMr Roberts said there had been discussions with Loganair to look an alternative and he was having more talks about the matter on Friday.\nHe said there had been a suggestion that NHS Shetland should be obliged to pay for a lounge for passengers, but added in his own view it was a matter for all passengers travelling to Shetland.\nMr Roberts argued if the waiting area were adequate for all passengers it would be adequate for patients too.\nZetTrans chairman Ryan Thomson thanked Mr Roberts for bringing it to members\u0026#8217 attention.\nMr Thomson added \u0026#8220it\u0026#8217s a drafty corridor\u0026#8221, the issue had been raised at other transport meetings and Loganair was aware of the issue.\n\n \u0026raquo\nYet again, this is just so typical.

There\u0026#8217s no holidays and no rest, it\u0026#8217s a condition you have to face every day.\u0026#8221\nOnhausz is perhaps best known for his daredevil stunts scaling the likes of Scalloway Castle while kitted out in superhero outfits. But he is also a painter of considerable talent.\nHis previous exhibits have seen him paint picture-perfect likenesses of musicians such as Jimi Hendrix and movie monsters such as Frankenstein.\nThis time Onhausz has taken inspiration from something a little closer to home, his job with Scottish Sea Farms.\n.\nBalazs Onhausz with the centrepiece of his latest art exhibition.

The wooden boat was taking in water in rough seas in the Roost.\n into Lerwick harbour.\nShetland Coastguard watch officer Alex Dodge said: “The 14 on board were all safe and well. The skipper handled the situation extremely well.”\nThe 40-year-old converted fishing boat, with an all-female crew and female passengers, was heading to Shetland for a diving trip, and will be in the isles for the next few weeks.\n since January last year and has 22 years experience as a power boat instructor, said she called the coastguard as a precaution.\n was [originally] a fishing boat and well able for the conditions.”\nThe problem started when the boat began taking in water from the rudder gland and a deck hatch, she said. The boat was equipped with a three bilge-pump system but one of the pumps had failed, meaning they only had one as back-up. Ms Weaver said: “We try to be two failures away from a problem.” Also, she said, she had to “err on the side of caution” because the boat was carrying 12 passengers.\n was able to proceed “under her own power and pumping under her own power” into Lerwick. She is currently in the small boat harbour.\n and two sunken klondykers.\n is used for various types of dive trips, including recreational and wreck diving in locations in Orkney and Shetland, including Scapa Flow and Fair Isle as well as in northern Scotland and Faroe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}]
