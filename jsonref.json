I’ve been doing it for three years to make sure that nobody abuses the term champagne.”The Comité Champagne is one of the organisations tasked with ensuring only sparkling wine from the Champagne region in France carries the name champagne.“He said, ‘I’ve checked out your website and your Facebook, and it looks like it’s not part of your online shop, but, if you do commercialise it, you will have to call it something separate’,” Robertson said.Robertson said rather than upsetting him, the legal warning made his day.“It was quite funny. It gave me a bit of energy for the day, that’s for sure, that in the scheme of things he would call.”The Mount Gnomon Farm usually sells its produce at farmers’ markets and to restaurants, but lost almost all its business overnight when physical distancing restrictions came in.In order to keep the farm running, Robertson has started home-delivering local produce boxes to the Penguin area.“We are busy with the Easter deliveries at the moment, but after that we were thinking of putting up a naming competition for the rhubarb champagne on Facebook … We could give away a bottle of it, maybe.“Someone suggested Rhu-bubbles, which I like,” Robertson said.He is now considering serving the drink in the farm’s restaurant when it is allowed to open again.One question remains: who dobbed in the farm to the French officials?“It must have been somebody that knew about the farm that was French,” Robertson said.“I guess some people just have too much time on their hands in quarantine.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83b747e9f29e0111c061a9f0c16ce93e2b83adc7/0_129_3878_2328/master/3878.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=420839fdc0a5f743166de6797cec3d10","title":"perth hottest april day ever temperature 395c coronavirus beaches distancing","story":"Beaches remain open in Western Australia as police praise the public for respecting coronavirus physical distancing rulesPolice have praised West Australian beachgoers for respecting physical distancing rules as Perth sweltered through its hottest April day on record.Perth’s temperature reached 39.5C on Saturday, eclipsing the previous April record set in 1910.Authorities had been on standby to close beaches given the combination of the hot weather and the Easter break.But patrolling officers reported people were obeying the rules and practising physical distancing.“We’ve seen good behaviours generally right across our beaches, our high-contact areas where people generally congregate,” the police commissioner, Chris Dawson, said.“People are really accepting the advice and we’re not seeing many instances at all where people are grouping together.”WA recorded eight new coronavirus cases overnight, taking the state’s total to 514.All the cases were in the Perth metropolitan area and linked to either overseas travel or cruise ships, including three crew members from the Artania liner.Dawson said 12 people had faced charges related to breaching quarantine and isolation rules, and a further eight had been issued $1,000 fines.Those fined included a 65-year-old man who was turned away at a checkpoint north of Perth only to attempt to get in through back roads.Under WA’s intrastate travel bans, people must have an exemption to move between the state’s nine designated regions.WA has also implemented a hard border with the eastern states, denying entry to anyone who does not meet a narrow set of criteria.The premier, Mark McGowan, said he hoped WA would eventually be able to remove some of the restrictions within the state.“We’ve had very, very low levels of community transmission,” he told 6PR radio.“That’s a really good sign. That’s better than virtually anywhere else in the world.“What I’d like to see happen over time is watch how it develops, review it each month ... to see if any can be eased and any tightened up.“And if at the end of a month we can ease some, and hopefully get a bit more normality back without risking anyone, then that’s the sort of approach we’ll take.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6522f8ae0a6a82401bd4df114b33bd571f9346c7/0_472_4126_2476/master/4126.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a1786b44d596294d18ad4229a0204f8","title":"book clinic are there any books as clever and amusing as bridget jones","story":"From Katherine Heiny to Carrie Fisher, some of the best authors to get you laughing out loud Q: I need a good laugh. Can you recommend something as smart, funny and deft as the first Bridget Jones novel?Anonymous quality controller, 40A: Emma Jane Unsworth is a novelist whose books include Animals and Adults (Borough Press). She writes:Smart, funny and deft – my favourite literary cocktail. And let’s face it, we all need a good laugh at the moment. I’d like to start by recommending an author whose work never fails to cheer me up – but that’s not to say it’s mindlessly jolly. Katherine Heiny’s Standard Deviation is, in my opinion, one of the best comic novels of the past 10 years. If you like it, you should also try her short story collection: Single, Carefree, Mellow. Also brilliant. Standard Deviation is more understated in its lols, but the characters – an odd couple caring for their son, who has Asperger’s – are flawlessly hewn. On a similar tip, check out Where’d You Go, Bernadette by Maria Semple, which is as formally exciting as Bridget Jones, being told in a series of documents – emails, memos, transcripts – and tells the story of a daughter trying to find her missing mother. Seriously, this book has wit for days. I also must say that Queenie by Candice Carty-Williams is Bridget Jones for the 21st century. Read it, if you haven’t already. It mixes the light and dark of female experience in jaw-dropping ways.On to some nonfiction: treat yourself to Carrie Fisher’s autobiography Wishful Drinking – based on Fisher’s one-woman stage show (aren’t the best comedy narrators standup comedians at heart?) – which tells of her long, sticky life in showbiz. In fact, read anything by Carrie Fisher. And definitely read her semi-autobiographical novel Postcards from the Edge if you haven’t already. I feel like I recommend that book every day of my life, but until everyone in the world has read it at least twice, I will not stop.Now for something a little off-piste. I listened to The Panopticon by Jenni Fagan while on a writing retreat in a motorhome recently. It’s the story of a 15-year-old girl in the care system. She has the gift of the gab. It’s dark as hell, but it made me laugh more than any book I can remember for a long time. Some of the scenarios Fagan paints about what the teenage girls get up to are perfect comedy vignettes with the darkest silhouettes.Finally, some poetry in the mix. You did say “smart, funny and deft” and those words bring one particular poet to mind, John Cooper Clarke from Salford, near my hometown of Manchester. His voice makes me so happy. Read his delicious poem Chickentown – better yet, find an audio recording of him reading it. He is pure comedy, and then some.Submit your question for book clinic below or email bookclinic@observer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6088edadd218b4573359f66000a7b05a7aa39e03/0_61_3508_2105/master/3508..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d138fd6314559f65b27c5eb21735b999","title":"max porter writing allows me to worry about stuff better","story":"The Grief Is the Thing With Feathers author talks about how myth, environmentalism and anxiety inspired his second novelMax Porter’s second novel, Lanny, is the semi-mythic story of the disappearance of a boy in a rural English village. It follows his widely acclaimed debut, Grief Is the Thing With Feathers. Porter, 38, until recently editorial director of Granta Books, lives near Bath with his wife and three sons, aged 10, seven and four. This interview took place by phone.I suppose Lanny emerges somewhat out of that sense of the fragility of the beautiful surface of lifeI suppose so. In that if you are engaged with being alive on this planet just now and especially raising children, then if you are not terrified about the future half the time, you are not paying attention. What is weird about Lanny is that I realised some of what it was about after I had finished it. Certainly the environmental elements of it. Lanny himself has that easy proto-environmentalism that all children are born with.The malevolent spirit in the book, Dead Papa Toothwort, would have lived and breathed Covid-19…Yeah, you would be jogging through the woods and he would just cough it out.The book seems to channel some of the atmosphere of certain rooted mythic novels. I was reminded of Alan Garner. Did you have him in mind?I came late to Alan Garner, in my 20s. I have a Quaker Welsh side in my family, so I was always drawn to The Owl Service, and the idea that those Welsh myths were bubbling under my own life. But those weren’t really sort of foundational texts for me. Likewise, someone else asked me if The Piper at the Gates of Dawn chapter in The Wind in the Willows was a reference point. But again I’d hardly thought of that at all.But you see the connections?Yes, I am becoming worryingly pagan in my reading. I have been reading about contemporary animism, and if you strip out all the stuff about druids and rune tattoos, it makes a lot of sense. It’s funny, I just read Bill Bryson’s terrific book about the body and the fact is, bang-up-to-date science is saying the same things about our relationship with our environment that ancient indigenous people understood. There was a review of Lanny that said “beware: mystical thinking” and I’m thinking yeah, we could probably do with a bit more of that.You studied art history and I understand that your writing always starts with drawing – at what kind of scale?Just now the art projects are quite grand. I’m making presents for everyone I know who works in the NHS, with collage and paint. Generally, though I am hunched over my notebook with a black fine-liner pen. I might start with two diagrammatic figures or the idea of a building. And then out of that I might get a sentence or two, or at most a paragraph and then when I sit down and write they are my raw material.Did that habit come naturally?Pretty much. The great truth I learned from John Berger, who I had a huge reading crush on, was that to put art and writing in separate buckets was to completely misunderstand how the brain worked. Art is where I begin thinking from. I am never going to be a writer who just sits down and writes paragraphs of prose.You want to surprise yourself?Yes, you want to not be in control, always. Also I am a worrier. I find that writing allows me to worry about stuff better and in more detail.There is plenty of scope for anxiety at the moment.Yes but the page should be the place where you do that much better than you do on Twitter or whatever.Lanny grew out of a long poem you wrote based on an inspiring friendship between a child and an older neighbour. Was that autobiographical?Yes, there were a few people like that. I did art lessons with my next-door neighbour Pam, who was a lovely woman who taught at the local prison. I had a really nice grandfather who taught me how to do watercolours and stuff like how to make arrows. And mainly there was my godfather, Tony, my best mate, who makes beautiful things with his hands and just gives them away. He is a working definition of the good life for me. I wrote to him a while ago and told him I was sorry this beautiful tray he had made me was all stained now, and he wrote back to say: “Great, that’s how it should be”. I’d like to think my books can be lived with in the same way.You are interested in oral poetic traditions. How far back do you go?Quite far. I’m reading this great new translation by Gwyneth Lewis and Rowan Williams of The Book of Taliesin. And also this incredible Ethiopian spiritual text The Harp of Glory, which is a kind of Chaucerian love song to the virgin.Which book or author do you always return to?Riddley Walker by Russell Hoban. I first read it in my late teens – my brother gave it to me and said don’t panic in the first 20 pages. And it was true, the first pages were like smoking a really bad joint, but then after that you are syntactically and emotionally and politically absolutely held in the book’s spell. I have reread it three or four times since. The way it changes is unbelievable it is a living thing.• Lanny by Max Porter is published by Faber (£8.99). To order a copy go to bookshop.

The firm says its own rules do not allow for the meeting to be held virtually or digitally.Bunzl is among the firms criticised by campaign group ShareAction for making it difficult for investors to hold company boards to account during the pandemic, and is concerned the extreme circumstances created by the health emergency could set a precedent.So this year, at least, some familiar sights on the corporate calendar will disappear. On a spring weekday morning, it’s not uncommon to see pensioners queuing for an AGM outside the Queen Elizabeth II Centre in central London – a favoured shareholder meeting venue – opposite Westminster Abbey. Attendance offers retail shareholders the single chance of the year to question executive board, then receive a free lunch.Executives, sat behind a long dais and a row of nameplates, rarely look like they are enjoying these occasions, as the company chair fields questions from the floor that range from the aggressive or adulatory to the incisive or meandering.But public companies are required by law to hold an annual meeting within six months of their financial year ending – often the end of the calendar year, giving many a 30 June deadline. It is a time to face the music and meet some old adversaries among the retail investor community who attend such events assiduously, as well as campaign groups who regularly use AGMs – those of oil groups Shell and BP and defence giant BAE Systems in particular – to make a point.Firms must give shareholders at least 21 working days’ notice of the meeting. Miner Rio Tinto and medical equipment manufacturer Smith+Nephew, which had already scheduled dates in early April, have scrambled to rearrange their plans.A quorum of at least two people is required by law, depending on a company’s articles of association, the written rules which define how a firm must be run. This resulted in the bizarre scenario of Hikma Pharmaceuticals, a FTSE 100 drugs company, switching its AGM from a luxury London hotel to the home of the company secretary in the suburb of Surbiton.Barclays’ meeting will take place at its London headquarters instead of Glasgow on 7 May. If government restrictions are still in place, the lender will hold a “virtual” AGM for the first time in its 123-year history.Alok Sharma, the business secretary, has said the government intends to make it easier for companies to hold virtual AGMs, but, as at Bunzl, a company’s own rules may prevent this.Luxury footwear brand Jimmy Choo held the UK’s first virtual, fully electronic AGM in 2016, during its brief stint as a public company.Michael Kind, campaign manager at ShareAction, commends some companies like Rio Tinto, which offered shareholders the chance to ask questions in real time during an audiocast of the meeting, but is worried by others: “We have concerns that companies are not going to be held as accountable as they usually would be this season. This is especially worrying given how millions of people with pension savings are invested in a company’s shares, and workers are being laid off,” said Kind.ShareAction has written to the government, asking it to “protect shareholder democracy” and ensure that this season’s changes to AGMs “should be a temporary solution”. Nonetheless, this year is going to set a precedent."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a85295b13145bab687d57d3661065e5ca898522/0_0_4394_2636/master/4394.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c62744af1416b26a3ab83461627b4da9","title":"retail landlords struggling rents dry up pandemic","story":"Enforced closures are crippling a sector that was already in serious troubleWhen Debenhams filed for administration last week, it wasn’t just suppliers of its stock, who are owed cash, that felt the pain. There are 22,000 jobs at risk if the retailer cannot be rescued and many of its 142 stores are unlikely to reopen, spelling more trouble for British high streets. And there is also a network of landlords who rely on quarterly rent payments from their shops.The outlook for these landlords was dark enough before the pandemic brought the British economy to its knees. More than 16,000 stores closed last year and the enforced shutdown of cafes, pubs, restaurants and non-essential shops is expected to result in thousands more pulling down the shutters for good.Since pre-industrial times, landlords and tenants have adhered to a schedule of quarterly rent payments, when annual commercial or agricultural rents were payable in four equal instalments on the “quarter days”, linked to religious festivals.It is not just Debenhams, New Look and Sir Philip Green’s Arcadia group – to name just a few of the retailers in deep trouble – that are seeking help on rent. Vast, profitable businesses such as fast-fashion retailer Primark, sportswear chain JD Sports and Burger King are also refusing to pay their landlords the rent they are due.One major problem is that the government has now allowed commercial tenants to delay rental payments for three months without fear of eviction. Some landlords are furious that certain tenants have interpreted this as permission not to pay.Some £2.5bn in retail rents was due at the end of March, according to trade body the British Property Federation (BPF). The property industry, it says, cannot absorb vast losses, because landlords have debts to service.Melanie Leech, chief executive of the BPF, is calling for government and regulators to work with lenders to help commercial property businesses. “As property owners offer relief to their tenants, there is a very strong case for lenders to provide debt service deferral to owners in return, to protect the 45 million savers and pensioners across the country whose money is invested in commercial property,” Leech said.Some investors have already been caught up in the property-sector tumult. Investment managers BlackRock and Schroders have both suspended trading in their UK real estate funds, saying it was difficult to obtain an accurate valuation of their assets.“Landlords” are treated as one group, although they vary enormously: some are private iniduals, some are pension funds. And their approach to pursuing rental income varies also.Property consultancy firm Lorenz Consultancy is currently involved in negotiations between more than 40 hospitality businesses based in London’s West End and their landlords. It says two-thirds of landlords are offering some flexibility. “You’ve got to have transparency between the tenant, landlords and financiers,” said Richard Russell at the consultancy. “The landlords want to protect income through this, but don’t want to be left with vacant units.”Some of the country’s biggest landlords have offered tenants deferred or lower payments, which Cedrik Lachance, an analyst at the property consultancy Green Street, called a “partnership in pain”. “Landlords who are proactive will get better results over time,” he added.Property firm British Land, which owns shopping centres including Sheffield’s Meadowhall, has scrapped rent between April and June for smaller tenants, and allowed larger firms to spread rent repayments.A number of landlords, however, have called for their lawyers and are threatening immediate legal action. Intu, which has a £4.5bn debt pile and is fighting for survival, has already threatened some tenants with a statutory demand – a formal request for payment – if they do not pay.An Intu spokesperson said: “We are happy to engage with brand customers on a case-by-case basis, but we have neither the desire or financial capacity to bankroll global, well-capitalised brands who have just decided they don’t want to pay their rent.”A similar warning has been sent by Criterion Capital, which owns London properties including the Criterion Building on Piccadilly Circus, home for almost a century to the Lillywhites sports store, now operated by billionaire Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct chain. Its letter warns that non-payment of rent will lead to a winding-up petition.“This is a sledgehammer to crack a nut and an entirely inappropriate use of the legal process, which will result in business collapse and administration,” said Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, which represents the cafe and restaurant business. The trade body has written to the government asking for an extension to the ban on evictions, from three to six months. UK Hospitality wants the measures widened to prevent property owners from issuing winding-up petitions or statutory demands, a protection already introduced in Germany.Russell at Lorenz also believes an extension is needed, as tenants and landlords are already discussing next quarter’s rent. He warns: “There will be a bloodbath in June if tenants are forced to pay double rent: lots could go to the wall.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/839db6a711fe6ea7f044ed98bc33b6ec636a9df7/45_60_5345_3207/master/5345.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6909b1ab39093398ad5b1e2b97a036db","title":"for non intrusive tracking of covid 19 smartphones have to be smarter","story":"Monitoring the pandemic with personal technology is a thorny issue. We can get results without having our privacy on paradeOn the weekend of March 20-21 news organisations in the US and elsewhere were reporting that beaches in Florida were thronged with holidaymakers, none of whom seemed to be observing any kind of social distancing. “If I get corona, I get corona. At the end of the day, I’m not going to let it stop me from partying,” one reveller told a reporter in Miami, conveying the general atmosphere.As it happens, however, some people were paying attention – employees of two firms, X-Mode and Tectonix, that specialise in the geo-tracking of smartphones. As rumours began to spread that the US government might be thinking of using tracking to map the spread of the virus, they decided to show what they could do with their technology.This could have been motivated simply by curiosity. Or maybe they were really pitching for a putative federal contract. Whatever the reason, they produced pretty dramatic results. Both focused on tracking location data from the phones of people who had visited the beach in Fort Lauderdale, Florida – among them the spring-breakers who had made national news when they ignored warnings to practise social distancing despite the worsening pandemic. The results of the tracking, a map posted on Twitter, showed where people went after they visited the beach, spreading out all across the country to major cities including New York and Chicago, possibly bringing the virus with them.If you wanted a dramatic illustration for non-techies of what this technology can do, then those maps were perfect. Many lay people were doubtless shocked by them. But actually it was old hat, technically speaking: it simply brought into the public sphere what’s already being used to address the pandemic challenge in some countries, and what’s being contemplated by governments everywhere.The capabilities of this technology would make totalitarian leaders drool. On the other hand, it appears to be very effective in helping countries to manage the crisis. And it is probably not a coincidence that the democratic societies that appear to have coped best – South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, for example – have evolved from, er, authoritarian pasts. In normal circumstances, liberal democracies would have to think very hard about intruding so comprehensively into their citizens’ privacy.But these are not normal times, and it seems likely that western governments will move to deploy smartphone tracking as a way of monitoring and controlling the pandemic. When they do there will be an explosion of (understandable) outrage from civil liberties organisations, but governments will ride roughshod over these with reassuring bromides about how such “emergency” measures will be rolled back once the crisis has passed. Recent history (think 911) does not provide much comfort here. And we are going to have zoonotic-virus crises for the foreseeable future, so the “war against the virus” will become like the war on terror.In that sense, we seem to be heading into a nightmarish future. But it doesn’t have to be that way. It all depends on how we design and deploy the tracking capabilities of smartphones. And contrary to what you will hear from government and tech industry sources, there are technologies that will enable us to have the societal benefit (being able to track the virus and keep iniduals and authorities informed) while minimising the intrusions on personal privacy. We just have to be smarter.And then there are decentralised models that keep as much sensitive data on users’ phones as possible and uses a centralised server only to enable people to use their own devices to trace contacts. All over the world – at MIT, Cambridge University, King’s College London and a range of European technical universities, for example, groups of gifted researchers have been working on this third approach. Prototypes already exist (I have one on my phone). And what this shows is that privacy-preserving approaches to proximity-tracing are possible, and that countries do not need to accept methods that create risk and enable misuse.

When Lewinsky learned that Tripp was sick, she said: “No matter the past… I hope for her recovery. I can’t imagine how difficult this is for her family.” A graceful response and one in stark contrast to what Lewinsky said when the then US president Bill Clinton was impeached for lying about their affair: “I’m really sorry for everything that’s happened. And I hate Linda Tripp.”Her loathing for the older woman was understandable. Taken into Lewinsky’s confidence about Clinton, Tripp secretly recorded the conversations (giving them to the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr) and encouraging the former White House intern to keep the semen-stained dress (for evidence). Even after relentless censure, ridicule and disgrace, Tripp continued to view herself as a righteous whistleblower. However, 22 hours of secretly taped conversations suggest something less edifying: one woman (naive, obsessed) spilling her secrets to another woman, who coolly gathered information, then used it to jam her young friend’s head on to a spike.Too simplistic? Maybe. The truth is always more complicated. After all, it was Clinton who put the main wrecking ball through the lives of the three women involved: Monica, Hillary and Linda. The same Clinton who recently said he’d had the affair with Lewinsky to “manage his anxieties”. (Do at least try to stay classy, Bill.)Women are also complicated – as human and fallible as any male betrayer. Certainly, women shouldn’t be held to idealised standards of behaviour, which have a nasty habit of turning into bear traps anyway.Nevertheless, a woman betraying another woman so completely, in such an intentional strategic manner, is shocking and, in most female lifetimes, rare. While all betrayal is devastating, maybe because of entrenched sexism the female-on-female variety has an extra whiff of sulphur. It goes against the unspoken code, the feeling among women that ultimately we look out for each other, that it’s them and us.It’s the impulse that makes little girls pinky-promise their eternal devotion and teenagers keep secrets until they die. It’s the young woman bursting into tears in the nightclub lavatory and finding herself comforted by a bunch of strangers who are her instant best friends. It’s there behind workplace mentoring schemes. It’s what makes younger women turn to older women for advice and older women feel proud to give it. And it’s been there throughout #MeToo, with women giving testimonies and supporting each other, whatever the personal cost.Whatever was going on between Tripp and Lewinsky all those years ago, this crucial element – of instinctive warmth and trust between women – was missing, but only on one side. Lewinsky went to Tripp believing that the sisterhood exists Tripp lied to her that it didn’t.How would you like to be gawped at while you’re trying to have sex? Perhaps it’s best you don’t answer that, but a couple of middle-aged giant pandas in China have made their feelings on the matter abundantly clear.Ying Ying and Le Le of the Ocean Park theme park in Hong Kong have known each other for 13 years, with no “action” to speak of. Now they have mated, there is hope that a baby panda could come along and some people think it’s because they are finally getting some privacy during the lockdown.After the closure of the park in late January, the amorous pandas were first spotted “cuddling more intensely than usual” and there were more panda lurrve signs such as scent markings and Ying Ying – the lady panda – “spending more time in the water”, which must be the panda equivalent of shaving your legs.It would appear that having loads of humans poking cameras at you is a major turn-off. Who’d have thought it? All this raises serious issues about the wellbeing of not just pandas but all caged animals, how much this could be affecting libido and how much better off they would be left in the wild.At the very least, it needs acknowledging that onlookers are stressing pandas out and stopping them getting it on. Whatever other problems pandas have with mating, what amounts to human-on-panda dogging has to stop. Clearly, pandas need a bit of privacy, the equivalent of Barry White playing on the turntable, perhaps a lava lamp on its lowest setting. If you wouldn’t like people rubbernecking at you while you’re having sex, spare a thought for modest pandas.Do we need to be careful that events don’t lead us to sleepwalk into a Planet Amazon scenario?Debenhams has called in the administrators again and many other smaller retailers are in trouble. Meanwhile, multibillionaire Amazon boss Jeff Bezos has faced strike action over claims of inadequate worker protection and putting “profits before safety”.Furthermore, while the online goliath has dominated the marketplace for years, arguably killing off the high street, it’s now making it near impossible for Amazon third-party sellers of non-essential items (including books) to operate, having temporarily withdrawn access to the Fulfilled by Amazon feature in which firms bulk ship their goods to Amazon warehouses and use their delivery network for a fee. Where is the protection for these small businesses?This is not a wild attack on Amazon – most people use it, it’s not responsible for coronavirus and the emphasis on essential items was understandable, particularly during our stockpiling phase.However, while Amazon says it has taken “intense” measures to protect staff, it’s imperative that worker concerns are properly dealt with, whatever the cost. Moreover, such developments expose the power of Amazon and the essential vulnerability of the small businesses it claims to support. Memo to Bezos: don’t make people suspect that they’re going to wake from this nightmare to discover a retail reality where only Amazon and the cockroaches survived."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4818103d9720f6796c42dcd2784beff0175ed416/0_0_2706_1781/master/2706..jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53cfcb8ecc9991c3d6ec2926df3e4fff","title":"meera sodha vegan recipe asparagus thoran","story":"With homegrown asparagus now hitting the shops, here’s a novel way to make use of those glorious spearsNever has a comment been so barbed as when a dish is described as a side.

For me, however, the fun – by which I mean the simple, tasty dishes that always see people reaching for more – lies more often in the quick and easy, fresh and fast sides. Here I offer two such dishes: they’re both good to go for this weekend’s big meal or to file away until spring is fully sprung and we can all, hopefully, venture out into the sun.This understated side dish is dressed up enough to keep everyone at the table happy, but simple enough not to steal the show from the main course. It would pair really well with roast chicken or grilled seafood. You can make the sauce well in advance – just warm it through while you’re cooking the polenta – but don’t make the polenta until just before you’re about to serve, otherwise it’s likely to set.Prep 20 minCook 45 minServes 4 as a sideFor the sauce1 onion, peeled and cut into 8 wedges (150g net weight)150g datterini tomatoes, or regular cherry tomatoes4 tbsp olive oil6 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed750g vine tomatoes, core removed and finely chopped into 1cm dice (seeds and all)1 tsp caster sugar5g oregano sprigs (leaves and stalks), plus 1½ tbsp leaves extra to serve (or use basil or parsley instead)Salt and black pepperFor the polenta500ml chicken stock350ml whole milk60g unsalted butter200g quick-cook polenta150g gruyère, roughly gratedPut a large saute pan on a high heat and, once very hot, add the onion wedges and cook, turning regularly, for about six minutes, until very well charred on the outside. Transfer to a plate, then put the tomatoes in the same pan and char for another four minutes, or until nicely blistered in places. Transfer to the onion plate, but keep the two separate, and put the pan aside to cool slightly.Return the pan to a medium-high heat and add the oil and charred onion. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about two minutes, until slightly softened, then add the garlic and cook for another 30 seconds. Add the chopped vine tomatoes, sugar, oregano sprigs, 150ml water, a teaspoon of salt and plenty of pepper. Bring up to a simmer, then turn down the the heat to medium and leave to cook for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes have started to break down. Add the charred tomatoes and cook for seven minutes more, until they’ve started to soften and the sauce has thickened. Keep warm until ready to serve.Put the stock, milk, 100ml water, half the butter, a teaspoon and a quarter of salt and a good grind of pepper in a medium saucepan on a medium-high heat. Bring to a gentle simmer, turn the heat to medium-low and pour in the polenta in a slow, steady stream, whisking continuously, until completely incorporated. Carry on whisking for two to three minutes more, or until the polenta is cooked and the mixture is still quite wet and loose.Stir in the cheese and remaining butter, then spread out the polenta on a large platter. Spoon the tomato sauce on to the polenta, gently swirling some of it in, top with the extra oregano leaves and serve warm.The natural sweetness of the peas and onions goes a long way to making this very simple dish, with very few ingredients, taste rather special.Prep 10 minCook 35 minServes 4 as a side2 tbsp unsalted butter60ml olive oil2 onions, peeled and finely choppedSalt500g frozen petit pois, defrosted10g chives, finely choppedPut the butter, two tablespoons of oil, the onions and three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt in a large saute pan on a medium heat, and cook for 16-18 minutes, stirring often, until soft and deeply golden.

That’s not to say that there’s no point in coaches and directors planning, but it is to say that there are times when entirely external events take control – and that doesn’t have to mean something as enormous as coronavirus. Football can turn on events that seem random, unconnected, unpredictable – the bounce of a ball, the shape of the goalposts, the eruption of an Icelandic volcano – or on the unlikely influence of one man.Take, for example, the case of Gino Pivatelli, a forward for Bologna, Verona and Napoli who was top scorer in Serie A in 1955-56 and won seven caps for Italy. At the end of his career, he played 37 games for Milan, by which time he had lost some of his pace and sharpness in front of goal. He never managed them. And yet without him, the first two of their eras of European pre-eminence may never have come about.Milan’s meeting with Benfica in the 1963 European Cup final was one of those rare crossroad games after which football history takes a decisive turn in a particular direction. Bela Guttmann had left (and cursed) Benfica the previous year in a dispute over his bonus for leading them to successive European titles. Under Fernando Riera, their football remained of the old school, attacking and inidualistic. Nereo Rocco’s Milan played a form of catenaccio and it was the mentality that underlay this that led him to pick the 30-year-old Pivatelli rather than Paolo Barison, who had scored six goals in their run to the final. Pivatelli’s job was to mark Mário Coluna, Benfica’s left-half and playmaker. It was an overtly negative move. “He had practical intelligence, common sense and was extremely intuitive,” said the forward Gianni Rivera. “He always knew where the least expected danger would come from.”Eusébio put Benfica ahead after 18 minutes. José Altafini levelled 13 minutes after the break. A minute after that came the decisive moment. Coluna intercepted a Pivatelli pass inside his own half and advanced. Space was opening up. If he’d been able to play the pass, Benfica would have been three on two. But he wasn’t allowed to. Pivatelli closed in, clipped his back leg and brought him down. The attack was thwarted, but worse than that, Coluna had broken a bone in his foot and was forced off. In the days before substitutes it was a decisive blow. Coluna did hobble back on with 10 minutes remaining but it was a gesture, no more. Altafini had added his second 11 minutes after his first, and Milan won 2-1.On the 24th anniversary of the final, RAI, the Italian state broadcaster, gathered Coluna, the Milan captain that day, Cesare Maldini, and the journalist Gianni Minà in a studio to watch the game again. “Awful challenge, eh?” Minà said after the foul, before broaching directly the suspicion that has always lingered. “Lads, after 24 years, can we say whether that foul was ordered or not?”Maldini was adamant: “Absolutely not. Clearly it was a foul, but ...”Coluna, agitated, silenced him with a wave of the hand, pointing at the screen. “Look how far away the ball is,” he said, through an interpreter. “Pivatelli got nowhere near it!”The truth is the foul was cynical rather than malicious. It was late and clearly designed to bring the counter to an end, but it wasn’t the sort of crunching foul that characterised football in the sixties. And besides, if Pivatelli had been acting under instruction to crock Coluna, why wait until nearly an hour had been played? Nonetheless, as Minà acknowledged, the foul settled the game. Catenaccio had been validated as a style of play that could win the biggest European trophies.The age of innocence, of Real Madrid and Benfica and all-out attack, of finals that finished 4-3 and 7-3 and 5-3 was over. Rocco – and two of the same players, Giovanni Trapattoni and Rivera – added a second European crown six years later. Inter, with their version of catenaccio, won the European Cup in 1964 and 1965, as well as reaching the semi-finals in 1966 and the final in 1967. Pivatelli’s foul, symbolically at least, had been the moment when the Italians and defensive pragmatism took over.For the full-back, it was the first major turning point in his life. He gave up his dreams of being a player and decided to become a coach, to put into practice his belief that there shouldn’t be just one playmaker but that every player in the team should be a protagonist. It took a long time, but Arrigo Sacchi did become a coach. Twenty years later he took charge of Parma and, after his then Serie B side beat Milan in the 1986‑87 Coppa Italia, he was made manager of the Rossoneri. Within three years Milan had won two more European Cups and, more than that, their hard pressing style had redefined Italian football.What if Pivatelli hadn’t been so decisive? What if Sacchi had hung on playing low-level amateur football? There were many other factors in Milan’s late-80s rise under the presidency of Silvio Berlusconi, but that detail was critical. Pivatelli, with a foul and some straight words to a teenager, incidents a little over a year apart, twice transformed the history of the club. Plans are important but, sometimes, stuff just happens."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/587e470b72dea05a180d93d7c13cdfe1a1262dfb/0_94_3000_1800/master/3000..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39d1b3dde96b32b4c61f2923c7df4c20","title":"small talk and ready made sandwiches things i dont miss about normal life","story":"I’ve been thinking about Nora Ephron’s lists, not because I’m dying, but because normal life has, for now, died for all of usI’ve been reading a lot of Nora Ephron recently because, well, who needs a reason? Although in this case, there is one. I miss spending time with my friends – in person, that is, as opposed to through a screen. My friends are, in the vast main, funny and smart women, and in the absence of meeting up with them in the pub or park, I get into bed every night with Ephron, the smartest, funniest and most female writer of all, who wrote just as brilliantly about feminist politics as she did about her frustration that her breasts weren’t bigger. (Honestly, Nora, the breast thing? It’s overrated.)When Ephron died in 2012, obituarists were spoiled for choice about which of her writings to quote: a pithy line from Heartburn, her novel about her orce, or an irresistible bit from When Harry Met Sally, which is every single line of that film. (“A Sheldon can do your taxes. If you need a root canal, Sheldon’s your man. But humping and pumping is not Sheldon’s strong suit.” I have a condition that makes it physically impossible for me to mention WHMS without quoting it.)Yet every journalist who covered her death quoted from the then little-known lists about what she would and wouldn’t miss after she died, from her final book, I Remember Nothing, which she wrote when she and almost no one else knew she was dying. What made those lists so affecting was that they were mainly small things, both specific and entirely relatable, like all of Ephron’s writing. Bras, polls and panels on Women in Film are not currently being missed by Ephron but dinner with friends, fireworks and pie are.I’ve been thinking about those lists, not because I’m dying, but because normal life has, for now, died for all of us. I have gone through the five stages of grief: shock that I am living through a global plague fear for those I love sadness about all the cancelled plans irritation with the lack of online delivery slots delusion that I’ll spend the next three months reading Proust instead of staring at my phone. (A mix of existential terror and petty flouncing sums up my feelings during All This.)I am lucky: no one in my family is sick (yet), but I miss normal life, when I didn’t leap in terror any time someone near me coughed, like a Victorian maiden. And yet, without wishing to seek out a nonexistent silver lining, there have also been things I don’t miss. They are all small things, but it’s only by focusing on the details that life feels manageable right now. Once I start thinking about the macro (my parents, my kids) instead of the micro (cancelled holidays, postponed cinema dates), hello, 3am insomnia.Yoga classes have become much more Zen. Instead of having to schlep to a studio, internally grumping if my favourite spot in the room (front right corner) is taken and then hating the person on the next mat for being so much better, I do online lessons alone in my bedroom. I always get the best spot and I am definitely the best in the room. So much time and internalised fuming saved!When I was pregnant with my twins during a heatwave, I resented the impediments to my physical freedom. But then I realised the upside: no one could give me any grief for having an elective C-section – or hiring six gold-painted men to carry me around on a plinth, should I so desire. Self-isolation has, weirdly, brought a similar release. No longer do I have to feel guilty for not going to this or that play, as I chronically do, even though I hate the theatre because I can never figure out when to eat dinner (Sondheim musicals are the exception). Now I have all the time in the world for dinner. There is a freedom in imprisonment: the essentials take root, the flotsam floats away.Speaking of the essentials, I can exclusively confirm that it is not easy to work with three children under five running around the house. In my lower moments, I have looked at the comparative freedom of my childfree friends with the same envy with which they now look at my garden. But it is lovely to eat three meals a day with my kids, and to see how much they love it, too. Self-isolating with their parents is, I have realised, a small child’s fantasy come to life. (This is possibly less true of teenagers. Turns out my decision to wait to have kids until I was 102 really worked out for the best.)Here, then, is the official list of things I do and do not miss.What I miss The first sip of a cool drink in a dark bar bumping into a friend getting a late cab home and listening to Magic FM booking holidays, especially with friends ice-cream in a cone.What I don’t Small talk feeling guilty about not having people over for dinner cold afternoons in the playground ready-made sandwiches.Yes, small things. But Harry realised he loved Sally when he loved that it took her an hour and a half to order a sandwich. As Ephron understood better than anyone, when life feels overwhelming, it’s the insignificant details that are the most revealing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7179c6294a0f9dc664a12daf691704944ccb4c91/143_0_2351_1411/master/2351.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=485c63b41ae386d86acdcd94bd0649bb","title":"life on ice what esperanza base in antarctica can teach us about isolation","story":"Despite missing friends and celebrations, a community at the bottom of the world has learned to survive, even thriveUntil a month ago, the word “quarantine” conjured up images of someone joking about their bout of the flu, of animals entering our country, or of Sydney’s Q Station, where for 150 years until 1984, migrants suspected of carrying contagious diseases were put into isolation.Quarantine has typically meant isolating people from the wider community it has rarely been applied to the community as a whole. And the prospect can be terrifying.There are communities in the world we could look to for guidance, communities that have been living in isolation and making it work - on a rotating basis - for decades. They exist in natural quarantine, surrounded by lots and lots of ice.There are two scientific research bases in Antarctica that exist as civilian “towns”. There are children, a school, a medical centre and a gym. People can congregate, but supplies are limited. And the rest of the world and loved ones feel far away.One such town is the Argentinian Esperanza Base, with around 60 residents and 10 families, which is sprinkled around Hope Bay, on the tip of the Antarctica peninsula.I was lucky enough to spend some time at Esperanza in late 2016 as part of an Antarctic expedition with tour operator Chimu Adventures. Lately, I have been reflecting on this brush with isolation.After a 14-month stint, the station’s residents were packing up to return to Argentina for Christmas. Sixty new residents were preparing to replace them.There was a pre-holiday buzz in the air, and a sense of pride that comes from having lived more than a year on a slab of rock and ice at the bottom of the world, and having made it work. It’s a sense of achievement that we too will enjoy when we emerge from isolation a few months from now.But first we must endure it. Those who live at Esperanza admit it’s not easy. The base’s motto is “Permanencia, un acto de sacrificio” (“Permanence, an act of sacrifice”). It takes patience, work and planning to make quarantine and isolation a success. Although their circumstances are different – the small community are still able to gather, touch and socialise –there’s much we can take away from how they live. Beginning with one essential ingredient.Esperanza is Spanish for “hope”. The base is named in honour of three Swedish explorers who were stranded here in the harsh southern winter of 1902 after their ship was crushed by ice. They built a shelter of rocks, and after almost a year, they were rescued. Without hope and determination they would have perished.Today’s residents of Hope Bay live in relative comfort. Square little houses are painted bright red (so they can be seen in a blizzard), the school is colourful and creative, and the communal hall, the Casino, is decorated with pride – Argentinian maps and flags and patriotic posters. Creativity brings joy pride offers purpose.There is gas oil for heating (the base uses 250,000 litres of it each year) and a reasonable satellite connection to speak to loved ones back home, or for the kids to play video games against old friends.The pantry is a warehouse of frozen and tinned fare. Esperanza’s chef requires military standards of organisation and some creativity to cook up tasty meals, day after day – like the pizza the entire community shares at the Casino on Saturday nights.It made me realise how much we rely on supermarkets and the convenience of regular shopping. Without them, we use our imagination, we share ideas and we collaborate.Food and fuel from the real world make it possible to live in Antarctica. But, like anywhere, it’s human connection that sustains life.The residents of Esperanza find it incredibly hard to miss big gatherings like birthdays, weddings and funerals to connect regularly with loved ones and old friends. Social media and video-calling can help, but it’s a different kind of connection: distant, remote. No touch.In the quiet of Antarctica, people learn to rejuvenate instead by developing more intimate relationships with their immediate clan – and through nature.Ana, who assisted her husband, Esperanza’s chef, grew to love her new way of life. She told me, “when I need time to myself, I’m feeling sad or I’m missing people back home, I take a walk in the snow and appreciate where I am. When I’m still, I notice how the light on the ice changes every day and throughout the day.”“I could stay another year. I love the landscape, the views, the people, the community.”Which makes me wonder now, is a quieter, simple life, with more time with our close family, and more time appreciating the nature in our own backyard, something we could all get used to, and draw energy from?The base’s deputy, Eric Dorado, had missed little about Argentina during his year on the ice– “just beaches and heat”. An unexpected takeaway was a newfound depth of patience and empathy he’d acquired from living in close quarters for so long.At Esperanza, social problems are solved without delay. “We get together, we talk, we solve them,” he said.It is a lesson those isolating with flatmates or families can learn from. With fewer bodies, personalities seem bigger and emotions stronger. There are days when people want to disappear, be alone, see someone different, be somewhere different. “We cannot have problems on the base. We must be strong and determined and respectful.”Esperanza is a place of harmony – and pride. Despite the isolation, there is unity. Down there on the ice, the residents of Esperanza see their time in quarantine as a rare human experiment: to live, breathe and support each other in an isolated corner of the earth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4dde068b4186c1a94c086736f27a3bb296a748e1/0_0_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6753112009a990ee34d1edf2c2933044","title":"celebrities happy in their own skin dont take it at face value","story":"Hollywood stars are using time in isolation to encourage honesty, but often there is more to ‘no makeup’ than meets the eye At last Hollywood is revealing its unvarnished side. An increasing number of actresses – including Julia Roberts, Julianne Moore and Drew Barrymore – are posting makeup-free selfies while in isolation as they embrace the trend to go bare-faced.But beauty experts warn there is a degree of smoke and mirrors – and politics – at play within the concept of what constitutes “no makeup”.Bunny Kinney, editor-in-chief of magazine Dazed Beauty, said: “It’s a reassuring gesture brought upon by influential women who want to show a fearlessness, a solidarity and an encouragement of all people to celebrate the skin they live in.”But he added: “It’s so easy for audiences to compare themselves to influencers by really taking them only at face value, based on how they are presenting themselves in a highly curated and controlled way without any grasp of what is really going on behind the scenes.”And what is going on “behind the scenes” can be the creation of a bare-faced look that is just as complicated as a fully made-up one.In 2018 a fan reposted a picture of the beauty vlogger Gina Shkeda (885,000 followers) looking makeup free, alongside the hashtag #naturalbeauty. But on Twitter Shkeda rebutted this claim by saying: “Girl, I have micro-bladed brows, lash extensions in and lip injections – I don’t even look like this.”Shkeda’s revelation could have seen her taken apart by trolls and “cancelled”, but instead she was praised. “Generation Z has no time for influencers that aren’t honest and open about who they are,” said Sarah Jindal, associate director of global beauty and personal care at market researcher Mintel.The no-makeup trend, alongside the clean beauty ideology (mindfully created, toxin-free products) is part of the “emotional beauty” movement, which represents a return to the “honesty, authenticity and transparency that have been the hallmarks of Generation Z’s beauty evolution,” said Charlotte Delobelle of forecasting agency Fashion Snoops, who coined the term.The movement arguably began in 2014, when Leandra Medine Cohen wrote a post called Why I Don’t Wear Make Up for her Man Repeller site. It was a treatise of radical self-acceptance. “I am comfortable with how I look,” she wrote. “I don’t hate what I see when I look in the mirror.”When the beauty blogger Kadeeja Khan moved from standard beauty posts to bare-faced images of her struggle with cystic acne, she was praised for promoting skin positivity in all its forms.“It’s important for my audience to understand that if you don’t have the ‘perfect skin or perfect body’ that it’s normal,” she said. “There is no such thing as perfection and it’s important to share that reality with my followers.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2b5569fb97af19c1e2d9cb7da3e2a6f55db3950/0_1813_6192_3715/master/6192.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f899ff28761921270733c21fbcdfc5d3","title":"i gulp back feelings of regret how i found my long lost sibling","story":"Four years ago, I didn’t know my brother existed. Meeting him was like being reunited with an old friend and made me want to speak to other siblings who connected later in life “I’d always wanted a brother,” says Declan Aumpu, the first time we meet. It’s April 2017, and I am 23 years old. Dec, 26, has arrived in the back of a friend’s van after a big night out. He is clearly nervous and has hardly slept. I’m anxious, too.It’s strange that we have never met, especially since so many people know we are half-brothers, and I gulp back feelings of regret and shame. We don’t look much alike, beside our smiles, which curl up on the left-hand side of our mouths, but there is an instant connection an immediate ease in each other’s company. As we embrace outside the Merlin’s Cave pub in Chalfont St Giles, south Buckinghamshire, it’s like being reunited with an old friend.Later, in the pub, Dec tells me he was “forever envious of the bond that brothers seemed to share”, a feeling that only grew when, around the age of eight, he found out about me. He also explains that this is not our first meeting: more than two decades ago, we spontaneously played together with a boules set in a pub garden in nearby Chalfont St Peter, where our parents had grown up. Dec’s mum, Tracey, beckoned him away as soon she realised who I was. I had no idea of the identity of my fleeting playmate. Dec drinks Stella mine is a Guinness. The barman asks who I am, since Dec is a regular here, and Dec proudly says that I’m his brother. Noticing the height difference between us (I’m 6ft 4in and Dec is 5ft 8in), the barman raises an eyebrow and makes a joke about me being put into a grow bag at an early age.I only learned of Dec’s existence relatively recently. When my parents first got together in 1991, my dad, Nick, then 27, told my mother, Mandy, 26, about a rumour going around that he had recently fathered a child he said it wasn’t true, and my mum believed him. Soon afterwards, they moved from Chalfont St Peter to the more affordable town of Fenny Stratford, near Milton Keynes, where they had me and my younger brother, Rory. My mum heard nothing more about this rumour until many years later, when my uncle Andy referred to my dad’s “other son” during a conversation with my aunt Judy she later told my mother.Not wanting to disrupt Rory’s GCSEs, Mum spent the next six months silently seething, before confronting Dad. Clearly regretful and contrite, he eventually told us about our half-brother as we slowly chewed paneer at an Indian buffet in July 2016. He claimed he had been warned to stay away from his baby son after his friendship with Tracey broke down, and that he had duly done so. Tracey has since said she had wanted him to be either a constant presence in Dec’s life, or not present at all, and he had conceded that he was not ready to be a father. I was, and still am, bewildered: the dad I knew had never shied away from truth and responsibility.Once the news had sunk in, I got in touch with Dec, a landscape gardener and builder, on Facebook, and we arranged to meet. We settled on the Merlin’s Cave, where he and my dad had met a handful of times since 2010, after my parents separated and my dad sent Tracey a Facebook friend request. Dec is keen to build a relationship with Dad, but neither of them are very good at texting each other back, never mind socialising or making time for enriching activities. Nor am I.Dec tells me that, growing up in Chalfont St Peter, most people viewed his connection to the Busbys as a matter not to be spoken about. Tracey struggled for money, and they spent time in a homeless hostel before moving to the next village. “I still get called ‘the bastard Busby’ down the pub,” he says. “And at school, there were these girls who would viciously bully me for not having a dad.” This prompted Tracey to tell him that his dad had another family. Then, at the age of eight, Dec was diagnosed with diabetes, and took part in a genetic study through this, he discovered our father’s name, and those of his half-siblings.Dec and I both spent large parts of our childhoods alone he is an only child, while Rory is six years younger than me, and we didn’t really connect until later in life. “If we’d been introduced when we were younger, it would have been a different experience,” Dec says now, three years after that first meeting. “But now you’re my little brother.” We may not see each other regularly, but we find comfort in keeping in touch to discuss our partners, work, family and the coronavirus. Just like brothers would.How does it feel for other siblings united in later life? Almost one in five British families have been touched by estrangement, according to research by the charity Stand Alone, and a million children across the UK have no significant contact with their father. Reenee Singh, a psychotherapist and CEO of the Association of Family Therapy, is clear about the emotional burden associated with this: “It can be very difficult for half-siblings to grow up knowing they have a family somewhere they’re not in contact with,” she says. “If their existence was a secret, it can leave them feeling confused, vulnerable, unprotected and insecure.”However, she warns against rushing into a meeting with an estranged sibling, pointing out that it is better to exchange photos, letters or messages on social media first. In my own case, she says: “You’re old enough to forge your own adult relationship and to bridge the gap between him and your father. The onus is on the siblings who have grown up with both their parents to reach out to their half-siblings.”Reunions aren’t always straightforward, as the 2018 documentary Three Identical Strangers, about triplets separated at birth, tragically showed. Although the three brothers experienced a joyful reunion, followed by fame and success, they all struggled with mental health issues. One of the siblings, Eddy, took his own life in 1995. Meanwhile, plenty of people live their lives never knowing the whole story about their families or how many siblings they have.My meeting with Dec had raised questions for us both, and made me want to speak to other people who had experienced something similar. How had they found their long-lost siblings? Had they been able to reconcile their different upbringings and move beyond pondering what might have been?Sandy, who lives in Petworth, West Sussex, was brought up in Carlisle by his grandparents. His father, Jan, disappeared shortly after he was born, and remarried twice, fathering a number of other children, including Paul. “I wasn’t close with my mum,” Sandy says. “She was more like an aunt to me. As a kid, you feel a sense of abandonment. For about two and a half years from the age of 12, I was a carer for my grandmother when my grandfather was at work.”When he was 18, Sandy visited Jan and his family in south Wales, to work out whether he should invite him to his wedding. It was during this visit that he discovered he had two younger siblings, Paul and Chantelle. But according to Paul, his parents told him that Sandy’s visit – during which he was told to stay upstairs – had been to ask for money. Further attempts to talk to his parents about his half-brother were quickly shut down. This may explain why, when Sandy tried to make contact with Paul 15 years ago, his friend request on Facebook was rejected. Paul says he simply wasn’t ready for another sibling, to share his father, or to grapple with his family’s past.Two years later, when Sandy was 40, and he and his wife were expecting their first child, he made a fresh attempt to get to know his half-siblings, first making contact with Chantelle. “We met up in Ireland and got on well,” Sandy says. Then, in 2018, when looking for other Buseks online, he happened to send a friend request to Lucy, Paul’s daughter, not realising she was his niece. “She printed a photo of me from Facebook and shoved it under his nose,” Sandy says.“My wife was gobsmacked,” Paul recalls. “I wouldn’t say we look like twins, but we are very similar. I felt driven to meet him because we clearly shared DNA.” In September 2018, Paul contacted Sandy on LinkedIn. They didn’t waste any time: three weeks later, Sandy flew to Bahrain to meet Paul, who works for a defence company in Saudi Arabia. According to Paul, the half-brothers got along “like a house on fire”, and later he and his family visited Sandy in the UK. “You don’t realise you’ve got space for another sibling, but when one turns up it’s like, ‘OK, yeah, this is great’,” Paul says.They noticed a number of coincidences. Sandy is teetotal, and Paul rarely drinks. They both enjoy luxury cars and clay pigeon shooting. Both brothers are 6ft 1in, weigh 105kg, and wear near-identical spectacles. They also have a similar fashion sense on the day they met for the first time, both were dressed in blue-and-white striped polo shirts. “We look so similar,” Paul says. “Incredibly similar bad taste, too.”“It’s spooky how many similarities there are,” Sandy agrees. “But there are differences, too: I was wrapped up in cotton wool by my grandparents, while he’s more of an alpha male after 26 years in the military.”Paul says: “I think he’s probably a nicer guy than me. He’s a bit more placid, more level-headed, but that might be the different nurturing he had from his side: I lived with our old man, he didn’t. He’s starting to see a less polished side to me as I open up.” Then he jokes: “I think he gets insanely jealous that I’m better-looking.”Although Sandy wishes he had grown up closer to his parents and half-siblings, he remains pragmatic. “I don’t sit here thinking life could’ve been so much better, but I have got some catching up to do.” This will become easier now that Paul’s family are planning a move from the Middle East to nearby Midhurst in West Sussex. “We didn’t know that part of the country, but when we visited Sandy we thought, ‘Bloody hell, we like it here’,” Paul says. “Whenever I’m back in the UK, my priority is to see my family and kids – and my brother.”Dougie grew up in Edinburgh in the 1950s, and never felt a sense of belonging. He remembers his stepfather, who had his own children, being unkind to him and his sister, not allowing them to celebrate their birthdays. When Dougie discovered his real surname at the age of 11, after it was read out from his birth certificate during his communion, he began asking questions. “But I was always told to shut up.”Then, one night, an aunt “spilled the beans”. He remembers learning that his mother had left his Irish father, Hugh, without explanation, in the early stages of her pregnancy with Dougie, not telling him she was bearing a child. “After that, it was always on my mind,” he says. “I had known from a young age there was something different about me, but if I asked it was, ‘lift the carpet, sweep it under’.”Dougie left home at 15 and moved to Ireland to work in construction in 1972. He didn’t start looking for his family in earnest until 2009, when he was made redundant. With his daughter, Katrina, Dougie began to do his research. They learned that, after the war, Hugh had worked in coal mines in Derbyshire Katrina tracked down his details from a list of workers from the period. “I was rattling, shaking, thinking, ‘What am I going to do now?’” Dougie says. By then, Hugh was seriously ill: he ignored their letters and denied the connection over the phone. Eventually he relented, asking if Katrina could send some pictures.Three months later, Hugh invited Dougie and his wife, Sally, to visit him in Derbyshire. Jo, Dougie’s half-sister, remembers opening the door to them in September 2012: “I looked at this poor, very nervous man who looked like he could have been my dad’s brother and said: ‘We couldn’t disown you,’” she says now. “He was one of us, for sure.”Dougie, who now lives in Kildare, south-west of Dublin, says he felt intense relief. “I went, ‘That’s it: mission accomplished.’ The first thing Jo told me was: ‘The apple hasn’t fallen far from the tree.’”Jo, who also lives in Ireland, had only found out about Dougie an hour before meeting him. “I was in England on work business and went to visit my dad,” she recalls. “He kept saying things like, ‘Ach, some fella from Scotland wants to come and see me.’ But just before he arrived, he said: ‘He says I could be his father.’”Dougie never found out what sparked his mother’s sudden flight. “I never asked any awkward questions,” he says. “I wasn’t going to go in bull-headedly. I set out to find him, and when I did, there was an ease there. There was no resentment.” Dougie continued to speak to his father regularly on the phone and, after he died in November 2017, kept in contact with Jo, who lives three hours north of him in Donegal. Now their families spend holidays together. “We’re brothers and sisters,” he says. “It feels like we’ve known each other for years, since birth. I couldn’t ask for anything better.” At family events, Dougie is often confused with his father. Five years ago, at a funeral, a cousin gasped in horror, thinking she had seen a ghost. Last summer, Jo arranged for Dougie and Sally to join her on a trip in their father’s home county of Donegal, to scatter Hugh’s ashes. Dougie did the honours: “I broke down,” he says. “I thought I would never get to that stage. The whole trip brought me closer to my roots.”“We’re really close now,” Jo says. “He’s definitely part of the family.” The spare room is now known as Dougie and Sally’s room, and they bought each other almost identical gifts for Christmas – shortbread biscuits in packaging featuring Highland terriers. “It’s really bizarre, the connection we have.”Peggy’s identity crisis began the moment she was born, in Brixton, south London, in 1959. Peggy is mixed race, but her mother and the man who thought he had fathered her were white. Her birth caused shockwaves, and her mother suddenly disappeared from her life when she was two weeks old. She also left behind Peggy’s half-sister, Linda, with whom she shared a cot.Peggy was put into an orphanage, and moved around the UK by the authorities, eventually ending up in a foster home at the age of 13. “Growing up, I was always told I was Jamaican,” she says. “But it was being an orphan that defined me. People would tell me I didn’t have the nose to be African-Caribbean. I felt my whole life that I didn’t belong. People had minimal expectations of me, and called me ‘half-caste’.” She went on to suffer from dissociative disorders, and struggled with drug misuse, self-harm and bulimia.She met her husband, and had two daughters with him, but Peggy says he was abusive and she continued to struggle. “Every time something happened to my daughter, if she fell down or hurt herself, my subconscious returned to how I was never cuddled when I was younger.”She remembers being in her early 30s and hearing a radio interview with John Cleese about Families And How To Survive Them, the bestselling self-help book he co-authored with therapist Robin Skynner in 1983. The interview referenced an experiment in which people who know nothing about each other have to decide who to pair up with for an activity. “The two people who have not grown up with their family always go together,” Peggy says. “I recognised myself in this: I have lots of friends, but I still keep myself slightly separated. I just started crying.”Peggy decided she needed to track down her family. Years before, on her 18th birthday, the Church of England had given her a piece of paper with her parents’ and siblings’ names on. In 1998, with the help of the Salvation Army, she found her elder half-brother Jack, who had grown up with his father, and away from their shared mother. But she could not find Linda, nor her eldest half-sister, Angela, who had been adopted. After her marriage unravelled, Peggy moved with her girls to the US in 2002, where she felt more at home. In 2009, she received a message on the family history site Ancestry from Mark, the husband of a 51-year-old Linda Sturman, asking her to confirm her name and date of birth. “He said, ‘I’m Mark, and I think I’m married to your sister.’ I cried all weekend.”The contact came after Linda’s father had unexpectedly told his family about Peggy and Angela, over Sunday lunch, before his death. “It was a shock,” Linda says. “I said I needed to go home and process everything, and then I tried to find my sisters. I looked at the birth registrations in Brixton, and found them.” Peggy describes their first meeting, over a meal in Twickenham, south-west London, as being “like two pieces of a jigsaw coming together”.Angela, now 63, and the eldest of the three sisters, was also there, thanks to Mark’s detective work. She had been adopted as a child due to her parents’ chaotic lives, and given another surname. She was living in Hastings, unaware that her family were looking for her.“I’d always thought I could be walking down the streets past my sister or my brother,” Peggy says. “But this was for real, and we just fitted. There was none of the baggage other people have – no, ‘You did this to me when we were 12’.”Peggy has stayed close to Linda. All four siblings meet up in Gorleston-on-Sea, where Linda lives, whenever Peggy is back in the UK. “Linda and I both have mild depression,” Peggy says. “We don’t carry it around like a bad energy, but stuff happens that takes you back, and we’ll give each other pep talks. We hold each other up.” Linda also had a difficult upbringing: although she remained with her birth father, she never heard from her mother again. She says her father would often leave her in the care of friends while he was away working as a lorry driver. “We have a good bond,” Linda says. “I feel as if I’ve known her for ever. We have different surnames, so it would have been impossible to find one another without modern technology.” With the help of Mark, a keen amateur genealogist who trawled old newspapers and records to build a family tree, Peggy discovered that her father, Henwood Adrian, was actually from Guyana, and that she also has Congolese and Nigerian ancestry. “It has given me an identity and a sense of pride,” Peggy says. “Being mixed race, people ask you: ‘Where are you from?’, ‘What’s your heritage?’. It’s nice not to have to lie or make something up.”Peggy says it is only since meeting Linda, and the rest of her maternal family, that she has finally begun to overcome her pervading sense that she doesn’t belong. “It’s a gift that as an orphan you would fantasise about,” Peggy says. “You dream about being in a family, as a unit. After I connected with them, it all clicked – I started to heal.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdbe87ad9a2e1f51b1df0fd96ab949c04efa9425/0_0_3600_2160/master/3600..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1eeb91429925a642a5da2eeaa9ccb94","title":"this much i know jameela jamil","story":"The presenter, 34, on using her platform, agitating for change and why she’s happy to learn when she gets it wrongIt made me a more thoughtful, peaceful person, as well as hyper-observant. I can read people’s body language, which has heightened my ability to make good decisions. Growing up with a disability also makes you obsessed with control, so I’ve never even tried alcohol, even though it seems like I’m drunk on Twitter.I decided to absolve myself of shame before I turned 30. My therapist said: “A doormat is already lying down – that’s why people wipe their feet all over it!” That changed the course of my life. It was empowering for me to realise that there might be a way for me to change how people interact with me. Projecting a lack of give-a-fucks has meant fewer people fuck with me.I’ve been saying how I feel on the internet for 10 years, but I never had a big following, so I was never able to do much harm – or much good. Out of nowhere, I now have more than 4 million people at my fingertips. After a decade of people not really listening to you, you’re not prepared for that responsibility. I have learned to be much more careful when calling someone out, especially if that person is already at a disadvantage.I think I’m less annoying in person than I am on Twitter. I live online as a provocateur. Sometimes you have to say things that are going to piss people off in order to create discussion. I’m outrageous about abortion. I say things that might come across as insensitive so that thousands of people join a conversation. That’s not to defend all my insensitivity. Sometimes I genuinely get it wrong.The worst I feel is when someone has misconstrued my tone, or I’ve misrepresented myself, and I’ve hurt a group of people by mistake. That burns me to my core. I can’t sleep and I can’t eat. I recently criticised a rapper on Twitter for talking about doing a water fast, not knowing that she was mentally ill. I should have known better to send any kind of negativity her way. I felt gutted and embarrassed and very sorry.I’m happy to be called out. I don’t mind learning in public. I’ve become a better person for it. What I find frustrating is that when you admit you were wrong people seem to attack you more. When I apologise there’s a hysteria of bullying. We’re so unaccustomed to dealing with humility, you sometimes get treated worse than if you say nothing. There’s no accountability, and no opportunity to learn – it really halts evolution. It’s not a weakness to apologise.Once people get an appetite for you, suddenly the industry envelops you and boosts you. People write about you as if you are a saint, the saviour of humanity. They build you up to a point where the expectation of you isn’t sustainable. You can’t maintain that standard, which you never actually professed to have. It’s stressful for female celebrities.There’s a particular vitriol towards women with money. We can handle men living lavish lifestyles, but when a woman does the same thing we drag her down for how gaudy she is. You can see the beginnings of it with Phoebe Waller-Bridge. As soon as she signed that $20m deal with Amazon, people suddenly started to bring up her privilege, even though we’ve known about that from the beginning – she’s got a double-barrelled name!I’m not very interested in other people’s opinions of me. That’s liberating. I feel like I haven’t seen enough change over the course of my life. As I’ve grown older, I’ve become more aggressive, because nothing is moving fast enough. I can’t just sit here and wish for the best any more. The fact that I’ve got the privilege of a platform means I have a real chance to at least do something.

Here’s what you need to knowWorkers laid off due to the coronavirus crisis and applying for universal credit for the first time may be surprised to learn how little it pays and how difficult the process can be.That was the stark warning from benefits experts this week as many people embark on their first ever benefits claim.More than 1 million people have applied for universal credit in the past month. The result has been huge waits to talk to benefits staff on the phone. So if you are about to claim for the first time, how do you do it, and what can you expect?Anna Stevenson, a welfare and benefits specialist at the financial charity Turn2Us, says the first thing new claimants need to do is to assemble all their financial data, and then use a benefits calculator – there is one on the Turn2us website – which will give a good indication of the sum payable.While people do not need a national insurance number to claim, details of rent and any outstanding earnings and mortgage costs will be required.The biggest bar to many will be the fact that anyone with savings of £16,000 or more is not eligible to make a claim. They can only apply for jobseeker’s allowance (JSA) of £74.35 a week, and will receive no help with their rent.All applicants are expected to file their claim online, or via the helpline. At the start, claimants must verify their identity – so have your passport or driving licence to hand.One of the big stumbling blocks has been that large numbers of claimants have been unable to do this online, often because they moved house recently or because some of their documents do not match up. It has lead to reports of people spending many hours on hold. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said this week it aimed to have a simpler ID system in place in the next few days.Once over that hurdle, applicants must input details of any income they are yet to be paid, any savings they have, the income of other members of their household (spouse or partner plus any adult children), and their housing costs, such as rent or outstanding mortgage.Problems can arise when trying to make an appointment to have the claim processed, says Stevenson. “Universal credit claimants have to make this appointment within 30 days of completing their applications and, for the claim to be approved, the interview must happen. Previously, this took place at the jobcentre but this is now being done over the phone. Again, people have been reporting that it is impossible to get through.”The DWP accepts there have been long waiting times, and said on Thursday it was ending the need to call up. Instead, it said, its staff will be “proactively calling claimants if they need to check any of the information provided as part of the claim, as well as messaging them on their online journal to confirm details”.It is difficult to generalise as each person’s calculation is based on their household income, how much rent they pay, number of children etc – see the scenarios below.However, a single person over 25 will receive £410 a month, or about £94 a week basic benefit, provided they have no other income.An unemployed couple on universal credit will receive £594 a month. If they have two children they will be paid a further £516 a month, provided the first child was born before April 2017.Claimants are also entitled to help with their council tax, although again this will not always cover the full amount. This has to be claimed direct from your local council.Universal credit is paid monthly in arrears and there is a five- to six-week wait for the payments to start. Those needing money immediately can claim an interest-free loan called an Advance within the first month, three days after filing the claim.Local authorities can sometimes help bridge the gap between the sum offered by universal credit to pay rent and the actual rent paid, known as discretionary housing payments. There is a limited amount of money available, so councils usually give preference to applications showing the greatest need.Yes. Dan Rust, a benefits expert at Turquoise Training, says universal credit is also there to help workers whose hours and income have been reduced as a result of a partial shutdown.“If you are getting statutory sick pay because you are self-isolating, or if you are doing fewer hours at work, you should claim universal credit to top up your income,” he says.Yes, and you should, even if you expect help to come from the government’s self-employed scheme. The government has also removed the floor on earnings that it previously used to limit payouts to those earning below the minimum wage from their self-employment.Family with both parents working, but one has lost incomeA manager is laid off after the owner shut his restaurant. He is 35 and married to a nurse who earns £24,000 a year. They have two children, aged nine and seven, and a £600-per-month mortgage. They have savings of £8,000.The nurse will still receive her net pay of £1,663, while he will get universal credit payments of £351 per month, or £81 a week. But any help with the mortgage will come only after nine months of not working. Self-employed freelance worker, lost nearly all earningsA freelance (self-employed) camera operator who used to make films at Pinewood Studios still receives £150 a month in royalties, but all other work has dried up. He lives alone in a rented two-bedroom house in St Albans, for which he pays £1,400 a month.He will receive only £798 towards his housing costs and a total universal credit payment of £1,058 per month. But this leaves him with a total income significantly less than his rent.Self-employed consultant, 55, lost all earnings but has savingsA self-employed management consultant now has no work. He has paid off his mortgage and he and his wife have Isa savings of £60,000.Unfortunately, he is not entitled to any help. Their savings are too high to apply for universal credit, and he is not eligible for JSA, because he is self-employed. Had he been an employee, he would have got £74.35 a week JSA.Single person, 22, lost pub job and has moved back in with parentsThis person had a short-term contract but has been laid off from his job in a pub, and has no income. He does not pay rent to his parents, so will receive the basic £343 a month.He has no work, while she earns £1,100 a month net. They have three children aged six, nine and 11.

She released her debut album, Alas, I Cannot Swim, the week of her 18th birthday. Recipient of a Brit award for best British female solo artist in 2011, she has also received nominations for three Mercury prizes and a best folk album Grammy (for her last album, 2017’s Semper Femina). As a gesture of solidarity to locked-down music fans, Marling brought forward the release of her seventh LP, Song for Our Daughter, from late summer. It was released on Friday on ChrysalisPartisan.I saw this with a friend in Soho a few months ago and it absolutely sucker-punched me. I’m still thinking about it now. I didn’t know Louisa May Alcott’s book when I was younger, but I’m the youngest of three sisters, and we used to watch the 1994 film version, starring Winona Ryder, all the time. I wanted to be Jo, of course. We all do! This version brings what happens to Beth to the beginning, and it had me crying from the second minute, all the way through. Greta Gerwig is a fantastic director. She should have won an Oscar.Are You My Mother? A Comic Drama by Alison BechdelAlison Bechdel’s such a brilliant comic book artist. This book’s about her relationship with her mother, and her discovery of the work of the English psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott, who wrote a lot about parenting and children’s development. Bechdel weaves memoir together with snippets of Winnicott’s essays and his biography, which interests me because I’ve been studying for a part-time masters degree in psychoanalysis myself since last summer. I’ve also been under psychoanalysis, and I love how it helps me write, and can be applied to so many things.Where Should We Begin? by Esther PerelWhen I first heard Esther Perel, on another podcast, I thought she was fantastic. She’s sassy and authoritative in a way that I find very appealing. She doesn’t tolerate bullshit. On this podcast, anonymous couples come in, and you think they’re in obvious situations, but what happens next always goes beyond that. I find it fascinating that there are a lot of queer or non-binary couples on it, and the issues they discuss always transcend gender and sexual identity. Perel reduces everyone to their childish needs, and shows how sensitive and vulnerable we all really are. We’re all still little children, really!I decided that re-watching all nine seasons of Seinfeld would be the best thing to do during lockdown. Friends has aged terribly, and I briefly considered revisiting The Sopranos, but decided it would be too much for my brain. I missed Seinfeld the first time round because I was too young, but as my sisters are eight and 10 years older than me, I remember them recording and rewinding bits of it on VHS, and sharing one-liners. My favourite episode’s the one where they all have a competition to see who can go longest without masturbating (The Contest). I could watch Julia-Louis Dreyfus all day.Big Thief were one of the few bands I saw in the past few months and they’re so good at it. There’s something timeless, but also uncanny, about their music to me. It’s like they’re a band from the 1990s – they have this holey, baggy-jeans feel about them – but you can tell they’ve played together for enough hours, as the rule goes, to make them geniuses, too. Adrianne Lenker is an astonishing lyricist. One of my favourite lines of hers is from Shark Smile from a few years ago: “Evelyn’s kiss was oxygen I leaned over to take it in”. Their new album, Two Hands, is fantastic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/691adb7fe1edf017c552fae78ab21d2f4c5387fd/0_389_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b374fc19eba72328472d74baebd1a607","title":"call for super rich to donate more to tackle coronavirus pandemic","story":"While some billionaires have pledged vast chunks of their wealth others have been criticised for not giving enough, or even at allThe world’s richest people are being urged to urgently donate big chunks of their fortunes to the global effort to tackle the coronavirus pandemic, and help millions of people across the globe whose lives have been thrown into crisis by Covid-19.Some billionaires – including Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey – have committed huge amounts of their money to fund solutions to the unfolding crisis.But other members of the wealthy elite have been criticised for pledging only small fractions – if any - of their fortunes to address the worst-ever global health emergency, which is set to trigger an economic crisis on the scale of the 1930s Great Depression.Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon and the world’s richest person, has donated $100m (£80m) to food bank charity Feeding America. The charity, which runs a network of about 200 food banks, said Bezos’s donation was the biggest it had ever received, and “countless lives will be changed because of his generosity”.Amazon is also pumping $25m into an “Amazon Relief Fund” to support delivery drivers and “seasonal employees under financial distress”.Fran Perrin, a daughter of supermarket heir and philanthropist Lord Sainsbury, said now was the time for billionaires such as Bezos to start “giving back to society in the biggest way possible”.“Why wouldn’t you want to give more,” Perrin said of other very wealthy people. “I think people in a position to be able to, should give as much as they can. I think that’s perfectly reasonable.”Perrin, who has committed to giving away all of the Sainsbury’s fortune she inherited, this week pledged £2.5m emergency funding to help people struggling with the economic fallout of the lockdown. The extra money has been provided via her Indigo Trust charity, to which she had already donated £10m.“We are currently in a national emergency to which charities and wealthy iniduals need to immediately respond and play their part,” Perrin said. “There is a huge, huge need for funds to support people and demand will only grow. It’s a perfect storm.”Luke Hildyard, who campaigns against excessive executive remuneration at the High Pay Centre, said all donations should be welcome, but he added: “Very generous inidual grants can obscure the fact that on the whole, wealthy people’s charitable giving is pretty minimal. Indeed, studies show that poor people donate more than rich, as a proportion of their income.”Perrin said she would like to tell reluctant billionaires that helping to solve the world’s problems could be “the most rewarding challenge you’ve ever faced”.Her message, she said, would be: “You have a skillset that has made all this money. Now imagine what you could do if you turned those skills to solving the world’s problems. This may be the biggest contribution you can make to the world. Give yourself the gift of knowing you did everything you could.”The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has pledged an immediate $100m towards detection, isolation and vaccine development. Gates has said he is prepared to spend billions in the longer term to develop and produce a vaccine. “It’ll be a few billion dollars we’ll waste on manufacturing for the constructs that don’t get picked because something else is better,” Gates said on The Daily Show. “But a few billion in this, the situation we’re in, where there’s trillions of dollars ... being lost economically, it is worth it.”Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook founder, has committed $30m to the Gates Foundation and Wellcome Trust’s joint research project, the Covid-19 Therapeutics Accelerator. Zuckerberg has an estimated $67bn fortune.Jack Ma, China’s richest person, has pledged 100m yuan ($14.5m) to “support the development of a coronavirus vaccine”. Ma has an estimated $44bn fortune.Hans Rausing, grandson of the Swedish founder of Tetra Pak, has donated £16.5m to charities and other groups supporting the NHS.George Soros, the multibillionaire former hedge fund manager and philanthropist, has pledged €2m to support the “unprecedented emergency” in Milan and his native Hungary. “I was born in Budapest, in the middle of the Great Depression,” Soros said in a statement. “I lived through world war two, the Arrow Cross rule, and the siege in the city. I remember what it is like to live in extreme circumstances.”Madonna has donated $1m to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, to help in the creation of a vaccine.George and Amal Clooney have pledged $1m (£803,000) to six coronavirus causes including the NHS, relief charities in the Lombardy region of Italy and Lebanese food banks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/957ec811a3f8ef06ac2eb6073873ac5bb2d6a005/73_0_1925_1156/master/1925.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6adee6420fb95dff3d6ae9f5fe0159a6","title":"astronauts return iss space station coronavirus","story":"Two Nasa astronauts expect a difficult return to a drastically changed world next week, after close to a year onboard the International Space Station.Andrew Morgan told reporters the ISS crew had tried to keep abreast of news regarding the coronavirus pandemic, but it was hard to comprehend what was really going on and what to expect when his nine-month mission ends next Friday.“It is quite surreal for us to see this whole situation unfolding on the planet below,” said Jessica Meir, who last year took part in the first all-female spacewalk.“We can tell you that the Earth still looks just as stunning as always from up here, so it’s difficult to believe all the changes that have taken place since both of us have been up here.”As an emergency physician in the army, Morgan said he feels a little guilty coming back midway through the medical crisis.“It’s very hard to fathom,” Morgan said.Meir said it would be difficult not being able to hug family and friends after seven months off the planet. She expects to feel even more isolated on Earth than in space.“We’re so busy with so many other amazing pursuits and we have this incredible vantage point of the Earth below, that we don’t really feel as much of that isolation,“ Meir said.“So we’ll see how it goes and how I adjust. But it will, of course, be wonderful to see some family and friends, at least virtually and from a distance for now.”Morgan flew to the space station last July, and Meir last September.

After four years without a drive she grasped her chance in the all-female W Series with unbridled verve. However, with her career resurgent the opportunity to build on her success has been wrenched away by the coronavirus-induced sporting shutdown. It has struck Powell as a body blow. “The thought of having another year not racing is pretty gutting,” she says bluntly.Powell fears there may be no racing this year but is emphatic that if that is necessary to defeat the virus, then every sport must take it on the chin. “My other half thinks that we might not go racing at all,” she says. “I say: ‘Don’t be silly,’ but in the back of my mind I think he could be right. That is really upsetting because last year was my time back racing after being out for a long time.”After lack of funding forced her out of racing to the extent that she believed her career was all but over, last year Powell finished the inaugural W Series on a high. The 27-year-old from Oxford won the final round at Brands Hatch and was third in the championship. Her performances caught the attention, new seats opened up and another season in the W Series beckoned. But the promise of 2020 lies in tatters and the outbreak may yet finish it off.It has clearly been a major disappointment and she admits to finding the situation depressing, but there is no pause as Powell immediately acknowledges the bigger picture. “If it means we can fight the virus, stop it from spreading, prevent illness and deaths then of course we should not go racing,” she says.“People’s health is much more important. Clearly, there are far more important things in the world than us getting back in a car.“When races started to get cancelled it really hit home. But it is absolutely the right decision. You can put so many lives at risk and we need to stop this spreading. The number of people at a racetrack, hundreds and thousands of people, you can’t keep social distance at a racetrack. So it is the right thing to do.”The W Series is no exception to the sporting lockdown. The DTM – the German touring car championship – to which it is a support series has postponed its opening three meetings and discussions are continuing on if and when they may begin racing. Two W Series rounds were due to take place at Formula One meetings this year, in the US and Mexico, a real step forward that is now in jeopardy.Last year’s inaugural season offered female drivers the chance to compete in F3 cars for a championship where the series covered all the costs, the intent being to promote their talent and help their careers move forward. For Powell it worked handsomely: she became one of several competitors whose subsequent success comprehensively proved the series is making a difference.Before the end of the season Powell was offered a drive in the US in the IMSA sports car championship. That was followed by a contract for a full-time seat in the Jaguar I-pace eTrophy series that supports Formula E meetings. Before its calendar also came to halt Powell had made her mark, with two podium finishes helping her to third in the standings, while in February she was given a shot in the Formula E rookie test for Envision Virgin Racing.“My name wasn’t out there, when I wasn’t racing,” she says. “People started to forget about me, I hadn’t been around, then the W Series came along and the attraction of interest from around the world was incredible. That surely had to help. Without the W Series I probably wouldn’t have had the drives.”Powell has been racing since she was eight. Her talent was recognised early yet despite success across a range of championships including GP3, she did not receive backing and as the money dried up so did the opportunities for her to compete.She continued as a racing coach but was working with her father in house renovations when the W Series offered her a second chance. It was a life-changing moment, brought home recently in a moment of quiet reflection during the lockdown. “I was looking back through photos on my phone,” she says. “I have lots of photos of my dog and that kind of stuff and then it hit January last year and it’s just all racing.”Powell is as engaging and enthusiastic as she is sharp and competitive on the track. That racing is everything to her is unmistakable: it is a passion to which she is wholly committed. She feels its absence almost as a physical loss, yet accepts with an admirably calm stoicism that under the current circumstances even another year out would be a small price to pay.“We love our sport so much,” she says. “That I don’t know when I will next be in a car again brings me back to when I was not racing and that sinking feeling inside that I don’t know when it is next going to be, its horrible.“But the health of everybody is far more important. More important than racing. More important than sport.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/492dd60e27404b1519a9c84338ac47a54e7f8ebc/0_169_2036_1221/master/2036.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d6036abfcf8f1cdaef4a310acd8ba27","title":"my favourite game australia v england fifth ashes test sydney 2003","story":" The Test was a dead rubber but it was cricket at its most compelling and signified England’s greatness to comeThe dead-rubber England victory was something of a ritual during Australia’s long Ashes supremacy from 1989-2005, a feelgood finale signifying little. Think Phil Tufnell at the Oval in 1997, or Dean Headley at the MCG 16 months later – jaunty cameos with no wider meaning.Sydney 2003 was different. Not just because it was Test cricket at its most compelling - close, fluctuating, full of subplots - but also because it signified a stirring in England’s cricketing mood, among us travelling thousands and in a team performance portending greater things to come. The road to 2005 began here. The bare facts are that England won the fifth Test by 225 runs, denying Australia a historic 5-0 whitewash and salvaging something from another catastrophic Ashes tour. But they don’t indicate just how tight this match was until its closing stages, nor how important it felt. Australia’s fans were desperate for the hitherto elusive 5-0, England’s – who had spent the preceding weeks revelling in noisy self-deprecation – yearning for some reward from a long, expensive trip. And to attend all five days of such a match is to lose yourself totally in the game’s rhythms and dramas.Sydney 2003 was about two batsmen above all: Michael Vaughan and Steve Waugh – one the coming man, the other a legend in his final Ashes Test. First Waugh: when the Australia captain came to the crease on the second afternoon, his side were in bother – 56 for three in response to a rare decent England first-innings total of 362, adorned by a hundred from Mark Butcher and handy half-centuries from Nasser Hussain and Alec Stewart. England were up for this.But so was Waugh, under pressure after an indifferent personal run. From the start he batted as if a century was predestined, playing with a style and swagger more reminiscent of his brother, Mark, than his usual nuggety self. A style and swagger reminiscent, in fact, of his very first Ashes innings - a big hundred at Headingley in 1989. He reprised that style for his last.Day two had its fairytale ending after Waugh had motored to 98 before the final ball of the day, Gilchrist at the other end having joined him at 150 for five for a swashbuckling partnership worth 83 at that point. The off-spinner Richard Dawson delivered it, outside off stump, and Waugh clobbered it square on the offside to the boundary, provoking frenzied celebrations from the home supporters who remained in the ground after stumps, chanting his name.The following day it was Vaughan’s turn. The match was deliciously poised after Australia were bowled out for 363 to lead by one run. Vaughan was enjoying perhaps the most stellar run of form of any England batsman this century, having compiled four daddy Test hundreds in the past five months. His fifth, here, was the pick of them all, albeit against an Australian attack shorn of Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath through injury. Few players of his generation could drive so beautifully as Vaughan in his prime and he took victory away from Australia in one afternoon. He eventually fell for 183 the following day to a dubious lbw, comfortably the top-scorer of the series.Their tails up, England got into Australia from the start as the hosts chased 451, fourth-innings specialist Andy Caddick leading the charge, taking two of three early wickets. But Australia rallied to 91 for three at the close, leaving victory by no means a given.Our fears were unfounded. Caddick zipped into life again, ending with seven wickets as Australia were skittled for 225.Caddick didn’t play for England again other key contributors here – Hussain, Butcher and Stewart – never played another Ashes Test. But Vaughan had made himself the inevitable choice to replace Hussain as captain the following summer and the seeds of recovery symbolised by Sydney bloomed under his leadership. As we filed out of the SCG that afternoon, a dead rubber had never seemed so full of life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d86f42fb478c5c74a7e56bc65aa54b7d71649ed/78_128_1370_822/master/1370.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5b2db6e086d3af0614699668eab52f8","title":"the masters 1996 greg norman final round live","story":"Greg Norman shipped a six-shot 54-hole lead as Nick Faldo won his third green jacket with a glorious final-day 67.And look, let’s cut Greg some slack, shall we. It’s no time for a pile-on. If that 70-footer on 14 had dropped ... if that chip for eagle on 15 went in ... yeah, yeah, your auntie and uncle. But we’re talking the combined width of a couple of dimples here it wouldn’t have taken too much to shift the momentum. Sure, you can’t deny the scale and scope of the collapse ... but things are never totally black and white, and it’d be dreadful if history forgets how Norman nearly pulled it back round when his dreams were crumbling. Just as it’d be an outrage if Faldo’s 67 doesn’t go down as one of the great final rounds in the entire history of championship golf, one of the carpe-diem performances. Faldo’s been pretty good at those over the years, you know.Anyway, thanks for reading. Join us tomorrow afternoon, 34 years ago in 1986, for more spacetime continuum-bending Masters action!But take nothing away from Nick Faldo, who now joins Jimmy Demaret, Sam Snead and Gary Player as a three-time Masters champion. That’s some exalted company only Arnold Palmer (four) and Jack Nicklaus (six) have won more. Throw in his three Opens, and that’s a total of six majors, putting him up there on the all-time list alongside Lee Trevino, and ahead of the likes of Byron Nelson, Peter Thomson and Seve! Faldo never seems to get the credit he deserves for his brilliance, his talent, his street-fighting moxie. And no doubt today’s 67 will become another example of that trend, eclipsed by the Norman psychodrama. But what a final round! Six birdies today, and a serene swing around Amen Corner, not a single bat of the eyelid as he traversed the most notoriously mind-bending stretch in major-championship golf. What a golfer! What a champion! England’s greatest sporting star of all time? He’s got a claim.How to process all that? The top line will be Norman’s collapse. There’s no option. It just has to be. This morning, it looked like his 15-year quest for that elusive green coat would end. The ghost of Larry Mize, in particular, would be banished forever. But once again, the Great White Shark came so close, yet remains so far, having found yet another spectacular way to come a cropper in a major. The yearning goes on. You’d like to think he’ll come back and win this Tournament another day, but at 41 years old, this may well have been his last chance. Heartbreaking. Greg and the Masters: one of golf’s great unrequited love stories.Speaking of Greg, he’s just come out of the scorers’ tent. Here’s his hot take: “I haven’t had chance to think about it. I didn’t play as well as I’d have liked, I didn’t putt very well today, it’s just one of those things. Things just didn’t go my way. Nick played a great round, he played very solid and steady, and it was all my mistakes.” Back in the Butler Cabin, last year’s champion Ben Crenshaw helps Faldo on with his third green jacket. The new champ quips: “I putted like you for a change!” Gentle Ben smiles back: “You played fantastic!”Here’s Faldo in the Butler Cabin for the third time! No amateur in attendance at the ceremony this year, with none of them making the cut, not even last year’s much-heralded low amateur Tiger Woods. A flash in the pan? Oh Tiger, we hardly knew ye! Anyway, Faldo looks exhausted physically, and sounds exhausted mentally, his sympathy for Norman evident in pretty much every word. “I went out to do what I ended up doing, shoot a 65, 66, 67. But I genuinely feel sorry for Greg. He’s a great man. In a way it’s a credit to the Masters, for what you put us through. It’s the most nerve-wracking golf course in the world. We have to play the most precise golf under the most extreme pressures, and so I’ve come out great, but I do feel sorry for Greg.”Faldo raises both arms in the air triumphantly, spinning around, putter aloft, scarcely able to comprehend the events of this afternoon. He hugs his caddy Fanny Sunesson, then she departs the scene with the 18th flagstick over her shoulder, a souvenir sourced and secured. That leaves the stage for Norman and Faldo to embrace. And it’s a true embrace, bittersweet but warm, both men fully aware of the historic importance and emotional implications of this wild final round. Norman appears genuinely happy for Faldo, offering hearty congratulations and a kind smile Faldo a strange mixture of ecstasy and wish-I-could-have-won-it-another-way concern for his opponent. The brotherhood of golfers right there. They walk off the green arm in arm, and Norman pats Faldo softly on the tummy, each friendly slap saying well done, old boy. Such a sporting response from Greg, who exits with supreme dignity, even though his eyes betray his heartbreak. The man with the child in his eyes. Poor baby Shark.It’s Faldo’s moment. Without so much as a microgram of pressure weighing on his shoulders, he teases in his right-to-left slider, and he finishes in style! A birdie and a truly wonderful 67! NICK FALDO IS THE 1996 MASTERS CHAMPION!Two putts from the fringe for par, and at least Norman has avoided the further indignity of giving up sole ownership of second place. He raises one arm in the air to thank the gallery for their love, support and - sorry to say, because no world-class sports star wants this - sympathy. His heart’s broken. He’ll most likely never wear a green jacket now. But he still manages a smile and a tip of the hat. A six-over 78 today, though, goodness. Only three days ago, he tore round here in a course-record-equalling 63. This is why we all love and hate golf, in equal measure, often at the same time. Even the greats struggle to work it out sometimes.Norman wedges in from 120 yards or so. It’s of similar standard to much that’s gone before it. Pushed right and short, stopping on the fringe. And so both players make the walk up 18. The gallery showers the pair with applause. Norman arrives first, letting the champion-elect savour his moment as he walks up last. He’s able to soak it in this time his first two victories required play-offs, but this one’s all done and dusted. A slight sadness hangs in the air, though, which is a shame for Faldo and no reflection on the 38-year-old Englishman. It’s just that Norman’s collapse has been through-the-fingers distressing, and many turned up today in expectation of seeing one of the most popular players in the world claim the prize he so longs for. It’s just the way it is.Faldo attempts to replicate Lyle’s famous bunker shot from 130 yards. It’s not quite as delightful as one of the greatest shots in Masters history, but that’s a hell of a high bar, and it’s pretty darn good on its own terms, sent into the heart of the green, the ridge across the middle bringing the ball back to 20 feet. He’ll have a good look at birdie. Faldo, full to the brim with adrenaline, booms his drive at 18 into Lyle’s bunker. Norman finds the fairway by the dogleg. He couldn’t have placed his ball any better. It’s not often he’s been able to say that this afternoon. Oh Greg.Meanwhile Faldo and Norman are both on 17 in fuss-free regulation. A genuine sense that, if both men could pick up and walk back to the clubhouse now, they would. Probably best to let Norman spend some time alone. A garden-variety par for Faldo. Norman has a much better chance for birdie, to get within three and keep faint hopes alive. But he fails to hit his ten-foot left-to-right curler. He’s come up short so many times today, though this fiasco can’t solely be blamed on his timidity with the flat stick. Just about every aspect of his game has crumbled to dust today. It’s been a comprehensive, all-encompassing, widescreen, stereophonic, surround-sound, hi-def-and-Dolby debacle.Up ahead, the penultimate match comes up 18. Waldorf can’t get up and down from the front to save his par, but the 33-year-old from LA signs for a level-par 72, and at -4 will safely top his previous best showings in a major, ties for ninth place at the 1992 PGA and the 1994 US Open. Mickelson meanwhile guides in a slick downhill 20-footer to save his par. A preposterous way to finish, really, given the manner in which he yipped tiddlers at 8, 11 and 12, then three-putted 14. It’s a 72 for Lefty as well, and he finishes the week at -6. Another year, perhaps. He’s certainly got the sort of game - the talent, the showmanship - that suits this place. But then we’ve been saying this about Greg Norman since he finished fourth on debut in 1981, and look where we are right now.Faldo very nearly knocks his 40-footer, with huge right-to-left break, into the cup. That would have added insult to injury. But a par is more than fine. Norman simply has to make this bogey putt. But it’s an awful misread, sent way too far to the right, the ball never breaking back and stopping three feet past. A double bogey met with almost total silence. A mixture of sadness, sympathy and respect. The gallery at 16 was bouncing earlier when Ray Floyd aced now the atmosphere is positvely funereal. These are the sort of blows some people never get over. Will Redbud become Norman’s Rosebud?A few murmurs, little more, from the gallery. They’re so sad to see it end in this grisly manner. Norman drops, his ball falling like a single tear. He clips his third shot from the dropzone to 12 feet. Why couldn’t he do that 60 seconds ago? As Norman hauls himself up to the green, every one of Redbud’s 170 yards will feel a mile. The crowd, sensing his agony, rise as one to greet him with the warmest ovation. He’s always been popular round Georgia way. He’s always been popular the world over. A lot of golf fans will be feeling for him tonight.“Nope! It’s water!” Wah! Once again, just like at 12, a seer in the Augusta gallery knows exactly where Norman’s ball is headed, when it’s still in mid air, carrying all of the Great White Shark’s hopes and dreams. Greg goes for the pin - he’s got little choice, really - but sends a big pull-hook deep into the drink. That was nowhere near terra firma. Miles from the flag, the green, dry land. His head falls. Then he allows himself a little wry smile. He realises the jig is up, the horse has bolted, the dream is over. Faldo must know how close he is to a sensational victory, too, but there’s no trace of joy on his face. These two may be long-standing rivals, but while Faldo will be delighted to be in the box seat, he won’t be taking any pleasure from Norman’s ongoing suffering. This is incredibly difficult to watch. That was miles off target.It’s Faldo first up at the iconic par-three 16th. He finds the green safely enough, but that’s in conservative country, in the fat of the green but plenty away from the cup. Birdie is unlikely, but with a two-shot lead he certainly wasn’t going to flirt with the water, the pin tucked back-left in its traditional Sunday position. It’s all down to Greg. He needs to get close here. He takes his usual sweet time, and then ... Faldo is chipping down the green, quite the task on these hysterically fast surfaces. A lovely touch to four feet secures his birdie, then Norman tidies up for his. Still a gap of two, and Norman has come back strongly and impressively since his nightmare around Amen Corner. On another day, in another universe parallel to ours, his 70-foot putt on 14 has dropped, and his eagle chip on 15 went in too. They’re tied with three to play over there. Back here on Planet Earth, GA, Faldo leads by two, and poor Norman must wonder what he has to do to get his hands on a green jacket.Greg has match-play style advantage, a little bit further from the flag, chipping first up the bank from 60 feet. For the second hole in succession, he’s so close to holing out from distance, landing his wedge softly onto the green, then rolling it out gracefully, right-to-left, towards the cup. It looks like dropping, but shaves the right-hand edge and stays up. As the gallery circling the green gasp theatrically - patrons have been allowed to congregate on the fairway, with nobody left behind - Norman falls to his knees, cocks his head back with an involuntary yelp of despair, then spins around and lands on his back, holding onto his wide-brimmed hat before springing back up in disbelief. So close to an eagle that would have given Faldo some serious pause for thought!Nobilo can’t make his par putt on 18, the ball sliding just to the left of the cup. A closing bogey, but that’s a 69 and he’s the new clubhouse leader at -5. A fine week’s work for the 35-year old from Auckland, who has yet to register a victory on the PGA Tour (four in Europe, though).Faldo’s going for it. He whistles a 4-iron over the water and onto the green, though it falls off the back, from where getting up and down is no certainty. Norman was a little longer from the tee, and he’s hitting 6-iron. This has to get close. His shot of destiny? Well, it nearly decides this Masters, put it that way. The nerves kicking in, just as they did on 18 a decade ago, he pushes his approach to the right. The bank on the other side of the water stuns his ball. For a terrible second, it looks like it’ll roll back into the drink. But it stops safe and dry. Lucky boy, Greg. It wasn’t quite as heart-stoppingly dramatic as Freddie Couples on 12 four years ago, but the old ticker would have been in his mouth for a few seconds there. Hoo boy.Some friendly golf on 15, as both Faldo and Norman send their drives into the shadows down the left. Norman will be desperate for eagle. Up on 18, Nobilo doesn’t try to get too clever, shortsided with the bunker in front of him. He takes the sand out of play, landing his chip onto the ridge running across the green, letting the slope bring his ball back towards the hole. He’ll be left with a downhill 12-footer - think Sandy in ‘88 - for a closing round of 68 and the clubhouse lead at -6. Meanwhile as expected, there’s no birdie for Phil at 16. Nobilo looks like stumbling at the last. He finds Sandy Lyle’s bunker on 18, then hits a fat iron out of it. He’s well short, disappointment washing all across his face. He’s left with a tricky chip over the bunker guarding the front, with not a great deal of green to play with, the pin tucked behind the trap. Back on 16, Mickelson finds the front right of the green with an uncharacteristically conservative play. You’d think he needs to make everything if he’s to apply any significant pressure on the leading pair unless he curls in a huge right-to-left breaker for birdie, you’d imagine that’s his race run.One of the putts of the week by Norman on 14! It doesn’t drop, but it’s the perfect speed from 70 feet, up and over the ridge running across the green. It stops a couple of inches to the right, and that’s a simple tap-in for par. Sensational, because a three-putt bogey looked a very real prospect there that’s where Mickelson three-putted from a few minutes earlier. Had Norman’s effort dropped for an outrageous birdie, it might have really turned the tide. It could well have rattled the usually unflappable Faldo. But it wasn’t meant to be. Faldo takes two careful putts for his par, and the lead remains two.Mickelson drains his eagle putt across 16! There wasn’t a whole lot of movement on the putt, and he’s judged the pace perfectly. Only the second eagle of the day there! Those missed tiddlers at 8, 11 and 12, plus the three-putt at the last hole, suddenly look hella costly. He’d be tying Faldo right now had his flat stick been anywhere near on its best behaviour.Norman’s second into 14 is rotten. He finds the dancefloor, but he’s shoved it well right of the target and it topples down the ridge, ending a good 70 feet away. Faldo punches his up into the heart of the green. He’s not close, but he’s avoided Norman’s fate of dribbling away down the slope and into possible three-putt territory. Meanwhile two putts for Nobilo on 17, his birdie effort shaving the right-hand side of the cup. He remains four off Faldo’s lead at -6.Faldo’s drive at 14 topples off the fairway on the right and towards the trees, but he catches a break and he’ll have a route into the green from there. Norman slams a biggie down the left side of the fairway. He looks a little bit more relaxed now, the worst having already happened. Perhaps he’ll enjoy chasing as opposed to being chased. Up on 17, Nobilo finds the green in regulation, pin high to the left, and will have a 20-foot look at birdie. And on 15, Mickelson, from prime position in the middle of the track, whips his second pin high. He’ll have a look at eagle from 30 feet. There have only been two at this hole this weekend, by Jack Nicklaus yesterday, and Davis Love III today. The gallery, so quiet having witnessed Norman’s collapse, crackles into life as the man himself finally arrests the slide! After careful contemplation, he taps his birdie putt with great care, sending his ball gently oscillating from left to right and back again. You’d swear that was dead straight if you weren’t concentrating hard. Perfectly judged, and in it drops. A desperately needed birdie! Faldo follows him in to remain two ahead, but that might give Norman, the hunted turned hunter, some crucial impetus over the final stretch. God knows he needs it, because right now Faldo doesn’t look like he’ll be giving him anything. Meanwhile the penultimate pairing of Mickelson and Waldorf continue to do-si-do on the leader board, swapping places yet again: the former bogeys 14, three-putting from distance, the latter birdies. Masters Sunday, right here, right now!Faldo’s long eagle putt on 13 looks like dropping for a while. But turns out it’s always missing on the low side, and slips a tricky three feet past. Norman is up next, and really has to make this birdie putt if he’s to stay in this. He hasn’t made one since the 2nd, a lifetime ago in a different galaxy.Up on 18, Corey Pavin takes three to get down from the front of 18 and that’s a decent but ultimately disappointing final round of 71. He ends the week at -3, the joint clubhouse leader alongside Davis Love III and Jeff Maggert. He looks good for his third top-ten finish in the last five visits. A top-ten finish certainly looks on the cards for Nobilo, who sends his tee shot at 16 to five feet and tidies up for birdie. A conservative punch of the air. On only his second visit here - he missed the cut on debut last year - he moves into third on his own, three off the lead, and will be ruing his failure to pick up a shot at the inviting par-five 15th. Those two shots took the best part of seven minutes combined. All the options considered. Golf as chess. Now Norman has no option but to get close. But after his travails at 12, he isn’t in the mood to flirt with Rae’s Creek. From 80 yards, he takes it out of the equation by wedging well over the flag, 15 feet past, spinning it back a little to ten feet or so. He’ll have a decent look at birdie ... but that’s by no means a gimme.That leaves Faldo with a decision of his own. He’s just off the fairway, on the first cut to the right. Does he go for the green, effectively pressing his cleats on Norman’s neck? Off comes the head cover and out comes the 5-wood. He addresses the ball and ... steps back, the breeze having picked up. He addresses it again and ... steps back again! This time he’s changed his mind. The gallery mutter their disapproval, but then Faldo isn’t playing to, or for, them. Eventually, after a Normanesque period of reflection, he pulls out an iron. Is he going to lay up? Nope! It’s a 2-iron, and one fired into the meat of the green. He’ll have a look at eagle from 40 feet. Had that ball landed ten feet to the right, the camber would have taken the ball seriously close. As is, it’ll do. He bounces down the fairway, full of beans. The pressure’s really on Norman now.Two putts from 40 feet for Mickelson up on the green, and that’s a birdie that takes him back to a share of third at -5. Waldorf can’t get up and down and the resulting bogey probably puts an end to his dream he’s -4. Once they’re done, the stage is set for Norman. “I feel for him,” says Venturi on CBS, channelling all those emotions from 40 years ago. “It’s difficult to bring it back.” He’s got a decision to make. He’s 232 yards from the pin. He can make the green, but hitting fairway wood off pine straw, a dip into Rae’s Creek is a fair possibility. In an ideal world he’d roll the dice and try for eagle, but he can’t afford any more slip ups. After a couple of minutes of thought, and a little bit of very careful gardening, removing loose needles with a tee peg, he decides to lay up. The smart play, surely.From pine straw on 13, Mickelson fires his second into the heart of the green. His partner Waldorf pulls into a bunker on the left, and he’ll have a job getting close from there, the green in front of him falling away towards the creek. Back up the hole, Norman trudges up to the tee with his head hung low. Faldo has the honour, and he sends his tee shot down the right, from where he’ll likely lay up. Norman has to go for it, and belts one towards the patrons in the trees on the pine straw down the right. Oh Greg. Birdie here is a must, surely.This is an unprecedented collapse. Ed Sneed gave up a five-shot 54-hole lead in 1979 - and a three-shot lead with three to play - but even then he still managed to squeak into a play-off. However, Norman’s game has fallen completely to pieces, his mind like a cake left out in the rain. Oh no no. It’s extremely difficult to see him getting anything out of this. It’s certainly hard to see him getting back into this proactively, put it that way. He might have to hope Faldo hits a bumpy stretch of his own, though those sort of meltdowns aren’t really in the five-time major winner’s DNA. “Six-over par today. Is it possible to come back from something as great as that?” The thoughts there of Bobby Clampett on CBS. Now there’s someone else who’ll be able to identify with Norman’s plight, having led the 1982 Open at Troon by seven strokes after six holes of the third round, only to take three shots to get out of a pot bunker at 7, going on to card final rounds of 78 and 77. He ended the week tied for tenth.Faldo takes two putts for his par. Softly, softly, catchy Sharky. It’s good enough to establish a two-shot lead, because Norman, freaked out after giving his birdie putt on 11 too much, doesn’t give this bogey attempt enough oomph, and it’s always dying to the right. A double bogey, and the world number one has shipped five shots in the last four holes. The singular pressures of Amen Corner. The gallery, astonished beyond volume, watch as mute. They came for entertainment they’re witnessing a comprehensive, root-and-branch mental capitulation. Norman had been in the lead for 49 holes, since making birdie at 17 on Thursday. Now look!Norman drops 85 yards from the flag. With his head, like his ball, swimming, he does extremely well to wedge to 12 feet. If he knocks that in, and limits the damage to bogey, it could arrest his downward momentum. It’s the only way he can think about this horrific situation he’s in - though trying to put a positive spin on what would be a fourth consecutive bogey takes some mental gymnastics. He trudges over Hogan’s Bridge without a word. The gallery has fallen extremely quiet too. An eerie pall descends on Amen Corner. It wasn’t supposed to be like this.Norman really should aim for the heart of the green. “If I was Greg, I would not take the pin on,” opines Venturi, who knows a thing or two about what Norman is going through right now, having bogeyed 9, 10, 11 and 12 himself while shipping a lead on Masters Sunday in 1956. “I’d take it over the fat side of the bunker and put it on the green. He’s not going to win it here, but he can lose it here.” Greg takes the flag on. The ball begins its fateful descent over Rae’s Creek. Just before it lands on the bank guarding the front of the green, one wise old Augusta punter, who clearly knows where you can and cannot take liberties, predicts in matter-of-fact style: “It’s in the water.” The ball slaps the face of the bank, takes one big bounce, then a couple of sweet baby ones, then topples back quietly into the drink. Oh my. Amen Corner on Sunday, huh.Norman and Faldo receive a rousing, standing ovation as they walk up to the 12th tee. On CBS, Ken Venturi deconstructs. “You know what that ovation says? It says they’re tied: may the best man win!” Most of the colour has drained from Norman’s stunned face. As he waits for Faldo to go about his business, he gnaws on his bottom lip like a clubber who’s been a bit too liberal with the old bag of speed. His heart will be racing in similar style, too. Faldo meanwhile calmly sends a 7-iron into the heart of this most testing of par threes. Can his co-leader - his co-leader! - respond?... Norman clacks his birdie putt down the green. It flirts with the lip on the right, but it’s not lacking for speed and charges on by. He’s left himself a tricky three-footer coming back. Not the worst putt in the world, but given what’s happened to him recently, it’s not the ideal outcome either. After trying to shake the tension from his shoulders by letting his arms hang loose, he sets himself and ... shoves a meek putt to the right, the ball lipping out. As he taps in, the patrons of Augusta National swoon and chatter in disbelief. What on earth is happening here?! Norman started the day with a six-shot lead, but all of a sudden, it’s all gone! Three consecutive bogeys. No wonder he’s pinching the bridge of his nose as he stumbles off the green, head bowed in bewildered contemplation.Mickelson bumps his chip up onto the 12th green. Not quite enough juice, he’s left with a four-footer for his par. And once again his flat stick lets him down. Having pushed one left on 11, he now pulls this right. A bogey, and he’s left two shots out there in short order. He slips to -4. Meanwhile Faldo can’t make his 25-footer for birdie at 11. No matter, another par will do. Because ...Faldo’s comparative lack of distance means he’s hitting first into 11. Always an advantage in match play, which, well, y’know. He piles the pressure on Norman by landing his ball 20 feet from the flag. Not sure whether he went straight for the pin or was aiming for the centre of the green and pulled it a tad, but he’ll not care too much about that. Norman responds well: after twitching and tweaking his set-up this way and that for 20 seconds, he eventually drops a 9-iron into the middle of the green, and will have a fairly straight look at birdie from 15 feet or so. Worth the wait.Norman takes out his frustration on his drive at 11, and batters one miles down the middle. He’s a long way past Faldo, who had crashed a big enough one down there himself. Over on 12, Mickelson goes straight at the flag, but he’s long, and the ball topples off the back-right of the green. He doesn’t have too much green to work with there, he’ll be facing a difficult chip back up. Meanwhile here’s Simon McMahon: “As Seve (+11) rides off into the sunset, my sources tell me there’s a promising young Spanish golfer who may be worth keeping an eye on. Won the European amateur championship aged just 15 last year, and with it entry to this year’s Open. A cool customer by all accounts. Sergio Garcia. Remember the name.” Yes, we’ve heard rumblings that he’s something special. Word is, if he hasn’t landed at least three or four majors by 2010, something will have gone seriously wrong.Up on 11, Mickelson arrows an iron straight at the flag. From 140 yards, he’s now no more than four feet away. That is a sensational shot, and ballsy too, the pin tucked in behind the water, with barely any room for error. A birdie would take him to within four of the lead ... but with the sun glinting off his flat stick, he dribbles a miserable putt wide left. Like Norman up on 10, he only half-committed to the stroke, and paid the price for his timidity. That’s one hell of a yip. I wonder whether he was put off by a roar of disbelief elsewhere, as news of Norman’s latest bogey was posted on the leader boards? And he nearly misses the two-footer he left himself, pulling it, the ball only just toppling in on the right. He remains at -5. And he’s joined there by Nobilo, who finds the heart of 13 with his approach, then rolls a gentle left-to-right slider into the cup from 25 feet.A lovely boring two-putt par for Faldo. If he’d hit the first one, uphill from 25 feet and fairly straight, it might even have dropped for birdie. But par will do. No sweat. Norman is breaking out into cobs, though. He almost quits on his par putt, and the subsequent lack of velocity means the ball’s always going to turn left before reaching the cup. That’s a wretched effort in the circumstances, and as he taps in disconsolately for a second bogey in a row, one patron emits a sing-song “ooooh my” in the style of Blanche Dubois. The tone and timing of this particular song of the south strongly suggests the subtext: “Uh-oh, what do we have here, this dude is losing it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de23c9d8151bd8d9c5493d9d92d5cc7f1ccefcc7/0_8_2536_1522/master/2536.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f5fb0187ebb1880a9d6989a8d14f229a","title":"the early days of home computing in pictures","story":"“There were no design conventions for the earliest home computers, no rules for how they’d look,” says Alex Wiltshire, author of Home Computers, a new book that explores the rapidly changing face of the household machine between its birth in the 1970s and the 1990s.

Sex life gone from G-spot to pee spot? The London Clinic’s Jane Simpson explains what we can do to tackle incontinence – including kegel exercises that you can do wherever you are As a continence nurse specialist, I’ve seen firsthand how overwhelming and upsetting incontinence can be. Patients visit me when things have gone too far – their behaviours change and they’re suddenly avoiding activities such as playing tennis, having sex or even going to the cinema because they’re worried about having to race to the toilet. When you start avoiding things you enjoy, it’s time to take action.Of course, leakage can be troubling at any moment, but during sex it’s particularly distressing (it tends to happen during an orgasm or because of the physical pressure). But the good news is, it doesn’t mean the end of your sex life. In fact, patients always say they wish they’d sought treatment sooner. Even if you don’t experience leakage, sexual sensation and satisfaction can be improved, too – and who wouldn’t want that? As well as increasing blood supply to the vagina and penis, pelvic floor muscle training (or “kegels”, as they’re also known), can improve muscle tone and maintain nerve activity, meaning better sex.When it comes to treatment for accidental leakage, it depends on the type of incontinence people are dealing with. “Stress incontinence” is when we suffer leakage while doing things such as sneezing, coughing or laughing, and it’s common for women to experience this after having a baby, when the pelvic floor is weakest. Leaking during sports or sex falls under this category, due to weakened pelvic floor muscles. The other common type is an overactive bladder, or “urge incontinence”, which feels like you have to urinate suddenly and often.Pelvic floor exercises can help in both instances, but it’s really important to make sure you’re doing them properly – speak to a women’s health physiotherapist or a continence specialist if unsure. They’re simple – just squeeze, lift and hold the anus and vagina, count to five and repeat five times. Improvement is fast – you’ll notice a change in six weeks if you do them regularly. There’s also a brilliant app called MyPFF, which reminds you to do your exercises.If an overactive bladder is the problem, lifestyle changes are key – symptoms can be worsened by too much caffeine, alcohol, fizzy drinks, spicy foods and stress, for example. Certain medications can also play a part, as well as conditions such as constipation, urinary tract infections and vaginal atrophy. Bladder retraining is great – when you have an urge to pee, you teach yourself to hang on, which slowly expands your bladder capacity. It might also be worth avoiding high-impact sports until your pelvic floor is stronger, since too much exercise can make things worse. Medication and surgery could be considered with a specialist, too.I definitely sense a change coming in the way we discuss women’s health issues and incontinence, and it’s great the conversation is becoming more open. There shouldn’t be any shame or stigma around it any more – this sort of condition affects so many of us. I hope people realise improvement is possible and that once the issue is tackled, it really can be life-changing. Recently, a woman visited me in my clinic and said that just having a treatment plan in place has made her feel better. It really is the very least we deserve.As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

It implies it’s a time of things “winding down”, “ending”, “drying up”.Well, most things. Because often, along with menopause, comes bladder weakness. And for many women that means that things get decidedly less dry.Unlike when a girl starts her period, which in many cultures is celebrated, and in the UK is now respected with a government campaign to provide sanitary products in schools, when a woman’s periods begin to end, it’s seen as a change towards old age, towards a body that’s “done”. And even for those going through menopause, it has often felt pretty taboo to talk about the daily problems – especially bladder weakness.“Don’t make me laugh, I’ll wet myself!” might seem like an age-old joke, but it’s one that’s true for menopausal women. And when it comes to our sex lives, it’s no laughing matter. There’s fear and shame and women shut down, choosing not to be intimate for fear of leaking urine during a passionate moment.After all, when do you slip “I’d love to have an early night but I’m worried I’ll wet the bed!” into the conversation, whether you’re with a long-term partner or someone new?The good news is this conversation is being reclaimed by women in the spotlight, who are starting to talk about the final menopause taboo of bladder weakness. Well, we talk so much about starting our periods – why would we not talk about stopping them, and how this affects your love life?It seems there has been a realisation that no matter whether you grace the red carpet and TV screens or you’re on the school run with grandchildren or off to the office, menopause will happen to every woman. Take Gwyneth Paltrow, for example, who released a video for her wellbeing site Goop, saying: “I think menopause gets a really bad rap, and needs a bit of rebranding.” Her video Madame Ovary spoke about mood swings and sweats, while British actress Emma Thompson has joked how hot sweats mean she’s not cold on the red carpet.OK, so the conversation is shifting – just like we can now see a tampon string in a TV ad (thanks to Sport England’s This Girl Can campaign), women are no longer sitting quietly while they deal with the side effects of menopause. But there is one subject that still has to work hard to find its way into our vocabulary – bladder weakness.We can talk hot flushes, night sweats, mood swings – all with increasing honesty. But then there’s Nadia Sawalha, who struggled with incontinence in silence. The usually outspoken TV presenter kept quiet about bladder weakness until she was forced to speak about it after having an accident on national TV.Why is it the one part of menopause women can’t talk about? Well, leaking during the day is one thing – the embarrassment of needing to find some alternative underwear, for example – but when it comes to sex, it’s a different matter altogether. Women who have bladder weakness and might have an accident during sex are likely to close off to their partner, so worried they’ll spoil the intimacy that they don’t have sex and even make up excuses, or “blame” menopause. Intimacy is not synonymous with leakage.After all, when you’re not sure whether you might lose control of your bladder, being intimate isn’t always top of the list. Talk about mixed messages! Women are encouraged to embrace their ageing, to love who they are and how they look – to go grey with glamour and grace, or to wear a bikini with pride. Just don’t mention the bladder weakness, right?!As periods end and change, we have to adjust. The problem is, the world doesn’t seem to adjust with us. And women are left in a strange quagmire of going through something so natural and even primal in silence and, often, shame.And with two-thirds of women over 40 affected with bladder weakness, and many revealing it has affected their mental health, it’s time we became more open and honest about how bladder weakness affects us.Meg Matthews, who has been campaigning about the menopause and runs megsmenopause, says: “Bladder weakness, also called bladder incontinence, is a very common consequence of menopause. It’s not easy to talk about this topic, and, because women don’t always feel confident talking about it, they can feel alone. We need to understand that having bladder weakness is OK. This is the message we need to spread.”But just like when we’re younger, confidence can come back when we use the right products. Once a girl knows she can use a tampon or pad, she’s less worried about her period affecting her day-to-day life. And for women with bladder issues, it’s about a pad that can help you forget there’s even a problem. Then you’ll feel freer to have those more difficult intimacy conversations that you’ve been putting off – and perhaps that early night …As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

Vanessa, who works in a care home on the Wirral, talks about how hard it is for residents not to have visitors and what to do when supermarkets won’t let you order in bulk online. Two tins of beans will not cut it. She’s had to find different ways of getting food supplies, at the same time as rejigging her workers’ shifts. Her deputy has been told to self-isolate for 12 weeks, living on £95.85 a week.From an intensive care unit in south London, doctor Andrew explains how hard his job has become. It’s hot in the operating theatre, wearing full PPE. He describes intubation: “So much more challenging to do when you’re in a full gown… all of the virus-infested sputum was going to be aerosolised into my face.” He can’t see his colleagues’ faces or hear them speak, so everyone is shouting at one another. His shifts are getting longer and longer as more doctors and nurses have to self-isolate in case they have the virus (still no tests for them, unbelievably). He is getting sores from his face-mask.And on Merseyside, Carmel, a nurse, has decided to move out of her family household, away from her parents, her sister and her son, in case she brings the virus back home with her. She cries as she does so, and so do we… Michelle Dignan presents this podcast, a little intrusively. We don’t really need to be told how to react to these reports.For more conventional journalism, try LBC’s daily corona pod, Coronavirus UK, in which Nick Ferrari, breakfast broadcasting terrier, gets sharp with those in charge of the UK response to the virus. Ferrari nurtures his relationships with ministers, and this show pulls in many more prominent politicians than the Today programme. Matt Hancock has been on quite a bit, as have Michael Gove and Jeremy Hunt, who chairs the health select committee. They are not let off the hook: Ferrari is the master of the precise, awkward question. LBC, as a station, is infatuated with coronavirus, its new post-Brexit obsession, and is covering it well but manically, fuelled by listeners phoning in, as well as politicians. Episodes are 25-35 minutes long.The World Service offers the Coronavirus Global Update. We hear about China, Spain, Italy, France, the US, from international correspondents, and this five-minute podcast gives an excellent, snappy overview. It’s a headline-only news show, in ye olde BBC manner, which is reassuring in itself. The other main BBC Covid-19 offering, The Coronavirus Newscast, is of the modern BBC manner: this is Brexitcast, but coronafied. Laura Kuenssberg, Adam Fleming, Fergus Walsh and Chris Mason present from their various homes, with all the banter that engenders. If you’re after an upbeat, insider-y show, this is the one for you.The Bunker Daily: Nigella’s Lockdown KitchenThe Bunker is not, by nature, a comfort listen, being a clever, up-to-the-minute discussion show that has grown out of Remainiacs, a clever, up-to-the-minute anti-Brexit discussion show. Its weekly offering brings together the very smart Ian Dunt, Naomi Smith, Dorian Lynskey and Alex Andreou to discuss big issues. But its Daily show is more varied and this episode, where Nigella Lawson talks to Andreou, her friend, is a truly lovely thing. Lawson speaks so beautifully about food, creativity in the kitchen and lockdown. I hate cooking and I loved this episode.The Tranquillusionist Helen Zaltzman has shifted the focus of her podcast The Allusionist, to calm us down in these stressful times. In the first Tranquillusionist show, she reads out soothing words in alphabetical order, accompanied by gentle music. “Cuddle, cumulonimbus, custard, cwtch,” says Zaltzman, and things feel instantly better. In the second episode she gives us Imagine by John Lennon, but with the words in reverse alphabetical order (I really love this one). And in the third, she reads out the annual winners of best in show at the Westminster dog show, starting in 1907: “Warren Remedy, a smooth fox terrier”. Lovely.Nothing Much Happens This is a podcast designed to make you fall asleep. Yoga and meditation teacher Kathryn Nicolai writes all the stories and reads them out, in classic ASMR fashion. Her voice is close to the mic, with a neutral American accent, and she reads the story twice, a little slower the second time. Slow tales about going to a cabin in the woods, about making cups of tea, about watching winter through the window. The podcast trains your brain, over time, into falling asleep. It slightly drives me mad, but I know a lot of people for whom this show really works."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43b72a787fb0837b8dd13aaddc5b25a53ac9606e/0_525_4675_2806/master/4675.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b920a2726ea61fdf200849075e0b4a4","title":"cuomo de blasio new york schools","story":"New York governor Andrew Cuomo and New York City mayor Bill de Blasio once again had differing opinions on who has authority to implement certain Covid-19 policies.This time, it involved De Blasio’s announcement on Saturday morning that New York City’s school district, which oversees 1.1 million students, would shutter for the rest of the academic year to try to slow the spread of the coronavirus. De Blasio said his administration was forging a “comprehensive plan” to safely reopen schools in September and that “next year is going to have to be the greatest academic year New York public schools have ever had”.De Blasio, like Cuomo a Democrat, said it was not an easy decision to close schools in favor of online learning, but that “it is the right decision, and it’s also a decision made a little clearer by the fact that the distance learning is working more and more every day”.Cuomo added: “When we made the decision to close the schools, we made it for the entire region. Any decision to reopen them will also be a coordinated decision.”Adding to the confusion, an email from the city to parents was issued while Cuomo spoke, advising of the extended school closing. “NYC school students will continue with remote learning for the rest of the 2019-20 school year,” it said.Freddi Goldstein, De Blasio’s press secretary, took issue with Cuomo’s comments.She tweeted: “The governor’s reaction to us keeping schools closed is reminiscent of how he reacted when the Mayor called for a shelter in place. We were right then and we’re right now. Schools will remain closed, just like how we eventually – days later – moved to a shelter in place model.”Goldstein’s tweet alluded to that fact that Saturday’s dispute was the latest bout in a long-running grudge match between the two elected officials.When De Blasio said last month New York City residents should prepare for a “shelter-in-place” order, Cuomo said the city didn’t have the power to make such a declaration. Days later, Cuomo announced a “New York state on pause” order, directing non-essential businesses to close and telling people to stay 6ft away from others in public. The order sounded much like shelter-in-place, a term De Blasio has continued to use.School buildings in New York City, the center of the pandemic in the US, have been closed since 16 March. All school buildings in the state have been closed since 18 March following an executive order from Cuomo. The school closures were initially announced for a few weeks, back when the virus’s full impact was not known. A massive effort to move school instruction online has met with mixed success in the city, where many low-income students lack wifi and devices for connecting to their virtual classrooms.Cuomo, whose national profile has risen during the pandemic, said again on Saturday he is not interested in running for president.When a reporter said some Democrats would prefer Cuomo to former vice president Joe Biden as their party’s presidential nominee, Cuomo said: “That is on one hand flattering. On the other hand, it is irrelevant.”“I have no political agenda. Period,” he said. “I’m not running for president. I’m not running for vice president. I’m not running anywhere. I’m not going to Washington. I’m staying right here.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae8d8c50ffcfbbb42e8802c0e9c0850a2e25c10e/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ded9dca7368f3f620bcdfa6f5cd4b0b2","title":"the cluster effect how social gatherings were rocket fuel for coronavirus","story":"Holding hands, kissing, sharing drinks from the same glass all helped spread the virusOn 15 February, a merry crowd wearing clown wigs and jester hats gathered in the town hall of Gangelt, a small western German municipality nestled by the Dutch border, to ring in the peak of the carnival season.Beer and wine flowed aplenty as approximately 350 adults in fancy dress locked arms on long wooden benches and swayed to the rhythm of music provided by a live band.During an interval in the programme, guests got up to mingle with friends and relatives at other tables, greeting each other as Rhineland tradition commands, with a Bützchen, or peck on the cheek.A carnival committee of 11 men in red-and-white uniforms compered the four-hour event and gave speeches on topical issues. Covid-19, the virus that had been detected on German soil for the first time two weeks earlier, was not among them.Yet the coronavirus is the single reason why the carnival session in Gangelt is now drawing close attention from scientists from around the world: seven people who walked out of the event later tested positive for the virus. A 47-year-old man who performed in the “male ballet” at the Gangelt carnival was the first person in Germany admitted to intensive care with the infection.Gangelt is in the Heinsberg district, which is home to 42,000 people and has since had 1,442 infections and 43 fatalities, more than any other administrative district in the country. The national media has started to refer to it as “Germany’s Wuhan”.A hundred days after a Chinese government website announced the discovery of a “pneumonia of unknown cause”, it has become clearer that the dynamics behind the virus’s rapid expansion across the globe has relied heavily on such “cluster effects”.Each of the countries most heavily hit by the pandemic has reported similar stories of social, cultural or religious gatherings where large numbers spent numerous hours in close company – holding hands, kissing, sharing drinks from the same glass – which then turbo-charged the spread of the pandemic.“One pattern we are seeing across the globe is that wherever there was singing and dancing, the virus spread more rapidly,” said Prof Hendrik Streeck, a virologist at the University of Bonn whose team of researchers has spent the last week carrying out the first “Covid-19 case cluster study” in Heinsberg.“Most infections didn’t take place in supermarkets or restaurants,” Streeck said of his preliminary findings. In Heinsberg, his team of coronavirus detectives could find scant evidence of the virus being transmitted via the surfaces of door handles, smart phones or other objects.Early theories that the virus at the carnival party in Gangelt could have been transmitted through the dishwater in the kitchen turned out to be a red herring: most guests drank their beer from bottles.Instead, he said, transmission took place at “events where people spent a length of time in each others’ close company”, such as apres ski parties in the Austrian resort of Ischgl, the Trompete nightclub in Berlin and a football match in northern Italy.“Mass events are a perfect opportunity for the virus, as people meet total strangers,” said Niki Popper, a mathematician at Vienna’s Technical University whose team has been developing a simulation that could help governments predict the development of the pandemic more accurately.Instead of merely multiplying the number of daily cases by a certain factor, Popper’s example tries to account for what he calls the starting point of “local epidemic networks”.“If you have 100 or 200 people spend enough time in a room with a person carrying the virus, then for example 20 might walk out with the new infection and, after a few days’ incubation time, pass it on to their families and workmates, let’s assume 10 more people each. Within a few days, the virus can thus multiply 200 times with only one new incident - and then continue.”Large parties played a key role in the pandemic’s rapid expansion not just in central Europe, but also in the US and Australia. New York may now be the centre of the US outbreak, but the traditional festivities around Mardi Gras is thought to have been a catalyst for a large outbreak in New Orleans.On 25 February the entire city, with almost 400,000 residents, and an estimated tourist crowd of 1.4 million people from all over the world were swallowed up in a tide of music, floats, extravagant costumes, cocktails and revelry for the climax of carnival.As is traditional in this Louisiana city on the Mississippi, gatherings and parades had begun weeks before, from 6 January onwards. Many people flung the doors of their houses open and crammed in friends, family, neighbours, strangers – all jostling, dancing, hugging, eating and drinking together.There were no social restrictions during carnival. Only weeks later, on 20 March did the mayor of New Orleans issue a stay-at-home order for the city, with Louisiana ordering statewide restrictions two days later, closing schools and all non-essential businesses. “Mardi Gras was the perfect storm, it provided the perfect conditions for the spread of this virus,” said Rebekah Gee, head of Louisiana State University’s healthcare services ision. For health authorities that were still trying to track and contain inidual infections at this stage of the pandemic, party clusters represented a particular challenge since revellers would often travel from and return to other regions, other countries or even other continents.In Australia, for example, at least 30 people including backpackers became infected after attending a crowded dance party at Bondi Beach’s Bucket List pavilion on 15 March. The party took place the night before restrictions came into force on gatherings of more than 500 people, during a weekend of mixed messages from the authorities. Australia’s prime minister was urging people not to gather in large numbers, but also saying he would go to a football game.Many of those who attended the “Back to Boogie Wonderland – Tropicana” event, which told people to release their “inner Caribbean dancer”, later retired to local backpacker hostels with dorm rooms and shared facilities.The Waverley council area, which encompasses Bondi and its backpacker community, has now become a hotspot for Covid-19, with many of its 140 cases linked to bars, clubs and restaurants, including the Bucket List.In many countries, partygoers and organisers have found themselves on the receiving end of a backlash. In Australia, the Bucket List’s Facebook page is full of livid comments condemning “idiots” who gathered to party. In Germany, cars with Heinsberg number plates have had their windows smashed and have been jeered as “corona spreaders”.But the novel coronavirus did not require social gatherings to have an overtly hedonistic character to flourish. In the week of 17 to 21 February, around 2,500 worshippers gathered at the Porte Ouverte Christian church in the Bourtzwiller district of Mulhouse, in Alsace, eastern France, for one of the most anticipated events in the evangelical calendar.They came from far and wide including from France’s overseas territories and Corsica, for a week of fasting and prayer – held annually for the last 25 years.“During the five days, the worshippers greeted each other, pecked each other on the cheeks, and held hands, sometimes while praying during the services,” Nathalie Schnoebelen, spokesperson for the church said afterwards.At the time, nobody thought more of it it would be almost a month before France went into a national lockdown. A small cluster of coronavirus cases had broken out in the unfortunately named Contamines ski resort in the Alps, but most coronavirus cases were still confined to China.“Contrary to what certain politicians have said, we didn’t ignore the basic rules because at the time there were not any,” Schnoebelen said.It was only after the congregation at the Porte Ouverte had dispersed and several worshippers tested positive for the coronavirus that concerns were raised. Among those who tested positive were the church’s main pastor, Samuel Peterschmitt (son of Jean Peterschmitt, who founded the Porte Ouverte church in 1966).In total 18 people from the Peterschmitt family tested positive for Covid-19. Samuel Peterschmitt’s son Jonathan admitted that worshippers had been in close confines for a week in “conditions relatively ideal if a virus wants to develop”.By the time it had been identified as a cradle for the virus, church worshippers had unwittingly passed it on to others. A nurse who had been at the Porte Ouverte is believed to have originated a cluster that contaminated 250 colleagues at Strasbourg University hospital, where she worked.Two retired worshippers returned to their home in the Ajaccio region of the Mediterranean island of Corsica. There are now at least 263 positive cases and 21 deaths on the island.A delegation of five church-goers from French Guiana, led by their evangelical pastor Gilles Sax, returned to the French overseas territory on the north-east coast of South America, on 25 February. Sax said he felt ill and was “trembling like a leaf” as soon as he returned..Other worshippers returned to cities and towns across France - Orléans, Besançon, Saint-Lô, Belfort, Dijon, Mâcon, Briançon, Paris. By 8 March, around 100 coronavirus cases had been linked to the church prayer week.Today, Mulhouse is one of the worst-hit areas in France with local hospitals overwhelmed by patients with the coronavirus.Christophe Lannelongue, until yesterday director general of the regional health authority, said: “It was a kind of atomic bomb that fell on us at the end of February and we didn’t notice it.”In Italy, which has recorded the highest number of deaths as a result of the virus, a Champions League football match between Atalanta and Spanish team Valencia on 19 February in Milan has been described as the “biological bomb” that turned the north of the country into the centre of the country’s outbreak.But scientists like Massimo Galli, the head of the infectious disease unit at the Sacco hospital in Milan, believe the spread is more likely to have accelerated in smaller clusters in the valleys around Bergamo.“We know Covid-19 is particularly efficient at transmitting within familial groups,” Galli told the . “In osterias crowded with elderly people, it would have found a perfect environment.”A similar gathering that brought together older and younger citizens preceded an outbreak of the virus in Italy’s south-east. On 3 March, hundreds of people gathered to pay their last respects at the funeral in San Marco in Lamis, a small city of 13,000. The 74-year-old man being buried had died after complications of what seemed to be a case of seasonal flu.Until that day, there had been seven cases of coronavirus infection in Puglia, the heel of Italy’s boot. The photos of patients in the red zones of northern Italy, and the first fatalities in Lombardy, seemed unimaginable, much like the national lockdown that was extended a few days later across the entire country.However, soon after the funeral, the man’s wife, who had just begun mourning the death of her husband, received a call informing her that her husband had tested positive for coronavirus.According to Ludovico Vaccaro, head of the public prosecutor’s office in Foggia, “a postmortem revealed the man was infected with Covid-19, but the result came out only after his body was released to the family for the funeral. They should have waited for the result of the test before handing over the man’s body.”Authorities said that, a few days earlier, the man had travelled to Cremona, in the north of Italy, to visit his daughter. Upon returning, he began to experience flu-like symptoms.According to doctors and investigators, the man had infected his daughter and wife before he died. At the funeral, they then came into contact with dozens of relatives and friends who gave their condolences to the family with handshakes and hugs, opening a gateway for one of the first clusters in southern Italy. As a result, 110 people were quarantined, dozens of whom tested positive for coronavirus. Two have died.The prosecutor’s office in Foggia has begun an investigation into what the governor of Puglia has called a “catastrophic error”. Behind one of the most dramatic cases of the virus’s spread is human error: if doctors had waited for the test results before handing over the body to family members, perhaps dozens of people could have avoided infection.Thinking of the coronavirus pandemic as a process that can speed up dramatically through human clusters also affects the considerations of policymakers who are plotting a route out of the current lockdown. When governments start to relax the current social distancing measures, can they also afford to allow large social, cultural or religious gatherings to go ahead?“The image of the Covid-19 epidemic as a curve has taken hold in the collective imagination, but my fear is that we are actually dealing with a loop,” said mathematician Popper. “As soon as restrictions are loosened, there could be new clusters that allow the spread to accelerate again.”The story of the pandemic in Vietnam serves as a cautionary tale.The south-east Asian country recorded its first cases of coronavirus on 23 January, a development that prompted swift action from officials. Vietnam kept many schools closed following the traditional lunar new year holiday late in January, and banned flights to and from China on 1 February. It also became the first country outside China to introduce a mass quarantine, when, on 12 February, officials isolated villages about 25 miles (40km) from Hanoi that were home to 10,000 people.Vietnam had detected no new cases for three weeks when a flight from London touched down at Hanoi’s Noi Bai international airport on 2 March. Among the hundreds of passengers onboard was a 27-year-old Vietnamese woman returning after a trip to attend exclusive fashion week events in Europe. Along with her sister, she had sat among guests at a Gucci show in Milan, and watched Yves Saint Laurent in Paris, documenting her travels on Instagram.The woman later told the New York Times that she had flown to Milan on 18 February and that, at the time, “no one was talking about the virus”. She travelled to Paris on 25 February, she added, and said she felt fine when she flew home that week.Days after arriving back in Vietnam, she developed a cough and tested positive for coronavirus, becoming the country’s “patient 17”. As of 7 April, Vietnam has 245 confirmed infections. The effort to trace and contain the virus has to start all over again.• This article was amended on 9 April 2020. An earlier version said it was the Champions League football match between Bergamo and Valencia on 19 February that was described as a “biological bomb”. The match, which was played in Milan, was between Atalanta and Valencia.

Now he’s working as a truck driver and regularly sleeps in his vehicle to avoid the risk of infecting his grandparents at home.“Looking at it now, I wish I hadn’t come back,” he said. “I would be coming out of lockdown now, and instead I’m just going into one.”He’s not alone. Fellow evacuee Matt Raw, 38, is enjoying life in lockdown in Knutsford, but said if he’d known how bad the outbreak was going to get in Britain, he would have stayed in China.“It feels a little bit like out of the pot, into the fire,” said Raw, who was living in Wuhan with his wife, Ying, and 75-year-old mother, Hazel, who suffers from dementia. “We made the wrong decision coming back here. We should have stayed in China.”He said the UK was “slow to act” and he was surprised the UK didn’t quarantine people flying into the country. “I just sat watching the news incredulously every single day. What was the point of putting us in quarantine?”He said he feels lucky to be living through lockdown in a spacious house with a garden, adding that his home in Wuhan was more cramped, and like many inner-city apartments in China, had little natural light.“We made our decision based on the best information available at the time. Hindsight is a wonderful thing.” he said. “Yes, I wish we’d stayed there. But by the same token, it’s also nice to be back over here again.”Jeff and Sindy Siddle, now in lockdown in Prudoe, Northumberland, also questioned whether leaving Wuhan had been the best course of action, but decided that – despite their nightmare journey – it was the best thing to do.“Overall I think we still made the right decision, but certainly we have asked the question,” said Jeff.The couple, along with their 10-year-old daughter, Jasmine, had been visiting Sindy’s family in a village in Hubei province, three hours drive from Wuhan, when the lockdown took effect.“Here, we can stay at home, we can do our jobs no problem,” said Sindy, an accounting assistant. “And Jasmine can do her school work. Back in Wuhan I was worried about her being the only one off school for a long time, but now all the kids are off, so I’m much more relaxed.”The one positive to come out of their Wuhan ordeal is their preparedness for the outbreak over here. “I think we are probably more cautious than a lot of the people in the UK because we’ve been through it before,” said Jeff.“We’ve been much more worried about it and we go out a lot less than our friends and family. We’re so worried we don’t go out beyond the garden, other than to the supermarket once a week, and we do click and collect to avoid going in.”The family originally faced being split apart, when Sindy was told she wouldn’t be allowed on the UK repatriation flight as she had a Chinese passport.Chris Hill, another Briton out in Wuhan, faced a similar problem after the Foreign Office was unable to confirm whether his wife and four-year-old daughter, both Chinese nationals, would be able to join him on the flight home.He decided to stay put.“I made the choice to stay because I didn’t want to risk leaving them,” said the 38-year-old from Sunderland, who has lived in Wuhan for 12 years and works as an English language teacher. “I did falter a couple of times and I would start having regrets. But I knew the lockdown wouldn’t last forever.”After nearly 76 days stuck inside, and tight restrictions on movement still in place, he’s confident he was better off in China. “I’m still glad I made the decision to stay,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4a879b5b777ed05ea4f1750756bf84b8bb9b5b9/256_0_3306_1984/master/3306.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=267d5b0ae0318b76cd59d5dbb4bf37e7","title":"coronavirus good news upside blessings covid positive","story":"Though our blessings may be well disguised in this pandemic, we must still count them“Everything bad in life is eventually a blessing.”I’m not sure where I read this – it may well have been in this wonderful novel by Taffy Brodesser-Akner. Like all the best epigrams, it is deeply wise, even if it overgeneralises. I can’t think of many instances from my own life where it isn’t true. A breakdown, a miscarriage, a job lost – they all led to better things.The phrase reminds me of something Winston Churchill supposedly said on losing the 1945 election. His wife apparently told him that defeat may well have been a blessing in disguise. “Madame, if this is a blessing, it is indeed well disguised,” he replied.And yet a blessing it was. Britain got Attlee, the welfare state, the NHS. Churchill got a rest, and then his swansong six years later. The rest is history.And so to the present.

There have also been calls for charter flights to be laid on to Argentina.A retired GP, Adrienne Newton, who has been stranded for weeks in Córdoba, 700km (435 miles) from Buenos Aires, said the embassy, had sent details at 1am on the day of a potential Air France flight from Buenos Aires.After protesting on Twitter that there were no connections to the capital because of the lockdown, the embassy tweeted details of a transport company “that has worked with other embassies, good luck!”, she said.“If other countries are contracting companies to transport its nationals to airports for flights home, why isn’t ours? Clearly it’s not a logistical issue. The flight yesterday with KLM left Buenos Aires half empty. I am starting to think this is not just a question of inefficiency,” she added.Meanwhile, the Foreign Office says that as long as the Pakistani government allows the national airline, PIA, to continue repatriation flights to London, there is no need to charter flights.It says it has already repatriated 4,000 of 6,000 people stranded in that country and was confident it could get thousands more home on PIA flights.However, in a conference call between the government’s South Asia minister, Lord Ahmad, the UK high commissioner in Pakistan and 10 MPs with large numbers of constituents stranded, it emerged there could be tens of thousands of Britons stuck in the country.Sam Tarry, the Labour MP for South Ilford, who was on the call, said: “I know the British high commission has been working very hard on this. They said that there’s going to be a series of more flights. They’re saying there are up to 20,000 people who want to come home.”He added that MPs on the call raised the issue of the “lack of faith” in PIA to deliver further flights after constituents paid out thousands of pounds for tickets on flights that were cancelled. But he was told that charter flights would be difficult. “They felt the issues were going to be that the Pakistan government were not going to open the international airspace to obviously allow charter flights to take place. So they were saying essentially the only option is PIA.”Afzal Khan, the shadow deputy leader of the House of Commons, said that British nationals in Pakistan were “still having to pay for the chaotic mismanagement of PIA and the British repatriation effort”, in a letter to Raab.​A spokesperson for the FCO said Lord Ahmad and the high commission were “in close contact with their Pakistani counterparts as well as PIA, the national carrier, to ensure that commercial flight routes are kept open between our two countries.”It added that there had been 17 flights between Pakistan for the UK since 4 April, “returning in excess of 6000 people to the UK”. It said it was working hard with the local authorities to keep flights “operational in the coming days.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3640c2cb134a1236e456d2136a5a5d0d0621148e/0_240_6454_3873/master/6454.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=acb89a2f7e1d245d6387b18cdca32183","title":"tech giants struggle stem infodemic false coronavirus claims","story":"Critics say efforts are too little, too late as research reveals vast majority of false claims appear onlineClick over to Google, type in “coronavirus”, and press enter.The results you see will bear little resemblance to any other search.There are no ads, no product recommendations, and no links to websites that have figured out how to win the search engine optimisation game. Government, NGO and mainstream media sources dominate.Algorithms and user-generated content are out gatekeepers and fact checking are in.Silicon Valley has responded to the “infodemic” with aggressive intervention and an embrace of official sources and traditional media outlets.Across the social web – on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, Instagram and Pinterest – search results related to Covid-19 are similarly predetermined.Instagram delivers a pop-up urging US users to go to the website for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) – or UK users to the NHS – rather than look at the memes and pictures tagged with #coronavirus.On Facebook, a dedicated “Information Center” includes a mix of curated information and official medical advice. On Pinterest, the only infographics and memes to be found on topics such as “Covid-19” or “hydroxychloroquine” are those made by internationally recognised health organisations, such as the WHO.It is a stark contrast to how social media platforms have dealt with misinformation in the past.US-based platforms, shaped by Silicon Valley’s libertarian ethos and protected by the first amendment, have long been reluctant to take a proactive editorial role or censor speech that could be considered political.They have had to be pushed, prodded, cajoled, protested, and shamed into addressing hate speech, anti-vaxx propaganda and the harassment of victims of mass shootings.On coronavirus, they have competed to be responsible and reliable sources of information. Yet still misinformation continues to adapt and spread, largely on social media.A conspiracy theory falsely linking 5G to the coronavirus pandemic has led to real-world consequences, including threats and harassment against telecom engineers and petrol bomb attacks on telephone poles.Carl Bergstrom, a University of Washington professor of biology who also studies and has written a book about misinformation, says the efforts of the social media companies are too little, too late.“They’ve built this whole ecosystem that is all about engagement, allows viral spread, and hasn’t ever put any currency on accuracy,” he said. “Now all of a sudden we have a serious global crisis, and they want to put some Band-Aids on it. It’s better than not acting, but praising them for doing it is like praising Philip Morris for putting filters on cigarettes.”Some of the more radical steps taken by tech companies include Twitter’s new policy to remove misinformation that contradicts official public health advice, such as tweets encouraging people not to follow physical distancing guidelines, and WhatsApp’s strict new limits on message forwarding.The platforms feel they can be much more aggressive on coronavirus misinformation than they have been on political misinformation, said Claire Wardle of the non-profit organisation First Draft.“There are no two sides with coronavirus, so they don’t have people on the other side saying: ‘We want this,’ the way you do with anti-vaxxers or political misinformation,” said Wardle. “They are freer to act.”It is also relatively simple and straightforward for the platforms to select trusted sources of authoritative information – the WHO, NHS, CDC, etc – without appearing politically biased.Wardle faulted the tech companies for not being better prepared for the crisis, however. Facebook has long ignored the conspiracy communities that organise using Facebook groups, such as anti-vaxxers, followers of QAnon, and people who believe 5G is harmful. Coronavirus misinformation is rampant in those communities.And while the scientific nature of the crisis may lessen some of the external political pressures over how to moderate speech, it also brings with it a slew of challenges. The coronavirus is brand new, and the scientific understanding of it changes daily.Bergstrom described this conundrum as an “uncertainty vacuum”. “Any reasonable authority will not give you a straight answer” to certain questions about the pandemic, “not because they’re trying to mislead you, but because they don’t know yet,” he said. Another complicating factor is that normally trustworthy sources are not providing reliable information.“We’ve seen the US government, particularly the White House, becoming a significant purveyor of misinformation around the virus,” Bergstrom said.Facebook and Twitter have removed posts by prominent and powerful people over coronavirus misinformation, including the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, but the real test of their resolve will be whether they ever take action against misinformation by Trump.“We planned for years for this pandemic, but we never realised that we would be fighting a war on two fronts,” said Bergstrom. “One against the pandemic, and one against all the disinformation and hate and fear that is being amped up and enflamed by political opportunists.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/427dea542b7d2c67f96fe24483437a2c2ffc072c/0_370_5548_3329/master/5548.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d22339a608fe0cfb952272c23e3f449","title":"call for schools to open in the summer after lockdown","story":"Children’s commissioner says schools will play an important role, but teachers and parents may oppose loss of six-week breakSchools should consider opening in some form over the six-week summer holidays to help children catch up with the curriculum – and to provide childcare for families who need to get back to work, the children’s commissioner has said.Anne Longfield said that when schools are allowed to reopen, they could be vital during the long summer holidays. “Whether they are open to all or not, schools do have a really important role, especially for vulnerable children over the coming months.” She added: “It would be really valuable, if the scientific advice says they can, to have schools consider opening in some form over the summer holidays to help children learn and catch up but also to offer them a safe place to play and socialise with friends. It would also provide vital childcare for families who need to get their incomes back up as they, hopefully, return to work.”Longfield said schools could bring in play, sports and youth workers to help supervise pupils.In a recent exercise to explore the public’s coronavirus concerns, the Commons petitions committee received numerous questions about whether schools should open in the summer holidays. It asked the government to outline its plans for the school year, including whether the summer holidays could be cancelled.Catherine McKinnell, the MP who chairs the committee, said: “Members of the public have been particularly concerned about education – how long schools will be closed, and some have queried whether school summer holidays will be changed as a result.”Teachers, however, regard the six-week summer holidays as non-negotiable. The National Education Union has issued advice to its independent school members saying it had “major practical and contractual concerns” about the reasonableness of such plans.The guidance points out that cutting short the holidays mean little or no break for staff in schools that have remained open for key worker and vulnerable children, and for teachers running online provision. Margaret Morrissey, founder of the pressure group Parents Outloud, said: “At the moment schools are open and providing online work. After this is over, we all, including children, need real holidays. Cancelling the summer holidays will cause more confusion and disruption. We should aim for term starting in the first week in September and life going back to normal.”Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the NEU, said: “The government is very clear, as is the NEU, that the scientific evidence needs to be the deciding factor on this issue. The Department for Education would have to ensure any return to full opening of schools is well-planned and organised, but this is not the issue for now.”A DfE spokeswoman said the government had announced a package of support last week, including additional funding and resources, to help schools deal with the challenges posed by coronavirus.

Both the deleted pages were accessed from online caches.Prof Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London, said the Chinese government had had a heavy focus on how the evolution and management of the virus is perceived since the early days of the outbreak.“In terms of priority, controlling the narrative is more important than the public health or the economic fallout,” he said. “It doesn’t mean the economy and public health aren’t important. But the narrative is paramount.”With the virus having infected more than a million people worldwide and caused heavy casualties particularly across Europe and the US, details about its origin and the first weeks of the pandemic – when there was a cover-up by local officials – may be considered particularly sensitive.“If these documents are authentic it would suggest the government really wants to control the narrative about the origins of Covid-19 very tightly,” said Tsang of the reports of new regulations.China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) appears to have published and then deleted new requirements that academic papers dealing with the origins of the virus be approved by China’s ministry of science and technology before publication.The university’s academic committee was expected to first go through the research “with an emphasis on checking the accuracy of the thesis, as well as whether it is suitable for publication,” the regulation said.Despite its name, the geosciences university announced elsewhere on its website that it was carrying out coronavirus research.A separate document obtained by the , which could not be independently verified, appears to be from the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University and also said publication of research into the origins of Covid-19 would need approval from the science and technology ministry.Another notice, which appears to have been published on 9 April by the school of information science and technology at Fudan University in Shanghai, called for “strict and serious” management of papers investigating the source of the outbreak.Papers could only be submitted for publication after being approved by a special office. Email, names and phone numbers provided on the notice suggested that office was part of China’s ministry of education.A source who alerted the  to cached versions of the websites, and who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said they were concerned by what appeared to be an attempt by Chinese authorities to intervene in the independence of the scientific process.The person said researchers submitting academic papers on other medical topics did not have to vet their work with government ministries before seeking publication.A technical analysis of the cached websites indicated that the posts were published on verified university websites before they were removed.  could not independently verify that they reflected a new government policy.The notices appear to be part of a broader push to manage research on the virus. The science and technology ministry said on 3 April that ongoing clinical research on the coronavirus must be reported to authorities within three days or be halted.In March China’s president, Xi Jinping, published an essay that included “tracing the origin of the virus” on a list of national priorities. It was referenced by the science and technology ministry shortly before the universities posted their orders. The Chinese government did not reply to a request for comment sent by the  to the Chinese embassy in Washington.While the exact origin of the pandemic is still not certain, one commonly held hypothesis is that it began following an interaction between a human and an animal at the Huanan seafood “wet market” in Wuhan.Scientists have said the virus probably originated in bats and then passed through an intermediary animal before infecting the first human.Scientists believe the transmission was similar to that in the 2002 outbreak of Sars. Some criticism of China has focused on why the government did not shut down wet markets after the previous outbreaks of coronaviruses.Kevin Carrico, a senior research fellow of Chinese studies at Monash University, said he was not aware of any specific recent change to rules for academic research in China in connection to Covid-19, but the documents were generally consistent with efforts by China to control the narrative of the pandemic.“They are seeking to transform it from a massive disaster to one where the government did everything right and gave the rest of the world time to prepare,” Carrico said. Carrico said those efforts had been evident in communications ranging from government pronouncements at the highest level to public sentiment on social media.“There is a desire to a degree to deny realities that are staring at us in the face … that this is a massive pandemic that originated in a place that the Chinese government really should have cleaned up after Sars,” he said.Around a month ago senior Chinese diplomats, officials and state media all publicly encouraged speculation that the new coronavirus could have come from outside the country. The foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian suggested without evidence that the US military might have brought the virus to Wuhan.

Deaths from the virus rose by 917 on Saturday compared with Friday to a total of 9,875.Fronting the daily Covid-19 briefing for the first time, the home secretary, Priti Patel, said the figures showed the “devastating impact of this virus”.Although there was a slight drop in numbers between Friday and Saturday, experts warned that the coming week could see a significant jump.“This is Easter weekend, and that will have affected numbers of reports of deaths,” said David Spielgelhalter, a Cambridge University statistician.“I would expect there will be a catch-up this week and a massive spike in numbers of daily deaths being reported on Wednesday or Thursday. Only in the following days will we see if we are reaching a plateau in deaths.”In her first-ever Easter audio message to the nation, the Queen on Saturday urged people to have hope and look forward to better times, with the words: “We know that coronavirus will not overcome us.”But with concerns growing that the peak may be some way off, and questions mounting over the government’s handling of the pandemic while the prime minister, Boris Johnson, remains in hospital, the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said parliament had to be recalled as soon as possible.In a letter to the Leader of the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, in which he demands urgent talks with the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, Starmer said there was “no substitute for parliamentary scrutiny” particularly “at this time of national crisis”.“The best decisions are those that are challenged and subject to scrutiny. And by that process issues can be resolved, mistakes quickly rectified and inidual concerns addressed. That will help save lives and protect our country. But if parliament is not sitting or functioning effectively that cannot happen.”All parliamentary business was suspended on 25 March because of fears that MPs would contract the virus while working in close proximity. There was also concern that they would spread Covid-19 when returning to their constituencies.While the parliamentary website says MPs will return to Westminster on 21 April, few believe there is any chance of this happening. But no alternative arrangements for virtual sessions have been announced.One senior Labour source said: “I don’t think this government wants parliament to return as it will allow MPs to focus on ways they are messing things up. That’s why they like daily press conferences. They give them a chance to control everything.”Patel said discussions were taking place over how parliament would resume and function. However, she insisted all focus was currently on dealing with the pandemic. “I think at this particular time, we have to focus the resources of government, all our energies, every single sinew of government, focusing on saving lives and dealing with this awful disease.”The SNP leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, said it was essential that parliament returned to work in a virtual form this week. This should include a virtual “question time” with whoever was standing in for Johnson, using a similar model to the video questions session with Nicola Sturgeon in the Scottish parliament.Blackford said he found it astonishing that he had yet to be asked to a confidential briefing on privy council terms by Downing Street. He also revealed that he had written to the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, more than two weeks ago raising concerns about whether money would get to the most needy but had had no reply. “This is simply not acceptable,” he said.The Tory MP David Davis, a former cabinet minister, went further saying MPs should return to Westminster in person as soon as possible and subject themselves to daily tests for Covid-19 if necessary. ”The House of Commons met when air raids were going on in the war. I think it needs to be reconstituted even if it means MPs being tested every day,” Davis said.The acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, Ed Davey, said the lack of parliamentary scrutiny at this time was “intolerable” and could not be allowed to continue.Meanwhile, the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, whose father was a bus driver in the capital, says in an article for the Observer online that he is exploring how protective equipment could be given to London’s transport workers. By the middle of last week nine London bus drivers had died from Covid-19.Asked to apologise for the lack of personal protective equipment, Patel said: “I’m sorry if people feel there have been failings.” She conceded that there had been “distribution issues” as a result of global demand for PPE and that there was now a “clear plan” for delivering it.Patel also launched a public awareness campaign aimed at protecting those at risk of domestic abuse. In the West Midlands alone, it was revealed that 400 domestic abuse suspects have been arrested in the last fortnight."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/058194d9881f7ebcefffa10d5ad30a6ccdde6e67/0_148_4500_2699/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a98f3d2dbb3bd6fb3326f5a44370af5e","title":"reveal cost of 35m unusable covid 19 tests health chiefs told","story":"Payment was guaranteed for antibody kits designed to show who was immune but they later proved wildly inaccurateSenior health officials are facing demands to reveal how much has been spent on millions of inaccurate coronavirus antibody tests, after it emerged that payments had been guaranteed even if the kits failed to work.Public Health England is also being asked todisclose which companies the tests came from and why payment was not made contingent on the tests proving accurate. A formal request for the details is being made in a letter by Greg Clark, the former Conservative cabinet minister and chair of the Commons science and technology committee.Britain ordered at least 3.5 million of the antibody home-testing kits, which are designed to detect whether someone has had coronavirus. The UK government talked up the potential of the tests last month, with Boris Johnson heralding them as a “game-changer” that could give iniduals a “green light” to go back to work. Health chiefs said kits could be made available through Amazon and Boots once they had been proved to work. However, all the versions of the tests proved to be too inaccurate to be used.Scientists have discovered that although the tests can show that a person has been infected with a coronavirus, they cannot adequately differentiate between the virus that is causing the current Covid-19 outbreak and other types of coronavirus –which just cause colds. They found that a range of devices all produced far too many false positives.“It does seem surprising that these tests were bought with a contract that wasn’t contingent on their usability,” Clark told the Observer. “In learning lessons through this crisis, it’s important for future contracts to recognise this risk.”Kathy Hall, director of Covid-19 testing strategy at the Department for Health and Social Care, revealed last week that the government was working to recoup money paid for the tests “where possible”. Asked iwhether payment was made on the assumption that the devices worked, she said: “Our overall strategy was to secure tests in order to get them validated. That meant ordering minimum volumes in order to secure them. And we wanted to make sure we had the opportunity to do that, so that was the strategy we took, yes.”Antibody tests are considered to be vital to moving out of the lockdown caused by Covid-19. They will show whether people have or have not been infected with the the Sars-Cov-2 virus. Health workers found to have antibodies would no longer have to worryabout being infected or infectious every time they display symptoms similar to those of Covid-19, for example.In addition, antibody tests will give scientists a far clearer picture of how far the Sars-Cov-2 virus has affected the British population, said of Cambridge University’s biostatistics unit. “Knowing how many of us have been exposed to the virus is important for calculating accurately the death rate of this virus among all who were infected. As importantly, the proportion of the population who still have antibodies and – we hope – immunity, has implications for what the future of the epidemic might look like.”These figures have been welcomed, albeit with caution, by scientists in the UK. Professor Keith Neal of Nottingham University, described the study as “good news”, because it suggested that significant numbers of people had developed antibodies and the overall mortality rate could be lower than current estimates.“The findings are dependent on the quality of the antibody test used, however, and it is important that similar antibody studies are done elsewhere and that results of the antibody tests from Porton Down lab in the UK are reported regularly without delay.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b287263b9d261b4f4b1ecfea99e6a02db857680/0_127_5836_3502/master/5836.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=584f2982444d9e676a144104e6342f70","title":"sub saharan africa g20 imf world bank debt relief coronavirus","story":"For more than two years the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have warned that sub-Saharan Africa stands on the verge of a debt crisis. Ever since commodity prices began to fall in 2015, the public finances of nations stretching from Nigeria to Kenya and Chad to South Africa have deteriorated.If China is the manufacturing centre of the world, Africa is its chief supplier of essential materials, from oil and copper to the rare-earth minerals used in mobile phones. As China’s manufacturing waned in the middle of the last decade, so did the crucial foreign earnings that keep African nations afloat.Making matters worse, an investment binge to build much-needed infrastructure left the continent with spiralling debt costs.The high rate of interest that sub-Saharan governments pay on their debts means that the cumulative stock of loans can be modest in relation to national income but still be unaffordable.This week, with the Covid-19 pandemic starting to have an impact on the African continent, senior officials at the IMF, the G20 and the World Bank will meet online for their spring conferences. To help them review the situation, research conducted by King’s College London and the Australian National University for the aid charity Oxfam found that more than half a billion more people could be pushed into poverty unless urgent action is taken to bail out the world’s poorest countries.Oxfam said the impact of shutting down economies to prevent the virus spreading would wreck vital industries and risked setting back the fight against poverty in sub-Saharan Africa by up to 30 years.If those governments attempt to intervene, as developed-world governments have, to support industries and communities suffering a sudden loss of income, then their public debts will soar and the world financial system will ultimately be threatened by debt defaults.Health systems in Africa are expected to be overwhelmed and what welfare systems that are in place will buckle under the strain. Even better-equipped systems in China, the US, UK and much of Europe have struggled to cope.For this reason, whichever way they turn, sub-Saharan governments are threatened by a financial collapse. Aid charities have already called for the IMF and World Bank to engineer a debt write-off to prevent such a situation arising. So far, the answer has been extra loans, albeit at low or zero interest rates, to bridge funding gaps in healthcare provision expected once the virus begins to make inroads.One of the reasons for resisting write-offs can be found in the way debts have built up over the past 15 years. Almost from the moment the G7 wrote off a large slice of developing-world debt at the Gleneagles conference in 2005, African nations have allowed their debt-to-GDP ratios to inch upwards. Encouraged by the World Bank, they have sought loans from major commercial banks and the bond markets.In the past six or seven years, the emphasis has switched to borrowing from China, in part to benefit from “free” advice on infrastructure projects, built by Chinese contractors. So a debt write-off by international public bodies like the IMF merely allows developing-world countries to keep paying their exorbitant private-sector debt bills and Chinese-backed development loans.Another barrier is the lack, with a few exceptions, of any transformation in the governance of sub-Saharan states, despite 20 years of solid (albeit debt-fuelled) growth.Many of the executives in aid agencies involved in debt relief make the point that corruption remains rife and inequality has increased, aided by developed-world lawyers, accountants and bankers who help African oligarchs stash their gains overseas tax-free.Then there are the pre-colonial tribes and nations, which cut across today’s borders and remain strong. They prevent post-colonial nations from developing strong governance and tackling corruption.A repeat of the Gleneagles deal is difficult when so little appears to have changed in the meantime. Fatigue among donors, and a sense that money hasn’t solved much so far, add to a sense of despair and fuel inaction.Yet, this is not a time for considering the moral hazards.

While traffic has dropped around the world, and with it nitrogen dioxide levels, there are widespread concerns over a rise in speeding drivers endangering those walking and cycling.Evidence suggests air pollution, including from exhaust fumes, significantly harms the survival chances of those with Covid-19. With pedestrians crammed on to narrow pavements, and acres of empty asphalt on roads, lower speed limits, filtering residential streets to prevent rat-running, introducing emergency cycleways and expanding footpaths are among potential solutions.Tabitha Combs, a lecturer at the University of North Carolina, is collating examples from around the world, adding to growing calls for more such measures.“No matter where a city is on the spectrum of supporting walking and bicycling, there are actions that are within their reach, and precedents of those actions being implemented in peer cities around the globe,” she says.In Philadelphia officials closed 4.7 miles of Martin Luther King Jr Drive, a wide riverside boulevard, to motor traffic on 20 March following an 1,100-strong petition, as leisure trails became overwhelmed by residents seeking their daily exercise.Sydney, Perth and Adelaide in Australia, Chapel Hill in the US and Calgary in Canada are among the cities that have made pedestrian crossings automatic in some districts so that people do not have to press a button.In Berlin, a slew of streets have new, wide bike lanes in place of some motor vehicle lanes. Bogotá has ambitiously replaced 35km of traffic lanes with new emergency bike lanes using temporary cones, mirroring the Colombian capital’s TransMilenio bus rapid transit network, an alternative to people using public transport. Workers adjust the lane width depending on usage.In late March the bicycle mayor of Mexico City proposed 130km of temporary bike lanes. In the meantime, a 1.7km temporary lane, running 8am-7pm, has been installed on a major thoroughfare.Cycling UK’s policy director, Roger Geffen, has suggested junctions could be redesigned while roads are quieter, saying temporary cycling infrastructure “provides a good experience to new commuters, while claiming that kerb space when it’s not under pressure and not as disruptive to make changes”.Hackney council in east London is the first UK local authority openly planning to temporarily “filter” its streets, using bollards and planters to prevent rat-running while maintaining access for emergency vehicles and residents. Councillor Jon Burke says it will decide which streets to filter on 20 April, before starting work.Burke told the  pedestrians stepping into the road to socially distance from one another are put at risk by speeding drivers, whose number appears to be increasing during the lockdown. He says construction workers can operate while socially distancing, and it is one sector with excess capacity during the pandemic.“We are running around making sure vulnerable people have enough food but we aren’t doing something about the 40,000 people that are dying each year because of air pollution,” he says. “We haven’t got weeks to deliver it, we need to deliver it now, because this crisis is happening now.”Transport engineer Brian Deegan says 20mph streets, bikes for key workers, and “core corridor” emergency cycle routes would help more essential staff cycle, while removing guard rails on pavements and extending pedestrian space using traffic cones would help those on foot. The London Cycling Campaign has also come up with short, medium and long-term proposals to improve active travel in the capital during the crisis.• Coronavirus and volunteering: how can I help in the UK?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7200859fb487792e1336e456cb1a1b0c126614c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c3503426875ecac8614c1ddb0a46742","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:British prime minister Boris Johnson has said he owes his life to the doctors and nurses at St Thomas’ hospital in London, where he is being treated for coronavirus. He was admitted on Sunday and remains in hospital. Johnson, who spent three nights in intensive care, said he “can’t thank them enough”.For the first time in history, all 50 US states have come under disaster declarations. Wyoming became the 50th state, following approval by Donald Trump on Saturday. The US Virgin islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico are also under the declarations, which enable federal funds to be used by state and local governments.Opposition parties across the UK and senior Conservatives have united to demand that parliament be recalled. In a letter to the leader of the Commons, newly elected Labour leader Keir Starmer demanded urgent talks with the Speaker, saying that there was no substitute for parliamentary scrutiny particularly “at this time of national crisis”.A World Health Organization official urged Belarus to impose measures to contain coronavirus, as the country enters “a new phase” of the virus. President Alexander Lukashenko has been downplaying the need for restrictive measures in recent weeks, and said that drinking vodka, driving tractors and bathing in a sauna could help fight the virus. Patrick O’Connor, who led a WHO delegation to Belarus this week, warned that the virus had begun spreading through communities in the capital Minsk and parts of the country.The Kremlin said that the “huge influx” of coronavirus patients was beginning to put a strain on Moscow’s hospitals. The city and other regions have been in lockdown for almost two weeks, but the hospitals in the capital are still stretched. “The situation in both Moscow and St Petersburg, but mostly in Moscow, is quite tense because the number of sick people is growing,” Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.Seven countries have demanded that China address their concerns that Africans living in Guangzhou city are being mistreated and harassed. The countries claim African residents have been targeted out of fear coronavirus could spread through imported cases. In recent days Africans in the city have reported being ejected from their apartments by landlords, being tested for coronavirus several times without being given results, and being shunned and discriminated against in public.Pope Francis urged people to “not yield to fear” and focused on a “message of hope” as he led an Easter eve mass in an empty St Peter’s Basilica on Saturday. The vigil was scaled back due to coronavirus, with just two dozen attendees compared with the usual 10,000, a smaller choir, and the elimination of several traditional features such as baptisms and processions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a6b4a26dedddcc9013f3b2af671f0b4c0873145/0_0_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff2a5c74fd59ec5ea51476e652fcced2","title":"wuhan celebrates its liberation as covid 19 lockdown ends","story":"The people of the city where the first virus was first detected are taking their first cautious steps outside after being confined for three monthsLast week the city of Wuhan celebrated the end of its nearly three-month lockdown. Flower beds and trees were planted in parks across from hospitals previously overwhelmed with panicked and sick patients. The streets have been scrubbed clean.Before midnight last Wednesday, when restrictions barring people from leaving the city were officially lifted, state news outlets sent drones into the sky to film lit-up buildings and bridges. Cars lined up at motorway tollbooths, waiting to leave. Drivers described feeling finally “liberated”. Several housing developments had flags declaring them “virus free”. One said: “Decisive battle, decisive win.”But for many in the city of 11 million, where at least 2,500 have died from the coronavirus, it has not feel much like a release. “We haven’t felt much of a change,” said Zhang, 50, who lives in the district of Wuchang and has been quarantining at home. “For regular people, the lockdown is not over.”Wuhan’s exit from lockdown is part of a broader effort by Chinese officials to assure the public that life can return to normal and that authorities have beaten the virus.“The high-profile re-opening of Wuhan is meant to send a signal that China is getting back to business and work can be resumed. But despite the government efforts, people will be still very cautious,” said Ho-Fung Hung, a lecturer in political economy at Johns Hopkins University. “People can’t easily forget the government’s early missteps in causing the crisis, particularly for those who lost their loved ones or have their health severely impaired.”In the city, many shops remain closed, with restaurants reopening only for deliveries. Schools, cinemas and other entertainment venues remain shut. Many neighbourhoods are still sealed off, with only those with permission from their employers able to leave regularly to go back to work. While people are freer to come and go, there are constant checkpoints where residents must show their “health code” and have their temperatures taken. Zhang says he has to go through four just to get to his local bus stop.The continued restrictions, which authorities have said will be lifted in a “gradual and orderly manner”, are an indication that the epidemic – while much eased– is not over.Many residents are still worried about the number of asymptomatic patients, as well as released patients who retest as positive but do not show symptoms. Others worry about the number of imported cases, as Chinese travellers return from infected countries. Yesterday the National Health Commission reported 46 new cases from the day before, all but four of them from abroad. Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital, has seen no new cases for seven days.“We are still worried and will stay inside. There are still people who have come out that are retesting positive,” said Zhou, 68, who lives in Hankou and who had ventured outside of her home for the first time in two months. Others said they were eager to return to work but still worried about the possibility of a second outbreak. “Going back to normal doesn’t mean the virus disappears,” said Iris Yao, 41, who also lives in Hankou.At a recently reopened convenience store just outside Wuhan Youfu Hospital near the Huanan Seafood market where cases were first detected, a store owner said she would not have returned to work if she did not have to. “If I don’t come out, I can’t make money and I cannot eat. If I could, I would stay home,” she said.Several said their neighbourhoods, after loosening restrictions, had become strict again. Some suspected new infections had emerged. Others said they did not trust what was officially reported. Coco Han, 22, who was infected with the virus in January, remembered how her compound in Wuchang still posted its “virus free” sign even when she was at home sick.But residents also said they believed the government had made up for early missteps, including being slow to alert the public about the virus and suppressing doctors who attempted to warn residents.Chen, 60, from the city of Yichang, which was also placed under strict travel curbs at the beginning of the outbreak, had just returned to Wuhan to go back to work. He was proud of the government’s efforts to contain the virus. “The government and the country banded together,” he said. “The party really puts the people first.”Across the city, the after-effects of the epidemic are visible. At a funeral home in Wuchang district, relatives of those who have died over the last two months are still coming to retrieve their ashes. A tent has been put up to house those waiting, with plastic chairs spaced one metre apart. Local residents said that in recent weeks the funeral home had had to limit the number of people who could come to 100 a day. Zhang, whose daughter is studying in Hong Kong, does not want her to come back yet because he does not believe it is safe enough. “Some people believe the disaster is over, but there are also people who don’t see it that way,” he said.“The danger here is not necessarily bigger than in other Chinese cities, but it is there. From regular people to the government, everyone knows it.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d3cfbda2a7a0fcb476054adbb4d9c2af05872ec/0_5_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8e47c6f0eb4865ff1b3d69ff20dcaac","title":"how are you affected by coronavirus in the south west of the uk","story":"If you live in the south-west England or Wales, we’d like to find out about the impact of coronavirus on you and your community.

There have been over 1.3m confirmed cases, and over 75,000 deaths. Billions of people are confined to their homes and stock markets have plummeted. Here is how the crisis unfolded. Note: Data for the first 20 days is reconstructed from early WHO situation reports and the later progress of the disease. The case counts for the remaining days comes from the open source Johns Hopkins data repository.There are some tentative indications that “the curve is flattening” in Italy and Spain, as the number of new cases each day falls. But the UK and the US have so far seemed to be about two weeks behind Italy in the progress of the disease, so their worst days may well be yet to come. Similarly, although the Chinese city of Wuhan is gradually reopening after two months of lockdown, it is by no means clear when or how other countries will begin to return to normal. In the meantime, scientists are working on several fronts to develop treatments and possibly vaccines some of those trials may start to show results in the next month or so, but a viable vaccine could still be 18 months away.Data caveatsThe case counts come from data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, one of the most reliable sources. The figures reflect the available data at the time this article was first published. Occasionally there are differences in the case counts between the Johns Hopkins website dashboard and the open source data repository used here. For the first 20 days, the evolution of cases is reconstructed from early WHO situation reports and the later progress of the disease. But the data should be treated with caution throughout as countries take different approaches to testing, and scientists believe many people may have been infected with the disease without suffering symptoms."},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

I am travelling to take up a care baton from my sister, who has been with vulnerable family members for almost a fortnight.“Essential Travel Only,” read some motorway signs I pass.Most of the other traffic on the M50 with me are trucks there are very few cars.At the first checkpoint, I explain why I am travelling, and am waved through at once and wished well. The second checkpoint comes as I exit the motorway to Mountrath, Co Laois. This time I explain I am a journalist on assignment, and although I offer to show my official letter from my employer, the garda doesn’t want to see it. It is a low-key policing approach one that is clearly dependent on respectful co-operation from the public to be truthful about the reason for their essential journey.At Mountrath the bunting from St Patrick’s Day still flies over the town’s streets, as do Tricolours. The town is buzzing with local traffic, and parking is difficult to find. Johnny Purcell, who owns Purcell’s Bar on the Main Square, is sitting out on a bench, talking to a friend. His bar is in a building more than 300 years old.“A lot of small bars like mine won’t open up again when this is over,” he says. “They might own their premises, as I do, and not have to pay rent, but there are still rates and electricity bills to pay. We have a lot of customers who are older people living out in the country. When will they ever come back into town again?”Seán Sharkey, owner of Conroy’s Pharmacy, says: “Who would have thought two months ago that we’d have a glass screen up between us and customers, and only one person allowed in the the shop at a time?”Michael Keegan, who owns a butchers shop, praises the support of local people for their continued custom. “But all the big orders are gone that I’d had from hotels and restaurants. One weekly order alone was for €1,500. At the moment I am just trying to keep the doors open.”Newly unemployedMother and daughter Margaret and Clodagh Nolan are waiting to use an ATM. They have both lost their jobs due to Covid-19.“I worked at the toll plaza and was let go last week, because there is so little traffic,” Clodagh says. “There is only one lane in three open now, and that’s automatic.”“I clean houses for older people, and my work stopped two weeks ago,” Margaret says.Unless the many groups of people gathered together chatting on the streets of Mountrath are all sharing the same household, it seems social distancing is not being routinely practised.Alcohol appears to be a common purchase. One man exits Centra carrying just a case of beer. Another has a case of cider. “We are all drinking much more now at home, and much more often,” says one woman in Centra with several bottles of wine in her basket who does not want to be named.In Nenagh, Co Tipperary, the signs in the windows of closed businesses tell their own stories of the inidual toll on people’s lives.“Due to fatigue and staff shortages, I am unable to continue business for the next few days,” reads a sign in Denis’s Butchers.“It is with a heavy heart that we have decided to temporarily close the bookshop,” reads a sign at Ryan’s Independent Bookshop.“These are unknown times for us all, so the main thing is to pull together for now and follow all the advice,” reads a sign at A Sportsman’s Dream.Philip Talbot’s menswear and protective clothing shop has been operating since 1947. He took over from his father in 1976, and runs the shop by himself. “Apart from Christmas, I have never closed longer than three days,” he says. “I have never, ever had a time like this. It’s unbelievable. I am the only staff, and I own the property, so costs are low, but there is no turnover.”Postage\u0026nbsppaidTalbot shows me an ad he placed this week in the local paper, the Nenagh . “Stuck at home?” it reads. “I will post (free of charge) any necessary items wanted, eg pyjamas, bedroom slippers, bed linen or Wellingtons, safety boots or rainwear or anything needed from my shop.”“I wanted to do something for my customers,” he says. “And I have had three calls already.” The day before he posted a pair of trousers to a customer. “She wanted to pay the postage, or go halves on it, but I insisted.” He paid the €9 postage himself.Jacqueline Redmond is out shopping, wearing a mask and gloves. “I am wiping everything,” she says. “I even wipe the letterbox after the post arrives.” She has lost her job as a cleaner at a local school.At Nenagh Fruit and Veg, Mark Counihan says: “I haven’t had time to bless myself.” There is a sign for duck eggs for sale, and one on a shelf of home-made jam that asks customers to return the jars. The shop is offering a free home delivery on Fridays for orders over €20. “Business here is up 50 per cent since all this started,” Counihan says. “People are still panic buying.”Back on the motorway heading west, there is virtually no traffic. I drive for almost 20 minutes and see fewer than half a dozen vehicles travelling in either direction.The toll plaza in Limerick is down to one automated lane. There is another checkpoint a few kilometres beyond the plaza, on to the M18 leading to Clare and Galway. I explain I am travelling for family reasons. “Mind yourself, and safe journey,” the garda says, and waves me on.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4227127.1586631715!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"co clare teenager seen by garda%C3%AD carrying unlicenced rifle","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe male, aged in his late teens, was spotted by gardaí in the Kilmihil area near, roughly half way between Ennis and Kilkee.

Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council said the decision was taken on Saturday following consultation with gardaí and as a result of “concerns raised with social distancing compliance”. In a statement on its website, the council said the areas will remain closed until further notice “to best align with Covid-19 restrictions and in the interests of public health”. Gardaí confirmed the locations had been closed. “The decision has been made by the relevant county council and not local gardaí,” a spokesman said. Parking restrictions were put in place by the council at Sandycove, Vico Road and the Killiney Beach and Dart station car parks earlier this week. The move came as members of the public were urged to comply over the bank holiday weekend with restrictions on movement introduced to combat the spread of the virus. The Government on Friday said the restrictions, including that people should remain with 2km of their homes, would stay in force until at least May 5th. New powersGardaí have been given new powers to instruct people to return home, if they are travelling outside of 2km of their home without a valid, essential reason, with penalties for people failing to adhere to the orders.Deputy Garda Commissioner John Twomey on Saturday said public compliance with the travel restrictions had been high so far this weekend. However, gardaí on checkpoints were still noticing significant numbers of cyclists travelling more than 2km from home while exercising and people travelling excessive distances to get their shopping.Mr Twomey said gardaí stopped one man travelling from Tipperary to Limerick to buy a trampoline.“My message to the general public is to stay at home, stay safe and do not venture out unless it’s for one of the exceptions provided for. Remember, we’re all working together to try stop the spread of Covid-19,” he said.Mr Twomey also urged elderly and vulnerable people to contact their local garda station or community policing unit if they have any needs or concerns. “We will help you in whatever way you can.” The PSNI on Friday said it had fined a number of people for breaching the social distancing rules in Northern Ireland.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"South Korean health officials said it remains unclear what is behind the trendMove is likely to be part of attempt to control the narrative surrounding the pandemicDelayed response to coronavirus outbreak had consequences for Chinese city and the worldChina\u0026rsquos appointment like making \u0026lsquopyromaniac the town fire chief\u0026rsquo, says watchdogVirus lockdown lifted on Wuhan but imposed on Suifenhe on Russian frontierSurge in new cases in city-state and Hong Kong leads to tough new restrictionsCleric (78) to be freed from jail after Australian court quashes child abuse convictionsAuthorities work to stave off second wave amid struggle with ongoing outbreaks in WuhanScientists say survey shows damage more widespread than any preceding eventsMaha Vajiralongkorn was given permission to self-isolate with a 20-member harem in BavariaTokyo at centre of outbreak that has seen cases nearly double over past weekHospitals and morgues full as hundreds of deaths reported in city of GuayaquilDay of mourning sees country suspend all entertainment, observe three-minute silenceMove in Shenzhen after Beijing banned wildlife trade over outbreak\u0026rsquos link to Wuhan market\u0026lsquoWe must not be afraid to hold this regime to account,\u0026rsquo writes Cardinal Charles BoAs cases rise, experts warn that hands-off approach to containing outbreak is failingPrivileged and middle-classes continue to live comfortably in larger towns and citiesObservers sceptical of Pyongyang\u0026rsquos claim that country has had no cases of Covid-19Video adds to Taiwan\u0026rsquos grievances, including accusations health body ignored its early virus warningsCoronavirus crisis drives many poor workers to walk hundreds of kilometres to villagesStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4227106.1586610913!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"deleted pages suggest china clamping down on coronavirus research","story":"A New York Times investigation looks at how China’s expansive propaganda system aimed at foreigners is looking to reshape the coronavirus narrative around the world.

Photograph: Roman PilipeyEPAChina is cracking down on publication of academic research about the origins of coronavirus, in what is likely to be part of a wider attempt to control the narrative surrounding the pandemic, documents published online by Chinese universities appear to show.Two websites for leading Chinese universities appear to have recently published and then removed pages that reference a new policy requiring academic papers dealing with coronavirus, also known as Covid-19, to undergo extra vetting before they are submitted for publication.Research on the origins of the virus is particularly sensitive and subject to checks by government officials, the notices posted on the websites of Fudan University and the China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) said. Both the deleted pages were accessed from online caches.Prof Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London, said the Chinese government had had a heavy focus on how the evolution and management of the virus is perceived since the early days of the outbreak.“In terms of priority, controlling the narrative is more important than the public health or the economic fallout,” he said. “It doesn’t mean the economy and public health aren’t important. But the narrative is paramount.”With the virus having infected more than a million people worldwide and caused heavy casualties particularly across Europe and the US, details about its origin and the first weeks of the pandemic – when there was a cover-up by local officials – may be considered particularly sensitive.“If these documents are authentic it would suggest the government really wants to control the narrative about the origins of Covid-19 very tightly,” said Mr Tsang of the reports of new regulations.PublishedChina University of Geosciences (Wuhan) appears to have published and then deleted new requirements that academic papers dealing with the origins of the virus be approved by China’s ministry of science and technology before publication.The university’s academic committee was expected to first go through the research “with an emphasis on checking the accuracy of the thesis, as well as whether it is suitable for publication,” the regulation said.Despite its name, the geosciences university announced elsewhere on its website that it was carrying out coronavirus research.A separate document obtained by the , which could not be independently verified, appears to be from the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University and also said publication of research into the origins of Covid-19 would need approval from the science and technology ministry.Another notice, which appears to have been published on April 9th by the school of information science and technology at Fudan University in Shanghai, called for “strict and serious” management of papers investigating the source of the outbreak.Papers could only be submitted for publication after being approved by a special office. Email, names and phone numbers provided on the notice suggested that office was part of China’s ministry of education.Cached versionsA source who alerted the  to cached versions of the websites, and who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said they were concerned by what appeared to be an attempt by Chinese authorities to intervene in the independence of the scientific process.The person said researchers submitting academic papers on other medical topics did not have to vet their work with government ministries before seeking publication.A technical analysis of the cached websites indicated that the posts were published on verified university websites before they were removed.  could not independently verify that they reflected a new government policy.The notices appear to be part of a broader push to manage research on the virus. The science and technology ministry said on 3 April that ongoing clinical research on the coronavirus must be reported to authorities within three days or be halted.In March China’s president, Xi Jinping, published an essay that included “tracing the origin of the virus” on a list of national priorities. It was referenced by the science and technology ministry shortly before the universities posted their orders. The Chinese government did not reply to a request for comment sent by the  to the Chinese embassy in Washington.While the exact origin of the pandemic is still not certain, one commonly held hypothesis is that it began following an interaction between a human and an animal at the Huanan seafood “wet market” in Wuhan.Scientists have said the virus probably originated in bats and then passed through an intermediary animal before infecting the first human.Related: How did coronavirus start and where did it come from? Was it really Wuhan’s animal market?TransmissionScientists believe the transmission was similar to that in the 2002 outbreak of Sars. Some criticism of China has focused on why the government did not shut down wet markets after the previous outbreaks of coronaviruses.Kevin Carrico, a senior research fellow of Chinese studies at Monash University, said he was not aware of any specific recent change to rules for academic research in China in connection to Covid-19, but the documents were generally consistent with efforts by China to control the narrative of the pandemic.“They are seeking to transform it from a massive disaster to one where the government did everything right and gave the rest of the world time to prepare,” Mr Carrico said. Mr Carrico said those efforts had been evident in communications ranging from government pronouncements at the highest level to public sentiment on social media.“There is a desire to a degree to deny realities that are staring at us in the face ? that this is a massive pandemic that originated in a place that the Chinese government really should have cleaned up after Sars,” he said.Around a month ago senior Chinese diplomats, officials and state media all publicly encouraged speculation that the new coronavirus could have come from outside the country. The foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian suggested without evidence that the US military might have brought the virus to Wuhan. – Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4206213.1584564281!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu sets out proposals for close uk ties after brexit talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Union chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and the British prime minister’s Europe adviser David Frost in Brussels on March 2nd. Photograph: Oliver HosletReutersThe European Union released a draft of its hoped-for future relationship deal with Britain on Wednesday, setting out ambitions for a tight relationship on trade and security.The 440-page document crosses several of Britain’s red lines, spelling out the bloc’s ambitions for Britain to agree “uniform implementation” of state subsidy rules, with the European Court of Justice remaining the adjudicating authority.It also makes reference to the so-called “level playing field”, provisions to ensure fair competition by keeping rules aligned, which London has already rejected.“The Parties recognise that the establishment of conditions that ensure a level playing field between the Parties is necessary for trade and investment between the Union and the United Kingdom, ” the draft reads.The EU’s draft envisages reciprocal access to waters for fishing rights, with negotiations held each year by December 10th on fishing opportunities for the following year, another contentious point.The UK negotiating team said it had also sent a draft to the EU. This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4227085.1586605180!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"fintan o toole coronavirus has exposed the myth of british exceptionalism","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThere is now the terrible possibility that Britain may match or even overtake Italy and Spain as the country in Europe that suffers most from the coronavirus pandemic Photograph: Peter MorrisonGetty Images.There is now the terrible possibility that Britain may match or even overtake Italy and Spain as the country in Europe that suffers most from the coronavirus pandemic. This tragedy has a political, as well as a biological, epidemiology. Those seeking to trace its path may look back on a telling moment – paradoxically the one at which the government finally changed course and fell into line with most of the rest of Europe.On March 20th, Boris Johnson announced the closure of pubs, clubs and restaurants. Even as he did so, however, he made it clear that this decision was an assault on the national character.“We’re taking away the ancient, inalienable right of free-born people of the United Kingdom to go the pub,” he said. “And I can understand how people feel about that.” Lest his anguish be in any doubt, he underscored the point: “To repeat, I know how difficult this is, how it seems to go against the freedom-loving instincts of the British people.” The message was – what exactly? You must not go to the pub but your right to do so is “inalienable” (which is to say absolute and irrevocable). You must stay at home but, if you so do, you will be a disgrace to your freedom-loving ancestors.The Sun reported the prime minister’s remarks rather differently: “Mr Johnson said he realised it went against what he called ‘the inalienable free-born right of people born in England to go to the pub’.” In this version, the freedom to go to the pub was conferred by genetics and history, not on the “people of the United Kingdom” or “the British people”, but on “people born in England”. It does not apply to Scots, Welsh or Northern Irish people and certainly not to the 9.4 million people living in the UK who were born abroad. It is a particular Anglo-Saxon privilege.LudicrousAnd since we are in the terrain of the ludicrous, the Sun’s version actually made more sense. There is, of course, no ancient and absolute right to go to the pub – inns and public houses have been regulated in England at least since the 15th century. But what Johnson was really evoking was a very specific English sense of exceptionalism, a fantasy of personal freedom as a marker of ethnic and national identity.That exceptionalism is not, alas, mere rhetorical self-indulgence. It helped to shape official policy towards the Covid-19 crisis. It lies behind both the idea that there should be a distinctive British response to this global challenge, and the assumption that there was something peculiarly unnatural in expecting Brits to obey drastic restrictions. Its legacy is the globally discredited policy of “herd immunity” and the late introduction, squandering Britain’s head start, of the lockdown.NotionThe prime minister himself has long cultivated the notion that he does not just espouse this freedom-loving exceptionalism – he embodies it. In the early stages of the crisis, Johnson’s admirers could see it as his Finest Hour, the moment when his Churchillian posturing would become real and he would save his country. When the prime minister was hospitalised, his overwrought friend and fan Toby Young confessed in the Spectator to “a kind of mystical belief in Britain’s greatness and her ability to occasionally bring forth remarkable iniduals, who can serve her at critical junctures. I’ve always thought of Boris as one of those people – not just suspected it, but known it in my bones.”FreedomBeing drunk on freedom is one way for the chosen people to “do their own thing”. Adopting a distinctive national approach to a global pandemic is another. The myth of a unique and defining love of personal freedom as a badge of nationhood underpinned a profound reluctance to impose life-saving restrictions on movement and social gatherings. Other people might put up with that sort of thing, but not the English. On the altar of this exceptionalism, lives have been sacrificed.This innate, genetic resistance to conformity is a myth. This is obvious from the persistence of an equal and opposite cliche of Englishness: the queue. George Orwell could rhapsodise “the gentle-mannered, undemonstrative, law-abiding English” and “the orderly behaviour of English crowds, the lack of pushing and quarrelling, the willingness to form queues”.The anthropologist Kate Fox wrote: “During the London riots in August 2011, I witnessed looters forming an orderly queue to squeeze, one at a time, through the smashed window of a shop they were looting.” Orderliness is just as prominent as waywardness in the English self-image – which suggests that neither of these truisms is ancient, inalienable or worth a damn when you are making policy in a time of plague.ExceptionalistThe exceptionalist “freedom-loving instinct” has little to do with history and much more to do with current politics, specifically the politics of Brexit. Johnson described as “magnificent” a 2014 book by the arch-Brexiter Daniel Hannan called How We Invented Freedom – “we” being the Anglo-Saxons. Hannan expressly reclaimed the idea of exceptionalism, the freedom-loving Anglo-Saxons being the exception especially to European slavishness. Brexit, as he argued, was one imperative of this dichotomy. Tragically, a notion that the UK could ignore the World Health Organisation and do its own thing with the virus was another.Covid-19, as Johnson himself discovered in the most awful way, doesn’t make exceptions. The threat is universal. And the shield against it – the NHS – is cosmopolitan and global. There are 200 different nationalities represented in its ranks by 150,000 doctors, nurses and ancillary staff. One consolation in this disaster is the realisation that Britain is exceptionally lucky to have them. – Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons april 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Coronavirus latest news: NHS facing equipment shortages as death toll rises among healthcare workersNHS hospitals on brink of running out of gowns to protect medics from coronavirus\u0026#39Infect the young and isolate those at risk\u0026#39 - One German scientist\u0026#39s plan to end the lockdownDeaths in UK rise by 917 as 11-year-old has died from the virusCosmetic surgeons breaching lockdown rules to visit clients\u0026#39 homes \u0026#39I owe my life to the NHS\u0026#39, recovering Prime Minister tells friendsThe inside story of Boris Johnson\u0026#39s coronavirus nightmare - and how Tintin is helping him recoverGive young people shares in companies that Government bails out, says former No 10 adviserGovernment advice on coronavirus lockdown backed by public, poll shows\u0026#39We can do it faster and bigger\u0026#39 - How the private sector plans to solve Britain\u0026#39s coronavirus testing crisisHow NHS doctors turn to WhatsApp to understand the coronavirusFemale staff at BBC \u0026#39put through humiliating trial to justify equal pay\u0026#39Britain\u0026#39s Got Talent, first auditions review: just the buoyant, feelgood escapism we all needFears for vulnerable children as those at risk of abuse become \u0026#39out of contact\u0026#39 during lockdownAirline seat cover company making PPE for medics during coronavirus crisisHackers pretending to be art dealer convinced museum to pay them £2m for John Constable paintingNHS hospitals trial anti-malaria drug endorsed by Donald Trump to treat coronavirusHow same-sex shopping helped Panama flatten the coronavirus curveComment: It\u0026#39s time to start loosening the lockdownChristians banned from consecrating bread and wine during live-streamed Easter servicesWorld Health Organisation chief accused of failing to record three cholera epidemics in home countryWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"can do faster bigger private sector plans solve britains coronavirus","story":"It was a phone call between Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, and executives at AstraZeneca that might yet prove a turning point in Britain\u0027s coronavirus testing crisis.Offers of simplifying the process and doing things faster were tabled by the pharmaceutical giant, which believes it can already test in batches at least three times bigger than other Government centres.Ultimately if the country wants to get to 150,000 or 200,000 (tests a day), we want to be able to get there as well, says Sir Menelas Pangalos, the company\u0027s executive vice president.However, voicing strong opposition to what he describes as a wild-west culture of false dawns, he added: Right now, baby steps, before we can run. Initial Government reticence to support from the private sector has evaporated since Matt Hancock set the daunting target of increasing testing to 100,000 a day by the end of the month.As a result, a refit has taken place at breakneck speed inside Cambridge Biomedical Campus\u0027s Anne McLaren Laboratory where more than 60 experts from AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline and the university are now aiming to provide up to a third of the Government\u0027s tests. The Cambridge pharmaceutical scene - Britain\u0027s scientific equivalent of Silicon Valley - has never had it so busy. At its main lab, AstraZeneca are testing antibodies and treatments for an array of existing drugs for other ailments. Five years\u0027 worth of work is being crammed into the space of months, and a breakthrough, he says, over a treatment or vaccine is possible within six to 18 months.However, he added: There\u0027s a lot of anecdotes right now. We call it the wild west, because everyone is so desperate to find something and then they are getting very excited about very small numbers of patients. What I would like to see is some proper studies done, which are controlled and well done... until I see that sort of data, I\u0027m not going to get excited about anything.Sir Menalas, one of Britain\u0027s leading scientists, says cautiously that there will be therapies to keep patients out of intensive care.As we start to understand the biology of the virus better and the different stages of progression through the life cycle of the virus, I do think there are some therapies that will help keep patients out of the intensive care unit, or keep them off ventilation, which obviously as you get more progressed, your prognosis gets worse, he added.The reason I\u0027m hesitant is that you see the headlines on chloroquine and azithromycin, and it\u0027s unfair. He is optimistic over the new Anne McLaren Laboratory testing site, which he believes will dovetail with the three Lighthouse Labs cited as key by the Government.Sir Menelas added: I do think the Cambridge centre will over time become a fourth centre. It\u0027s not competing. it\u0027s complementary. We are trying to create capacity for the UK, purely to help, and I think just the work we have done over the past few months, makes it easy to get up to speed quickly, and get the Cambridge site able to test 30,000 times a day, hopefully by the end of April, early May.AstraZeneca, which have had a direct conversation with the health secretary and told him their services were free, have already been hard at work fast-tracking testing regimes for their own staff.The medicines we make treat asthma, treat COPD, the disease of the lung, Sir Menelas said. They help with breathing, heart function, kidneys and pancreas. Some of the key areas affected by Covid-19.It\u0027s incredibly important we are able to supply our patients with our medicines... As a consequence of those conversations we\u0027ve ended up saying actually why don\u0027t we, with GlaxoSmithKline and Cambridge University, just build up the capacity for what we\u0027re doing to give the country capacity.The private sector believes it has an advantage over other testing labs because it works at a larger, more industrial scale. Other testing technology only allows assays (samples) to run 96 at a time, but because we\u0027re starting from the bottom up we are already doing 384 at a time, Sir Menelas explained.So, just by doing that, we are more than tripling the throughput of what we are doing so if we can then convert the other sites from 96 to 384, that speeds things up and increases capacity. Britain has been criticised for lagging behind Germany in its testing numbers, but the 53-year-old says comparisons are unfair.To be fair to the UK, Germany has a diagnostics industry that does this for a living, he added. We don\u0027t have a diagnostic system of scale in the UK. I think it\u0027s a little unfair and very easy to Monday referee on what we could have done differently.I think it highlights the importance of having some of these industries within your country in terms of moving quickly, but I think seeing how the country is responding, working together and trying to solve it, is a testament to how great this country is.And indeed the world, because everyone is doing their utmost. Forget about what their business is, let\u0027s solve what\u0027s in front of us and get back to normality as quickly as we can... AstraZeneca is not trying to help itself. It\u0027s trying to help the country, and ultimately the world. GSK and Cambridge are trying to do the same.The race is now on to find treatments, however, and at the separate lab in Cambridge, antibodies will be key to a breakthrough, he believes, as they can be used as a vaccine and a treatment. Testing there is being done in unison with America so work can take place 247.We need to know who has an immune response and who has the virus, he added. That is important and the other thing is getting a therapy. That is the other thing that we are doing in parallel. We are taking existing medicines that we have today that we use to treat asthma, COPD, diabetes, heart failure, cancer and we are seeing whether any of those could be useful for treating against Covid-19, taking existing medicines to treat Covid-19. And another thing further down the road, but more likely to work, therapies that are targeting Covid-19 specifically such as antivirals, antibodies.When asked when Britain can finally start to breath easy over the crisis, he said: China\u0027s coming out of lockdown in Wuhan, having come down with it in November, added Sir Menelas, who previously worked at Pfizer. I think social distancing and testing is the short-term answer, but I think it will take time. And ultimately we\u0027ll need a therapy - that\u0027s going to take six to 18 months.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus diary postcard wuhanwhat really happened","story":"The guard at the station eyes my ticket: Beijing to Wuhan, the locked-down ground zero of the coronavirus pandemic.“You sure? No mistake?” he asks. “No mistake,” I say.My colleague and I disinfect our seats with a wad of wipes the minute we get on the five-hour high-speed train.I worry coming to Wuhan will change my “green” health code – a contagion risk profile, which determines the difference between going out to dinner or government quarantine. When I get there, traffic is sparse, though busier than I expected. I chat with people in a park, out for their first strolls after nearly three months indoors.I walk by Huanan seafood market (pictured below), where experts think the virus emerged, and find it sealed with sheets of corrugated metal, wrapped in police tape, and patrolled by officers. At the end of the day, I check my health code again: Still green. Whew.Exiting my room, I bid good morning to a hotel cleaner in a hazmat suit and head out.Cai Yao, 34, tells me his mother’s symptoms appearing in late January worsened quickly she only returned home two weeks ago.“For a whole week, she couldn’t eat. She coughed up blood, and her nose would bleed,” he said. “It really looked like she was on her deathbed.”Hospitals were full, so they drove daily across town for outpatient treatment, waiting 10 hours in line with many others. Mr Cai doesn’t know what shots were administered, but is grateful she recovered. Many families weren’t so fortunate. At the peak, there were 5,000 bodies waiting to be scorched into ash at one of Wuhan’s eight crematoriums, a worker tells me – a far cry from two dozen per day before the pandemic. His shifts began at 5:30am and ended after dark. Such accounts cast doubt over China’s reported death toll of about 3,300, especially as fatalities in Italy, Spain, France, the UK, US, and Iran exceed that figure. Virus deaths are so sensitive that at a cemetery – which grieving families haven’t been allowed to visit – a phalanx of uniformed officers and plainclothes minders surround me and my colleague. When I try to leave, they grab my bag, drag me backward, and snatch my phone.“What if you report about this incident?” one sneers, when I ask for it back. They accuse us of sneaking in and staying hours to take photos. Actually, we’d walked in the front gate, registered our details after a temperature check – as per usual in coronavirus China – and roamed for half an hour.After threatening (“can’t leave until the ‘investigation’ is over”) and berating us (“stupid imbeciles”) for about an hour, they let us go upon taking photos of our ID documents. Our driver says the police also harassed him and recorded his details.This is the same “welcome” treatment I’ve gotten investigating human rights violations in China – Xinjiang concentration camps, Muslim cleansing in Ningxia, the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre. Residents have told me they don’t think they’ll ever learn the truth of what happened. All this leads me to ponder what the authorities are trying to hide – even as China crows success. Freedom! Sort of. Lockdowns lift today in Wuhan. But things are far from normal.Transport links start coming back online, and major roads are unsealed. Cars started lining up at city limits before midnight.But quotas have been imposed – for instance, only 1,000 a day are allowed to enter Beijing from Wuhan. Even then, people need to be approved after showing a clean bill of health. Some housing compounds continue barring residents from going out, or limiting them to two hours a day. Barriers made of corrugated metal sheets have yet to all come down. Same with cement road blocks. I spy a man in a hazmat clamber over and sneak away!Disinfecting tents continue to dot the city. Getting in and out of my hotel still requires being sprayed with medical-grade alcohol: Traffic is much noisier today, though nobody seems fussed by a sign that life is resuming.Requirements to depart Wuhan apply to me, so I head to the city’s No. 7 hospital to get my throat swabbed for a nucleic acid test to determine whether I’ve been infected with the coronavirus. I don’t feel ill, though asymptomatic cases are now being discovered. Hopefully, I’m not one of them…At the hospital entrance, a thermal facial recognition camera takes my temperature. Amazingly, this works with a face mask. I don goggles and feel even more claustrophobic.Medical staff have protective suits, shoe covers, face shields one spritzes sanitiser over his latex gloves. It\u0027s haunting to be inside. So many people died here, staff say.Doors are sealed in the fever clinic, dozens of oxygen tanks sit outside, and an extra CT machine is in a trailer out front.Next step: Registering via a mobile app to be approved for return and quarantine confirmation by Beijing authorities. There\u0027s a long queue – at least 11,000 have already applied, and there’s a daily departure limit.I feel glad to pass an open wine shop. I stock up might be here a while. Tons of virus origin rumours floating around. Scientists are working on this, too, and have found genetically similar coronaviruses in bats and pangolins.A seafood vendor tells me she heard patient zero was a man in his seventies selling wild ducks at the now-closed Huanan market.Others deny any Huanan link, and tell me unspecified foreigners brought it during the World Military Games last October, held in Wuhan. Wu Jianming, 29, a glassworker says: “Bats are impossible – when I was a child, we often played with them.”By far the most prevalent theory is that the Americans brought the virus. One man says the severity of infections is evidence the virus emerged in the US.“It’s so bad there,” he said. “Do you think this is still the Wuhan flu?” The idea was seeded by a Chinese official, who suggested the US military brought the virus. Beijing has been busy reframing the narrative to ert public anger from government missteps over the outbreak, stoking nationalism by portraying China as the world leader in virus response and buying the world time.Some, including officials and politicians in the US and UK, see it differently – that a botched initial response exacerbated global spread.We bundle into a van with other foreign media for a government-arranged trip to Leishenshan Hospital, a temporary field hospital.Hospital officials say thousands have recovered, and only 15 patients remain. We’re shown an empty virus ward with sealed rooms waiting to be disinfected. Many medical staff have transferred out.“All data are reliable please rest assured,” they say, when asked whether China’s reported figures accurately represent the outbreak. Doubts persist over the numbers. Hospitals were immediately overwhelmed there were multiple revisions to confirming cases and those not tested – despite having what doctors strongly hinted was the virus – weren’t included in the death toll.With so many curbs still in place, it’s clear authorities remain concerned. Even as Wuhan has begun reporting zero deaths, the hospital won’t be dismantled until next year. I get my virus results back.

It angers me.”When staff discover, usually through their own efforts, that they are not being paid the same as their colleagues for equal work, a pay grievance is their first recourse.  It is understood they have to gather evidence to support their claim, including justifying examples of their work, and present this to a panel which will “judge your entire career and your value”.BBC staff and a representative from outside HR specialist Croner sit on the panel, and fears have been raised over staff who may suffer anxiety having to endure the process.  This system can take months to produce a decision, which may go against those hoping for pay parity, leaving few options for staff.“The BBC pushes back anything until you take it to tribunal,” one member of staff explained.   They added:  “You have these big hitters that have done it, Carrie and Samira.  They’re on hundreds of thousands.  “There are these little fish in the big pond like me, and probably thousands of others, who are scrimping to get by, and that difference makes a massive difference in our lives.”As well as these grievances, figures reveal a rise in complaints of bullying and harassment made by women at the BBC. This total rose from 27 complaints made by women in 201718, to 48 in 201819. Overall bullying and harassment complaints have been rising each year at the BBC since 201617.  However, concerns have been raised over disparities which can see men receiving bigger pay packets than women  for the same work. In a high-profile case, Ms Ahmed brought to light her own pay disparity, receiving £440 per Newswatch show compared to the £3,000 per show earned the Jeremy Vine for Points of View.  She won her employment tribunal in January this year.Two years before this, Ms Gracie resigned as China editor after finding she was being paid far less than North America editor Jon Sopel.A BBC spokesman said of the grievance process: “This process was established and agreed with the BBC’s joint unions. The panel consists of a BBC manager from a different part of the BBC to the complainant and an independent expert from outside the BBC who has the casting vote.We have worked hard to improve support, communication and the overall time taken with these cases from where we started in 2017. We need to be thorough but we try our best to balance that with speed and transparency.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"five european supertrawlers target uk waters fishing industry","story":"Five European Union supertrawlers are fishing in British waters despite the coronavirus lockdown threatening a UK industry already struggling to cope with the collapse in the seafood market.Three huge ships from Holland and two from France were tracked fishing off the coast of Scotland where they are netting tonnes of fish.Greenpeace, which monitors the movements of these vast socalled fishing factories, said the vessels set off after Britain imposed its lockdown.The arrival of the five boats, all over 260ft, represents a marked increase in such ships operating in  UK waters compared to a year ago, a Greenpeace spokesman said.The UK fishing industry, worth £989 million a year, is reliant heavily on exports, with 70 per cent of its annual catch destined for Europe and Asia.However, the coronavirus crisis has hit the hospitality trade hard, in turn delivering a devastating blow to the worldwide sale of fish, particularly shellfish.Chris Thorne, of Greenpeace UK, said: “With the vast majority of the UK’s local and more sustainable fishing fleet stuck at port, unable to work because of a collapse in demand, these destructive supertrawlers are still plundering fish in UK waters. “The crisis has left the UK’s fishing communities high and dry, but in the meantime industrial fishing continues with business as usual.”Jeremy Percy, director of NUFTA, which represents Britain’s under 10m fishing boats which make up 80 per cent of the UK fleet, said the British fishing industry already needs help from the government to cope with the collapse in trade in fish caused by the pandemic.“It is of course all the more galling when the vast majority of the under ten fleet is tied up and some facing financial ruin to see that the large fleet of mainly Dutch super trawlers is fishing hard in our waters off the west coast of Scotland,” he said.“I\u0027m unaware of the impact of the virus on our naval service’s ability to police these operations, but with such a powerful fleet active when we are otherwise engaged in fighting Covid-19 this undoubtedly puts unnecessary additional pressures on our forces.”A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs said ministers were aware this was a “challenging time” for fishermen and fish processors and they were working the industry to better understand the impact and whether further steps are needed.“Any decisions about giving access to fish for vessels from the EU, or any other coastal states will be a matter for the UK to decide.”Last month, the Scottish government announced a £5 million assistance package to help the country’s 650 seafood companies affected by the collapse in the market for shellfish. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"german scientist predicted european epidemic calls end lockdown","story":"A leading German epidemiologist who predicted the coronavirus crisis in Europe is now calling for governments to end the lockdown.Prof Alexander Kekulé warned the virus was about to engulf Europe and publicly urged Angela Merkel’s government to start screening international travellers as early as January.But he now believes the lockdown is in danger of going on too long and causing more damage than the virus, and has drawn up a plan for how it can be safely lifted.“It’s impossible to wait for a vaccine,” Prof Kekulé told The . “The quickest we could have a vaccine ready is in six months. Based on experience, I’d say the reality is closer to a year. We can’t stay under lockdown for six months to a year. If we did that our society and our culture would be ruined.”Prof Kekulé, the head of microbiology at Halle University, has been the Cassandra of Germany’s coronavirus crisis. As early as January 22, he called for travellers to be tested for the virus at airports and borders. He appeared on national television, but his warnings fell on deaf ears. Now the world is in the grip of a widespread pandemic:“If we had started testing and following the chains of infection in January, we could have contained the epidemic here without resorting to a lockdown,” he says. “If you can get to people by the time they’ve infected 20 people you can stop it. But by the time it’s 400, there’s no chance.”By March, when the virus had Germany in its grip, he was calling for the border to be closed and schools to shut down. “At that stage a lockdown was the only option to slow the spread and prevent hospitals being overwhelmed,” he says. “But now we have to consider the possibility that a long lockdown may end up doing more harm than the virus.” Angela Merkel has dampened hopes of restrictions ending any time soon, telling Germans this week: “We must not be reckless now. We could very quickly destroy what we have achieved.”Not for the first time in this crisis, Prof Kekulé finds himself on the opposite side of the argument from Mrs Merkel. When he urged her government to do more about the virus in January, she chose to wait and see. Now he says the lockdown can be safely lifted by following a simple three-point plan. First, he says, the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions who are most vulnerable to the virus must remain in isolation.“We have to persuade them to stay at home, and that means we have to find ways of making it bearable for them, such as apps that will allow them to order their shopping or continue their social life,” he says.“If they are determined to go out, fine — but they have to wear full FFP medical standard masks.”That brings us to the second point in Prof Kekulé’s plan: a move from social distancing to what he calls “smart distancing”.“We need to adapt distancing to the situation. A cashier at a supermarket check-out, for instance, is going to be exposed to infection all day. He needs to wear a mask, he needs proper hygiene measures. A taxi driver needs to learn not to touch his face after handling money.”Basically, we all need to get used to wearing facemasks, Prof Kekulé says. “If you look at Hong Kong, they managed to avoid a major outbreak there and they’re very close to Guangdong in mainland China, which was badly affected. One of the key differences was they started wearing facemasks early in Hong Kong.”An ordinary surgical mask is sufficient for those who are not especially vulnerable, he says, and there’s no need to wear one while going for a walk. “In an open air setting a mask isn’t that effective. But in any indoors setting when others are there, we should all be wearing them.”He’s even come up with a slogan to convince people, “Kein Held ohne Maske”, and an English version: “Be a masked superhero”.Thirdly, and most controversially, Prof Kekulé says we have to let the young get the virus.“People under 50 are very, very unlikely to die or get seriously ill from the coronavirus,” he says. “We have to let them get infected so they can develop immunity.”Essentially, this is a return to the herd immunity plan once backed by the UK and widely seen as discredited. But Prof Kekulé argues that once the outbreak is under control and hospitals are not overwhelmed, there is a place for it.Children are least at risk so the lockdown should be lifted at schools and kindergartens first, he says — a plan already adopted by Denmark, which plans to reopen schools after Easter.Germany has won plaudits for testing more than other European countries, carrying out around 100,000 tests a day, but Prof Kekulé says that\u0027s not enough. He says it needs to be raised to 500,000.He concedes that some younger people do get seriously ill and die from the coronavirus. “What happens in these cases is their immune system overreacts and starts attacking their own body,” he says.“But this only happens with a very small number of people. I know it sounds heartless but we may have to live with these deaths.“Herd immunity is our only option now. We cannot wait for a vaccine. We have to find a way to live with this virus.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2020/04/02/TELEMMGLPICT000227911612_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth","title":"jeremy corbyn has slithered free thanks sad demise two jewish","story":"Financial problems didn’t prevent the Chronicle or the News from exposing and shaming the Labour Party for becoming Britain’s premier safe haven for anti-Semites under Mr CorbynIt is a bitter way to go. One of The Jewish Chronicle’s last exclusives will be the news that Labour’s new leader, Sir Keir Starmer, has issued an apology for the anti-Semitism rife in his party.In the same week, the Chronicle, said to be the oldest Jewish newspaper in the world, announced that it is going bust, as has Jewish News, its main rival. They have outlasted Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader only by a whisker.It isn’t an easy time for any private media. Even before the coronavirus recession, the Chronicle was burning through well over £1  million a year. I was an occasional reader online, but never a subscriber, so I am probably part of the problem.Still, financial problems didn’t prevent the Chronicle or the News from exposing and shaming the Labour Party for becoming Britain’s premier safe haven for anti-Semites under Mr Corbyn.Both papers reported assiduously on Labour’s moral decline, revealing and tracking the phenomenal range of incidents as they emerged, loudly holding the party to account, highlighting its failure to act and voicing the community’s growing fears. Their stories were frequently picked up by the national press. It is hard to imagine how it would all have played out without either of them there.Now, unless a rescuer appears, there will be no established Jewish media around to report on the Equality and Human Rights Commission’s investigation into Labour anti-Semitism. Not only will Mr Corbyn have managed to scuttle back under his rock before facing the music the Labour Party will also escape scrutiny from its two fiercest media critics.Sir Keir has promised action to match his words. What a shame that the country’s main Jewish media outlets won’t be around to hold him to his pledge.The coronavirus and China’s disastrous cover-up in the early stages have prompted some soul-searching over whether the UK has got its policy right on China. The short answer is no.To that end, it is surely worth revisiting the question of whether it is prudent to continue with the Government’s strategy of merely “mitigating” the security threat posed by Huawei, the telecoms giant, rather than avoiding it entirely by barring the company from our 5G network development.Last year, the Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Centre, a government body – though funded by Huawei – that assesses the security of the company’s products, stated in its annual report that it had identified “concerning issues” in the company’s software that pose “significantly increased risk” for UK telecoms. Despite the HCSEC having flagged the exact same issues a year before and Huawei promising to throw $2 billion (£1.6 billion) at fixing them, it reported that the company had made “no material progress” and that the HCSEC “has not yet seen anything to give confidence” that it can do so. The agency declared, therefore, that it could “provide only limited assurance that the long-term security risks can be managed”. The Government ignored this warning and, since it was published, has given the go-ahead for Huawei’s flawed technology to become further integrated in the nation’s critical infrastructure.Read more | Huawei 5G stormIn the meantime, the company has embarked upon a global campaign donating tens of thousands face masks to virus-hit countries. Huawei, remember, vociferously denies close links with the Chinese state, which rather begs the question of how and why it is sitting on enormous stocks of spare face masks. All of this is extremely puzzling.At some point, Parliament will vote on legislation that will implement the 5G decision. The House of Commons Defence Select Committee has said it will conduct an inquiry into the issue. It would surely be helpful, therefore, for the HCSEC to update its report. Has there been any progress? Can the agency provide any more reassurance, as the Government seems to think it can? The Cabinet Ofice promises the report will emerge “in due course”. While older updates came out in July, last year’s evaluation was published in March. Given its political and commercial relevance, most of the work should surely have been done before the lockdown. Yet there is nothing. Are the poor techies worried about embarrassing their political masters?For corporate high achievers stuck on back-to-back conference calls during the lockdown, the Financial Times has helpfully published a feature on the “urgent” need to “look and sound good” on video chats. Its main advice is to avoid wearing pyjamas and to imagine you are on TV (the latter seems more likely to irritate colleagues than “own the room”). There is no mention of workers’ increasingly urgent need for a haircut. But its best suggestion, among the cod science and cited “psychological studies” is this: skip the video calls and use a phone.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

For me, it actually makes the drama. People are fascinated. The scientific advances we have today are absolutely phenomenal.”Ms La Plante, whose extensive research has taken her to murder trials and forensic laboratories, said: “Juries - and criminals - watch crime series, just like the rest of us, and these often give an unrealistic view of what is possible with forensics…. I’m fascinated by the way that DNA is presented in court and the way that the jury reacts to this sort of scientific evidence, which is not always beneficial because I think jury members now have unrealistic expectations of what DNA can deliver.“They often watch all the crime shows and have no real conception of the reality of it and you get a feeling that they\u0027re sitting there thinking, ‘well, with that DNA, the police should have got that decision… faster. Why have they taken so long?\u0027 But the reality is, it isn\u0027t quite as simple as that, because… the scientists must put in hours of painstaking work and care to prove without doubt that evidence is correct. Miracles do happen, but they take longer than most audiences have patience for.”She expresses her views in seven podcasts, titled “Listening to the Dead: The Secret World of Forensics”, in which she and her friend Cass Sutherland, former detective and CSI in the politan Police Force, discuss their own experiences and talk to forensic scientists about real-life CSI. Her publisher, Bonnier Books, releases the sixth and seventh podcasts this month, coinciding with her new book, titled Buried.Ms La Plante has been dubbed the Queen of Crime Drama for page-turning novels and high-rating screen thrillers. Television hits include Prime Suspect - in which Helen Mirren made her name as tough–talking DCI Jane Tennison - and Trial and Retribution. Her authentic depictions of crime scenes and police procedures are achieved through meticulous research.In the podcasts, which include blood and DNA analysis, she says that she could not have completed her work without the assistance of the police, especially Sutherland. As forensic science is continually evolving, she has created these recordings to give the public a better understanding of it.In one podcast, she says that, contrary to what crime stories show, forensic science cannot predict an accurate time of death: “The pathologist is probably the most recognised forensic scientist. They have been portrayed in so many films and books that it’s almost a cliché to have them chatting to detectives about two minutes after they arrive…‘What time did they die?’ ‘I’d say between 5 and 5.15pm.\u0027There is no possible way that they could come up with that… In fact, one pathologist once said to me.. ‘the only way you can get an exact time of death is if the assailant has smashed the victim’s watch’. Then you’ve got it, ‘they died at 6.25pm’.”She adds: “I feel that often forensics is never given any dramatic input… They say ‘oh, we’ve got the matching fibre, oh yes, they were definitely there’. It is much more intricate and… dramatic than we realise.”Among real-life cases explored is the 2002 Soham murders of Jessica Chapman and Holly Wells, both 10, by Ian Huntley. Ms La Plante attended the trial and will never forget “that despicable killer on the stand being questioned and lying”.She observes that “the ability to lie never ceases to amaze me”: “How many areas of film footage I’ve seen and watched. ‘Were you at that street at that time?’ ‘No, I was not, I was with my mother.’ Lies! And without any apparent feature changing… It’s only… science that can actually say he was lying…That is incredibly dramatic to me, more so than wanting to deal into the psychology and the reason why a psychopath kills. They are sick human beings. To me, the fascination in crime is discovering the perpetrator, how he did it, why he did it, when he did it. I don’t want to know his life, I don’t want to know his ins and outs… The police procedure fascinates me.”In a podcast on entomology, the study of how insects and bugs interact with corpses, Ms La Plante is particularly fascinated by Dr Martin Hall of the Natural History Museum discussing the extraction of evidential DNA from insects that have drunk blood and blow flies acting as sniffer dogs to help locate a corpse.Discussing the “brilliance” of such science, she jokes: “I may be actually stealing some of his ideas in my latest novels.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"museum bible attempts convert critics forgeries blunder","story":"When a $500 million Bible museum opened its doors in Washington DC in 2017, its billionaire founders anticipated it would be an innovative, global, educational institution.In fact, the Museum of the Bible quickly became known for a string of embarrassing headlines - the most recent of which was the admission that fragments of the Dead Sea Scrolls it has exhibited for years as one of its main attractions are fake.Now, the museum is using these same controversies to win over its critics as it attempts to rebuild its image.But after a string of controversies, the turning point came when an investigative firm hired by the museum found that its much-vaunted Dead Sea Scroll fragments were forgeries - most likely inked on ancient leather sometime in the 20th century to look like the original Hebrew bible.To demonstrate the museum\u0027s commitment to transparency, its chief curator, Jeffrey Kloha, has now announced plans for an exhibition showcasing how the investigators made the discovery.The museum says that the extensive research it funded into the forgeries produced a rigorous protocol which will help to identify other false fragments.Mr Kloha is also leading the charge in purging the museum of any other items of dubious origin.The museum\u0027s founders - the Greens, a wealthy Evangelical Christian family - recently committed to returning a staggering 11,500 objects or insufficient provenance to officials in Egypt and Iraq.Steve Green, the museum\u0027s chairman, acknowledged he had made mistakes in accepting the veracity of objects without sufficient evidence in his early days as a collector. He said the museum had received a great deal of criticism over the years as a result, some of which was justified.If I learn of other items in the collection for which another person or entity has a better claim, I will continue to do the right thing with those items, he said in a statement. Former critics have praised the museum for its recent attempts to rectify its errors.Kate Fitz Gibbon, from the Committee for Cultural Property, a US non-profit, criticised Mr Green for failing to do “the due diligence when acquiring artefacts but praised his candid admission and transparency now.Mr Green said he would continue to learn from the sound protocols of more established museums going forward.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"supermarket chiefs urge healthy people shop store free home","story":"Otherwise healthy people should not be clogging up supermarket home delivery services which are being prioritised for the vulnerable, retailers have said.Thousands of those deemed to be especially vulnerable to coronavirus have struggled to book a home delivery despite being told they have been made a priority.However, figures obtained by The  show that Britain’s supermarkets are capable of delivering to at least 2.2 million households a week – a much higher number than the 1.5 million who are on the Government’s list for the most vulnerable.Supermarkets have pleaded with customers to come into the store to free up home delivery slots for this group as many have struggled.One man with a form of blood cancer was forced to make 200 phone calls before finally securing a slot. Charities have urged supermarkets to work quickly to prioritise those most at risk of catching coronavirus, warning that the decision to go into a supermarket could prove fatal.The British Retail Consortium (BRC), the trade body for supermarkets, said shoppers needed to look out for each other and consider whether they can help others with their shopping. Tesco and Iceland have previously asked “healthy” people to shop in-store wherever possible.He added: “Everyone should consider whether there are vulnerable neighbours they can support by shopping on their behalf. These measures will help alleviate the pressure on delivery services and ensure that slots are available for those with the greatest need.”The Government has drawn up a list of 1.5 million people who have been told to self-isolate for 12 weeks which was passed to supermarkets to help them ensure they could give them home delivery. Supermarkets have massively increased delivery capacity over the past few weeks as they rush to meet this demand.Tesco can now deliver to just over 800,000 households a week, an increase of 145,000 over the past few weeks. Asda has 700,000 slots, an increase of 250,000, while Sainsbury’s has increased its capacity by 100,000 to 472,000. Ocado has 250,000 delivery slots a week but has been forced to stop serving new customers.Waitrose would not give an overall figure but said that by next week it will have increased capacity by 50 per cent, with 25 per cent of slots being reserved for vulnerable customers.Currently 41 per cent of its slots have been used by this group. Morrisons said it will have increased delivery capacity by 60 per cent by the end of the month. It has added a fast-track section to its online queue system for vulnerable customers.However, many vulnerable people have still reported problems getting delivery. Earlier this week, The  reported on the case of Ally Boyle, 48, who has blood cancer and spent days and hundreds of phone calls trying to contact Sainsbury’s.His order was eventually fast-tracked after several hours on hold. Gemma Peters, chief executive of Blood Cancer UK, the charity, said that, although supermarkets had risen well to the challenge, people were “being forced to choose between going hungry and making a trip to the supermarket that could be fatal if they pick up the coronavirus there”.In addition to home delivery, supermarkets are also introducing further measures to help the vulnerable. Morrisons has hired 500 people from charity shops, which are currently closed, to help people with their shopping and at checkouts.Waitrose has introduced a “volunteer’s shopping card” which can be purchased by vulnerable people and given to helpers who are doing their shopping for them.Tesco has made 75,000 delivery slots available immediately to people on the Government’s list.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"time no definitive answersno end sight wrong message business","story":"Knowing the man, Boris Johnson will return as soon as is physically possibleBoris will be back. Knowing the man, that will be as soon as is physically possible. But even if he is not working in the full sense, his presence will be felt and his views will be communicated. We can give thanks for that.But in truth, there never was a crisis of governance. The overhyped melodrama of cabinet dissension and uncertain leadership was not going to produce – as it might well have done in more excitable nations – a breakdown of civil authority. For a brief moment we might have gone on to vacuous autopilot in the understandable confusion and shock. But this is a very grown-up, stable country with an extremely competent, assured administrative class. Nobody was going to run amok and everybody with any degree of responsibility was going to behave well.There has been gossip about disagreement and power machinations within the Cabinet and some speculation about paralysis as a consequence of this argy-bargy. Most of it can be ignored: a few supposedly well-connected sources mouthing off to journalists whose business it is to make politics seem as exciting as possible. (For “exciting”, read “vicious”.) Of course Cabinet ministers disagree with one another. That’s what politicians do. You would not want to live in the kind of society where there was no possibility of disagreement among those in power.But this situation is not, perhaps inconveniently for my own trade, a political problem. It is a medical emergency that carries enormous economic implications. The questions that need to be asked are factual (what will work?), and moral in the highest sense (how much risk to life is acceptable?) rather than strictly political (who should be in charge?).On the last of these – how to decide who should be running the government – there has also been some rather pointless controversy. Much has been made by commentators stuck at home with too much time on their hands, of the lack of any specific provisions in Britain’s constitutional arrangements. When American friends ask me who is the designated successor to Boris Johnson, I have to explain that the prime minister, not being elected to his office by the population at large but by his party, is simply the first among equals, blah-blah.Total Covid-19 vaccines in developmentHere at home, the US Constitution, with its legally rigorous rules for succession is being commended as superior to our rather rackety ad hoc solutions. Be careful what you wish for. The vice president, who automatically steps up, has often been chosen as the presidential candidate’s running mate for crassly opportunistic reasons: because he or she “balanced the ticket” or was expected to haul in a difficult cohort of voters.Add to that the fact that the third in line to the presidency is none other than the Speaker of the House of Representatives who is, as often as not, from the opposition party. Not only does the country lose the president it voted for, but it ends up being governed by a party it rejected. So there is a lot to be said for impromptu agreements especially when there is a general understanding that those who govern will behave reasonably – as there is, in this very fortunate polity.If much of the political chatter at the moment is contrived and phoney, it might be because there is a desperate need to talk about what is happening in some way that is comprehensible to our modern consciousness.Having left the Middle Ages behind (I hope), we have no language for describing this phenomenon: the evil spirits, the demonic forces that would once have filled this role in the popular imagination are not available. So the metaphors are of war or terrorism: of an “invisible enemy” that must be defeated or destroyed by superior tactics.This is absurd of course, and ultimately unhelpful. The virus is not malevolent. It is not calculating. It has no plan and no intention. It is not a sentient being that can be outwitted or an army that can be outmanoeuvred. This is just a more contemporary form of superstition.The three strains of Covid-19 and where they originatedThe corona virus is a brainless organism whose only imperative, like all life forms, is to survive and replicate. It does that by attaching itself to human cells. We have to find a way of preventing that. Nobody knows, as yet, what the best way of doing it is, but all the attempts are being made with the best and most honest of intentions. It helps no one to suggest otherwise.The real enemy now is hopelessness: “no end in sight” is not the right message.The task seems to be peculiarly difficult because of the bizarre nature of an illness which causes symptoms so mild in many (perhaps even most) of the people it infects while killing a significant number of others quite rapidly.In the midst of the desperate search for a way to put an end to this thing are questions which only post hoc historical analysis has a hope of answering – about genetic links or lifestyle effects. These are strictly empirical matters which, in the blessed time after the present emergency has ended, will be explored.In the meantime, we can legitimately debate the moral issue on which everyone has a right to an opinion. How much should the potential damage to our economic future weigh in this? There are those who talk as if taking the economic consequences into account was a heartless contest between money and lives when, in fact, the collapse of the economy would destroy all public services (including the NHS) and thus cost huge numbers of lives while undermining the quality of life of the great majority of the population.The argument has to go on but it must be conducted with humility – nobody yet has a definitive answer.

When our shops were closed three weeks ago, we were told it was to buy time. “It’s vital to slow the spread of the disease,” said the Prime Minister in his televised address.The intervening three weeks have not been wasted. We have more ventilators, more hospital beds, more protective gear. Our doctors, nurses and ancillary staff are facing their test with unfussy heroism. We have, thank God, avoided the horrors that overwhelmed some northern Italian hospitals. It is dreadful that people should be dying but, as the Health Secretary confirmed on Friday, they are not dying for want of medical attention.The stoppage was intended to allow the NHS to increase its capacity to the point where the peak of the disease would not overwhelm it. It worked. Yet, oddly, no one seems in a hurry to lift the prohibitions.Eighty-nine per cent of voters support the quarantine – apparently regardless of the potential cost in lost liberty, lost livelihoods and, indeed, lost lives. Over a million more people have been pushed onto benefits. If the closures remain in place into next month, our GDP is set to fall by between 15 and 25 per cent in the second quarter – a drop no country can sustain. Every day that the embargoes remain in place adds billions to our liabilities and years to our eventual recovery.Look around you. Small businesspeople who have poured their souls into their firms are going bust. Charities are folding. A generation of children is going untaught. Non-coronavirus health needs are being deprioritised. Debts are piling up.So why are people so hesitant about returning to normality? Part of the answer is that crises of this kind make us more authoritarian. We demand the smack of firm government. The police persecute people for buying wine or sitting in their front gardens. Anonymous informers snitch on their neighbours. Anything that looks too much like fun – walking in the Peak District, for example – is condemned. Shared threats can give us a sense of common purpose and solidarity but they can also make us bossy, intolerant prigs.The three strains of Covid-19 and where they originatedAt the same time, the purpose of the shutdown, at least in the eyes of the media, has shifted. It is now no longer about preventing deaths because of lack of NHS capacity it is now about the number of dead per se. The front page of yesterday’s , for example, was filled with images of people who had tragically died from Covid-19.Coronavirus is virulent and there is as yet no vaccine. That is why, around the world, the authorities have responded with stringent measures. But such measures have a way of becoming self-sustaining. Politicians soon realise that their media are interested only in the coronavirus deaths – not deaths caused by other things or, indeed, caused indirectly by erting resources to deal with Covid-19.Commentators who point this out risk being shouted down with “You’re putting money before lives!” In fact, money and lives are at stake either way. The shutdown, if it lasts long enough, will push up other kinds of deaths, just as surely as a mistimed reopening would deepen the downturn. But some pundits deliberately refuse to see this, preferring the warm glow of self-righteousness. In consequence, decision-makers are deterred from making hard choices.Consider this. The closures are costing Britain £2.4 billion a day – enough to build six state-of-the-art mega hospitals. The savings made by all the spending cuts between 2010 and 2019 came to around £30 billion – a reduction that Labour, at the time, claimed was killing thousands of people. In the circumstances, to say, “Let’s leave things for an extra couple of weeks, just to be on the safe side,” is not so much irresponsible as inexplicable.Scientific advisers, like politicians, are aware of public opinion. They would not be human if they were not readier to intervene excessively than risk being accused of complacency. As Dr Anthony Fauci, the immunologist who crafted the American government’s shutdown, put it with admirable frankness: “I think we should really be overly aggressive and get criticized for overreacting.”Instead of focusing on those most at risk, our authorities decided, following a hectoring media campaign, to quarantine the entire population. We normally require a high level of proof for incarceration, but not this time. The evidence from the countries that were hit before us is mixed. If anything, it suggests that, beyond a certain point, tightening the screw makes little difference. Spain and Italy have harsh quarantine rules – you need written permission to leave home – yet they have suffered worse than, say, South Korea.The Swedish authorities, who have kept their shops and schools open, point out that it is the rest of Europe, rather than they, who are conducting an experiment: mass quarantine has never been tried before. Indeed, according to the UK Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Strategy, drafted in more cool-headed times: “It will not be possible to halt the spread of a new pandemic influenza virus, and it would be a waste of public health resources and capacity to attempt to do so”.Critics point out that the per capita infection rate is higher in Sweden than in Denmark or Norway. But a faster spread was part of Sweden’s calculation. The purpose of quarantine, remember, is to prevent a healthcare system from being overwhelmed, and Sweden believes it can achieve that goal without excessive restrictions.So far, Sweden shows little inclination to copy its neighbours. On the contrary, the neighbours are starting to copy Sweden. Denmark has announced that it will reopen its schools, as have parts of Germany. Austria plans to reopen shops.The most dangerous sequence in politics goes like this: “Something must be done. Here’s something. Let’s do it.” It leads to all manner of unintended consequences. It is only natural, faced with a plague, for voters to demand crackdowns. It is harder than you might imagine for ministers to make measured and rational decisions in such an atmosphere. But they must.What would a phased loosening look like? It should start where the cost of closures is highest and the gains most dubious. It may be difficult to justify the speedy reopening of, say, night-clubs. But the decision to close schools had as much to do with staff shortages and pupil absences as with epidemiology. A major survey by University College London suggests that schools closures had a limited impact on reducing coronavirus infections. Ministers should announce this week that next term will begin on time.What about, say, shops, restaurants or cinemas? Each case should be assessed on its merits. Many shops could operate as supermarkets do now – that is, with hand sanitisers and a limit on the number of people inside. It may even be possible for cinemas to space out their seats, or for restaurants to introduce, as in Sweden, service at tables but not bars. In any event, we should move from a policy of general prohibition (closing all businesses other than those exempted) to one of general openness (banning only a limited number of listed activities).More to the point, it needs to start right away. If things are left decaying until May, there will be little left to salvage.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

When he was Mayor for London, not usually a Conservative city, he knew he needed to repay the trust that voters had given him. We saw the murder rate fall, increased investment in infrastructure and our high streets, as well as support for a whole range of digital and tech start-ups.Boris was fond of saying that when he first arrived at City Hall there were only three construction cranes on the horizon but by the time he completed his term there were hundreds of cranes across the skyline bringing employment, homes, offices to our capital city. Boris had energised London and brought with him that “can do” attitude that allowed London to thrive.When reflecting on the Olympics, Boris described the “readybrek glow” that the success of the Olympics brought to the UK, and we are going to need that Super Sunday spirit again as we allow Boris time to recover and then pull together as a nation to move forward after the crisis is over.  Boris Johnson unveils giant set of Olympic rings on Tower Bridge in 2012Once, when we were discussing the London Health Commission report and the importance of GPs in the community, Boris could not recall when he last needed to go to his GP. Boris might have had the odd cold but he did not “do” ill! I remember weekly team meetings – behind Boris was an amazing landscape painted by his mother, Boris was always being given certificates and fun memorabilia, but this was the only artwork in his office.Family is important to Boris, and he comes from a very successful family and as a father, son, brother, and just about to be a new Dad again I have no doubt that his whole family are very anxious.As the official Deputy Mayor of London, I often met dignitaries and undertook official occasions, but I always knew it was Boris’s agenda and it was vital not to let the side down. Hundreds of invitations and letters came in for him every week and I am sure that No10 will be inundated with thousands of goodwill messages for the PM’s recovery. So the best message we can all give Boris is to ask him take his time to rest and recuperate, as we are all going to need his energy and drive for the next battle ahead.Boris leads from the front, he wants to get things done, so it was typical of him to want to battle through the early signs of the coronavirus and to keep going when he should have given himself time to rest. Rest and inactivity are not really on Boris’s agenda – in his spare time, he keeps active playing a fierce game of tennis, running or for relaxation devouring books and of course writing his own articles and books. Boris cycled from his home in North London to City Hall every day, bringing him into the basement of City Hall, so he could work his way through the building chatting to people as he went, still in his cycling kit.Everyone relates to Boris – when you walk down a street with him people shout out of windows, come out of their front doors and peep their car horns and wave. People want to be part of his team and Boris loves meeting people – he wants everyone to be successful – he brings optimism and a “feel-good factor”.  As I write this we are seeing the daily death toll rise, and I know that Boris, if he was back on his feet, would be challenging the medical experts and scientists to re-double their efforts to tackle this crisis. Who would succeed the PM?He will want to openly communicate what is going on – just as in his letter sent to every household in the Country, he says, in all honesty: “it is important for me to level with you – we know things will get worse before they get better”.  I hope he will go and recuperate and get the rest he needs whilst still being connected to all the apparatus of Government.  The next step will be to deal with the depressed economy and increased debt, and that is where Boris’s energy and style of leadership will really be needed. He will urge his team to unleash the power and energy of the British people across the whole country to re-invigorate business, and the British entrepreneurial spirit to get the economy moving again.It will be about empowering people to succeed, incentivising business and creating an environment that enables people to be successful.Yes, we have more years of paying off debt, but we need to have the vision, the passion and energy that Boris can bring to get UKPLC back on its feet. After all, it will be getting us out of the current crisis that will define Boris’s premiership. We all wish him well.  Coronavirus latest news: NHS facing equipment shortages as death toll rises among healthcare workersNHS hospitals on brink of running out of gowns to protect medics from coronavirus\u0026#39Infect the young and isolate those at risk\u0026#39 - One German scientist\u0026#39s plan to end the lockdownDeaths in UK rise by 917 as 11-year-old has died from the virusCosmetic surgeons breaching lockdown rules to visit clients\u0026#39 homes \u0026#39I owe my life to the NHS\u0026#39, recovering Prime Minister tells friendsThe inside story of Boris Johnson\u0026#39s coronavirus nightmare - and how Tintin is helping him recoverGive young people shares in companies that Government bails out, says former No 10 adviserGovernment advice on coronavirus lockdown backed by public, poll shows\u0026#39We can do it faster and bigger\u0026#39 - How the private sector plans to solve Britain\u0026#39s coronavirus testing crisisHow NHS doctors turn to WhatsApp to understand the coronavirusFemale staff at BBC \u0026#39put through humiliating trial to justify equal pay\u0026#39Britain\u0026#39s Got Talent, first auditions review: just the buoyant, feelgood escapism we all needFears for vulnerable children as those at risk of abuse become \u0026#39out of contact\u0026#39 during lockdownAirline seat cover company making PPE for medics during coronavirus crisisHackers pretending to be art dealer convinced museum to pay them £2m for John Constable paintingNHS hospitals trial anti-malaria drug endorsed by Donald Trump to treat coronavirusHow same-sex shopping helped Panama flatten the coronavirus curveComment: It\u0026#39s time to start loosening the lockdownChristians banned from consecrating bread and wine during live-streamed Easter servicesWorld Health Organisation chief accused of failing to record three cholera epidemics in home countryWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/04/10/15/apollo13.jpg","title":"apollo 13 nasa anniversary moon what happened explained","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Mission is remembered as perhaps Nasa\u0027s finest, and most desparate, hourExactly 50 years ago, Apollo 13 set off from Earth and for the Moon. Just a couple of days later came a blast and the words that would shock and fascinate the world:\u0026nbspOK, Houston, we\u0027ve had a problem here.Nasa is marking the anniversary of the mission it refers to as a successful failure, which represents one of its most high-profile disasters and its most famous miracles. It is a part of space history that is celebrated even today, with the story of the mission continuing to captivate the world.It was 11 April\u0026nbspthat marked the day the astronauts blasted off on their way to the Moon, and 13 April that an oxygen tank explosion started the mission to save the astronauts from being stuck in space.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOn 17 April, nearly exactly six days after the mission began, the astronauts fell back through the Earth\u0027s atmsosphere and arrived safely back on Earth. It was an unlikely end to an unlucky mission.While it is now remembered as one of the most important moments in Nasa\u0027s history, the mission began in relative obscurity for a trip to the Moon. Apollo 11 had already managed to get to the lunar surface, and so what just a couple of years before was regarded as a near-impossibility was by that time relatively unexciting.Astronauts on screen from The Right Stuff to Apollo 13 and GravityBut hours later, television stations around the world were giving rolling updates on the mission\u0027s status, following closely as the astronauts and Nasa engineers back on Earth tried to save them from disaster.As well as being a relatively unwatched mission, the first couple of days of the journey were almost tediously straightforward. After two days of flight, one of the Nasa staff in mission control joked the astronauts that the spacecraft was in such good shape that they were bored to tears.Problems began on Apollo 13 when the astronauts were nearing the Moon and heard a bang and felt a shudder through their spacecraft. During what should have been a routine stir, one of the oxygen tanks on the spacecraft had burst and exploded.(After the mission was over, the explosion was traced back to overheating while the spacecraft was being tested on the ground, but there was no way to know that at the time.)The explosion also knocked out the fuel cells that should have been powering the spacecraft, and sent voltage in its circuits plunging. Engineers watching the mission from Mission Control saw the pressure in the damaged oxygen tank drop instantly.OK, Houston, we\u0027ve had a problem here, said\u0026nbspJack\u0026nbspSwigert, the command module pilot who had actually joined the mission as a last-minute substitute for a colleague who had become sick just before the mission took off.Houston, we\u0027ve had a problem, said Jim Lovell, the commander of Apollo 13.Almost immediately, it became clear that the astronauts would not be landing on the Moon, as planned. But that was a relatively unimportant challenge compared with the more pressing job of staying alive.In many ways, the explosion happened at the best possible time, and the astronauts would later say they considered themselves lucky. If it had happened earlier, they would have run out of power later, and the blast could have happened in lunar orbit or on the surface of the Moon.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

It would require them to slingshot around the Moon – coming frustratingly close to the surface they were supposed to land on – and then whip back around and float back home to Earth.In the meantime, mission control got to work putting together a rescue plan while the astronauts on board attempted to put out of their mind just how likely it was they would now die in space, something they say they never discussed.Flight controllers told the astronauts to shut down their command module and climb into Aquarius. That module was supposed to be the box that took the astronauts down to the lunar surface – but was refashioned into a lifeboat in an attempt to conserve power.Because it was never meant for so many people for so long, the lander was low on space. It was also filled with carbon dioxide, as the astronauts breathed inside their new, tiny spacecraft.One of the most famous breakthroughs came as engineers tried to find a way to fix that problem, by using the air purifiers from the now abandoned capsule in the lander. The two were the wrong shape to fit together – they were literally trying to fit a square canister into a round hole – but engineers back on Earth came up with a way of using various pieces of spacecraft to push the two together.Even once that was fixed, conditions inside the lander were miserable, without the energy for heating or other improvements to their conditions. They were stuck inside of a frigid box that was never meant to hold them, stuck\u0026nbspfor days with little to do but wait and see if the various last-minute solutions to their desperate situation would actually work.(The astronauts have said they didn\u0027t argue during this time, despite the miserable conditions, and didn\u0027t talk about the possibility of getting stuck floating in space and waiting to die either Lovell wrote in his autobiography that they were too busy struggling for survival. He also denied that they had poison pills hidden away in case of becoming lost.)Eventually they arrived back near home for what is traditionally one of the most perilous parts of the journey: dropping back through Earth\u0027s atmosphere to come home. They had enough power to switch on the command module and wait as they went through the gruelling, hot ordeal of slamming back down to Earth.As they did, the communications blackout that comes from the extreme conditions of the Earth\u0027s atmosphere lingered for much longer than usual, leaving flight controllers in the dark as to whether the three astronauts and their hacked-together spacecraft had survived.But eventually they appeared in the air, the spacecraft being cradled by three parachutes as it fell through the sky and down to Earth. They were picked up and all three completed a journey whose legacy – one of inventiveness and luck that became mission control\u0027s greatest achievement – is still celebrated by Nasa today.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

About half of applicants were seeking work after losing their livelihoods due to Covid-19, Concordia said.When can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastThe latest round of jobs will start from the beginning of May when the UK’s soft fruit season begins with harvests of strawberries, raspberries and other summer fruits.Recruitment website Totaljobs has reported a record 50,000 searches for farm jobs last week.

think about what you are putting online, and who could potentially see this information.Over time this adds up, and you may find that you have placed much more information about yourself online than you first thought.It comes amid a spate of scams linked to the pandemic, as criminals seek to capitalise on people\u0027s fears.Created with Sketch.Coronavirus culture from rooftops, windows and balconies Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A rose is delivered by drone to a woman on Mother\u0027s Day in Jounieh, LebanonWomen dance on their balcony as a radio station plays music for a flash mob to raise spirits in RomeA skeleton stands on a balcony in Frankfurt, GermanyThe film Le ragazze di Piazza di Spagna is projected on a building in RomeA woman uses a basket tied to a rope to pull a delivery of groceries up to her balcony in Naples, ItalyDJ Francesco Cellini plays for his neighbours from the rooftop terrace of his flat block in RomeA woman gestures from her balcony in BarcelonaCellist Karina Nunez performs for her neighbours at the balcony of her flat in Panama CityDJ Nash Petrovic live streams a set from his roof in BrooklynPeople applaud medical workers from their balconies in Modiin, IsraelA Brooklyn resident relaxes in a hammock hung on their balconyResidents toast during a safe distance aperitif time between neighbours in Anderlecht, BelgiumMusician Adam Moser plays for neighbours from his balcony in Budapest, HungaryA man and his son on their balcony in BrooklynA man sits alone on a roof terrace in RomeA rose is delivered by drone to a woman on Mother\u0027s Day in Jounieh, LebanonWomen dance on their balcony as a radio station plays music for a flash mob to raise spirits in RomeA skeleton stands on a balcony in Frankfurt, GermanyThe film Le ragazze di Piazza di Spagna is projected on a building in RomeA woman uses a basket tied to a rope to pull a delivery of groceries up to her balcony in Naples, ItalyDJ Francesco Cellini plays for his neighbours from the rooftop terrace of his flat block in RomeA woman gestures from her balcony in BarcelonaCellist Karina Nunez performs for her neighbours at the balcony of her flat in Panama CityDJ Nash Petrovic live streams a set from his roof in BrooklynPeople applaud medical workers from their balconies in Modiin, IsraelA Brooklyn resident relaxes in a hammock hung on their balconyResidents toast during a safe distance aperitif time between neighbours in Anderlecht, BelgiumMusician Adam Moser plays for neighbours from his balcony in Budapest, HungaryA man and his son on their balcony in BrooklynA man sits alone on a roof terrace in RomeFake food shopping vouchers and a bogus text telling iniduals they have been fined for going out during lockdown are among them.The Covid-19 pandemic has led to a surge in all kinds of scams, ranging from the doorstep to email, telephone and social media and everyone should be extra cautious of what they communicate online at this unprecedented time, added Leon Livermore, chief executive of the CTSI.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We want them to be susceptible and exposed for the trials purely to test the efficacy.”Developing a working vaccine by September was “just about possible if everything goes perfectly”, added Professor Gilbert, but she warned that nobody could promise it would work.The government is poised to spend millions of pounds for a viable vaccine to have it ready for use and the team is in talks with the government about starting production of the vaccine before the final results become available.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A strong vaccine candidate available by September would not be surprising.”However, Professor Brendan warned that because the UK lacks manufacture capabilities, it\u0026nbspmight be “at the back of the queue” if it depends on other countries with manufacturing capacity, such as Germany, Belgium and France.“Desperate times require desperate measures, so upscaling and manufacture would be justified before data is fully known,” he said.“Even if the vaccine didn’t prove effective this would be a useful trial run for the manufacture of alternative Covid-19 vaccines and vaccines against other viral and bacterial diseases.”London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

You just have to help as many people as you can.”Despite food donations left in supermarket collection points “dwindling significantly”, Mr Bagguley is making sure the produce gets taken to the BCVS’s central hub, where drivers deliver to people struggling with job losses, cuts in income or difficultly getting outside for health reasons.The Welcome Centre, an independent food bank in Huddersfield, has lost 50 per cent of its volunteers since the\u0026nbsplockdown\u0026nbspbegan. Yet demand for help has roughly doubled in the past few weeks.\u0026nbspKirklees\u0026nbspCouncil has sent two members of full-time staff to help the charity carry on by making home deliveries across the West Yorkshire town.“We normally help about 300 people in a month,” said Emma Greenough, one of The Welcome Centre’s managers. “It’s likely we’re helping around 600 people at the moment – although it’s guesswork at the moment because things are changing so fast.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If the government could suspend the five-week wait for universal credit, it would be a big help to people.”Both the Trussell Trust, Britain’s largest network of food banks, and the Independent Food Aid\u0026nbspNetwork (IFAN) are calling on the Department for Work and Pension to end the five week-wait on new claimants receiving their first universal credit payment.Ms\u0026nbspGoodwin said some of the independent food banks that closed a few weeks ago have already been able to re-emerge in a different form. “At the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak at least 12 of our member organisations closed. Since then, three of them have reopened because they have been able to adapt and put new processes in place.”The DENS Food Bank in Hemel Hempstead, part of the Trussell Trust network, is relying on extra help so it can continue to operate. Demand for food parcels has gone up 75 per cent in the past few weeks, at a time the food bank is struggling with a drop in volunteers. It has forged an alliance\u0026nbspwith another local charity called the South Hill Centre, allowing volunteer drivers to make home deliveries to people asking for help.“A lot of people have seen their income drop and they don’t have savings to cover them,” said Wendy Lewington, DENS Food Bank’s CEO. “For the self-employed, the government help that might be there in a couple of months isn’t there immediately so they’re struggling to afford the basics.”Both the Welcome Centre and DENS Decorum Food Bank are looking for financial donations and non-perishable items such as UHT milk, soups, tinned meat and fish – proving harder for many food banks to buy in bulk at the supermarkets.Despite the difficulties faced by small, local food banks, some of the larger food surplus charities – rescuing\u0026nbspunwanted or short-dated stock from restaurants, retailers and\u0026nbspmanufacturers\u0026nbsp– are stepping up to fill\u0026nbspsome of the gaps.The Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign is supporting the work of our key partner The Felix Project – which has teamed with two other large organisations\u0026nbspin London to forge the London Food Alliance.The London Food Alliance is now coordinating with all 32 London boroughs to make sure the new, council-run community hubs are well-stocked with supplies, and also providing meals for\u0026nbspNHS staff.The Independent\u0026nbspis also encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry across the country – find out how you can help\u0026nbsphere.

We have teamed up with The Felix Project – a start-up charity we helped launch in 2016 – to deliver produce to community hubs in London boroughs.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent is also asking food charities across Britain to contact helpthehungry@ to tell us about your project and help build a directory of ways that our readers can help the hungry in their area – through money, volunteering and food donations. Food banks, which were already struggling to meet the need for emergency food parcels, have seen a huge surge in demand in recent weeks, while at the same time coping with dwindling donations, supermarket rationing systems, and a loss of many volunteers to self-isolation – yet none of the government’s rescue money goes to them.British households have stored more than £1bn worth of goods in their homes in response to the pandemic, creating shortages for food banks as shoppers ignore assurances that supply chains are robust.How to support our campaignJess Phillips, the Labour MP who recently ran for party leader, has backed our campaign, saying: “Nobody should be in the position of not being able to get enough food. In my constituency, London and in places all around the UK the coronavirus pandemic is placing extra stress on a system that was already straining.“We should all do what we can to help food and other essentials get to those that need it. That is why I’m backing the Help the Hungry campaign – please give if you are able.”Pastor Obi Onyeabor, the manager at Barking Foodbank, part of The Trussell Trust’s national network, said his pool of around 50 volunteers has been reduced by a dozen or so people currently self-isolating at home. Yet he and his team have kept their two church hall food banks open, and are now making home deliveries on Tuesdays and Thursdays to make sure the most vulnerable get supplies.“We have been scrambling for the past couple of weeks, doing all that we can – but we’re appealing for more people to come and help,” he said. “Out of fear people have been buying for themselves and their families, but I’ve seen some real generosity too.“I hope that if we can get past the panic buying stage, more people will want to give money, food or some of their time too.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIn London, charities like The Felix Project donate 10 tons of food – or 22,000 meals – to the needy every day. But funding has dropped since the outbreak of Covid-19, limiting their capacity to carry out vital work at a time when it is more important than ever. As part of the London Food Alliance, along with FareShare and City Harvest, The Felix Project will coordinate deliveries in London boroughs in order to distribute surplus food to the elderly, poor and vulnerable. The charities will deliver food to the hubs, where local volunteers will package up parcels and arrange “last-mile” deliveries to the homes of the vulnerable.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has backed our campaign to help in the capital in partnership with our sister title the Evening Standard. He said: “In a city as prosperous as London, everyone should have enough food to feed themselves and their families – but unfortunately the coronavirus outbreak means some Londoners are facing even greater difficulties. It’s commendable these organisations are joining forces to help ensure surplus food isn’t wasted and instead reaches those who need it most. I urge Londoners to support this crucial initiative.”Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, said: “Our role is to pick up large volumes of nutritious surplus food from the commercial sector and deliver it to community hubs to ensure there is enough food for vulnerable people for as long as this health crisis ensues. We will be working all hours doing our bit – and it would be wonderful if your readers can get behind us so we can do this job for London.”Emma Revie, chief executive of The Trussell Trust, which supports 1,200 food banks, appealed for help from the public to get vital food to people who cannot afford the basics, and to boost volunteer numbers in areas where they are needed.“Our main priority as coronavirus unfolds is ensuring the safety of everyone who comes to a food bank – whether it’s someone needing help, someone volunteering their time, or someone making a donation,” said Ms Revie. “Until we are confident that adequate government protection against poverty is in place, food banks provide an essential community service to people unable to afford food. But this should not fall to food banks.“Our benefits system could be the life raft people need now. That’s why it’s more important than ever that we end the five-week wait for universal credit. While incredible food bank volunteers continue to help people unable to afford the basics, we would ask our government to take this essential step and end the five-week wait now. It’s five weeks too long.”Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network UK, which oversees 834 independent food banks, said the charitable services were “struggling to stay above water” in the current climate and accused the government of so far “failing to act” to prevent an ever-increasing number of people falling into poverty.“Food bank use was rising before the coronavirus outbreak and the impact of job losses can only make matters far worse. But this catastrophe in the making is avoidable,” she said. “We’re calling for an income-based solution to this crisis which would mean that the Herculean efforts by volunteers across the country wouldn’t be needed.“FareShare, the UK’s biggest food redistribution charity, is also calling for more volunteers to help with packing and making van deliveries. The organisation takes food from the food manufacturers that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors or overproduction, and gets it out to food banks, hospices, homeless hostels and other charities.Commercial director Alyson Walsh estimates around 1,200 people have got in touch over the past week. “We have quite a lot of older volunteers who have had to stay at home, but we are now seeing a wave of interest in new people willing to fill in.”Ms Walsh added: “We know we have the capacity to do more – we have the warehouse\u0026nbspspace and the chillers. But the government needs to help the food industry do more in terms of all the bagging and boxing and delivery of food that needs to be done.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The £1m you have donated will help us help The Felix Project feed NHS workers, care workers, the poor and the vulnerable. Thank you.How to support our campaign“But I have to report that I have been out delivering food with Felix today and they are seeing unprecedented demand from people who cannot afford or access food.“I went to two homeless charities, The Marylebone Project and Rhythms of Life, where our deliveries are preventing deep distress. I accompanied one of 22 Felix vans that set off across the capital, filled to the brim, to ferry over 20 tons of nutritious food to three of the giant community hubs established in Barnet, Islington and Haringey, and to more than 75 charities and schools.“That’s more than double the 10 tons a day Felix were supplying in normal times.”Mr Lebedev added: “Within days, this picture is set to change dramatically yet again. Felix say\u0026nbspthey expect another 11 community hubs in another 11 boroughs to open their doors to hungry Londoners – and with it, Felix’s output will need to double again.“That is why we at The Independent\u0026nbspare committing our resources to raise another million pounds to prevent food insecurity to people already anxious about their health and that of loved ones. That is why we say: £1m raised, £1m to go. Let’s finish the job and keep vulnerable Londoners healthy and fed.”The deliveries are part of our food appeal’s support for the charities in the London Homeless Collective, the umbrella organisation of London homeless charities that The Independent\u0026nbspis working with through our Homeless Fund. Felix is delivering to other homeless organisations, as well as The Marylebone Project, including Centrepoint.Des Scott, CEO of the Church Army, which runs The Marylebone Project and provides 112 beds to homeless women under the Edgware flyover, said: “Being able to get fresh vegetables is one of the key things we can do to keep these women healthy.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

So it’s still too early to lift the measures that we put in place.“We must stick to the plan and we must continue to be guided by the science.”Mr Raab, who chaired\u0026nbspa meeting of the government’s emergency Cobra committee on Thursday,\u0026nbspthanked everyone for staying indoors but urged the public\u0026nbspto keep sticking to the rules.Early signs suggest the lockdown\u0026nbspmeasures are having an impact but “it’s too early to say that conclusively”,\u0026nbspMr Raab said.

Liberal Democrats were down a point on 10 per cent with Greens on 6 and the Brexit Party on 2.Labour voters showed strong approval of Sir Keir’s leadership, with 49 per cent satisfied, against just 7 per cent who were not.

Some 22 per cent of non-voters voiced satisfaction at\u0026nbspSir Keir’s\u0026nbspleadership, against 9 per cent who were dissatisfied.Strongest support for the new Labour leader was found in his native London (33 per cent satisfied against 11 per cent dissatisfied) and the West Midlands (39-11). But he appeared to have made less of a breakthrough in the northeast, where the margin of satisfaction was just 21-14, and Scotland (26-7).He enjoyed his strongest approval among the 18- to 24-year-old age group (36 per cent satisfied, 11 per cent dissatisfied).

The former New York mayor skipped the first caucus in Iowa and instead campaigned in California on 3 FebruaryHe added: “The worst crime he committed, in the eyes of the establishment, is not the policy he’s proposing it’s the fact that he was able to inspire popular movements, which had already been developing — Occupy, Black Lives Matter, many others — and turn them into an activist movement, which doesn’t just show up every couple years to push a leader and then go home, but applies constant pressure, constant activism and so on.”Many commentators have pointed out that because of Mr Sanders’s success and the way he especially inspired young voters – he won the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada – visually every Democratic candidate was obliged to have their own policies on topics such as climate change, greater accessibly to healthcare, and criminal justice reform.As it, Mr Sanders has said his name will remain on the ballot in the primaries remaining and he will continue to collect and accrue. He said this was a deliberate tactic to try and put pressure on the committee that agrees the party’s official policy platform this summer.Mr Chomsky said if Donald Trump\u0026nbspwere elected it would be an “indescribable disaster”.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I just mentioned the Lancet figures. It will get worse. What this means for the environment or the threat of nuclear war, which no one is talking about but is extremely serious, is indescribable.”He said he assumed a Biden presidency would be a continuation of former president Barack Obama’s administration “nothing very great, but at least not totally destructive, and opportunities for an organised public to change what is being done, to impose pressures”.Israel intervention in US election greater than Russia’s, says ChomskyNoam Chomsky says antifa is gift to far right and US state repressionChomsky says Trump brought Doomsday Clock alarmingly close to midnightNoam Chomsky argues Antifa is a ‘major gift to the right’He said if Mr Biden, 77, were elected Mr Sanders and his supporters could continue to seek to put that pressure on him.Aware that he will need the backing and votes on Mr Sanders’s supporters if he is to defeat Mr Trump in November, Mr Biden immediately paid tribute to the senator after he suspended his campaign. In a statement directed at those who had so vigorously supported the veteran democratic socialist, he also said: “I see you, I hear you.”On Thursday, in what was seen as another nod to the progressives he need to win over, he unveiled two new proposals he said would help ease the “economic burden on working people”.These were a proposed lowering of the age eligibility for Medicare from 65 to 60 and eliminating student debt for some lower-income families.“In our nation’s 244 years, we have never weathered a crisis that we did not emerge from stronger,” Mr Biden wrote. “This one will be no different.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Singapore is also seeing a rise in local transmissions, with more than 400 new cases in the past week that have been linked to migrant worker dormitories.The first confirmed cases in all three places were connected to people who had travelled to Wuhan, China, where the pandemic began, followed by small clusters of cases among residents with no travel history. Despite their proximity to mainland China, however, they had all managed to keep their case counts low for weeks, through vigilant monitoring and early intervention.None of these places had a single day with more than 10 new cases until March, even as the coronavirus spread around the world.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThat changed in the past two weeks, as both Hong Kong and Singapore saw new cases in the double digits for consecutive days, with the bulk attributed to those who have travelled from abroad. Singapore’s numbers are now triple digits, with large clusters of cases linked to dorms for migrant workers.Taiwan was hit with a surge of new cases, the vast majority of which were imported from other countries, while the number of locally transmitted infections remained low.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastStudents or expatriates returning from Europe or the United States account for a large share of the imported cases.

But as virus hot spots developed in other places, the governments increasingly expanded travel restrictions or mandatory quarantine measures to encompass the rest of the world.By the end of March, all three places had prohibited short-term visitors, though residents or other long-term visa holders could still enter under the quarantine measures.“The first step is to further prevent imported cases and to cut off the infection chain around the world and within Hong Kong,” Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive, said at a news conference announcing the new measures. “All non-Hong Kong residents arriving at the airport from any overseas region will not be allowed through immigration for 14 days starting on 25 March.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Senior US congressmen began to threaten trade reprisals, and there have been renewed demands that Beijing pays reparations for the fatal delay in warning the outside world of the coming crisis.The calls for China to face financial penalties have been echoed by some politicians in other countries including Britain and Australia. There has been widespread condemnation of what is seen as Chinese subterfuge, which allowed the pandemic to spread so wide, so virulently. The latest criticism came from the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, which accused Beijing of “manipulation and disinformation”.Wet markets are where traders sell fresh produce, fruit and vegetables, but also wild and domestic animals, dead and alive: there have been regular complaints of some of them operating in unsanitary conditions. Dry markets sell non-perishable goods, including packaged food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent is calling for global action to create tighter restrictions surrounding the trade in wild animals, to help prevent reduce the risk of zoonotic diseases such as coronavirus.The Stop the Wildlife Trade campaign asks that governments work together to impose stricter controls on the trade, sale and consumption of wild animals.The accusation now is not just that China is culpable for the current pandemic but that it is the incubator for another devastating contagion in the future. The great risk comes from its wet markets – the one in Wuhan is believed to be the source of Covid-19 and also its huge and highly lucrative trade in wildlife. Official Chinese figures for wildlife trade and consumption shows that it was worth more than $74bn\u0026nbspand has provided work for 14 million over the past decade.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastIn Washington senator Lindsey Graham has launched a campaign in congress to get China to close wet markets once and for all. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, has urged the United Nations and World Health Organisation to ensure that Beijing does not reopen them. The United Nations’ bioersity chief, Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, has said that she would support a global ban on wildlife markets, and there is also support for the measure from senior conservationists within China.Writing for The Independent on Friday, Ms Mrema said: “Global wildlife trade and live animal markets, where live fish, meat and wild animals are sold, are important risk factors for zoonotic disease spillover. Accordingly, measures taken by countries to reduce the number of live animals in food markets can significantly reduce the risk of disease outbreaks. Stricter controls on the sale and consumption of wild species, and implementation of the International Health Regulations, must also be scaled up globally.”Senator Graham asked: “What can China do to help the world? Shut those markets down. The source of this virus is the Chinese wet markets. They are absolutely disgusting, selling exotic animals that transmit viruses from animals to human beings. About the last three or four pandemics have come from the Chinese wet markets.”It is indeed the case that some of the most lethal viruses that have spread beyond borders have come from contact between wild animals and humans.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe H2N2 Asian flu in 1957-1958 came from a mutation in wild ducks: it killed 1.1 million people worldwide. The H5N1 bird flu in 1997 came from Chinese geese, leaving around 460 dead. The Sars epidemic of 2002-2003 is thought to have come from bats or civet cats and killed around 780 people. The H7N9 Bird Flu in 2013 came from poultry at live bird markets with 610 dead. And now there is Covid-19, with more than 103,000\u0026nbspdeaths so far and rising daily.Senator Graham said he started his drive against wet markets after talking to Dr Anthony Fauci, America’s most senior expert on coronavirus, who had told him “it was a crazy decision which puts the whole world at risk”.There is an element of irony in this. Dr Fauci now needs security protection following threats from hardline Trump supporters who have been angered by him contradicting the president, who had initially claimed the virus was a “Democrat hoax”. Dr Fauci was denounced as a traitor and a supporter of Hillary Clinton.But on China and coronavirus at least, Dr Fauci and the Republicans are on the same hymn sheet. “It boggles my mind how, when we have so many diseases that emanate out of that unusual human-animal interface, that we just don’t shut it down. I don’t know what else has to happen to get us to appreciate that,”\u0026nbsphe told Fox News.In Melbourne, Premier Morrison bluntly stated “wet markets were a very real and significant problem wherever they exist. This virus started in China and went round the world, that’s how it started, we all know that.“These wet markets are a real problem and this is something the UN and World Health Organisation should do something about… We can clearly see the risks to the health and wellbeing of the rest of the world as a result of these types of places and facilities.”This week, more than 200 animal and wildlife charities from around the world wrote to the WHO, urging the body to demand Beijing close down all live animal markets, immediately, to prevent the spread of further pandemics.We all need to transform our relationship with the natural worldJinfeng Zhou, secretary general of the China Bioersity Conservation and Green Development Foundation, said that a universal closure of wildlife markets was justified. Speaking to , he said: “I agree there should be global ban on wet markets, which will help a lot on wildlife conservation and protection of ourselves from improper contact with wildlife. More than 70 per cent of human diseases are from wildlife and many species are endangered by eating them.”There have also been calls in the UK for Chinese wet markets to be shut.Such calls, however, were not evident two years ago, when Theresa May visited Wuhan, in the drive for post-Brexit trade with China. The then prime minister also went to Beijing and Shanghai on the trip. But the South China Morning Post noted: “Wuhan’s inclusion on Ms May’s itinerary seems surprising. The city rarely has been a destination for foreign visitors.”Wuhan was rapidly becoming an important technological hub. But there were also concerns about its wet market, where exotic wild and domestic animals, dead and alive, were being sold in packed conditions.There is no record of Ms May, or the Trade Secretary accompanying her, Liam Fox, a medical doctor, raising the issue of the wet market, despite UK National Security Strategy warning of a pandemic as a “tier one priority risk” and the knowledge that the Sars epidemic came from bats and civet cats.Last month, as coronavirus spread, Beijing banned the trade and consumption of non-aquatic wild animals. The authorities subsequently announced that 20,000 farms raising animals including peacocks, porcupines and ostriches have been shut down. Last week Shenzhen became the first Chinese city to ban the sale and consumption of dog and cat meat. And on Wednesday, central authorities declared that dogs are companions – and not for consumption. Around 10 million dogs and four million cats are currently killed in the country every year.The digestive juice from the animals, ursodeoxycholic acid, has long been used in traditional Chinese medicine, “tan re qing”, to dissolve gallstones and treat liver disease. There is no evidence that it is effective against Covid-19, for which there is no known cure, but some drug combinations have been found to alleviate symptoms.The ways of extracting the bile range from inserting rubber or metal tubes through a bear’s abdomen to cutting a permanent hole in the bear so it can be put on a “free-drip” system. The process is extremely distressing and painful for the bears. Animals Asia Foundation, an animal welfare group which rescues bears in the continent, recorded that the bears are often sick and their bile is contaminated with blood, pus and urine.Brian Daly, a spokesperson for the Foundation, said “We really shouldn’t be relying on wildlife products like bear bile as the solution to combat a deadly virus that appears to have originated from wildlife.”A spokesperson for Shanghai Pharmaceuticals company, China’s largest bear bile manufacturer, said the product came from “government-authorised animal breeding programmes... and they come from third generation of bred bears” rather than wild ones.The laws in China also allows the farming of bats and pangolins – two of the animals suspected of transmitting Covid-19. \u0026nbspScales of the pangolin – an endangered mammal also known as a scaly anteater – are used tin traditional medicine and are being sold in some areas as antidotes for the virus.Three of the bat species – Pipistrellus abramus, Murina leucogaster and Rhinolophus ferrumequinum – are found in Hubei province, which includes Wuhan. The third of these, the greater horseshoe bat, is sold commercially for its faeces and body parts. The faeces treatment, ming sha, or “night brightness sand”, is believed to cure certain eye problems while parts of the bat’s body are drunk with wine or taken as powders and thought to act as a “detox”\u0026nbsptreatment.Created with Sketch.Before and after photos show impact of coronavirus around the world Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.1020 Gateway of India, Mumbai1320 Church of the Nativity, Bethlehem1020 Gateway of India, Mumbai1320 Church of the Nativity, BethlehemThe animals used for medicine are meant to be bred under licence, but the system is open to widespread abuse with many being sold in wet markets. Shen Wangping, from the China Bioersity Conservation and Green Development Foundation (CBCGDF) which monitors wildlife poaching and trading in Hunan province, told the Los Angeles Times that state officials were often culpable in the illicit trade.Jinfeng Zhou the conservationist, speaking to , asked: “Why were civet cats still encouraged to be eaten after the Sars outbreak? It’s because hunters, operators, practitioners needed that. How can they achieve that? They urged the government to support them under the pretext of economic development.”Jane Goodall calls for global ban on wildlife tradeThere are accusations of conflict of interest in the body, which is supposed to be dedicated to the protection of animals. Three of the 14 board vice-chairs of the China Wildlife Conservation Association are also executives of traditional Chinese medicine companies.One of them is with a company that specialises in medicine made out of deer musk, cow gallstone, snake bile and herbal root. Another is the managing director of one of the world’s biggest Chinese medicine companies, famous for its tiger bone wine. The third is one whose company focuses on treatments made from seahorse and pangolin scales.The trade in wildlife as food in markets took off during the post-Mao reforms of the economy. In the 1970s, with the country facing widespread food shortages, including starvation in some areas, huge collective farms were dismantled and land redistributed to households under the orders of the new leader Deng Xiaoping.Smallhold farmers known as “specialised” or zhuanyehu because they focused on cash crops or livestock such as chickens, ducks or pigs began to spring up quickly in many parts of the country.But then came the “second great leap forward” in the 1990s, when the government decided on a drive for economies of scale in agriculture. Well capitalised production conglomerates, “dragonheads”, often with ruling Communist Party connections, built supply chains with slaughterhouses and production facilities.Some smallholders, seeing their income cut, gravitated to wild animals and local breeds, which got a relatively high return in wet markets. The move gained more ground when a number of diseases swept through livestock, adding to the burden of poorer farmers.The result was more animals, wild and domestic, packed into the markets and worsening of sanitary conditions. With rats, bats, civet cats, pangolins and other wild animals becoming staples of rural farming, a law was passed to protect “the lawful rights of those engaged in the development or utilisation of wildlife resources.”Wildlife is also brought into China from abroad for consumption. In the last 10 years Chinese customs authorities have recorded around 400 wildlife trafficking cases. Conservationists insist that the real figures are far higher.Steve Glaister, founder of Freeland, a Thailand-based anti-trafficking organisation, wanted to stress that “Wuhan is a major wake-up call. The way to prevent further outbreaks is to stop the trade. Most wildlife is trafficked by gangsters. This is not a regulated trade, so no wonder there are infections and viruses spreading. HIV, Sars and bird flu came from animals and now this too. These markets are ticking time bombs.” HIV is believed to have originated in\u0026nbspnon-human primates.Others warn, however, that an outright ban would only drive the trade in wildlife underground, making it difficult to detect. Professor Dirk Pfeiffer, of the City University of Hong Kong, points out that demand will remain. “The people who are providing them, whether farmed wild animals or animals from the wild, that’s an important source of income for them,” he said, speaking to\u0026nbspthe BBC. “Pushing it underground, that’s not the solution.”Richard Thomas, of the wildlife trade monitoring network TRAFFIC, has also warned of the danger of forcing the trade into a black market and held that the emphasis should be on addressing conditions that allowed Covid-19 and other diseases to emerge.China defends WHO and calls Taiwan ‘venomous’ in row over racist abuse“There’s a dilemma here. If you ban trade, you risk pushing it underground, where those dangerous conditions are likely to be prevalent – and realistically it’s just a matter of time before the next zoonotic disease risk emerges,” he said, speaking to Al Jazeera. “If you manage legal trade properly, the risk of disease emergence should be mitigated, but it needs to be thoroughly monitored and regulated.”But there is no guarantee that thorough monitoring and regulation would ever take place and, under the circumstances, Robert Emerson, a strategic consultant, maintains “a black market is probably better than a grey market. At least in the black market people know the goods are illegal and should know there are risks involved. But in the grey market there could be confusion and people believing something is safe when it’s not.”There is another problem now surrounding pandemics, largely between China and the US and some other countries – trust deficit and a burgeoning confrontation. “The talk of China paying reparations shows how far things have gone,” said Mr Emerson. “And when you have the Chinese government even denying that the coronavirus started there and saying it started in Europe or America, there is a disbelief in a lot of things they say.

Public transportation was limited to a few hours in the morning and evening, but some medical workers complained of being unable to get to their jobs.The virus death toll\u0026nbsphas been steadily increasing in Turkey, which recently surpassed 1,000 after a record daily toll of 98 was announced on Friday.Turkey to become first country to distribute free masks to nation“We urge all citizens who live in said 31 provinces\u0026nbspto comply with this weekend’s lockdown without panicking, and refrain from reducing their social distance prior to the lockdown,” Fahrettin Altun, communications chief for president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, wrote on Twitter.Mr Erdogan has insisted that the wheels of the economy continue to turn, and his government has kept certain sectors of the economy open for business. These\u0026nbspinclude\u0026nbspconstruction, banking, mining and manufacturing.News of the curfew came as so much of a surprise that even the mayor of Istanbul, Ekrem Imamoglu, took to social media to voice his astonishment. A member of the opposition to Mr Erdogan’s political party, he has long asked for a tighter lockdown on the city, which is one of the country’s most hard-hit areas.“Curfews to combat the pandemic should not be imposed so hastily,” he wrote on Twitter. The municipality of Istanbul “was not informed of the sudden 48-hour\u0026nbspcurfew in Istanbul and was left unsure as to what services will be provided tomorrow. Decisions taken unilaterally only serve to create more panic and confusion.”Residents discarded social distancing guidelines to crowd late-night shops to stock up on groceries and meats. Outside one bakery in the Bayrampasa district of Istanbul, a brawl broke out as young men “pummelled and jumped each other”, according to video footage posted to the internet.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Health minister Fahrettin Koca insisted Friday that the number of patients in need of treatment\u0026nbspat intensive care units in hospitals was slowing but “it should not relieve us”.Mr Erdogan on Friday spoke on the phone with Serbian president Aleksandar Vucic, who earlier imposed a strict weekend curfew throughout the eastern Balkan country.Turkey has introduced a number of measures to fight against the pandemic. Last week it banned the sale of surgical masks and launched an ambitious programme to distribute them for free to citizens.\u0026nbspIt has also sought to aid other countries facing the pandemic, recently dispatching planeloads of surgical masks and hazmat suits to the UK, with a quote from the medieval Sufi poet Rumi on the boxes.“After hopelessness, there is so much hope,” it said. “And after darkness, there is the much brighter sun.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

On people’s livelihoods, on people’s quality of le, on people’s mental health.And I appreciate that it’s often the little things that hurt the most.It’s been almost three weeks, and we’re starting to see the impact of the sacrices we’ve all made. But the deaths are still rising, and we haven’t yet reached the peak of the virus. So it’s still too early to lt the measures that we’ve put in place. We must stick to the plan. And we must continue to be guided by the science.Nearly , people have already died from coronavirus in the UK, as of April , while more than , have tested positive for the bug.Mr Raab also said: SAGEwill meet next week to discuss the latest evidence and well keep the measures we put in place under review.Health Secretary Matt Hancock has warned outdoor exercise could be bannediniduals continue to ignore social distancing measures.Englands chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty said he would expect the number of deaths to continue rising for at least two weeks past when the number of people in intensive care starts to flatten off, showing the peak is still some time away.Government advisers now believe April  is the likely peak date.The UKs three-week lockdown mark will be reached on Easter Monday.Legislation behind the mass containment must also be reviewed at least once every  days - with the first due to be carried out by April  at the latest.No easing of the lockdown will happen until at least the end of next week, Mr Raab said - but the strict measures will likely continue for even longer, with suggestions that some form of restrictions could last for up to  months until a vaccine has been developed.Ministers have warned that the lockdown could be stretched into May, after warning that relaxing it too soon will kill thousands more.Deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries has previously told the nation that restrictions could remain for the next six months.Englands Health Minister Ed Argar said the country was not at the stage where the lockdown can be relaxed.The lockdown is expected to be lted in stages amid Treasury fears that businesses wont survive past June.On April , the Mayor of London suggested the peak of the virus was ten days away.Sadiq Khan said: I think we’re nowhere near lting the lockdown.I speak to experts regularly, we think the peak, which is the worst part of the virus, is probably a week and a half away.A joint survey on the impact of the coronavirus lockdown upon , UK residents found that % are drinking more booze, and % are arguing with their family or housemates more than normal.Halfreported feeling more anxious or depressed as a result of coronavirus, while one in fivesaid they already cannot afford essential items or housing costs, the survey by Kings College London and Ipsos Mori found.April : Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab announces it is too soon to lt social distancing restrictions,  with SAGE to review the restrictions after Easter Monday.April : The Prime Minister is admitted to hospital for treatment, ten days after first displaying coronavirus symptoms on  March.March : Boris Johnson announced a partial, three-week-long lockdown, telling us to stay at home to stop the spread of coronavirus.

Today, even warmer weather is predicted.Therefore, with those in mind who clearly think the rules don’t apply to them, perhaps it’s time to tweak the Government’s oft-chanted safety message.Stay at Home. Protect the NHS. Save Lives . . . including your own.If the Prime Minister being in intensive care doesn’t focus their minds, then perhaps the sight of -year-old Ismail Abdulwahab’s coffin being lowered into the ground by strangers in hazmat suits will serve as a salutary lesson that this isn’t “just like the flu” — it’s a potentially deadlier unknown.Whatever your age, gender, race, health history or fitness level, it could be you. And until you have it, you have absolutely no idea what the outcome will be. No two cases have been the same.You could be lucky and only suffer mild symptoms, you might be less so and have a spell in hospital, or worst of all, you might never come out.The latter has been the harsh reality for — at the time of writing — , people in the UK, a figure that is likely to keep risingthose who clearly think that it won’t happen to them don’t start adhering to the strict behaviour codes that will, hopefully, send this thing packing.Or to put it bluntly, better six feet apart than six feet under.ONE of the positives of the lockdown is the rise of socialising via video apps such as Zoom, Houseparty etc.Some people dress up for a party, others have a virtual dinner together, choirs sing, kids have playdates and my friend and I completed a crossword together.But it has its drawbacks too.I’m due to do a chat with This Morning tomorrow and a virtual paper review from home on The Andrew Marr Show this Sunday, and I’m trying to find a suitable backdrop.The kitchen is too informal, with a real and present danger of either the dog snoring or The Bloke wandering into shot in his, ahem, attractive “lockdown shorts”.A couple of noisy, nesting pigeons rule out the garden, and for obvious reasons the bedroom would be a little too familiar.Most online commentators have chosen a backdrop of bookshelves displaying weighty tomes that convey their vast intellect, but thanks to The Bloke’s fondness for books such as The Subtle Art Of Not Giving a F*** and Is It Just Me Or Is Everything Sh** , I’d have to spend an afternoon sanitising ours.So, apologies in advance, it may have to be the downstairs loo.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealCHANNING Tatum is single again after splitting up from pop singer Jessie J.We know this because he’s reportedly back on celebrity dating app Raya, where his profile reads: “And yes, I used to be a stripper. Sorry.”No need to apologise, Channing.In fact, as any woman who’s seen Magic Mike will testy, it will no doubt be viewed as a considerable asset.DAME Julie Walters has revealed she didn’t tell her adult daughter about her bowel cancer diagnosis until she knew she was in the clear.She says she couldn’t “bear the thought” of -year-old Maisie worrying, so told her she was having her appendix out when, in fact, she was having two tumours removed from her colon.“I couldn’t say the word ‘cancer’ to her,” says Julie, , adding that she also “didn’t want to upset people around me. I wanted to keep it small.”In this social media age when certain celebrities post every thought, utterance and ingrowing toenail, it’s a reminder that some stars manage to keep things private too.LAST week I asked for examples of how you were passing your time in lockdown and there were some absol­ute corkers, thank you.Jigsaw puzzles, spring cleaning and garden maintenance were obvious favourites but Pat Ryan painted his shed rather spectacularly and ardent needleworker Irene Threadgoldis planning to produce “  of rock icons”, one of which is below.Well done everyone.

If we’re being generous, then driving to your second home when you’ve just issued a “stay in unless absolutely necessary” edict to the nation might be perceived as a “mistake”.Doing it twice is, at best, stupidity, at worst, downright “do as I say, not as I do” arrogance.THE Duke and Duchess of Sussex have revealed the new name for their rebrand after the use of Royal was blocked by The Queen.“Archewell”.Of which, under the circumstances of Harry stepping down as a senior royal, there’s a rather fitting, aristocrat anagram: Earl Welch.We needed research to tell us this FORMER F boss Bernie Ecclestone has revealed he’s to be a father again at the grand old age of .“I don’t see there’s any dference between being  and ,” he says.“You’ve got the same problems I suppose.”Except, of course, for guaranteed death before your child is even out of their teens.SOME good news: They’re making another series of the superb Le On Mars, starring John Simm and Philip Glenister.Less thrilling is the suggestion that it will be set in the modern day.Gene Hunt barking: “Fire up the Toyota Prius” doesn’t have quite the same appeal.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

For those of you who say this virus is nothing out of the ordinary, a big fuss about nothing – how often do we have a Prime Minister in intensive care We all wish Boris a swt recovery. The country needs a strong leader at a time like this and Boris has proved, in three short months, he is that leader.There have been calls for a national unity government. All the parties coming together to see us through this crisis. It’s happened before, of course — most famously during World War Two, when we had a coalition government led by Boris’s hero, Sir Winston Churchill. We had one during the Napoleonic Wars back in , too, when that short French tosser was causing havoc in Europe.But do we need one now I think not. The only reason people are raising the issue now is because the Labour Party at last has a leader who isn’t actually certiable.Nobody would seriously think that giving power to an oaf like Jeremy Corbyn would help us through this crisis.But there are plenty of other reasons to object. First of all, we kind of already have a unity government.The Conservatives have a whopping -seat majority. In the last opinion poll Boris had  per cent of the country behind him, thinking he was doing a good job. That’s about as close to unanimous as you will ever get in a democracy. The Government, then, has a free hand.Perhapsthis virus had struck back in October last year, there might have been a point. Then we had a paralysed government with no working majority.Battling this virus would have been nigh on impossible in such a position. But the December General Election changed all that.But then there’s this. Unity governments are usually convened when we are threatened by a foreign power — as happened in World Wars One and Two and indeed the Napoleonic Wars. There have been brief exceptions.But by and large we have a unity government to show the foreign power that the whole country is united. The virus isn’t a ­foreign power. It is an insentient microscopic parasite. It doesn’t give a monkey’s who is running the country.But the most important objection is this. We are a democracy. And democracy is no less important during times of crisis than at other times. And we need a competent opposition to hold the Government to account. Boris and co haven’t done a bad job, so far. But there are plenty of questions that could be asked. Did the Government react too slowly  Why do our frontline medical staff not have adequate protection against the virus  Why did we allow planes to land from China, back in March, when the danger was apparent.OK, you may think some of those questions unfair. And asked with the benefit of hindsight. But it is the job of the Opposition to ask dficult questions, to challenge policies and highlight incompetency.I would argue that is more vital now than at any time in the last  years.Labour’s new leader, Sir Keir Starmer appears to be a sensible bloke.He is generally behind the Government in its fight against this pandemic.But he must be allowed to question, in public, the Government’s policies.We are no less unied when dficult questions are asked of politicians.The more those dficult questions are asked, the quicker this virus will be beaten.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealLIFE will never be the same again. No, I’m not talking about this wretched virus for once.The Labour Party has got rid of almost all of its nutters from positions of influence.Diane Abbott has gone. John McDonnell has gone.So has the former chairman, the godawful Geordie Ian Lavery.Corbyn himself will be gone very soon.What are we going to do for a laugh without these clowns spouting rubbish all day long Luckily — thank the Lord! — the genuinely berserk David Lammy has been installed as Shadow Justice Secretary.It’s up to you, now David, you dingbat. Keep us chuckl­ing during these dark days.DONALD Trump has turned his guns on the World Health Organisation.He’s threatened to cut off its funding. He reckons the WHO has handled the virus pandemic very badly.The WHO told Trump he was wrong to ban flights from China at the start of the outbreak because it “wasn’t necessary”.He said: “The WHO receives vast amounts of money from the United States and we pay for a majority, the biggest portion of their money, and they actually criticised and disagreed with my travel ban at the time I did it.“And they were wrong. They’ve been wrong about a lot of things.”He may look like a morbidly obese Belisha beacon in a badly fitting wig.He may sometimes talk out of his a***hole. He may have the diplomatic abilities of a semi-housetrained wolverine.But he may well be dead right on this.SOME experts reckon we could be in a state of lockdown until well into autumn.That sounds pretty grim. But there is a silver lining.It means that tour by Genesis might have to be called off.WHO’S nicked all the flour, then  Can’t find the stuff anywhere.It’s aspeople thought: “Uh oh. Armageddon’s coming. Better make a really nice cake. Maybe a coffee one with walnuts, or something. Or a Swiss roll.” I suppose stockpiling flour is more sensible than stockpiling bog rolls. People seem to have given up on that now. Crisps, though, are selling out really quickly.As I mentioned last week, that’s because most sensible people are sitting on their sofas watching Netflix. And you need a snackyou’re doing that for  hours a day.Plus copious quantities of alcohol. One serious point – round my way, it’s impossible to get a click and collect slot for any of the supermarkets.And it’s been that way for two weeks. I know these are dficult times.And I’m pleased the supermarkets are giving priority to vulnerable customers. But would it tax them too much to take on a few extra drivers LONDON Mayor Sadiq Khan reckons that bus and Tube drivers in the capital don’t need protection kits to keep them safe from the virus.With every day that passes, this looks more and more dangerously wrong.There is growing evidence that the virus is more severeyou catch it from multiple sources.

our schools is one of the key issues the nation will face when it steps carefully away from this Covid- lockdown.Based on the evidence, I believe that re-opening schools should be considered early in the exit strategy because it appears they play a relatively small role in transmissions.We tend to see children as excellent spreaders of bugs, and therefore ­closing schools seems to make sense.Yet research published earlier this week shows that this isn’t necessarily true for the Covid- virus.Almost everything we know about closing schools to stop disease outbreaks comes from influenza.Flu is a very dferent virus to coronavirus, and children drive much of influenza’s transmission.Coronavirus is less likely to affect children and young people.They rarely get very sick, and they mostly get very mild symptoms or show no ­symptoms at all.During the  epidemic caused by Sars — a cousin of Covid- — the data showed that schools and schoolchildren played no role in transmitting the virus.To

getting some online teaching  —  my -year-old had brilliant support from his school before the holidays.But we know that some schools are offering much less, and I worry that it is particularly the poorest children who are ­missing out.Children also benefit from school through contact with friends and adults outside their family.Plus there is support for mental health and even in the food that they might not get at home.School closures also force children together with parents at home for weeks on end.This can be a source of great bonding, but we know that, particularly for teens, being cut off from peer groups and other adults is not good for their development or mental health.The issue of forcing key worker parents to stay home has been largely solved during the pandemic by keeping some schools open just for their ­children.But for parents who are not key workers, being forced to look after ­children for weeks at home can prevent them earning an income.Closing schools has in the past been shown to increase social contacts between children outside school, and between children and adults looking after them, particularly grandparents, who are most vulnerable to this virus.Currently, those over  should be self- isolating away from children.But there are many grandparents who are under .Andschools stay closed while we allow adults to exit lockdown first, we risk an increase in contact between children and grandparents.One of the problems is that we tend to think of schools as being entirely closed or open.Our research showed that there are a range of potential options.It would mean a partial or staged re-opening with social distancing built in.The point of social distancing for schools is to reduce the number of children in contact at any one time.Ensuring that dferent school years don’t meet would be a useful start.So have half the school attend in the morning and half in the afternoon, close the playgrounds and stagger year-group start, end and break times so that ­dferent years never meet.Then ensure that dferent classes don’t meet.This could mean staggering start times by class or alternating the ways that classes enter and leave school, and ­keeping students in form classes for all their lessons.Schools could also look at how feasible social distancing is within classes.True, most British classrooms could not fit a metre between desks.However,only half of the school is attending at any one time, classes could spread out across more than one classroom.We also need very clear rules on when not to come to school with any ­symptoms, and the need for self-isolation at homeothers in the family had been ill will be required.Teachers need to be protected, as we protect those who ­continue to drive buses, man shopping centres and work in our health ­system.And teachers should be early in the queue for testing.This may all sound too dficult.However, we owe it to our ­children to examine all of these options.It could be done more easilywe had sufficient testing to know which children or teachers had had Covid-.But we may need to proceed ­without that, given what we are currently told about antibody-testing timescales.As mentioned, our schools are already ­partially open — for the children of key workers and vulnerable children.Let’s gradually increase that “partially” in a way that’s guided by

And the bus drivers — nine already dead in London alone from Covid-. And the pharmacists filling out prescriptions in tiny, windowless shops.And the postmen, delivery drivers, papergirls — and anonymous neighbours who put notes through doors offering help for the vulnerable.And the supermarket workers who stack the shelves to keep our nation fed. And a round of applause for our Queen,  this month, who gave the speech of a letime last Sunday — and for our Prime Minister who ended up in intensive care.From the bin men to Boris, we are surrounded by heroes — but the one glaring exception has been elite football.Despite inidual acts of heroism, such as Manchester United’s Marcus Rashford raising £million for underprivileged schoolkids, football has not covered itself in glory during this national emergency.On Wednesday, Premier League captains announced they were banding together to create a fund to raise millions for the NHS.This is a big-hearted gesture but can’t hide the fact that for much of this health crisis the national game has been hopelessly out of touch with the national mood.When the Prime Minister was seriously ill, it made the skin crawl to see whining millionaire footballers resisting pay cuts from clubs that have nothing to sell, no revenue coming in and no idea when football will begin again.Gordon Taylor, the £million-a-year chief of the Professional Footballers Association, has made his members about as popular as bankers.While the country fights for its le, Taylor has fought for the rights of loafing footballers to keep every last million. He has badly misjudged the moment, as have the clubs owned by billionaires who have furloughed their tea ladies while pampered footballers continue to earn up to £, a week.It has been embarrassing to see hypocritical footballers mistaking “lockdown” for “lock-in”, acting like the new rules do not apply to them.After previously urging fans to stay at home, Aston Villa’s Jack Grealish emerged bleary-eyed from an all-night party and pranged his -grand Range Rover.Manchester City’s Kyle Walker had a couple of escort girls delivered to his door, soon before telling the peasants to social distance and save lives and blah-blah-blah. All that stuff about washing your hands, Kyle — should that be before or after the escorts have been round And Spurs manager Jose Mourinho oversaw a training session on Hadley Common, for all the world asthere was one rule for the princes of football and one for the plebs who pay their wages.Do the fatheads of football ever watch the news Mass unemployment is coming. Many of the millions about to be chucked on the dole will be football fans. So how the hell can football — the players, clubs, PFA — continue to kid themselves the bubble they exist in has not already burst The world has changed.There should be no more all-night parties, no more escort girls and no more car prangs. Like it or not, footballers are role models and many will follow their lead.Troy Deeney, Watford captain and one of the prime movers behind the Players Together fund, defends Jack Grealish’s busy social le during the time of lockdown. “What’s he going to do ” Troy asked. “Sit in the yard on his own ”Yes, Troy — because that’s what millions are doing right now. Shocking, I know, but the new rules apply to footballers, too.Most footballers come from working-class backgrounds but too many of them have a sense of entitlement worthy of Marie Antoinette.Look what happened to her.NEVER going out is placing an unbearable strain on relationships.So it is nice to see that Camila Morrone, , and Leonardo DiCaprio, , seem to be happily self-isolating together.I was afraid Leo might decide Camila’s just too old for him.STEVE HEDLEY, rail union fat cat at the RMT, boasts that he would “throw a party”Boris Johnson died of coronavirus – and hopes “the whole Cabinet of Tory b******s” also become victims.If Hedley was on a ventilator fighting for his le, would he check how the doctors and nurses caring for him voted at the last election You don’t think those NHS heroes all voted Labour, do you, Steve WILLIAM and Kate carried out their first virtual royal duty this week, thanking teaching staff who look after the children of key workers.I have never seen smiles that wide on the faces of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.I am sure that, deep down inside, they are really missing Harry and Meghan.They are just covering it up really well.FAREWELL Honor Blackman, who has died at the age of , immortal for ever in her career-defining role as Pussy Galore in Goldfinger.It is funny how certain names fall out of favour.At school I had mates called Keith and Ian, but nobody is called Keith or Ian today.Same thing with Pussy Galore. Bond girls just don’t get called things like Pussy Galore any more.THIS lockdown is taking an enormous toll on jobs, education and mental health but most of us understand it is necessary.I am infuriated, though, by the constant threats to intensy the lockdown, including closing the parks,a handful of idiots continue to flout the rules.Health Secretary Matt Hancock rages that he finds it “unbelievable that people are not staying at home” – and threatens to ban all exercise.Personally, I find it unbelievable that Hancock makes threats like some little home counties Hitler.Give credit to the MILLIONS who are doing their best during the lockdown.Don’t threaten the decent majority with a punishment beating because a selfish minority break the rules.If this Government ramps up the lockdown they will lose the British people. And something will explode.If some morons can’t stick to the rules, punish THEM – not the rest of us.KILLING EVE lost its way when the show’s creator Phoebe “Fleabag” Waller-Bridge bailed out after the first series. The second series was painfully naff.Early reports on the third series, starting tomorrow on BBC iPlayer, are not promising.But Jodie Comer as Russian assassin Villanelle will always make you want to tune in. Evenit is just for her new outfits.THIS global catastrophe started in China.When the dead are buried and we stand among our ruined economies, there MUST be some kind of reckoning.After World War Two, the Potsdam Conference decided that Germany should pay billion for what Germany had inflicted on humanity.China is now boasting that le is back to normal there, while we are burying NHS nurses like Rebecca Mack, , who worked in a children’s cancer unit.

Is it safe for him to go back to work as a security guard A: If your husband has no symptoms after self-isolating for  days, he can go back.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealQ: COULD I have coronavirus but not have any symptoms A: There are undoubtedly many people who have been exposed to coronavirus who test positive but never have any symptoms. While they carry coronavirus in their nose and throat, they can potentially transmit the virus to people who can become sick. But asymptomatic people rarely carry the virus for more than  days.Q: WHY are the deaths at home and other places, such as care homes, not being included in the daily UK death toll total A: Deaths in hospitals and those in the community, including care homes, are collated separately. They are not necessarily reported on the day of the event itself either. Another problem is that many deaths in care homes may be attributed, rightly or wrongly, to corona- virus infectionthe cause of death is pneumonia and where no post-mortem is performed.So the picture we are seeing in hospital deaths gives us a better idea of trends and what is actually happening although, of course, many of the deaths here are in people with ­pre-existing diseases or who are very elderly.Q: MY -year-old daughter is not sleeping at night and seems anxious. How can I support her through this dficult time A: Many parents like you are worrying about their children’s understandable anxiety. Listen to their worries and acknowledge them. Make sure they are not picking up any  information from their friends or on social media. Restrict the amount of time they listen to the news.Instead, focus on all the wonderful things people are doing, such as volunteering and fundraising. You can also contact Every Mind Matters or visit the Government’s advice website at bit.ly JVErOt for specic help for parents.Q. I have no spleen. Should I self-isolate andso for how long A. You are immunocompromised and are therefore more vulnerable to contracting this virus.While you are not in the highest risk group you should work from home, stay home, only go out for essentials and keep physically distancing from other people.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was a magnicent address, from a magnicent woman.Her experience and serenity did more to calm and inspire the nation than anything  I can think of as this crisis has unfolded.Best of all, she reminded us that there will be le beyond this lockdown — that we will meet again.If we just focus on the here and now, we won’t be able to prepare for the future beyond the virus.But it’s also true that none of us can think straight when we are in the eye of the storm.That is where good leadership comes in. It helps us all to hold strong, not to go to pieces and to stick to the guidance given to us.Everyone looks to the leader to make decisions, and it’s the decisions we make that will chart our way out of the crisis.Unfortunately, after the Queen’s address to the nation came the news that Prime Minister Boris Johnson had been admitted to hospital intensive care.At that point, anyone who was in any doubt this illness did not discriminate was forced to reconsider.At the time of writing, Boris was back on a regular hospital ward. But his illness has been a reminder that any of us are susceptible to Covid-.Most people are shocked he is in hospital and sympathise with his pregnant girlfriend Carrie Symonds.But of course it has raised the question: Who is really in chargehe is not  Without leadership, we all get distinctly uneasy.We all have leaders in our lives. We are all looking towards them to show us what to do and lead us through it.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealSome companies have stepped up to the plate and are doing good things — reassuring their staff, treating people well and doing their utmost to make sure people will be paid. Some aren’t, of course. But good bosses are taking pay cuts and doing everything they can to keep their businesses alive and look after their staff.At West Ham United we continue to pay all our full and part-time staff  per cent of their wages.My financial director, my manager and I have all taken a  per cent reduction to make sure this happens.It’s when there’s a crisis like this that we see who is made of what.Boris’s temporary stand-in, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, while talking about the PM’s hospital admission, referred to him as his boss, his colleague, but also his friend.Respect and friendship are the key words when it comes to good leadership.A good leader makes the tough decisions because they are right, but they are also governed by ethics. They want to do the right thing, for the right reasons. They are happy to make personal sacrices to ensure the majority are looked after.It is more important now, than ever, to put people before profits.After three weeks of lockdown, with no chance of a let-up, it’s all too easy to fall prey to catastrophic, even apocalyptic thinking.But we have to sht our thought process. We have to accept and understand that, at some point, this WILL be over.When things are calmer and clearer, we can ask what we can do to ensure we are still operating as the world gets back to normal — whatever the new normal is.The experience we are all living through really is like a storm, which continues to rage.There are so many unprecedented aspects to this situation and there is not one person in the world who will come out of it unchanged.So while there are so many challenging and dficult things going on, perhaps this lockdown is a chance for us all to learn more about ourselves.How are you responding  Have you thought about how you can help others  Have you thought about volunteering for the NHS As well as the importance of good leadership, we all have our inidual roles when it comes to showing autonomy and courage about our own decisions.I’m sorry to say, things are going to get a lot worse before they get better.So we all need to take responsibility — or we will never get out of lockdown.ANYONE who saw the social media video of Naomi Watts reaching breaking point after her printer, vacuum cleaner and dishwasher all broke down will surely have smiled in recognition.Naomi, who has been self-isolating in her Los Angeles home for three weeks, shared her very understandable anguish with a slow-motion video of herself screaming with the sound of a lion’s roar played in the background.I think we can all relate to her frustration.My lockdown revelation I am happy to report that I have given up ironing!WHEN it comes to illness, particularly cancer, I’ve long resisted all the talk of going into battle – mainly because of the unhelpful implication of weakness among those who “lose” that fight by dying.I feel the same way about descriptions of people “fighting” coronavirus.Illness is a fact of le. It is not a sign of weakness.The sad and terrible truth is that some people get this virus and others do not.Some have it very badly – a whole lot worse than others.We don’t yet know exactly why. We don’t even knowwe have the virus and may infect people.We don’t knowthere are antibodies that can protect us from getting it again, or how long that will take.We don’t knowthere will be a more deadly mutation of the same virus in the future.There is just too much we don’t know.But there are some practical things we can do.We need to help those who have it now, and the NHS and the Government are doing all they can in this regard.We also need to stop the spread of the virus, through testing. Hopefully that is going to happen soon.Meanwhile, scientists are also working around the clock to create a vaccine.Perhaps, most of all, we need to prepare for the possibility that this could all happen again.We need to learn lessons on food distribution, working from home, adapting our businesses – and having proper personal protection and hospital equipment ready and waiting.AS time ticks on, we are all realising what le is like without the things we used to consider necessities.Like our hairdressers.Claudia Winkleman’s Instagram post showing how unmanageable her fringe has become during lockdown made me laugh in recognition.My hair is grey, long and unkempt.On the one hand, it’s the least of my worries, which is quite liberating.Still, I did manage to get my hands on some hair dye for the roots.Do I care that it’s completely the wrong shade NO. I do not.So please, can we all just agree to turn a blind eye to the way we look when we finally emerge from lockdown HAPPY Easter Sunday, people. How will you be spending yours Personally, I have lost track of what day it is. The past few weeks have been a blur, with every day feeling like a cross between Sunday and Monday.It was my birthday last week and, without loved ones to hug, friends to see, drinks to be had, it was more or less just another day.Equally, this is the first time ever that Easter has felt like just another weekend.But I hope you can find ways to make it special. Just make sure you do so at home.THERE has been talk of schools possibly reopening after the Easter holidays – and who knows whether or not that is true But one thing I do know is that, whenever they do reopen, working parents will not only give the most massive sigh of relief, they will all be thanking their children’s teachers profusely for everything that they do.We will all also be thanking doctors, nurses, all NHS employees, as well as bin men, cleaners, shop assistants and all the other key workers we have under-paid and taken for granted.I really hope that is one thing which changes as a result of this pandemic.These people are the backbone of our country.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

One says that restrictions should be lted sooner rather than later to reboot our ecomony, while the other argues that the restrictions are working, so now is not the right time to lt them.When Chancellor Rishi Sunak first announced his bail-out plan last month, it was estimated that ten to  per cent of workers in the ­private sector would need Government support.Now economic forecasters believe it could be a third of the total private sector workforce. That will cost the British taxpayer between £billion and £billion every three months.To date, about a fth of small businesses have been pushed into bankruptcy. If the lockdown continues to July, that figure will rise to a third.The effect of this on the economy will be catastrophic. According to the ­Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, Britain’s GDP could contract by  per cent over the next two years. It shrank by six per cent during the global financial crisis of -.The Centre for Economics and Business Researchsays the lockdown is costing £.billion a day.Given we are now  days into the lockdown, this means we are already more than £billlion out of pocket.In short,we don’t ease off on the social distancing measures and re-boot the economy, we’re heading for the biggest economic downturn since the s.Against this, we are told thatwe end the lockdown more people will become infected, demand for critical hospital care will outstrip the NHS’s capacity and we’ll begin to see people dying in even greater numbers.I’m sceptical about that prognosis.It is based on the statistical modelling of Professor Neil Ferguson and his team at Imperial College, but there is mounting evidence that they under-estimated the percentage of the population already infected with coronavirus and over- estimated how deadly this disease is.According to Prof Ferguson’s model, fewer than five per cent of people have been infected. But according to another model, this one produced by Oxford University, it could be higher than  per cent, which would mean we are on our way to acquiring herd immunity.When Chris Whitty, England’s Chief Medical Officer, was asked at Thursday’s press conference what percentage of the world’s population has been infected, he put the figure at  per cent.If the true figure is between  and  per cent, the NHS can probably copewe ease off on some of the more extreme social distancing measures.Would ending the lockdown be ­gambling with people’s lives  Yes, but so will keeping it in place.Economic downturns cost lives, just as surely as viruses. During the global financial crisis of –, the suicide rate in Europe increased by . per cent. Economic recessions also cause a rise in poverty, domestic ­violence and murder.Philip Thomas, professor of risk ­management at Bristol University, has calculated thatour GDP falls by more than . per cent as a result of the lockdown, more years of le will be lost than saved.Politicians here and where have justied their cautious approach by ­saying they refuse to put a price on human le, as though the trade-off is between the lives of vulnerable people and economic growth.But the real trade-off is between the lives we might losewe end the ­lockdown tomorrow and the lives we know we will losewe keep it in place indefinitely.MPs aren’t being morally ­courageous. Rather, they’re just focusing on the next -hour news cycle, as they always do.What’s needed is a bold political leader who’s willing to risk some short-term pain to re-start the economy, thereby safeguarding all of our futures.I know of just such a person, but unfortunately he’s in hospital recovering from coronavirus.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealThe UK government’s measures to contain the coronavirus epidemic are just starting to make a ­dference.And with the three-week lockdown under review tomorrow, now is NOT the time to lt them.After a slow and indecisive start, the measures they now have put in place, including recommendations to stay at home, limiting travel, physical ­distancing, banning large gatherings and shutting shops and pubs, are just starting to show signs that they are slowing the spread of the virus.This means that there are fewer new cases, with fewer people becoming seriously sick and less demand on hospital beds, intensive care and articial ventilation.This means that the pressure on health services is reduced, which, in turn, will lead to fewer deaths from Covid- and other causes.Without the actions that have been taken and just letting the epidemic run its course, we would be likely to see more than half the population infected, and an overwhelmed health system with maybe five million hospital admissions and at least , deaths.The measures that have been taken in the UK have been of moderate strength compared to other countries.In France and Spain, the lockdown has been more severe, while in Sweden it has been less strict.The coronavirus epidemic can be thought of like a fire.If we starve a fire of oxygen, then the flames will stop and it will die down.So it is with the epidemic — reduce transmission from person to person and the number of cases will go down.Butyou let the oxygen come back too early, any embers in the fire will light up again and it will restart.So,we relax the lockdown too early, while there is still transmission of the virus going on, then the epidemic will restart.And that means that we would have wasted the efforts we have made so far.When transmission has stopped, or is at low enough levels that it can be monitored and each case and their contacts identied, isolated and treated, then the lockdown can be relaxed.We have not yet reached the peak of the epidemic, and we do not yet have the infrastructure in place for the systematic testing that will be needed to identy new cases, so now is not the time to relax the lockdown measures.Some people have talked about the serious damage done to the economy by measures the Government has put in place and the social disruption these have caused, in order to protect the public health of the nation.They have argued the lockdown will cause more harm than good in the long term. This is a  dilemma.Every le matters. Each person lost is a family member, a friend, a neighbour, a human being.They are not a number on a spreadsheet.This lockdown is the only way for us to get back on our feet.If left uncontrolled, the coronavirus by itself will cause social and economic disruption as well as damaging public health.It doesn’t need any help from politicians.It is up to us all, for the sake of ourselves, our families and our loved ones, to follow the rules, and our solidarity will allow the country totowards normal as soon as possible.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He was asked on Sky News: “Shesaid she’s sorry, is that good enough ” to which Ashworth replied: “No, I mean it wasn’t really an apology was it  It was one of those half-hearted apologies where you use the word sorry to give the impression that you apologised, but you’re not actually in reality apologising.  “We’ve had the doctor’s bodes, the nurses bodies, we hear stories everyday of healthcare workers on the front line forced to cut up curtains to make their own PPE, we’ve heard stories of nurses in bin liners because they couldn’t get PPE, and those nurses have now come down with coronavirus. This has been unacceptable. It has not been good enough.” It comes after Health Secretary Matt Hancock revealed today that  NHS workers had died during the coronavirus outbreak. The Government has been slammed for not providing health workers with enough personal protective equipment, putting their lives at risk as they treat patients infected with the virus.  Dr Rinesh Parmar, chair of the Doctorsapos Association, previously said some of his members felt like aposlambs to the slaughterapos and aposcannon fodderapos because of the lack of proper clothing. The Mirror revealed how some medics were so desperate for protection they cut up hospital curtains to use as gowns. NHS worker Thomas Harvey, who  caring for a coronavirus patient at Londonaposs Goodmayes Hospital but did not have any PPE, died after reportedly catching the disease.  The dad-of-seven passed away in self-isolation at home and police officers had to break down a door to retrieve his body. The -year-old had spent weeks fighting for his le after developing symptoms including a cough, shortness of breath, weakness, and aches and pains all over his body. He wasnapost given personal protective equipmentsuch as a mask at work, and he didnapost knowhe was infected with coronavirus because he wasnapost given a test, claims longtime friend and colleague of his who did not wish to be named.

It is not easy to stop at home when we are blessed with the rare treat in Britain of glorious weather at Easter. You are not only saluting the heroic efforts of NHS staff on the frontline but also joining in the national fight against an invisible enemy with more destructive potential than any the world has ever faced. If you are among the selfish minority flouting the rules there is, bluntly, only one thing we can say. You should be condemned as traitors to the national cause. We are all keen for the lockdown to be over. But impatience will not make the virus go away. A clear, coherent exit strategy is needed. Both to suppress the spread of the virus and to map a way out of the crisis. We are, on the whole, heeding the government advice on social distancing. That is the first step. The advice is right, and there are the first glimmers that it may be working. But that will not, in itself, show us the way out of lockdown. And any premature lting of the restrictions will risk a deadly second wave. It pains us to criticise the Government at a time of crisis. But failures are becoming clear and, without wishing to score any political points, justiable questions need to be asked. Was the Government too slow to act on supplies of masks, gloves, gowns and ventilators  Has it been truthful about shortages  Or even about the death rates, which do not include the tragic figures from care homes  Questions for a future inquiry. Now ministers need to show us what is being done to lead us to an effective and safe exit.

Becky Aitken was due to tie the knot this month but says her ex partner will now be “rotting in jail where he belongs” after he pushed her into a bath and threw an ashtray at her head.The -year-old was left needing stitches to her face after the brutal assault by her ex Lee Mulligan, reports Hull Live.Mulligan, , of Rhodena Avenue, Bridlington, was jailed last month at Hull Crown Court. Becky, who is from east Yorkshire, said the attack happened last November because she was late getting home from his mother’s house.  The mum-of-three said: “It was horric. He was like a raging bull. Lee was asleep on the couch when I got in but as soon as I walked into the living room, he started on me, demanding to know where Iaposd been. “I ran from room to room, but he followed me, hitting and punching me as I ran. Then he threw me across the landing so hard, I fell into the bath with him towering over me. I donapost know how, but I managed to break free and run downstairs. I saw him throw the big heavy ashtray through the air. It hit me in the face and knocked me off my feet.  After the attack Becky sought solace with a neighbour who called the police. Becky became engaged to Lee in September. She said Lee had started to become controlling and possessive shortly into their relationship, which began three years ago. Lee would commentI was a few minutes late back from visiting my pals,” she added. He even questioned me after Iaposd been to the supermarket. I felt like I had to account for my whereabouts every day. At first, I was flattered that he wanted to be with me constantly. I thought maybe he was a bit insecure. I was in no doubt that he loved me. I loved him, so I put up with him being possessive, and of course we had plenty of good times too. She now says she wants nothing to do with her ex-partner. During the court case, Clare Holmes, representing Mulligan said the couple had reunited and were planning to marry this month – but Becky says this is . Mulligan’s defence also relied heavily on the fact Becky did not complete a victim personal statement.  She said she did not complete one because she was frightened by the repercussions. Judge John Thackray said that just because there was no victim personal statement, it did not mean Mulligan should get a suspended sentence. He told Mulligan: Let me make it clear that your offending is not less serious because it is in a domestic setting. There is a breach of trust in that element and a vulnerability in her.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailCampaigners have called for a coronavirus levy on the household name tech giants accused of­ avoiding at least £.billion in tax. The Fair Tax Mark wants a ­dramatic change in taxation so that international companies help fund the crippling cost of the lockdown in Britain – instead of lowly-paid workers like NHS staff.The demand come just weeks after five tech giants – including Google – were accused of avoiding tax worth an estimated £.billion in the UK last year. Paul Monaghan, chief executive of Fair Tax Mark, said: “Silicon Valley mega-corporations such as Apple, Facebook and Google should be forced, at last, to make a fair tax contribution to the public services on which they rely, just like the rest of us. “No public money, be that ­ coronavirus bailouts or public ­procurement contracts, should go toward businesses that refuse to sign a Fair Tax Lockdown pledge.“This would entail a binding public commitment from them to shun tax avoidance and tax havens.” The call was backed by Labour’s new shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds, who said: “At a time when so many people are seeing income plummet, many tech companies are ­experiencing a boom. “It’s more important than ever they are paying their fair share of tax. Labour will continue to push the Government to help secure vital funding for our NHS and public services at this critical time.” Britain’s economy is predicted to shrink by - per cent between this month and June. And the cost to the taxpayer of the job retention scheme has been estimated at £- billion over the three months. Meanwhile Apple, Google, Cisco, Facebook and Microsoft raked in a combined profit of £.billion in Britain in , think-tank Tax Watch UK said in February.  But it claimed they used complex financial structures to take profits offshore and pay a fraction of the tax they should have handed over. Their UK corporation tax totalled £million in  – an effective tax rate of just . per cent. Tax Watch estimates Apple avoided a ­£million bill, Google £million, Facebook £million, Microsoft £million and Cisco £million. In the UK, Facebook paid just £.million in corporation tax in  despite a record £.billion in British sales. This week it emerged Google paid £million in UK ­corporation tax in the last year – ­despite £.billion in revenues. Research company eMarketer this week estimated Google made ­£.billion in ad revenue in the UK last year and will make more than £billion this year. Amazon paid only £million tax on British revenue of £.billion. The Government is attempting to crack down on moving profits to low-tax areas and is planning a  per cent digital service tax. But campaigners say tech giants will always sht profits to tax havens unless governments work with each other.  Fair Tax Mark’s Mr Monaghan said: “In the long term, governments need to get together and rip up the ­international rule book and move toward something called unitary taxation. “Profits would be ­apportioned to each country for tax on the basis of where real economic activity takes place. For Google this would likely see a four to five-fold rise in the corporation tax paid in the UK.” "},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus can spread 13ft twice","story":"NewsCoronavirus can spread ft which is twice the social distancing limit, study claimsThe published study in journal Emerging Infectious Diseases also found the virus was mainly found on floors, rubbish bins, the soles of shoes and sickbed handrailsShareCommentsByGrace Witherden:,  APR NewsWere all at armsbecause of the pandemic\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

The novelty of working from home has worn thin, we get more excited about a daily walk than the average dog and we canapost remember a time you didnapost have to queue to get into a supermarket. It might prove to be especially tiresome for parents who have seen their children forced to say at home, as they attempt to balance working with childcare and homeschooling. PE with Joe Wicks is perfect to fill half an hour in the mornings, but it still leaves what feels like an unending amount of time to keep the little ones entertained. But one dad may have found the devious solution weaposve all been looking for - and all it takes is a bit of water. Duncan Gillespie, from Sheffield, posted a video on Twitter, showing his two sons, Jem, five, and Bram, three, busily working away in the garden. He captioned the clip: Just froze the kids toys in ice and gave them only spoons to free them. Time for a bacon sandwich and some coding. It shows two hefty blocks of ice created by filling a plastic container with water and submerging his offspringaposs prized possessions, before leaving to freeze. It featured a selection of their current favourites, including a triceratops, a shark, a tiny T-Rex and a dolphin. The two are happily sat chipping away at the ice very slowly with the blunt spoons, hoping to one day be reunited with their toys again.  Duncan revealed his children stuck at it and eventually completed the rescue mission after about an hour when they headed inside due to rain and used their dadaposs boots to smash the blocks. I was quite chuffed with myself because I set them up in the garden, came back inside, made myself a bacon sandwich and sat down. They loved it. It was quite fun to watch them come up with strategies. As I was out there I could see them saying aposwhat happenswe push it down the slideapos, aposwhat happenswe drop itapos. They were trying all sorts of things. Theyaposre both very creative boys so it was just kind of fuel for their creativity. I think thataposs why they played with it for so long.  Getting out in the garden is our respite because to be honest they have been watching a bit too much TV. School and nursery have been very good and giving us lots of suggestions and weaposve been doing PE with Joe Wicks as well. Youaposve just got to get by and try not to put too much pressure on them. He tried to use the game again the following day but the boys had learned their lesson and went straight for the boots, ending things rather abuptly. Other parents applauded the hilarious idea, as it was suggested he should be nominated for an OBE.

She has now moved to LA with husband Prince Harry and son Archie, and the family are getting to grips with their new, non-royal lives.

Christine is quick to praise Meghanaposs royal style, and chatted about some of her highlights over the past two years.

The #YouAreNotAlone initiative will aim to reassure domestic abuse sufferers that support is available during the coronavirus lockdown. Members of the public have been asked to show solidarity for abuse victims by sharing a photo of a heart on their palm, and asking others to do the same. It is hoped that the campaign will show victims that they are not alone and to convey to perpetrators that domestic abuse is unacceptable in any circumstances.The campaign will be publicising support available including the freephone,  hour National Domestic Abuse Helpline number –    – run by Refuge.From next week, adverts raising awareness of where people can seek help will run across social media and materials will be made available in charities and supermarkets. Additionally, the Home Secretary will announce that the Home Office is working with charities and the Domestic Abuse Commissioner to provide an additional £ million to immediately bolster domestic abuse helplines and online support. Charities have reported a surge in activity since the social distancing guidelines came into force, so the funding will help to ensure that all victims can access vital support safely and securely. Tools such as online support services, including a messaging service with domestic abuse experts, will help those most at risk of abuse.This follows Chancellor Rishi Sunak ’s £m boost to the charity sector, which will benefit domestic abuse charities, to support the most vulnerable in our society.This £m funding will support charities providing key services and supporting vulnerable people during the Covid- crisis. Domestic abuse charities are being urged to bid when the new scheme is up and running in the coming weeks. Home Secretary Priti Patel is expected to say:“ Coronavirus has opened Britain’s enormous heart and shown our love and compassion for one another as we come together to help those most in need.“I am now asking this nation to use that amazing compassion and community spirit to embrace those trapped in the horric cycle of abuse.  “And to help us all look out for those who need help, we have created a symbol of hope – a handprint with a heart on – so that people can easily show that we will not tolerate abuse as a society, and that we stand in solidarity with victims of domestic abuse. “I would urge everyone to share it on social media or in the windows of your home, alongside a link to the support available, to demonstrate just how much this country cares. “And to show victims of domestic abuse: you are not alone.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mobile network ee gives free","story":"NewsMobile network EE gives free unlimited data to NHS staff for the next six monthsEE said all NHS staff on pay monthly contracts will get free unlimited data for six months to give them \"one less thing to worry about\" during the coronavirus crisisShareCommentsByGrace Witherden:,  APR NewsThe company has made the gesture for hard working NHS heroes \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

Powerful, poignant words in an extraordinary poem written by a woman who lost her sister. When Dorothy Duffy read her tribute to Rose Mitchell on Radio  and Five Live, listeners flocked to stream it. Today we offer this abridged version to keep as a symbol of defiance…. and hope. My sister is not a statistic Tomorrow, when the deathometer of Covid is announced in sonorous tones. While all the time the bodies still mount and curl towards the middle of the curve, my sister will be among those numbers. Among the throwaway lines, the platitudes and lowered eyes, an older person with underlying health conditions. A pitul way to lay rest the bare bones of a le. My sister is not a statistic. Her underlying conditions were love, kindness, belief in the essential goodness of mankind, uproarious laughter. Forgiveness, compassion, a storyteller, a survivor, a comforter, a force of nature and so much more. My sister is not a statistic. She died without the soft touch of a loved one’s hand, the feathered kiss upon her forehead, the muted murmur of familiar family voices gathered round her bed  Without the gentle laughter that comes with memories recalled, evoked from a time that already seems distant, when we were connected by the simplicity of touch, of voice, of presence. My sister is not a statistic. She was a woman who spanned the seven ages, a mother, grandmother, great grandmother, sister, friend, aunt, carer, giver. My sister is not a statistic. And so she joins the mounting thousands.  They are not statistics on the deathometer of Covid, they are the wives, mothers, children, fathers, sisters, brothers, the layers of all our loved ones. If she could, believe me when I say, she would hold every last one of your loved ones, croon to and comfort them and say ‘you were loved’.

For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic,  click hereShe says she now has just p and a few items of food to last until her next Universal Credit payment and has struggled to get through to the Department of Work and Pensions to arrange an advance payment. “I have phoned up numerous times. I’m just sat on the settee ringing again and again. “You just get a recorded message then after five minutes on hold it cuts you off. “I was pretty shocked. I’m phoning up about money for food. This is the same number for everyone. “It’s already hard to get through to anyone - I feel so sorry for people having to apply for the first time.” Dallas says she receives £ a month in UC, £ of which is spent on rent. She usually spends around £ a week on heating and electricity and other bills, but says her outgoings have drastically increased since the lockdown began. “Normally I would walk to Oldham, which takes about an hour, spend four hours in the library and come back. That would be five or six hours a day that I’d be out of the flat,” she says. “But now I’m just sitting in a cold flat. It’s like sitting in an old damp jail cell in here. “I don’t watch telly all day, I’ve been trying to do a bit of drawing to break up the monotony.” She adds: “I had to sell the fridge to get £ just to be able to pay for heating because I’m not normally in the flat each day. I’m always at the library and I’m using their heating and electricity. “I couldn’t afford to run the fridge so I sold it. I’ve got a small telly and my wi and that’s it. “At night I have to sit here and for lighting I use tealights. I buy a bag of tealights at the start of the month and use those. “It’s been like that constantly. Just the telly on and using tealights for light. Nobody should be living like this.” She says she cannot afford to run the heating throughout the day and the cold has made her feel ill and has seen her wearing a hat to bed and lots of jumpers in the day.  “I put the heating on for five minutes in the morning to dry clothes and for ten minutesI have a bath. “If you’re already poor you can’t go panic buying. I’ve got p in my purse at the moment.” Dallas says has been living on a diet of porridge and says she has a pizza, some bread, a jar of coffee and a box of eggs to tide her over until her next UC payment.

Her Majesty is keen to ensure Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, the youngest children of Kate Middleton and Prince William, donapost miss out during the Covid- lockdown. Louis will turn two on April , while Charlotte will celebrate her fth birthday on May . And it is believed the Queen, , who is said to have become rather tech-savvy of late, is planning to celebrate their special days using video conferencing. It comes as the country is in the midst of a coronavirus lockdown, with no end seemingly in sight, so by the time the two youngstersapos birthdays arrive the Royals will probably still be unable to see each other. The youngsters, as well as big brother Prince George, have already been sending aposchatty videosapos to keep in touch with their grandad Prince Charles, as well as the Queen, who they affectionately call aposGan Ganapos. Royal expert Angela Mollard told the ROYALS podcast: So little Prince Louis is turning two on April . Then Charlotte turns five on May .  So, within a week and a bit of each other two of them will be having birthdays. Obviously, they won’t be able to have friends over. Knowing Kate, she would have a whole schedule of party type things to do.  She continued: Remember her parents run a party planning company. I imagine Carole Middleton, because she can’t see the children, has got all these things sorted. Of course, they still have plenty of staff to make birthday cakes and help construct party poppers.  I don’t think the poor Cambridge children will be doing without. They just obviously will not have their friends.

The comedian was horried by the Sunday Mirror’s exclusive snaps of bats, snakes and dogs dumped on a street to be sold in North Sulawesi, Indonesia. Other markets had dead rats next to live reptiles with jaws tied shut. Dead dogs lay on crates holding live cats. Comedian Ricky backed our call for action, saying: “For the sake of people and animals, wildle trade and consumption has to end, now.”The coronavirus is feared to have spread from a market in Wuhan, China.Ricky is backed by fellow star Paul O’Grady, wildle hosts Michaela Strachan and Philippa Forrester and reality star Pete Wicks. Ricky,  said: “We can’t carry on exploiting animals, eating wildle and trashing the planet. The wildle trade and markets have to close, otherwise it will be a case of when, and not , we have another global pandemic.” In a message aimed directly at politicians he added: “How bad does this have to get before you close down Indonesia’s extreme animal markets that pose the exact same risk as the wildle wet markets in Wuhan, China ”  The Huanan Seafood Wholesale market in Wuhan was shut on January  and Shenzhen last week became the first Chinese city to ban consumption and trade of dog and cat meat. But in Indonesia, locals say trade goes on in defiance of orders to close. In Kawangkoan on March , pictures showed reptiles alongside bats. In nearby Tomohon, dogs were bludgeoned, blowtorched and displayed beside bats and butchered snakes.  And the grim scenes were repeated only last week, said the charity Animal Friends Manado Indonesia. Paul O’Grady, , host of For the Love of Dogs, has seen a wet market in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. He said: “I was horried. There were dogs on hooks that have been skinned, cages of live kittens. The cruelty is unbelievable.”  Presenter and producer Philippa, , said: “We’re asking impoverished people to make a huge cultural and economic sht. It isn’t easy for a man who has sold dogs to feed his family to just give up his income, however abhorrent we feel it is, so the support needs to come from the top.” Springwatch host Michaela Strachan, , said: “I have seen the appalling conditions in wild animal markets.

That would mean you couldn’t have everyone back at the same time. “You would need to focus on the key year groups, such as Year  and Year .” Experts advising the government have said that social distancing measures, such as working from home, may need to stay in place indefinitely to prevent new waves of infections after the current lockdown is relaxed.Officials have said that Brits may not be able toto normal le until a coronavirus vaccine is available next year.Patrick Roach, the new general secretary of the NASUWT, said a number of teachers on the front line are calling for access to PPE and Covid- testing as they are concerned about the health of their families. He said Government advice suggesting that teachers do not need personal protective equipmentwhen working in schools during the Covid- outbreak is dodgy and unhelpful.  He also urged the Government not to rush to reopen schools to all pupils until teachers had been properly consulted on the process as he warned that learning could be compromised. Dr Roach added that asking students toto school during the summer break, which runs from mid July to late August, to start the academic year early could lead to pupil burn-out.

But now it seems they might be able to spread it on their fur. However the British Veterinary Associationstressed “owners should not worry” about being infected by their pets. Dr Angel Almendros, of Hong Kong’s City University, confirmed: “There isn’t a single case of a pet dog or cat infecting a human with Covid-.” But early research shows moggies may be able to catch the virus from other cats. BVA president Daniella Dos Santos said the association has since claried its recommendations and says pet owners should take precautions “onlysomeone in their household showed symptoms”. She added: “Practise good hand hygiene. An animal’s fur could carry the virus for a timea pet were to have come into contact with someone who was sick.”  It is the cats themselves that may be susceptible to infection from respiratory droplets – virus particles suspended in air that people cough, sneeze or exhale. In Belgium, one unfortunate feline tested positive about a week after its owner showed Covid- symptoms. And tests in China provided evidence of infected cats passing it to other mogs.  Meanwhile, fears that humans can give the disease to animals is growing. There is evidence we can transmit respiratory infections to wild great apes, which makes the global spread of Covid- a real concern for conservationists. But in all cases, it is infected humans who pose the threat. Professor Bryan Charleston, of the UK’s Pirbright Institute, which studies infectious diseases, said: “We know the virus did make the jump from an animal into humans at the beginning of this crisis. “But that appears to be because people were eating infected animals.” There are reports of people dumping pets, fearing they will give them the disease.

One shocked mum, Margaret Ates-Suddes, whose -year-old son Ilhan has cancer, yesterday branded the le or death request as inhumane. Another enraged mother claims her  year-old son was called directly by their GP surgery to ask to consent to a DNR form. The order instructs medics not to perform CPRa patient stops breathing or their heart stops.The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence had told ­doctors to assess people with learning disabilities, autism or cerebral palsy on a “clinical frailty scale” meaning some would be denied ­hospital treatment. Days later Nice did a U-turn after being ­challenged by disabled charities but there are concerns about how the guidance is being interpreted by GPs. Ilhan, of Scar-borough, North Yorks, has a rare form of cancer called ­fibrosarcoma in his neck and jaw. He has to feed through a tube and has a hole in his throat to breath. Mum Margaret, , says the shock call from her GP ­surgery came “totally out of the blue” this week. She said: “They askedwe wanted a DNRIlhan had to be taken to hospital with coronavirus. “When I ­complained, one GP told me there had been a mistake. But how on earth can someone see an -year-old boy’s age on a computer and think that it is ­responsible behaviour  Ilhan is an oncology patient and this is something we would decide with his consultant at Leeds General Infirmary, where the treatment has been amazing.” She added: “Ilhan has fought cancer for seven years and there’s no way I’m going to let anyone give up on him. “Nobody has the right to decide whether someone is worthy of CPR or not. Ilhan is a fighter, always has been.” There was no one available for ­comment at Ilhan’s surgery, which we have chosen not to name.  A -year-old lad from Colchester, Essex, also ­received a call from his surgery askinghe would agree to the DNA order. The boy, who has ­asthma and the connective tissue disorder Ehlers-Danlos, has a say in his own care plan. His mum said: “The surgery called to askhe had enough asthma packs, then askedhe would agree to a DNR on his notes. He asked them what it meant and when they told him he said, ‘Hell no, I’m only .’ “He is about to sit his A-levels. How can his le be worth nothing  He thinks the Government wants him dead.” Last night the boy’s GP surgery said it was unable to comment due to data protection.Elizabeth John, , of Bridgend, South Wales, also got an apology from her GP surgery after they sent a DNR form. Elizabeth, who has cancer, said: “I was made to feel like I was worthless and a burden to society. But I’m not dying yet.”  Her surgery wrote: “Our letter was poorly worded and did not properly articulate the care and commitment we have for our ­patients. We would like to sincerely apologise.” Mencap Chief Executive Edel Harris said: “These letters from GP surgeries are deeply troubling.They wrongly ­conflate having support needs with frailty and risk people with a learning disability not getting equal access to healthcare and ­potentially dying avoidably. “We are extremely concerned these letters have already forced parents or carers to make potentially le or death decisions.” Labour’s shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: “This will already be a hugely worrying time for vulnerable people and their families and being asked to make a decision like this will undoubtedly cause more ­distress for them.

Dr Greene told NBC Miami : “I was just shocked that the judge would take this stance without talking to medical experts and knowing the facts and take it so lightly, take my child from me and not think of the effect on her, her mental and psychological well-being.” She said she usually shares custody with her daughter’s father, Eric Greene, but he filed for temporary sole custody when the pandemic hit. He asked for and received an emergency order due “due to the mother’s signicantly heightened exposure to Covid-,” despite the fact Dr Greene has tested negative to the virus.In his court order, Circuit Judge Bernard Shapiro wrote: “In order to protect the best interests of the minor child, including but not limited to the minor child’s safety and welfare, this Court temporarily suspends the Former We’s timesharing until further Order of Court. The suspension is solely related to the outbreak of Covid-.”Dr Greene, who is an emergency room physician, said she believes this discriminates against health care workers.She said: “I know I’m not alone, first responders, nurses, so many people in this position who, because they’re orced, their children are suffering and theyaposre being told they can’t see them, and it’s just not fair.” She said guidance from the American Medical Association’s position on the issue said frontline physicians should be able to go home to their families and to their children, as long as they take proper precautions. Eric Greene’s attorney told the news sit it was not appropriate to comment on the case. Dr Greene says she is now appealing the ruling.

The flour shelves at many stores are completely bare, leaving many wannabe Mary Berries wondering how theyaposre going to make their banana bread. But donapost fear, as there are lots of substitutes you can use for those delicious homebaked treats. Letaposs start with the flour, as itaposs one of the basic ingredients for most cakes and cookies. Although plain and self-raising flour are the most common types we think of when it comes to baking, there are a number of substitutes that you may already have at home - including nuts.  Great British Bake Off contestant Ruby Tandoh told HuffPost UK that: Cakes made with ground almonds or polenta are a good alternative to traditional wheat flour cakes at the moment.And, even though they wonapost be as light and fluffy, theyaposll be just as sweet and perfect for citrus flavours. Another alternative Ruby suggests is ground oats. By using a food-processor you can get a rougher type of flour - even though it wonapost be as fine as store-bought flour it will still work well in banana bread, apple cake or fruit loaves. However, swapping a wheat flour for an oat flour may not necessarily work, so try and pick out a recipe that has been tried and tested with oat flour as they have dfering types of elasticity, protein types and absorbency.  Yeast If you have a recipe which asks you for a leavener like baking soda, baking powder and yeast to help your baked goods rise, but you have none to spare, use baking soda with lemon juice or buttermilk and vinegar. Although these two options will help your dough rise, the texture or rise may still dfer from when you use yeast. Butter Whilst unsalted butter is the most common type to use whilst baking, you can swap this out for margarine, dairy-free aposspreadsapos, shortening, Trex, coconut oil, or even lard - but lard is best saved for savoury pies as it has a slightly fattier taste. Whilst the consistency of the mix will be softer than usual and trickier to handle it will still work just as fine. Andyou donapost have any of the above, you could try grated vegetables like carrots or courgettes. They release water during baking as salt in the baking powder and the sugar draws water out of vegetables as it’s heated.  Eggs Donapost have any eggs  Thataposs okay, you can use a range of substitutes like aquafaba, linseeds, chia seeds, bananas and apple puree.

I willto the stage and you will listen until I am finished.’“They did exactly as he said. No-one exited to go the toilet or asked for the bar during his performance.”The overwhelming majority of audience members at comedy shows are courteous and they have certainly been spoiled for choice at the Caird in the last  years.Home-grown favourite Frankie Boyle, Have I Got News for You star Paul Merton and Irish funnyman Dara O’Briain would be among the dozens to bring headline shows to the city centre in the st century.In , Sarah Millican made history, as she became the first female stand-up to headline a show at the Caird.That year would also mark a bittersweet moment for Susan as Billy Connolly gave his Dundee swansong.But as Susan recalls, the Big Yin managed to steal the show  hours before he was due to bow out.She added: “The night before his show, Jake Bugg was appearing and Billy came along with his daughter.“I got them discreetly seated in the balcony, got back downstairs and the fire alarm was activated. It was full evacuation.“By the time I got back to the balcony for Billy, the house lights were up full and instead of leaving the building the standing stalls audience were applauding Billy.“It was so lovely but we had to move quickly.”The following year would mark another milestone for comedy.Kevin Bridges would storm his way into Caird Hall folklore in  by selling out five shows in a row, a record run for the iconic venue.Almost  years have passed since Bob Hope first strode onto the Caird’s floorboards and set the standard for the stellar quality of comics to follow.The acts that have passed through the doors since would make up a hall of fame of stand-up comedy.A gut-busting night of hilarity seems a distant prospect in the midst of the current pandemic.Rest assured, the Caird Hall will be there to bring back the sounds of laughter.

I was free to talk to clubs.“I spoke to Mark McGhee at Motherwell and Gus MacPherson at St Mirren.“The chance to go to England and play for that club [Coventry] came up and it was a no-brainer really.“My agent and I sat down…we didn’t need to think about it.“There were other reasons why it was more beneficial for me – you’re trying to make a living in your career.“I had three top-flight teams up here who I had the chance to go to.“Lee Wilkie was at Dundee United at the time.

I got one cap but I was in the squad seven or eight times.“Getting to train with people like Jonny Evans, Steven Davis…I loved the training and I loved the trips.“I would’ve liked to get more game time but it was causing a problem to my back and ultimately that’s why I stopped.”He made his Northern Ireland debut in a - hammering at the hands of the Netherlands on June , , just weeks after his Hibs side were beaten - by Hearts in the Scottish Cup Final.McPake – who came up against Dutch stars Arjen Robben, Wesley Sneijder and Robin van Persie – said: “It wasn’t like a normal friendly, it was mayhem.“The Amsterdam Arena was packed. I’m looking at it and going, ‘Wow’.“I think in that two weeks, with the Scottish Cup Final and then that game, I got beat - on aggregate.“I had a week in Dubai between that so I suppose that makes up for it.”McPake is approaching six years at Dens Park, after initially joining as a player in May , and he didn’t envisage such a long spell at the club.He said: “If I did, I’d be living in Dundee or somewhere around about there.

It would be our intention,the season is brought to an early conclusion, where practical, to reimburse those season ticket holders for the remainder of the season that was not played.  This will be further assessed for timelines, etc., as we make our way through the claims process. We have often said that the club is a family and that remains true throughout this situation.In addition to our insurance coverage, we have also sought to access ious sources of support offered by the League, the Association, Government agencies and our associates.  All that have been involved have been extremely helpful in our solidication of the club as a business.  I would like to personally thank John Bennett for his very generous and selfless gesture of suspending rent on the stadium. His call, on day one of this crisis helped to set the tone for all that followed throughout this shutdown and is the epitome of showing how we are all in this together.The UK Government and its agencies have also been extremely helpful in the offering of grants loans and providing relief through the Job Retention Scheme.  That includes HMRC. It is our experience, thus far, that this country’s handling of the crisis exceeds others in the mitigation of losses for businesses as well as iniduals.  In the coming days we will be implementing elements of the job retention scheme in respect of our staff and it is our intention that all are looked after fully throughout this crisis. This includes our football players, football staff and administrative staff receiving full pay while they are on furlough for the foreseeable future.We also think it is right to give credit to the dedicated workers at the SPFL and SFA. They have been working in an ever-changing landscape throughout this unprecedented event. They have continued to keep us informed and provide us advice on how to best navigate this predicament. They have freely shared the advice and guidance they are receiving from the government and UEFA as we all feel our way through these weeks. We continue to take advice and express our opinions on what football should look like when football resumes. Although none of us know yet what will transpire with this season, it is clear that football will be back.We’ve been inundated with requests on how people can help the club.  It’s truly been heart-warming. The one way to helpyou can – and onlyyou can # is to purchase season tickets and merchandise online.  We still have limited availability of this year’s Third Strip, which may become a collector’s item as it may never be worn.This supports the club as well as SSAFA and The Black Watch Association charities.  We will soon be launching our - kit in the upcoming days and we know it’s not enough to completely fill your appetite for football, but keep an eye on the social media sites for Dundee FC and DFC in the Community, which will provide some entertainment while we all do our part to save lives by staying home.We wish we had something more definitive to say, but we hope this brief update will provide some reassurance that we are still here and will remain here when this crisis is over.

right to ensure they stay afloat during this time when there’s no income.Like a lot of people in the city right now, that will bring a whole lot of worry to workers for what the future holds post-coronavirus.Not knowing where the next wage is coming from is a dreadful situation to be in.There are players at both clubs whose contracts end in a couple of months and they have my every sympathy.I’ve been through similar in my playing career and that uncertainty is probably the worst feeling you can have as a professional.Going through administration at Dundee was a dferent sort of situation but I ended up coming out of it with that question of how I was going to pay my bills.Back then I was prepared to take a wage cut to help the club but it was decided that wouldn’t be enough and I left Dens Park.EXCLUSIVE: Lee Wilkie on starring alongside Claudio Caniggia at Dundee, Argentina star#s unusual pre-match ritual and representing Scotland\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp lee-wilkie-claudio-caniggia-dundee-fc-scotland embed # secretVsZdl\" data-secret\"VsZdl\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"On top of everything, I had just finished rehab on my knee and wasn’t even sure I’d be able to play on anyway.Thankfully, Dundee United gave me a chance, though the uncertainty continued even so.I wasn’t sure my knee would hold up and they gave me a contract from September to June on £ per week – a far cry from the million-pound lestyle people associate with some footballers.There was an appearance fee on top but spending time on loan at Ross County meant I couldn’t get that and it was a really tough time in my career.Right now, there are worse things going on in the world with people’s health but adding the stress and worry of work problems just piles on top for a lot of people.I think the move to furlough staff for the time being is a sensible one for both city clubs.What the players are desperate for now is some sort of certainty from the powers-that-be.The UK Government has gone to town on footballers this week completely unfairly.They are an easy target right now.I understand why people think players should front up and take pay cuts to either help non-playing staff at clubs or the NHS or whatever.However, they all seem to be lumped in the same bracket when only a small percentage of professional footballers earn millions of pounds.Boys playing for clubs like Dundee or United or St Mirren, Hamilton etc are not earning fortunes and they have bills to pay like everybody .I think everyone should be doing their bit to help during the coronavirus pandemic, whether that’s through paying taxes or some sort of voluntary work, but it seems like footballers have been called out because they are an easy target.There are plenty of people across the country earning big bucks but not getting hammered.A better way to go about it would have been to say to players exactly what their club needs to save and to give an option to donate part of their salary to the NHS.It seems a weekly occurrence at the moment that we see an SPFL meeting as the time decisions will finally be made.I’m not holding my breath too much for this one tomorrow but you never know.I saw Celtic put out they want to finish the season but they are in a position where they can take the high ground.Everyone has their own agenda but what we really need, what clubs and players need, is some idea of how Scottish football will continue.Cheering on the Virtual Grand National over the weekend was about as close to sporting excitement as you can get at the moment.I didn’t have much luck in my sweepy – my virtual horse fell over a virtual hurdle#"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/04/92354387_1011646992562892_7719572959957876736_n-e1586539337459.jpg ","title":"local artist crates fairy doors trail for local children","story":"A Tayside artist is hoping to sprinkle some fairy dust on the lives of local children stuck indoors because of the lockdown.Gill Hastie, , from Invergowrie, has created a fairy door trail around the local area to give children a fun activity to do on their daily exercise, while keeping a safe distance from others.She was helped by her children, including nine-year-old daughter Breagha, who came up with some of the door design ideas, and there are now around  for kids to find.She said: #We have placed these around Invergowrie and it#s giving local children and their families something to get out in the fresh air and look for. vw, px\"  #I also hope that it#s leading to creativity among others and as well as giving them a walk in the fresh air leads them also to think of ways they can spend their time during lockdown.#I#m also thinking about putting some blank doors around so that anyone finding them can design their own fairy door.# vw, px\"  Gill also painted  shells in rainbow colours, and has now scattered them around the area, for people to collect or leave as they see fit.She said: #I got the idea from a friend and painted around  rainbow shells.#I realise that people are struggling in these dficult times and the idea was to leave the shells around so that they could give a wee bit of hope to anyone who found them.#Gill said that so far her shells and doors had been very well received locally and she was  planning to create and distribute more fairy doors and increase the trail.She said thatit got to the stage where the trail could make any money, it would be donated to a local charity.#This has been something lighthearted and inexpensive to do at this time and I hope it#s spreading a little

They’re doing a lot of things that are out of their normal remit at the moment.“We’re working on our rapid response, we’re dealing with every case on an inidual basis.“At the moment we have  care packages going out a day.“It’s not just food, it’s baby supplies, hot food, toiletries, clothing, toys and books, we’ve got so much going out.“We’re catering for quite a large iety of people who might be homeless, or find themselves in financial dficulty those who are self-isolating and can’t get out, people fleeing from domestic abuse and the elderly and vulnerable.”Priority is being given to current service users, the homeless or people at risk of homelessness, people with multiple complex needs who are at higher risk the elderly and people with a disability or a chronic medical condition and single parents with babies.Needs are assessed on an inidual basis following an application.Ms Sheridan said they’ve had great feedback from thankful recipients of the deliveries.She added: “We had one gentleman who told us that it was the first hot meal he was having in two weeks. We’ve had nice cards as well.”Anyone who can donate goods or cash is urged to help.All money and goods received will go towards making sure those living in the north-east who need help during this dficult time are well supported and have access to basic necessities and services. vw, px\"  Applications can be made through www.ACU.org or    "},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column january 31 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsEver since it was #temporarily# closed to new admissions around two years ago, there has been the suspicion that plans were afoot to close Knapdale Ward completely.The HSCP claims to have consulted widely on the future of the ward, yet patients# relatives, front-line nurses and medical professionals say they were never asked for their views.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing.

Almost nobody has been untouched by it, although for some it has been more cataclysmic than others. But we are in this together, and it will be together that we pull through it.One of the real heartbreaking consequences of the lockdown has been the separation of families. Many grandparents now cannot see their grandchildren, or even their own children. Family of people who are ill cannot visit their loved ones. Each story has its own set of circumstances and sadly more is to come before it gets better.While we do need light-heartedness at this time, itrsquos also really important to acknowledge peoplersquos struggles. It was with gut-wrenching despair I realised a number of weeks ago that the arrival of Covid- in Europe was going to seriously affect so many families, my own included.I have five children, but my middle child, who is now  years old, has for the last eight years shared time between Scotland and Sweden.She went to school here until she was seven, when she began to attend school in Sweden. It was then that I had to adjust to the painful reality of less time with her, although I was still able to maintain regular time with her in Scotland and of course keep in daily touch.Itrsquos been an emotional rollercoaster, in which I have stories of me sleeping at airports, travelling through Scandinavian landscape at ungodly hours, and along the way meeting people who have helped and made a real dference. But itrsquos been worth it as it meant our blended family remained connected and my daughter hasnrsquot felt ided between two families but rather a full part of both.We were due to travel to Sweden this Friday andlater, but of course the flights were cancelled a couple of weeks ago. Explaining this to my daughter, and then not being able to say when we would be together was heartbreaking. I felt so helpless, unable to comfort her. Wersquod all counted down the days and now it seems it may be weeks, even months, before any reunion will be possible.I know that there will be families in similar or worse situations. My heart goes out to them all. My initial response to my situation was to close down with despair. The idea of not being with my child, for whom I was the equal main carer until recently, feels unbearable. Some friends have said, with good intentions: ldquoAt least shersquos safe.Yes she is, and I give thanks for that. But any loving parent facing long-term enforced separation from their child will understand the grief that such separation creates. It seeps into your being and makes it dficult to get through the day without having really dark moments. I tried to hide my emotions, but my loving and understanding we knows me too well yet she too felt helpless.There are moments in our lives when we are just overwhelmed by the impossibility of a situation and we just want to curl up and close down. I recently reached that point.Then my daughter asked me while we were talking online: ldquoI wish we could get a magic flying carpet or something dad, or ask the faeries to make a portal. She understood this wasnrsquot possible, but it was the wake-up call I needed. It made me realise I needed to get out of the pit of despair and, for her sake as well as mine, use my creativity to make that magic carpet, and that portal, to help us stay closely connected during this awful time.And the magic ingredient is stories. My daughter has always loved stories, and we have made many up together some of them have even been printed on this page. Now these stories help keep us connected and ease the pain of separation for us both.And so, with the help of technology, and, crucially, a good relationship with her mother, stories have begun to create a vital space for my daughter to be with her Scottish family, even when separated. We can all be together, even my grown-up daughters, who I miss even though they are isolating close by.We storytell to each other, make stories up and even share them in short films. Wee sister Skye, who is six and misses her sister like crazy, holds the tablet which she uses to speak to her, so they can be together while I tell stories and share riddles. We draw and add to the stories together, make fun dramas in which we film ourselves on phones acting out stories like Cinderella, and I have learnt to put wee films together which we can then watch together.Sharing stories like this has given extra meaning to our online communication. It takes us away from just asking ldquohow was your day  or ldquowhat did you do today  questions that often just seem to emphasise our current disconnection. Later, after this crisis is over, the wee films, the artwork and written stories will be memorabilia of this time our evidence that we remained close, even when forced apart.I write about this because I know there are parents and children out there in similarly dficult situations to say you are not alone in this and letrsquos be kind to each other and share the ways we keep ourselves connected. I also know others will have discovered better solutions, as Irsquom no technical wizard.Children are resilient, often more than their grown-ups are, but we need to help them manage this time emotionally, and when we canrsquot give them a hug or be physically with them in hard times, an inheritance of stories they can access can be a real support.I have often been less than enthusiastic about social media in the past, but right now people are discovering in this crisis it has become a leline in many ways.If you, or someone you know, are in a similar situation, please do get in touch. Letrsquos share our experiences, and understand that while we may be isolating, we are not alone."},{"url":null,"title":"european-stone-stacking-championships-dunbar-postponed","story":"The European Stone Stacking Championships were due to take place between April  and , with a place at the World Rock Stacking Championships in Texas next year up for grabs.However, James Craig Page, creator and director of the festival, broke the news that the event, like dozens of others across the county, had to be postponed amid concerns surrounding coronavirus.Mr Page said: ldquoIt has been postponed but we are very hopeful that we will find another venue or be able to go ahead at a dferent time.ldquoHowever, for the time being we have to postpone.This year would have marked the fth year a stone stacking event had taken place in Dunbar event.Each year, it attracts thousands of people to the area, as well as competitors from throughout Europe.Mr Page spoke to the Courier upon ing from the World Rock Stacking Championships in the USA last month.Initially, he was keen to see the European event, which takes place at Eye Cave Beach, off Bayswell Road, take place.However, upon ing to British shores, he became aware of the state of the global issue.Speaking to the Courier, he said: ldquoWe were just waiting for word and advice but it became apparent when I got back how bad things were and that we needed to put it on hold.ldquoWe donrsquot want to be taking any risks with anybodyrsquos health and wellbeing.

There are obviously many reasons why you may be thinking about acquiring a new dog.Our receptionist Lesley Baillie ndash who works in both Dunedin Vets branches in North Berwick and Prestonpans ndash recently had to bid farewell to her elderly dog Millie, her companion and friend for many years.Lesley was devastated but knew she needed a companion to fill the void. She began to consider which breed or type of dog would be best for her.The arrival of a new pet is a very exciting time, but careful consideration should be made regarding the type and breed of dog you choose.Many problems we encounter in the practice are a result of purchasing a pet not suited to lestyle and family environment.There are, however, many benefits of owning a pet. Companionship is the most obvious.Having a pet to talk to and interact with can take away many of the stresses of daily le.Taking a dog for a walk provides exercise and helps in creating a healthy lestyle. Having a pet is known to assist in the recovery from illness. In fact, PATdogs are encouraged in some hospital wards to help patients on the road to recovery.Dogs come in a huge iety of breeds, shapes and sizes, so choosing a dog to fit your lestyle can be extremely dficult. It is best to do lots of research before contemplating buying a dog.Many dogs have natural instincts such as herding and guarding, and these should be considered prior to choosing a dog.Also consider how the pup was raised. Were they house or kennel reared There are seven main classes of dogs, each with their own characteristics:l Toy dogs: as the name suggests, they are small dogs but are generally high maintenance and require a lot of grooming. They are, however, dogs and not toys or accessories. Examples: Bichon Frise and Chihuahua.l Utility breeds: there are a iety of breeds in this class but most tend to be courageous extroverts so need good control. Examples: bulldog and Dalmatian.l Terriers: they hunt by instinct and are brave and tough. They may be generally small but require lots of exercise and play. Examples: Border terrier and Airedale.l Hounds: these hunt and can be quite aloof they are quite independent and often like to be with one owner. Examples: bloodhound and basset hound.l Working dogs: as the name suggests, they have specic jobs. They are intelligent and may be quite large and guard dogs. Examples: St Bernard and Samoyed.l Pastoral dogs: these are bred to work with livestock and are very intelligent. They require mental and physical stimulation and tend to be tough and need a role. Examples: Border collie and Belgian shepherd dog.l Gundogs: they find and retrieve game. They have amenable temperaments and are active and affectionate. Examples: springer spaniel and retriever.We cannot, however, forget the crossbreed dogs, which are by far the most popular dogs around. Their nature will depend on their breeding and obviously they come in a huge range of sizes.Nowadays, there a large number of crossbreeds which are designated lsquodesigner breedsrsquo. Breeders will tell all the advantages of these lsquobreedsrsquo, but be aware not only are there advantages attributed to the parents, genetic traits from both breeds may also be present and in veterinary practice, we do see a disproportionately high number of problems with these dogs.There are many questions you should ask yourself before considering buying a dog.l Are there young children in the family  A utility dog, such as a miniature Schnauzer, or gundog e.g. Labrador may be breeds to consider.l Is everyone in the family out of the house during the day  Are you really able to look after a dog  An independent cat may be the best option.l Do you live in a flat  Consider a toy dog, e.g. Chihuahua.l Are you fit and able to go for long walks  Then the working or pastoral dogs should be considered e.g. Border collie or Doberman.l Do you have any fur allergies  Consider some the soft-coated dogs such as poodles.l Do you have a large garden  The terriers enjoy running around in enclosed spaces, e.g. Border or Patterdale terriers.Lesley considered very carefully what breed she should choose.She knew she wanted a fairly active dog who would enjoy long walks and travelling in her campervan with her.She also knew she did not want an overly large breed. She works part-time so wanted a breed which could be trusted to be left for short periods but was also friendly and enjoyed loving, human contact.After much deliberation, Lesley settled on a Tibetan terrier.These are a medium-sized breed originating in Tibet.Despite the name, they are not terriers but actually working dogs.They are therefore very loyal and affectionate but also energetic and sensitive.Tibetan terriers have a mid- coat which is very soft and hypoallergenic so excellent for anyone with animal hair allergies, but does require a good deal of grooming.After searching far and wide, Lesley found a breeder who had just had a litter of puppies.So, after a few weeks and a long journey, wee Hetty arrived home with Lesley.She really is a cutie and was so well behaved when Lesley brought her to the surgery.She is settling in well at home and hopefully she and Lesley will have many happy years and enjoyable adventures together.The rewards of owning a pet are immense.With careful consideration prior to purchasing a pet, you can have a cherished companion for many years to come.Caring for them can sometimes be a challenge but should give great pleasure to owner and pet alike."},{"url":null,"title":"public-can-report-businesses-not-sticking-covid-19-guidelines","story":"East Lothian Council says environmental health officers across Scotland now have new responsibilities to ensure appropriate public health measures are being followed during the Coronavirus pandemic.And it said any shops which could not comply with the social distancing measures required will be forced to shut down.The new Health ProtectionRegulations  have given additional control to councils and police to close premises.Councillor Norman Hampshire, environmental spokesperson for East Lothian Council, said enforcement remained a last resort for environmental health officers.And he urged people to report any business where guidelines are not being observed.He said: \"East Lothian Council in all cases will seek to encourage businesses to comply with the measures through stressing the risks to the public and the NHS.ldquoFormal enforcement will always be the last resort where businesses fail to comply or where social distancing requirements are compromised, putting public health at risk.

At a crucial time in the survival of the language, graduates have helped create a Gaelic speaking workforce that now holds key posts across a wide range of sectors in Scotland.Sabhal Mograver Ostaig is one of the key partners in fulfilling the governmentrsquos objectives in the National Gaelic Plan, which aims to increase the number of people speaking the language and accelerate the growth of Gaelic.Many people are keen to learn more about the language because of its rich culture and the college provides a wide range of short courses in Gaelic language, song and traditional music. Ceilidhs, workshops, conversation circles and music sessions all create an encouraging atmosphere that bring together students from  countries across five continents.As a modern, innovative college, Sabhal Mograver Ostaig has excellent learning resources on campus including an exceptional library collection, residential student accommodation, broadcast and recording facilities and a Gaelic medium childcare facility on site. It also has a growing international reputation for academic research.The college was founded on the principle of being part of the local and wider community and its activities are greatly enhanced by co-operative links, being home to a number of signicant national creative and cultural projects such as Tobar an Dualchais, Ainmean Agraveite na h-Alba and Cagravenan Graphics Studio.

It is one of the many canards which have debased social media in this crisis and turned Twitter into a pariah medium.What he told Philip Schofield on This Morning on March  was that ldquoone of the theories is that people should ldquotake it on the chin and not take measures to prevent the spread of the disease. He went on to say that this was not the Governmentrsquos policy, and that it was pursuing a ldquobalanced approach and taking measures to ldquoprotect the NHS.But that hasnrsquot stopped people saying it for him. It has become a political factoid, an article of faith that Mr Johnson, under the guidance of his dark amanuensis Dominic Cummings, has been pursuing a social Darwinist, survival-of-the-fittest approach to Covid-.Enough. Everyone with any decency should simply be wishing the Prime Minister and his pregnant partner, Carrie Symonds, well right now, following the lead of Nicola Sturgeon yesterday when she echoed the Get Well, Boris slogan.It could be any one of us in the next few weeks. This is a moment to reflect on the fragility of existence and the gt of being alive. For once, we really are all in this together.The only grain of truth in the ldquochin theory is that, as is widely known, Mr Johnson has tended to see illness as something other people get. He has famously robust good health and former advisers, like the journalist Guto Harri, say theyrsquove never seen him ill before.All the more reason to take this disease seriously. It doesnrsquot just kill the very old or those with medical issues. Even a fit, tennis-playing political leader in his prime has had to be placed in intensive care fighting for his le.This is not like a bad dose of flu, as President Trump unhelpfully suggested. Covid- mocks us because many carriers have mild symptoms or none at all. Then, after  days,the symptoms donrsquot go away it turns very nasty.There is so much we do not know about coronavirus. What we do know is that it is gendered ndash though not in the way we expect that word to be used. It seems to hit men very hard, and twice as many die of it. Women seem to have some form of genetic immunity.Either that or men just ldquodonrsquot look after themselves as some believe. That might actually be the case with Mr Johnson, since hersquos been under immense pressure over the past year: replacing Theresa May, renegotiating Brexit, then fighting a General Election.So, no one should be under any illusion that hersquoll be able tonormally any time soon. This raises dficult questions. Who in his Cabinet will have the authority to tell him that he canrsquot be allowed to take key decisions while his faculties are impaired Who exactly is in charge  The First Secretary, Dominic Raab, is formally chairing Cabinet committees. But that begs the question of who takes the final decisions. Where does the buck stop Someone has to balance the competing demands of the two front-line Cabinet ministers, Matt Hancock and Rishi Sunak. They have very dferent constituencies of interests. Mr Hancock is all about saving the NHS and avoiding immediate deaths Mr Sunak is about saving the economy, upon which just as many lives could ultimately depend.Who decides whether and for how long to renew the lockdown on Monday  It will almost certainly be continued, but should there be a provisional timetable for lting aspects of it, following Austria and Denmark Research led by Professor Russell Viner for University College London appears to show that keeping schools closed is of little use in halting the spread of coronavirus. Yet it damages the educational prospects of less-well-off children. Others disagree, including, it seems, Professor Neil Ferguson of the celebrated Imperial College report that prompted the lockdown last month.The minor scandal of the Scottish Chief Medical Officer, Dr Catherine Calderwood, breaking her own stay-at-home guidelines underlines the problem of compliance. For the comfortable middle classes, with gardens and nice homes, lockdown is tolerable but working-class families in small flats may find it unbearable.Then again, should the UK be encouraging the wearing of masks  Countries like Austria and Slovakia have made them compulsory. America is adopting masks on the grounds that it slows the spread of the disease. But the advice here is still that theyrsquore of little use.A broader question now there is a new Labour leader, is a government of national unity. Keir Starmer has clearly ordered his new shadow cabinet members to stop saying ldquowe were right and start talking constructively about how to revive a moribund economy when the lockdown is over.The Opposition has a crucial role to play in getting the Government to focus and be clear about what it is doing. But should there be a more formal arrangement, as in the Second World War when the then Labour leader Clement Attlee, was made Deputy Prime Minister It would mean the Opposition is bound by collective responsibility, and has to endorse the decisions made by Government in the next few weeks. On the other hand it would greatly enhance the political profile of the new Labour leader, and could provide a  on which Sir Keir could build a winning election campaign, in the way Attlee won the post-war General Election in .These are decisions that only a Prime Minister can make, for the simple reason that he will be required to accept the consequences. This is a desperate time for him and the country, as the death toll continues to rise.As I write, it seems that the PMrsquos condition is stable. Twitter aside, there has been a considerable degree of public sympathy for Mr Johnson. No one can be in any doubt that he feels our pain. The Prime Minister is, as it were, the first casualty among equals.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Shops across Scotland are closing.

Often it is signed by those with power of attorney for elderly relatives who are no longer of sound mind. Brutal though it looks when expressed in cold print, the intention behind it is compassionate.At a certain stage of ill-health, the process of resuscitation can be harsh. It unnecessarily prolongs suffering rather than allowing someone who has suffered a cardiac arrest to slip away peacefully. In some circumstances, especially where the patient is extremely frail, resuscitation is the worst of all options. Hard though it is to accept, the prospect of death can come as a relief to some for whom there is no hope of recovery, and who are simply longing to be gone.But for many who received this bald DNAR request, that is not the case. Instead of being asked to speed up and simply medical bureaucracy, they needed reassurance that, should they fall ill with Covid , they will be treated like anyone . The only grey area is over what they wish done in the event they require resuscitation. In their thoughtless and insensitive mail-shot, doctors presumably have pre-selected those for whom they think a DNAR is in their best interests. But what a way to go about it. It brings to mind Treasure Island and the sinister Black Spot pressed into piratesrsquo hands, signying their imminent demise.Even worse is the case of a care home where some residents, who were mentally well, learned staff had signed these forms on their behalf. I would not wish to be the manager should anyonersquos otherwise robust existence end prematurely because of a legally binding instruction they knew nothing about.What all this points to is troubling. There has been much trumpeting about the ways in which communities are pulling together under lockdown, growing stronger and kinder because of the strain on those who are least able to help themselves. Despite this, however, there is an insidious undercurrent to some discussions, a faint suggestion that the aged are in danger of being perceived as a nuisance, a drain on limited resources that are better used for the young. The tenor of recent government guidelines appears to hint that when people reach a certain vintage they should expect less heroic or interventionary treatment, and accept thatthings take a turn for the worst, their time is up.When new guidance was issued to medics by the former Chief Medical Officer Catherine Calderwood last week, Dr Donald Macaskill, chief executive of Care Scotland, was perturbed at its implications: ldquoNothing in this document gives me confidence that we will not be putting our clinicians in a position where they have no option but to decide on the basis of age.Le-saving equipment and highly trained medical staff are undoubtedly in limited supply. When intensive care beds and ventilators have to be rationed, then the decision of who benefits most will have to be made. Who would envy a doctor faced with such a bleak choice But it would be a terrible indictment of our societythe exigencies of this emergency fostered the sense that old is synonymous with surplus. If the word ldquopensioner is in danger of becoming a le-threatening label the long-term legacy of this disease will be far worse than the number of fatalities. It will have buried one of the primary principles on which modern civilisation is based.The idea that iniduals automatically become obsolescent after a certain age is repugnant. So too that their worth diminishes with each year. Who has the authority or right to say that one personrsquos le is more valuable than another  The more I see of friends in their eighties and nineties, the more I understand the old joke: Who would want to live to   Someone who is .One of the reasons this pandemic is so intense is because we have long recognised the importance of seniors. Modern medical advances have been expressly designed to allow much of the population to reach and enjoy advanced age, eventhey do rattle occasionally with their daily regimen of pills.Before going to university I worked for a year as an auxiliary nurse in a small hospital, on the male and female geriatric wards. It was a revelatory experience. Some of the patients had dementia, a few were permanently bed-bound, but there was not one of them who could not find some enjoyment and pleasure each day, or who did not retain much of their personality. It was an inspirational lesson that one of the finest achievements of society is to take such loving care of those whose best years are behind them, and for whom the future is measured in months, weeks, or simply hours.It is not for the state to determine who lives and dies. Every day doctors quietly make these calls, for reasons of humanity, and we must trust their judgement. When they need to discuss matters of le and death with relatively healthy patients, however, they would do well to remember that up to the very end, we all will rage against the dying of the light, and rightly, properly so.Shops across Scotland are closing.

Where do you feel the anxiety  Be conscious of what your body is telling you. Is your heart racing, stomach churning  To help ease these symptoms, be mindful of your breathing. Inhale through your nose for  slowly and exhale through your mouth again counting to  slowly. Repeat this exercise four times.AwarenessWe cannot control how her lersquos have changed due to this pandemic but what we can control is our thoughts to this global crisis. To quote from the Greek philosopher Epictetus ldquoPeople are not disturbed not by things, but by the views they take of them. Through awareness of how our thoughts make us feel, we can challenge these to more positive helpful thoughts. Awareness is the key to unlocking our distorted thoughts and through recognising whether we are for example predicting, judging or catastrophising, this can assist us in challenging and changing these negative obtrusive thoughts to more positive helpful ones.Self-CareTake this time as an opportunity to look after self. Self-care is crucial for building up resilience to le events and there is no time more important than in the now to engage in self-care: it is a priority. Self-care consists of several elements:Physical self-care such as nutrition, exercise and sleep.Mental self-care such as being aware of our thoughts and behaviours and engaging in activities such as crosswords. Emotional Self-care such as being aware of our emotions for example anger and sadness and how these can be managed. For example, through keeping a daily journal to recognise the triggers for our emotions.Spiritual Self-care such as awareness of when our minds are racing with thoughts and to try and be still. Engage in activities such as meditation, mindfulness and through being still in the now this will quieten the racing mind and provide strength at this challenging time. Take time to assess your self-care by implementing a self-care plan and commence small steps to change through looking after self. ldquoAn empty lantern provides no light. Self-care is the fuel that allows your light to shine brightly. If you find yourself struggling with anxiety, low mood or lapsing into unhelpful ways of coping, then contact Sharon.

Situated on the banks of the River Teviot, in an award-winning conversion of the former Victorian electrical works, the distillery is laying down spirit for a future Single Malt release, makes an excellent gin, and recently released a vodka.Kerrrsquos Borders Gin is genuinely Scottish Gin ndash wholly distilled from barley grown within  miles of the distillery. It is named after William Kerr ndash Hawick-born, and among the th centuryrsquos most accomplished botanists. He sent  plant specimens back to Kew Gardens from his Far East travels.Kerr would likely have approved of the distilleryrsquos Carterhead Still ndash one of only a handful in operation. It gently heats the botanicals rather than boiling them like most other gin stills, capturing more of the subtle flavours. Together with the barley, this gives the gin a distinctive depth. The rounded flavour works well with the bitterness of tonic water, creating a beautully balanced GT.The newest addition to distilleryrsquos range is Puffing Billy Steam Vodka ndash unfiltered malted barley vodka, named after the special still which plays a key role in its production. The spirit is steamed through charcoal inside the still itself and never filtered as a liquid, preserving the delicious character of the barley.Itrsquos the only vodka in the world made this way, and drinks commentators have praised the result, suggesting it could reinvigorate vodka, a spirit somewhat overlooked during the recent gin boom. Fabulous with tonic or Ginger Beer, the vodka also tastes incredibly smooth sipped chilled and straight.Kerrrsquos Borders Gin and Puffing Billy Steam Vodka are available direct from the distilleryrsquos online shop, currently offering free delivery anywhere within the UK when you buy a bottle.See www.thebordersdistillery shop ------------------------------------------------The Mortgage Advice Service ScotlandRe-mortgaging During the Coronavirus OutbreakAlthough health concerns are their immediate priority, people are searching for ways to reduce their monthly expenditure and cutting their biggest monthly outlay makes financial sense.Although the Coronavirusis having a signicant impact on obtaining funds for purchasing a new home, re-mortgages are still available from lenders at competitive rates and depending on the size of your mortgage, you could make substantial savings each month by simply changing lenders.Re-mortgaging neednt be a hassleEvenyou can save hundreds of pounds by shopping around, the thought of trying to switch your current mortgage may seem like a hassle you could do without.However, re-mortgaging isnt nearly as much hassle as you may think, because, thats where we step in and do all the work that is involved in finding you a fresh deal that can lower your monthly payments and maybe even help you to pay off your mortgage quicker.Choosing the right mortgage can be tricky.Next to purchasing your home, choosing the right mortgage is probably one of the most important decisions you will make when you are looking for a new deal.Approaching your current lender or bank may not result in you obtaining the best mortgage deal because they generally only consider their own products.

Guy spends ages engaged in pointless task to pass the time. Guy appears to be going slowly insane.Not le in lockdown Britain but business as usual on Limmyrsquos Handmade Show, the comedy so surreal the credits should be painted by Dali.Brian ldquoLimmy Limond does nothing as conventional as telling a joke. Dear God, no.Do not expect a series of set ups and punchlines, Only Fools and Horses-style, from this Glaswegian.No cuddly chummy stuff, and will-they-wonrsquot-they romance as in Peter Kayrsquos Car Share.Limmy is hardcore, brittle, slightly scary, and off the money more times than he is on it, but when his material works it sings like Connollyrsquos and can be as funny as Bridgesrsquo.This new three part series follows a pilot last year not long after the new BBC Scotland channel had launched. As before, it will be premiered on BBC Scotland before going network on BBC.Shot by himself in his flat, Limmy plays all the parts. He also the writer, producer, sound recordist, and editor. He probably did the location catering, too, and had a quick whip round with the vacuum before switching on the camera.When not in his flat he is out and about in Glasgow at ious venues. ldquoThis here is the international financial district of Glesga, he tells the camera. ldquoItrsquos offices hellip When I see offices like these it makes me so grateful that I donrsquot yet have to go back to having a real job.Note that ldquoyet. Limmy was one of the first to make \"do it yourself\" videos on his phone and upload them to social media. Now everyone and their granny is at it.Besides his television work he is best known for popping up on Twitter whenever a celebrity passes away to say he once had the pleasure of meeting so and so at a charity do, and that they were ldquo surprisingly down to earth, and VERY funny. Many are the unwitting TV researchers who have fallen for that one.In the first episode, besides wondering what it would be like working in an office, he teaches a masterclass in techno and how to rile the crowd into throwing bottles at you, rfs on contactless payments, and wonders what the numbers on a toaster mean.In a later episode he treats a creepy intruder ashe is a woodland creature that has wandered in by mistakeIt all sounds bizarre because it is. Limmy is so far down the rabbit hole he may never see daylight again.While he has his own particular brand of absurdism, he is part of a long tradition in Scottish comedy of surrealist humour stretching from Chic Murray and Lex McLean to Arnold Brown. Billy Connollyrsquos finest routines are the most fantastic flights of imagination that start at a point familiar to the audience before ending up who knows where.That said, the most successful sketches in the first episode were of the more conventional iety. In one he managed to take something as simple as an arrow chalked on the pavement leading him into an underpass and mine three pretty decent gags from it. It was almost silent comedy, with his face doing a lot of the heavy lting. A Glesga Buster Keaton no less.Some of the material fell flat, the social media chat felt dated, and three half hour episodes might be pushing it. Older now and a father, he is losing a bit of his punk edge .But I did laugh at the sheer daftness of some of it. I donrsquot think Limmy will have to worry about taking an office job to pay the mortgage for a long time yet,ever.BBC Scotland Friday, repeated on BBC Sunday, and on iPlayer"},{"url":null,"title":"hope-castle-owners-press-ahead-restoration-plan","story":"Perched on a rocky outcrop of the Black Isle, Castle Craig is one of Scotlandrsquos most distinctive and signicant landmarks.However, there were fears the ruined tower would crumble completely and be lost.Now fresh hope has been sparked after an architect was appointed to oversee vital preservation works and owner the Clan Urquhart Foundation confirmed it would press ahead with plans aimed at reviving the structure as a fully ing visitor attraction.It comes after Kirkmichael, another historic site on the Black Isle, was restored thanks to a successful community campaign.Those involved in the Castle Craig project hope to start work later this year once coronavirus-related restrictions are lted.Captain Glen A Cook, secretary of the Clan Urquhart Foundation Board, said: ldquoThe vision is tothe castle to a usable state and a community resource to interpret the historic architecture, archaeology and lives of the people who lived on the Black Isle.ldquoThere will be intermediate steps. We need to complete the stabilisation of the structure, then move to archaelogy studies of the site before more extensive repair may be accomplished.ldquoArchaelogy work outside the conservation area has been accomplished over the last two summers by Dr. Connie Rodriguez.Castle Craig, which is a Scheduled Monument and considered to be of national importance, has a history stretching back to the th century.It came into Urquhart possession in , when the Bishop of Ross granted ownership of the lands of Craig, along with its tower-house, to Thomas Urquhart, second son of Alexander Urquhart of Cromarty.The site was probably used as an occasional episcopal residence in the post-Reformation period.However, the castlersquos past also has shadier chapters, with stories of the lower section being turned into an illicit still around  years ago.By the th century, it had become a ruin.Chris Bowes, founder of the Edinburgh-based McGregor Bowes architecture firm, will oversee masonry repairs.He said: ldquoThe owners have established a foundation, The Clan Urquhart Foundation, and there is a determination to preserve this important Scheduled Monument.ldquoThe work I will carry out is basically specication and organisation of the masonry repairs.ldquoThere are a couple of large cracks in the building and it needs repair work so the condition does not get worse.ldquoIrsquom no knight in shining armour but it is work that has to be done and work that has to be done by skilled masons ndash people who are knowledgeable in the right approach.ldquoThe building is currently stable. There has been work done on it previously ndash timber shoring ndash which helps to keep it in place. The repairs to the cracks are just another part of that.He added: ldquoItrsquos a real privilege to be involved because you are a small part of the continuum to something thatrsquos a national landmark and thatrsquos one of the attractions of doing historic building work.

One side is almost perfectly preserved, while the other has been eroded by the sea.ldquoAnd, once upon a time,  years ago, people were using the downstairs as an illicit still.He added: ldquoItrsquos great to see some interest shown in it.

If someone is threatened by cattle, they are encouraged to release your dog and take the shortest route out of the field. As always pick up and remove all waste. A government spokesman said: #This is a temporary situation and it is more important now than ever to maintain good relationships between neighbours and within communities. This is not about restricting the general right of responsible non-motorised access to land but it is part of the wider approach to prevent COVID- deaths and preserving the nation’s food supplies.#Exercising access rights responsibly means respecting the needs of other people, and you will need to adapt your behaviour accordingly in the national effort to contain the spread of COVID-. Land managers should respect access rights, which are particularly important at this dficult time.

The shot was clearly going just wide of the upright before Fraser MacDonald inadvertently erted it into his own net for a bizarre opener.”Under the canny guidance of manager Angie Murchison, Skye’s useful blend of youth and experience continued to revel on the big stage. Youngsters like Somhairle Macdonald, Ewen MacSween, John MacLean and Allan MacLeod had established themselves along with several survivors of the  team – Cowie, Willie MacRae, Peter Gordon, John ‘Bodach’ Mackenzie, Ally MacDonald and Ewen MacKinnon.With  minutes played the islanders doubled their advantage.McCormack takes up the action: “John MacLean delivered a corner into the danger area, and with keeper Kenny MacDonald under pressure Cowie took two attempts before slipping the ball over the line as he tumbled face-forward onto the pitch”.Skye’s fans were in dreamland but, as the reporter had noted: “Kyles are famous for their battling qualities”.By half time the match was level.From a powerful hit in from the right the ball broke to veteran Dan MacRae “who had time and space to place the shot beyond the reach of keeper MacKenzie.”Then, calamity struck Skye in the closing moments of the half.“Another massive hit in by Tom White caused panic in the Skye defence, and as MacKenzie lashed out in an attempted clearance the ball appeared to come back past him off team captain MacSween”.Seconds later it took an outstanding save from MacKenzie to deny Dallas Turner and prevent Kyles from turning around in the lead.Murchison’s men regrouped.“The second half had been underway less than  seconds before Skye retook the initiative thanks to a corner which was turned in by Cowie, with Peter Gordon hovering to pick up on any mistake.”For much of the second half Kyles were kept well away from the Skye danger area, but a fourth goal proved elusive – thanks in large part to legendary goalkeeper Kenny MacDonald.And with Skye just eight minutes away from sealing a place in the final the men in blue hauled themselves back from the brink.Our reporter said that Dallas Turner “had looked the likeliest threat” and it was the youngster who “saw a glimmer of an opening and fired in a shot which took a deflection and flew past Bodach MacKenzie and into the net”.“That was the signal for the islanders to lay siege to the Kyles goal and for the Tighnabruaich keeper to dig dep with a string of exceptional saves.”MacLean, Somhairle MacDonald , Gordon and Cowie were all denied before the whistle sounded to herald extra time.In “energy-sapping heat” it was hardly surprising that the added half hour was more low-key, but five minutes into the second period came a “glorious chance” for Skye.Referee Donne Fraser spotted an infringement in the area, and the islanders were awarded a penalty.Rankin stepped up, but was unable to make clean contact and the “scuffed spot hit was easily turned away by MacDonald”.And so to a penalty shoot-out. Both goalkeepers excelled themselves, MacDonald saving two, and MacKenzie doing likewise. With Kyles - ahead, Rankin had to score to force sudden death, but his shot sailed wide and it was Kyles who went through to the final.Ian McCormack concluded: “Rankin was hero as well as villain. Once he got the measure of Ronnie MacVicar he dictated play from the centre, giving a hundred per cent in effort and running himself into the ground in the process. Up front Willie Cowie was immense – especially for a player just back from injury.“And while the defence as a whole were tight, Willie MacRae at buckshee back gave another award-winning performance.“If there was a man of the match award it would undoubtedly have gone to Kyles keeper Kenny MacDonald, who had excellent cover from full back Fraser MacDonald.“Their most dangerous forward was Dallas Turner, while that veteran Dan MacRae showed he still has a few seasons left in him at the top level.”In the final Kingussie, in the middle of a run of seven-successive Camanachd Cup triumphs, proved too strong, though Kyles gave a good account of themselves and had taken the lead before succumbing to a - defeat.The redoubtable Kenny MacDonald was the final’s man of the match, but his remarkable career had still some way to run. Both he and namesake Fraser # the full back in the epic tussle of  – would again pick up winners’ medals in , by which time Kenny’s son Roddy had also emerged as a star of the sport.For Skye the wait for another shot at the big one goes on – with the club also missing out in semi finals in  and .Allan MacLeod, the current Skye co-manager, reflected on that game at Ballachulish – recalling that he played much of the first half without a contact lens.“I remember marking Dan MacRae – a fantastic player. But it was great chance for us.“We were the better side for much of it, but not for the first time Kenny MacDonald was the saviour for Kyles.“At the time Kingussie were virtually unstoppable and we’d have met them in their prime. Our chance of winning the cup may have been slim, but it would have been nice to have made the final.“A lot of that Skye team would have deserved a shot on that stage.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Covid-19.jpg","title":"details of covid 19 case on skye leaked to the free","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineAs of Friday th April, there were a total of  confirmed cases in the NHS Highland area, but the health board have not released any further details on where the cases originate.Amid fears that some people might still consider rural areas to be isolated and virus free, there have been calls for greater clarity on where cases are.

It was a Saturday afternoon and the game was a supposed friendly against Rothienorman.“Back then I was a hard man, or so I thought! I was up against a burly young farmer-type at centre-half. I had a couple of robust challenges with the lad and he warned me that next time he was having me! Two minutes later he came in from behind and elbowed me in the head, I shrugged it off and instead of walking away I turned around and said: #You ain’t big enough to put me down, kid.# The next thing I knew, the birds were tweeting around my head and my front teeth were missing!“The game was abandoned and I had to go to the emergency dentist that afternoon and had months of repair work afterward. He had to pay my dental bill and a £ fine. Torquil Mackenzie # a name I will take to my grave!” “I can#t remember how far back it was but it was a while ago — it was a cup final up in Uig against Portree. The game went to extra-time # we had Bruce Neil and Paul Flynn sent off but ended up winning something like -.“I remember John ‘Spod# Macleod scoring a goal and running up the touchline with his hands cupped over his ears to the once noisy Portree support who had given him dogs# abuse during the game. That lives long in the memory!” “It won#t come as a surprise to learn the best match was the title-winning game on th August , for many emotional reasons. We had a great campaign that year and had won  out of  games with only three matches remaining. We had to go to Kyleakin away on this date and they were the only team who could catch us in the title challenge.“It was a really nice summer evening and we had a strong team out, although leading striker John Murphy was unavailable through injury which meant young James Pringle played upfront with Craig Brown.“Kyleakin got out of the blocks quickly and we found ourselves - down early on in the match in front of a big crowd. We settled after that and played some decent stuff but Kyleakin, as usual, were well marshalled by Michael Taylor and we had dficulty in creating clear-cut opportunities. However, with  minutes to go, coach Ian MacLeod and I decided to put youngsters Ian Morrison and Angie MacPherson on each touchline to give us pace and width. The freshness seemed to galvanise us and with  minutes to go, we pulled a goal back through Craig Brown. It seemed the whole match swung on that goal, we picked up some real momentum and Brown scored again to equalise. Then with five minutes to go, we were awarded a penalty with two Kyleakin defenders tackling Brown as he broke into the box. Craig dusted himself down and scored the penalty in off the post # we were delirious on the sidelines. We saw out the game for our first-ever title and then won the remaining two games to make it  wins from  matches # it was a campaign never to be forgotten!” “It was my first game in charge, and funnily enough, it was also against Kyleakin. In those campaigns it was always the case that the first game of the season in the Bagshaw League pitted the reigning champions against the team which finished bottom the season before.

Some of the top Cabinet team were exposed to the virus — and did not seem to have followed the public health advice.Stormont seemed preoccupied and torn between London which was now playing catch-up to WHO in Geneva and Dublin, which had been following the Galway doctor from day one.We had somethings going for us a good,under-resourced health system, a public health agency and a local firm Randox Health who made the initial test needed and imported the serology test which toldyou were now immune.Frittered AwayThese advantages were frittered away and attenuated.Emergency pandemic laws were enacted to empower the state rather than to penalise those who flouted the public health advice. The new law has empowered the stateto cut corners thereby disempowering the GP and the coronerfrom scrutinising the circumstances of thedeath to make accurate certication which is so important in measuring the pandemic. The laws also infringe the rights of patients and bereaved relatives. vw, px\"  ECMO OXYGENATOR: Only one in Ireland and that is in Dublin.Progress on PPE was slow as was the identication and upskilling of necessary staff and the procurement of extra ventilators and oxygenatorsnecessary for the many who would go into lung failure as a result of infection with the virus.We are - days away from the surge of cases and, unfortunately, deaths, and we must pray that enough will have been done to save lives and limit the damage.This virus has taught us some cruel lessons some of which should have already been learned. We will survive this to have a vaccine to protect us in the autumn.Maybe only a public inquiry can tell us who knew, what, when, how and the why of this epidemic.R.H.I. was about chickens, this is about us. vw, px\"  Dr Michael DonnellyMB, BCh, BAO is a clinical epidemiologist"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"opinion gerry adams we reflect back at eastertide only because we are focused on future","story":"THERE probably has not been an Easter week quite like this one in modern Irish history. I have always liked Easter and although I have less connection now with the institution of the Catholic Church, Good Friday always is a special day for me. It is the one afternoon that I try to slip into a church to reflect on the le of Jesus and his execution by crucixion all those years ago. This Good Friday the churches are closed. In fairness a church is not necessary for reflection. Any quiet place will do. But it will be strange nonetheless. vw, px\"  GERRY ADAMS:  commemorations will be more personalFor those of us who commemorate the  Easter Rising this will be a strange year also. There were Easters when repression and imprisonment, north and south, resulted in only a handful of activists coming together at gravesides and republican memorials to lay a wreath, read the Proclamation and list the names of our patriot dead. These were the Easters when successive Irish and Unionist governments banned such remembrances and used brutal tactics to enforce that ban. During the more recent years of conflict some Easter commemorations and republican memorials and graves were also bombed and damaged.This Easter we face a dferent kind of adversary. A silent, deadly enemy – the Coronavirus. So the traditional Easter commemorations have been cancelled.But that doesn’t mean that republicans will not commemorate our patriot dead. On the contrary this year commemorations will be more personal, more intimate, as we as iniduals and as families participate in our own little commemorative events or join in the online programme devised by Sinn Féin and others during this unprecedented health emergency. This includes a programme of social media events and posts, videos # some historical, speeches, including the keynote Easter address by Party President Mary Lou McDonald TD, music, encouraging children to produce art work reflecting on Easter, poetry, the flying of our national flag and the wearing of the Easter Lily.Many of us have favourite rebel songs and poems of struggle about the many dferent periods of rebellion in Ireland from , through Robert Emmet, the Young Irelanders, the Fenians, to Easter  and the Tan and Civil Wars, to the more recent decades of conflict. So as more and more people put video messages on social media why not consider posting your favourite rebel song  Or sing it yourself  But onlyyou’ve the voice for it. That leaves you out RG. Brón orm, chara.Or pick a poem by Pearse or Connolly or Bobby Sands or the last words of republican heroes. If you are a relative or friend or admirer of one of our patriot dead consider putting up a photo and telling their story.Court MartialThe book ‘Last Words’ by Piaras F. MacLochlainn is a personal favourite. It contains the letters and statements of the leaders who were executed after the  Rising. The poems of Pearse and the defiant statement by James Connolly to his court martial are often quoted but I have always had a special grá for Tom Clarke. He spent  years in English prisons in the s and s and endured long years of solitary confinement during which he was treated appallingly. In  he was the first signatory of the seven who signed the Proclamation. In the early hours of May  his we Kathleen, who was a prisoner in Dublin Castle, was brought to visit him in his cell under military escort. With a candle held by a British soldier for light and just hours before his execution Thomas Clarke gave Kathleen a message for the Irish people. It was brief but poignant.“I and my fellow-signatories believe we have struck the first successful blow for freedom. The next blow, which we have no doubt Ireland will strike, will win through. In this belief we die happy.” vw, px\"  National Graves Easter Parade JCThe story of the love of Joseph Plunkett and Grace Gford is well known. ‘Last Words’ contains a letter from Plunkett to Grace on  May in which he writes: “Listen –I live it might be possible to get the Church to marry us by proxy – there is such a thing but it is very dficult I am told. Father Sherwin might be able to do it. You know how I love you. That is all I have time to say. I know you love me and so I am very happy.”At pm on the evening of May  Grace was brought to the prison chapel. Joseph entered accompanied by a party of soldiers with fixed bayonets. The soldiers remained while Fr Eugene McCarthy read the marriage service by the light of a candle. After the ceremony they had to separate. A few hours later in the early hours of May  Grace was brought back to the prison and met her husband in his cell. They had ten minutes. Plunkett was executed on the morning of May  along with Edward Daly, Willie Pearse, and Michael O’Hanrahan.Oh Grace just hold me in your arms and let this moment lingerThey#ll take me out at dawn and I will dieWith all my love I place this wedding ring upon your fingerThere won#t be time to share our love for we must say goodbye.A century ago this November Kevin Barry was executed in Mountjoy Prison in Dublin. The song, which commemorates this young  year old, is a firm favourite with many. It has never lost its ability to stir the heart and remind us of the courage of this young man and his comrades. It has been recorded and sung countless times over the years, including by Paul Robeson and Leonard Cohen. Robeson’s version can be found online.A Nation Once AgainIn an earlier generation the essays and poems of Thomas Davis reminded people of the  Rising and of the awful impact of British colonialism on Ireland. RG has an edition of a book – Essays and Poems: Thomas Davis – published by the Gresham Publishing Company some time around the s. Davis died at the age of  from scarlet fever in  the first year of An Gorta Mór. One of his enduring works is ‘A Nation Once Again’.And then I prayed I yet might seeOur fetters rent in twain,And Ireland, long a province beA Nation Once Again.Davis also wrote ‘The West’s Asleep’ which in more recent years has been made famous by the Dublinersand the Clancy Brothers and others as ‘The West’s Awake’.So, this week and next use social media to post a personal reflection of the events in Dublin and where in  and of all those periods of struggle in Ireland’s long history of resistance and our demand for freedom. It can be something from YouTube or it can be you and those in your home or you and your friends singing, reciting, reading about Ireland’s patriot dead.These are some of my personal words and poems and lyrics.

Cough, fever, shortness of breath, lack of smell taste and even gastrointestinal symptoms are other relevant presentations.For women who have had symptoms, antenatal appointments can be deferred until  days after the start of symptoms, unless symptomspersevere.For women who are self-isolating because someone in their household has possible symptoms of Covid-, appointments should be deferred for  days.If women develop more severe symptoms or her recovery is delayed, this may be a sign that they are developing a more signicant chest infection that requires enhanced care. In this situation you should contact your maternity care team.Are all antenatal appointments going ahead as normal in Northern Ireland If you are well at the moment and have had no complications in your previous pregnancies arrangements for your care may be altered but they are still important to attend.If you have a routine scan or visit due in the coming days, you will still need to attend but the appointment may change due to staffing requirements. Maternity care is essential to reduce complications in mothers and babies. Even in the context of coronavirus, it is important that pregnant women continue to attend their scheduled routine care when they are well.Pregnant women will be asked to keep the number of people with you to a minimum. This will include being asked to attend maternity appointments alone.There may also be a need to reduce the number of routine antenatal visits.If women have an urgent problem related to the pregnancy but not related to coronavirus, they should get in touch using the same emergency contact details they already have. They should not contact that number unless they have an urgent problem.If women have symptoms of coronavirus, they should contact their maternity service and they will arrange the right place and time for the visits. They should not attend a routine clinic.What risks are there of an expectant mother contracting Covid- on a trip to hospital for an antenatal appointment Maternity care is essential and has been developed over many years with improving success to reduce complications in mothers and babies. The risks of not attending care include harm to mother, her baby or both.Many provisions have been put in place to reduce risk to mothers. These include reducing the number of visits to the hospital to a minimum, advice to mothers on reducing the number of people travelling with mothers to the hospital, attending the appointments alone, keeping numbers reduced in waiting rooms, spacing patients in waiting areas, staff taking additional protective efforts to reduce transmission in clinics with hand washing, cleaning equipment etc.How prepared are hospitals to deal with pregnant women with the virus Very signicant changes have been occurring in hospitals over the past weeks to deal with pregnant women with Covid-. Signicant changes have been made in all areas of the hospital, from clinics to wards and including delivery suites. Practice drills are being run frequently to train staff, additional resources have been brought in to help and a huge effort has been made by all levels of non-clinical, clinical, administrative and management staff.If the mother of a baby has symptoms or tests positive for Covid-, should she isolate herself from the baby Given the current limited evidence, we advise that women and healthy infants, not otherwise requiring neonatal care, are kept together in the immediate post-partum period.A risks benefits discussion with neonatologists and families to inidualise care in babies who may be more susceptible is recommended.Can a new mother with the virus breastfeed The main risk of breastfeeding for infants is the close contact with the mother, who is likely to share infective droplets. In the light of the current evidence, it is advised that the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh any potential risks of transmission of the virus through breastmilk. Precautions should be taken to reduce spread to the baby such as, hand washing before touching the baby, avoiding coughing or sneezing on the baby while feeding, and considering wearing a face mask,available, while feeding or caring for the baby.Can a pregnant person be accompanied by a partner or have visitors A person in labour can be accompanied by one birthing partner, according to the new guidelines. No visitors are permitted in ante-natal or post-natal ward areas.Will babies continue to be delivered in all Northern Ireland hospitals No, not at Causeway Hospital in Coleraine. Antenatal services will continue but it is not possible to deliver babies in the hospital during this surge period.This is due to a lack skilled paediatricians available to provide emergency care to a baby born in distress throughout the  hour period. To protect the wellbeing of mothers and babies, women booked to deliver in Causeway will be contacted and have their delivery transferred to Antrim or Altnagelvin Hospital.Should parents introduce their newborn to friends and family Current government guidance is that you should not meet with people outside your household, so no family celebrations are permitted at present.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Misleading figures, due to omission, is unhelpful and causes unnecessary confusion.The Belfasthas reported in recent days that the number of cases ­- and deaths - from Covid- are likely to be signicantly higher than reported.The PHA publishes the numbers of people who have tested positive for the virus from each council area.Figures for the two main council areas served by the Western Trust - Derry and Strabane and Fermanagh and Omagh - had remained mostly static this week.In Derry and Strabane, with a population of well over ,, the number of positive tests on Monday, April  as reported by the PHA was  and on Thursday, the figure was .On Friday this spiked to  after all the tests results supplied by the Western Trust were used by the PHA.Similarly, the number of positive tests in the Fermanagh and Omagh Council area, where the total population is almost ,, showed just one additional case from Monday, when the figure was  until Thursday.Once the PHA included all data from the Western Trust, the figure rose to  on Friday.As there is no community testing anywhere in Northern Ireland, the figure for the actual number of people who have contracted coronavirus is still a mystery.The Chief Medical Officer, Dr Michael McBride, has previously said he believes there are many thousands of cases in Northern Ireland.Dr Connor Bamford, a virologist at Queen#s University, last week estimated the true number of cases could be over ,.Mr Durkan, an MLA for Foyle, said getting accurate and information to the public from the PHA was crucialcomplacency was to be avoided.He said: As elected representatives, we are constantly asking people to follow the Public Health advice and rightly so.However, it is absolutely crucial that this information is accurate and fully up to date.We need to ensure the information we put in the public domain is completely accurate. The omission of data from a large Trust could also skew the figures across the North.DUP MLA Gary Middleton said relating accurate information to the public is one of the most effective ways of making sure people stay at home.He said: Failing to provide the public with an accurate picture on the number of people in any part of Northern Ireland with coronavirus could prove disastrous and could lead to the spread of the virus.It is when people see the true extent of the spread of the virus that they will take seriously the very necessary control measures that have been put in place.A spokeswoman for the Western Trust said: Between Friday April  and Wednesday April ,  Covid- test results were reported by the Western Trust.A spokeswoman for the PHA said: The PHA has worked closely with the Western Health and Social Care Trust around some of the reporting issues they experienced with regards the number of coronavirustests being reported to the PHA surveillance team.The reporting issues related to the data s that were being used by the respective parties to report into the PHA Surveillance .This has now been resolved and the PHA is assimilating the backlog of data to provide a fuller report.From Friday April , the test data for the Western Trust area will now represent a more complete record.Earlier this week, the chair of the British Medical Authority in Northern Ireland, Dr Tom Black, said the number of deaths in Northern Ireland could be  or % above the official figures being released.Belfast Related ContentCoronavirusCall for urgent coronavirus testing in NI care homes amid fears of #hidden# casesA Covid- testing programme should be urgently put in place in care homes across Northern Ireland in a bid to save lives, a leading dementia charity said.CoronavirusConcern as it emerges NI virus deaths will not be investigated by coronerCoronavirus deaths in Northern Ireland are not being reported to the coroner, it has emerged.,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

She slammed anyone ignoring government restrictions as crazy and irresponsible. She said: I usually post messages on my #liver-versary# as I call it to thank my donor#s family for my le and for more people to become organ donors. But this year I#ve begged people to follow the government guidelines which could save my le.In  doctors feared Aislinn, who had a rare liver condition together with gall bladder and pancreas problems from her teens, could die on her honeymoon in Florida after she fell gravely ill.She had to cut short her dream American trip toto England with new husband Jonathan as medics raced against time to find her a new liver.Eventually a donor was found and Aislinn underwent her transplant in the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead. Six years later her joy was complete after she gave birth to a son, Jericho. Aislinn, who is on furlough from her National Trust job as assistant retail manager at the Giant#s Causeway visitor centre, said she has to go to extraordinary s to protect herself and her family from Covid-.She added: I#ve had to shield myself in the house even before the lockdown started. I#m at high risk because I#ve had a solid organ transplant and I#m immunosuppressed, which basically means that my immune system is a lot less than a normal person#s would be. In order that my body didn#t reject the new organ, the immune response within my body was more or less knocked down.The good part of that is that I can keep an organ which isn#t mine. The bad part of it is that I#m open to a lot more viruses because my body doesn#t have the same fighting capability. An ordinary cold or flu can knock me for six but coronavirus would have a bigger percentage chance of killing me. In her online message Aislinn wrote: As someone who is immunosuppressed and at high risk, I ask anyone who reads this, stay at home please. Reduce the chance of me and others like me having a reduced lespan from Covid-. My family and I will do everything we can to protect me, but please also do your bit.Aislinn has been horried to read news as she self-isolates that some people in Northern Ireland have been ignoring the warnings to stay at home.She added: I find it hard to understand what it is that people don#t fathom about the guidelines. It#s almost asthey think: #I#m alright Jack and sod the rest of you#.Aislinn has pleaded in particular with people who have second homes on the north coast to stay away. There seems to be a feeling that by coming up here people will have less chance of getting the virus, she added.But nowhere is safe and Covid- is already having a huge impact on local services like shops who have run out of delivery slots.

Castledawson man Jason is currently renting a flat on Ireton Street, off Botanic Avenue near Queen’s University in south Belfast with three other students. Jason said his letting agency were unsympathetic to the students’ situation, saying there was nothing they could do. He told Derry Now: “They said it wasn’t their problem – that was what guarantors were for. “The situation is that they won’t give us any sort of leeway in terms of paying it when they know we’re not in the house due to university being cancelled. googletag.cmd.push “They’ve said it’s not their problem because it’s privately rented and I understand that to a point, but common sense has to kick in somewhere.” Jason and his flatmates are renting their accommodation through USPM Ltd, a letting agent based on University Road and say they had to initiate contact about Covid-. “There’s very little contact with the letting agency unless you miss or have to arrange a payment. They hadn’t contacted us about the pandemic, we had to do the ringing,” said Jason. “I rang them, and our contact said they understood the frustration but there was nothing they could do. To them, we were renting a house in Belfast to live in. googletag.cmd.push “Our landlords are usually dead on, butthey had any sort of generosity, they could do something. It’s not always up to the person on the end of the phone.” While Jason is able to fall back on the support of his family, he realises not everyone has that support available. He said: “I have a few friends who wouldn’t come home as much, they don’t have a stable home to come home to and they’re paying rent through jobs in Belfast. “A lot of them were in part-time jobs and have now been laid off. They have no way to continue that, no income. It’s not a good situation for them.” Jason believes the ‘mortgage holidays’ mooted by the government could provide the solution to the problem, but that the options did not appear to be being explored. “Anybody renting privately is just being made to pay. There are no mortgage holidays coming into play,” he said. “We’re probably now having to pay- months where we aren’t there whereas we had been in years gone by. That’s probably half the year of not being in the house and having to pay for it. “If they can take mortgage holidays, there is absolutely no reason for us to be paying rent, except for making a profit.” Derry Now contacted UPSM Ltd for a response, but none was available at the time of going to print.

Derry Trades Union Council chair, Niall McCarroll, said: The global Covid- crisis means we cant celebrate May Day, the international workers day, in the way we normally would. This year we were working with Derry and Strabane Council to host a Workers Rights and Social Justice Week culminating with the May Day march and rally. The Covid- crisis is causing tremendous pain and hardship. We are in the midst of a tragedy that we hope will end as soon as possible with as few deaths as possible. googletag.cmd.push The response to the crisis has also put a spotlight on the inadequacy of government action, the state of our public services and the central role of workers saving lives, protecting communities and allowing society to . Many in the political establishment have joined claps in recent weeks for our heroic nurses and frontline workers but they have spent the last decades justying poverty wages, undermining trade union representation and dismantling our public services, including our health service. The hypocrisy is glaring. Governments have described the battle to contain Covid- as a war but theyve sent frontline workers out without PPE and testing. Far too many employers have risked workplace and public safety by refusing to implement public health guidelines. Workers have been forced to take strike action to make sure health guidelines are followed. googletag.cmd.push Its crucial we put a focus on the heroic efforts of workersresponding to this crisis, on the need for workers rights and on the central importance of our public services. The Derry Trades Union Council is calling on everyone to mark this May Day by joining a Five Minutes of Noise for Workers Rights at pm on Friday May st - and by putting up red flags and signs for workers rights from homes and workplaces for  hours. Well be working with unions, community groups, equality campaigners, artists and others that we were collaborating with for the Workers Rights and Social Justice Week to organise as much as possible through social media. We will be launching our Workers Charter - our vision for dignity, respect and justice at work, in communities and for a more equal society. Were calling on the trade unions and organisations supporting workers rights across Ireland, North and South, to join this effort. People from all backgrounds and communities deserve workers rights,dignity and equality. We want this event to be as inclusive as possible. We need to begin to shape a new way of doing things thats centred around recognising the value of workers and the needs of the working class communities.

The initiative is the brainchild of Kelly’s Eurospar, which has stores in Raacuteth Moacuter and Hatfield, and is supported by the Lynch’s Spar in Skeogh. Henderson’s Eurospar in Rossdowney, Glassagh Taxis and Creggan Enterprises. Adrian Kelly said it he felt it was the ‘very least’ the community could do given the sacrices the nurses were making. “The nurses are serving on the frontline, spending Easter in isolation away from their families,” he said. “A friend of mine askedwe might possibly help make things a little more bearable for them with a hamper of treats to acknowledge our appreciation. And the other Spar stores all thought it was an excellent idea – and signed up immediately. We are delighted to be doing it.” googletag.cmd.push The stores have assembled  hampers – each containing Easter eggs, chocolates treats, snacks and a bottle of Cava - for the nurses who are staying in the Holiday Inn. The first of the deliveries, organised by local volunteers, will be leaving Raacuteth Moacuter at .pm tomorrow . Last month, Eurospar teamed up with Creggan Enterprises and Glassagh Taxis to launch a free delivery service for older and vulnerable customers who are unable to do their own shopping because of the virus. Raacuteth Moacuter’s Conal McFeely said the community response to the Covid crisis in Derry had been very strong. googletag.cmd.push “Our nurses’ courage and dedication at this worrying time has been steadfast and vital,” he said. “It is inspiring to see initiatives like this which recognise and salute the contribution being made by those on the frontline our behalf. “Let us hope that it is not long before our nurses are able tosafely to their loved ones to enjoy some much needed family time for themselves.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Its the time when things start to become very real, yet its a Hadrians Wall we all have to get over. The worry about what happens when the small talk runs out, only to be replaced with an uncomfortable silence. I didnt have that problem. Minutes into my visit, I was on the pigs back. One of the things I remember – apart from the never-ending flow of tea – was Paulines mother Bridie talking about school days in St Patricks Maghera, where she worked for  years. googletag.cmd.push The other was her father Patsy having the same fanaticism with talking football as I did. Hours later, a thousand balls were kicked, championships were won and lost, an th cup of tea was thrust in my direction before I headed for home. With the current social distancing, we are now talking in the window , yet little has changed. Before the more stringent lock-down, you were offered tea as soon as you land on the street with some of the weeks essentials and the chat has changed towards sporting nostalgia. “Mickey might make use of these,” Bridie said to Pauline on a visit, before the the lock-down. Yes that Mickey is me, but thats another story. googletag.cmd.push It was another stash of Maghera school magazines, The Patrician, going back to the early s. And low and behold, as I searched frantically for a photo of Niall Mullan to go with this weeks feature on Derry hurlings glory days, there he was in full flow in the  Patrician. TIME FOR CHANGE Like every media outlet, producing the County Derry Posts sport section has taken a change of direction. It involves more delving and conjuring. Gone are the reports and round-ups from the club league. The athletics, soccer and rugby seasons are on hold. The local cycling clubs have came to a halt. Now it is all about nostalgia. In these testing times, it gives our readers a chance to reflect on the past. We are living in unprecedented times. It takes a bit of readjusting, but sports writers are the lucky ones. We have a mountain of material out there – just begging to be sourced. There are stories waiting to be told. When researching Colum Rocks impact on Loups underage success of the early s, his nephew Ronan handed me a bag of scrapbooks. It was simply unbelievable. I am not from Loup, but it was compelling reading. Newspaper cuttings of match reports, previews and pen-pics. There was even a summary of each season and hopes of the next. I was relieved to leave them back. If I had lost them....lets just say, you couldnt replace them. For the Bellaghy piece a few weeks ago, Joe Cassidy was able to head to his father and mothers house in Ballynease and dig through the memories. If the walls could talk, they would tell the entire Bellaghy story, as well as the Derry pathway of their sons Joe and Damian. In an interview with teenager Enda Downey, before the postponed MacRory final, he mentioned his Granda and Granny Downeys collection of artefacts, including videos of games and how it gave him a taste of generations past, before he was even born. “We watched onethe other day and it was just catch and kick, it was so dferent to now,” he said of one of the s of videos, all stored away. The media industry has moved on. The newer generation is more au fait with online and getting their fix from social media. Thats the challenge we face, finding that balance. But, the last few weeks have reinforced one thing – there is no substitute for the hard copy. YouTube channels come and go, websites can vanish and hard drives can crash. On the other hand, a well archived set of papers, programmes and magazines is simply invaluable. As the pandemic continues, any glimmer of a date for the resumption of sport is far away over the horizon. When it arrives, we will embrace it like never before. My first visit to Patsy and Bridie Kennedy taught me well. Get the kettle boiled as soon as you can and lt the lid on all the great moments from the past. We need conversation, positivity and nostalgia more than ever. RELATED - Sideline Views Derry team with a dference. Click here...

Its the time when things start to become very real, yet its a Hadrians Wall we all have to get over. The worry about what happens when the small talk runs out, only to be replaced with an uncomfortable silence. I didnt have that problem. Minutes into my visit, I was on the pigs back. One of the things I remember – apart from the never-ending flow of tea – was Paulines mother Bridie talking about school days in St Patricks Maghera, where she worked for  years. googletag.cmd.push The other was her father Patsy having the same fanaticism with talking football as I did. Hours later, a thousand balls were kicked, championships were won and lost, an th cup of tea was thrust in my direction before I headed for home. With the current social distancing, we are now talking in the window , yet little has changed. Before the more stringent lock-down, you were offered tea as soon as you land on the street with some of the weeks essentials and the chat has changed towards sporting nostalgia. “Mickey might make use of these,” Bridie said to Pauline on a visit, before the the lock-down. Yes that Mickey is me, but thats another story. googletag.cmd.push It was another stash of Maghera school magazines, The Patrician, going back to the early s. And low and behold, as I searched frantically for a photo of Niall Mullan to go with this weeks feature on Derry hurlings glory days, there he was in full flow in the  Patrician. TIME FOR CHANGE Like every media outlet, producing the County Derry Posts sport section has taken a change of direction. It involves more delving and conjuring. Gone are the reports and round-ups from the club league. The athletics, soccer and rugby seasons are on hold. The local cycling clubs have came to a halt. Now it is all about nostalgia. In these testing times, it gives our readers a chance to reflect on the past. We are living in unprecedented times. It takes a bit of readjusting, but sports writers are the lucky ones. We have a mountain of material out there – just begging to be sourced. There are stories waiting to be told. When researching Colum Rocks impact on Loups underage success of the early s, his nephew Ronan handed me a bag of scrapbooks. It was simply unbelievable. I am not from Loup, but it was compelling reading. Newspaper cuttings of match reports, previews and pen-pics. There was even a summary of each season and hopes of the next. I was relieved to leave them back. If I had lost them....lets just say, you couldnt replace them. For the Bellaghy piece a few weeks ago, Joe Cassidy was able to head to his father and mothers house in Ballynease and dig through the memories. If the walls could talk, they would tell the entire Bellaghy story, as well as the Derry pathway of their sons Joe and Damian. In an interview with teenager Enda Downey, before the postponed MacRory final, he mentioned his Granda and Granny Downeys collection of artefacts, including videos of games and how it gave him a taste of generations past, before he was even born. “We watched onethe other day and it was just catch and kick, it was so dferent to now,” he said of one of the s of videos, all stored away. The media industry has moved on. The newer generation is more au fait with online and getting their fix from social media. Thats the challenge we face, finding that balance. But, the last few weeks have reinforced one thing – there is no substitute for the hard copy. YouTube channels come and go, websites can vanish and hard drives can crash. On the other hand, a well archived set of papers, programmes and magazines is simply invaluable. As the pandemic continues, any glimmer of a date for the resumption of sport is far away over the horizon. When it arrives, we will embrace it like never before. My first visit to Patsy and Bridie Kennedy taught me well. Get the kettle boiled as soon as you can and lt the lid on all the great moments from the past. We need conversation, positivity and nostalgia more than ever. RELATED - Sideline Views Derry team with a dference. Click here...

Anyone caught neglecting to clean up after their dogs can now be issued with an pound fine and the council has wasted no time in getting the message across along some of the citys most popular walkways. Recently, Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Councillor Michaela Boyle, reminded the public of the need to take responsibility for their pets following an increase in the instances of dog fouling in recent weeks. Government measures to reduce the spread of the Covid  virus by limiting when the public can leave their home has led to an increase in walkers in local parks, greenways and public footpaths and with it more dog foul for Councils Cleansing teams to clean up. googletag.cmd.push Mayor Boyle urged dog owners to show respect for public health and other parks and greenway users when walking their pets. The vast majority of dog owners are conscientious and clean up after their dogs but there has been a noted increase in fouling since the new stay at home measures were introduced,” she said. Dog excrement left on our streets and parks poses a serious public health hazard and is putting extra pressure on our Cleansing team at this dficult time.  I would appeal to all owners to carry a bag to lt the dirt and dispose ofit in a designated dog bin where possible or in a black bin. googletag.cmd.push “Similarly, owners are reminded that when in designated pedestrian zones, dogs must be on a lead held by someone who is able to control it and owners should be mindful of other dogs and members of the public who could be scared of animals.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The following year, he was second choice behind Padraig Oacute Mianaacutein when Derry won the All-Ireland B championship. googletag.cmd.push In , the Us lost to Antrimin the Ulster final. From that team, captain Colin McEldowney, Benny Ward, Mickey Conway, Gary Biggs and Geoffrey McGonigle would help spearhead Derry seniors towards Division One. The minors lost in the final that year, to the Saffrons, by an almost identical margin and Stevenson was the keeper on both teams. In , the Us took Antrim to a replay and  frees from the unerring Dermot Doherty, on his own Emmet Park turf, finished the job as Derry took the title in mid-week extra-time thriller. “That was a good win,” Stevenson recalls. “Antrim were always the team to beat, in terms of the county.” Things began to change. They ran Antrim to three points in the  senior final, but lost convincingly the following year. It was a spell in hurlings top tier that made the wheels of change turn that bit quicker. Promotion at the end of  began a four-year stint in the top flight. They ran Waterford to seven points at Ballinascreen in their first outing, before facing Cork and Kilkenny. The cream of hurling was lting Derrys standards. A -point slump to Tipperary, in Thurles, was their toughest afternoon. A one-point defeat in Laois was the one that got away, leaving Derry needing to beat Kerry in a relegation play-off to stay afloat before dropping down at end of the  campaign. “I think it as the Division One hurling that stuck to us and we were on an upward curve,” Stevenson feels. “There were more players added to the . “Derry hurlingwas about filling up the numbers and going out to play the matches. Then it changed and everybody was taking it serious. The club scene was improving and you could see the skill level going up from  to .” HARMONY In an interview three years ago, Conor Murray painted the Derry hurling scene he played on at the start of the noughties as a family. A unique one, with club rivalry left at the gates of Owenbeg and picked up on the way home. Stevenson agrees. “No club stuck to themselves, everybody got on well with everybody,” he said. Other managers werent chirping in players ears, telling them not to commit to the small ball game. In the  season, Kieran McKeever threw his lot in with the hurlers, while also playing in an Ulster football final weeks later. “Players were not restricted in playing for the county, in terms of hurling and everybody gelled,” Stevenson added A mountain of upside-down kit bags would be erected in the aisle of the team bus, with a coat thrown over it. Hey presto, they had a card table, around which they laughed on their journey to whatever battle they would later brace themselves for. It got more advanced when Stevenson, a kitchen manufacturer by trade, patented a custom-made card table. “When we were coming home, we were arm-wrestling on it and it was all a bit of craic,” he joked.  Emmett McKeever, Kieran McKeever and Geoffrey McGonigle celebrate Derrys  Ulster title. Steering the ship was Cushendall man Kevin McNaughton. After spending time helping foster Swatraghs structures and leading them to back to back intermediate championships, he came on board with Derry at the start of the  season. His trusted lieutenant, from the Swa, Roger Anthony Quinn, Laveys hurling godfather Tom Magill, Banaghers Gerard McCloskey and athletics coach Malcolm McCausland made up the management team. Heading up the M for the  final, Derry were in a decent place, following a - to - win over a Down team who had beaten New York in the quarter-final. Antrim were -point winners over London in their semi-final, but Derry blitzed them in the first half of the decider. Rookie defenders Emmett OHara and Declan McKillop were led a merry dance by the Derry attack. Ace attacker Geoffrey McGonigle and Emmett McKeever were missing through suspension. That told enough of the depth in Derrys squad. “We were getting better with playing all the better teams. There was plenty of skill, speed and fitness in the team. It was about trying to put it all together...it was a good ,” Stevenson explained. McKeever had been suspended after being sent off with Downs Noel Sands in the semi-final, on the advice of a linesman. With high-ranking officials on their July holidays, the appeal – lodged before the end of June – wasnt heard and McKeever would miss the final. “Beefywas our best player in defence...he was lethal,” Stevenson said of his captain. “We wanted to try and win it for him because he was hard done by. He was well-liked and in every match, hed have put his head in front of the hurl to stop the ball. “Antrim had Alistair Elliott, Gregory OKane was full-forward and Gary OKane started at centre half-forward, before going back .” DREAM START Kieran McKeever, Gary Biggs and Ollie Collins hit first half goals to leave Antrims foundations rocking. The Saffrons didnt score from play for  minutes. “We shouldve been further ahead,” said Stevenson of their - to - interval lead. “We had missed a pile of scoring opportunities and we were against the breeze in the second half. “We knewthe forwards were getting on the ball, they could score goals because they were skilful and quick.” Derrys backs were to the wall as Antrim notched  unanswered points and, with  minutes gone, went four points ahead. Derry replied with points to take the wind out of Antrims sails. Their case was helped further when John ODywer finished to the net for the crucial fourth Oakleafers goal. “It was the goals that won us the match,” Stevenson said. “I still have a hurling ball in the house, with the scorewritten on it.” All the press cuttings and programmes were kept too. A raft of memories from the glory years. But the hurl that deflected Gary OKanes last minute sideline cut to safety is long gone. “Some wee Belfast boy stole it,” Stevenson reckons. The Derry squad threw their history-making hurls on the turf to celebrate and within minutes they had vanished. “When the final was blown, it was more thepressure, you were always checking the time to see what was left. If the game had went onthere was less likelihood that we couldve won the game.” Conor Murray accepted the cup in the stand, before taking it down to the pitch for the suspended Emmett McKeever to again hoist it skywards to salute the magical moment. “We were there on merit,” was Stevensons assessment of their win. “We had a good defence and a good forward line. When you take the likes of John ODwyer, Geoffrey and Mickey Collins as your front three – you have a good side. “Conor Murray at full-back was safe, you had Collieand Niall Mullan in the corners.” Stevenson picked up the man of the match award and added to it with the Ulster hurler of the year accolade the following season when Derry retained their title. Later that night, the team partied into the wee small hours in Dungiven club. You could barely turn a sweet in your mouth. It was jam packed. Before that, on the joyous journey home, there was a poignant moment when the players got off the bus to carry the cup over the River Bann in Toome. “We had talked about it in previous years – the days when we were beaten,” Stevenson remembers. “It was a short walk, the boys were more interested in getting on the bus and heading on home.” Derrys fallow  years was over.

As one might expect there’s a strong representation from multiple John McLaughlin winners Ballinderry, Slaughtneil and Coleraine but I can’t believe some of the players that I have left out. However, I’m pretty sure thatan imaginary club was able to field this line-out in their prime, they’d not be far off lting the Andy Merrigan Cup. googletag.cmd.push  - MichaelConlan - Ballinderry A fixture between the sticks for Ballinderry for almost two decades, Mickey C was a good goalkeeper at the start of his career when winning an All-Ireland club medal in . By the s he seemed even better, maintaining a physical condition that would have been the envy of men  years his junior and adjusting to a massive transformation in what was expected from a modern goalkeeper. He just edges out Slaughtneil’s Antoin McMullan for the number one jersey.  - Karl McKaigue – Slaughtneil Karl might not be as well know as his elder brother, but he has been just as vital in Slaughtneil’s success. The archetype of the modern defender, who must meld man-marking skills with ability on the ball, McKaigue is often the initiation point for the Emmett’s attack. Has held some of the finest forwards in club football scoreless during Slaughtneil’s rise to national prominence including Conleith Gilligan, Ryan McHugh and Seanie Johnston. googletag.cmd.push  - Brendan Rogers Slaughtneil Another Emmets dual star Rogers, has been the defensive rock on which Slaughtneil’s success has been built. Named Ulster Club footballer of the year for , as a youngster Rogers initially chose to focus on hurling but has established himself as one of the football’s best defenders in not just Derry but Ulster, an automatic pick for this selection.  - Ciaran Mullan - Coleraine A superb athlete whose ball-carrying ability and pace have made him a nightmare for opposing forwards who end up spending much of their time tracking back into their own half. A key man as Coleraine claimed the John McLaughlin Cup for the first time in  and was still a fixture when they claimed their second title in .  - Kevin McGuckin - Ballinderry Another Ballinderry man with an All-Ireland medal in his pocket, the fact he was still making the starting  for the Shamrocks in  is testament to his qualities. A Rolls Royce of a footballer the former Derry captain’s experience was crucial as the Loughshore completed a hat-trick of victories between  and .  - Oisin Duffy - Foreglen It’s a measure of Oisin Duffy’s consistent excellence that he makes this selection based on performances in the Intermediate Championship. Could play any position in the backline, his strength and pace made him an effective man marker but equally comfortable in possession. Still as effective as ever as Foreglen claimed the Intermediate crown last October.  - Chrissy McKaigue - Slaughtneil First rose to prominence on the Derry minor side that reached the All-Ireland final in  the current Derry Captain has been a fixture for club and county for a decade. In addition to his evident abilities as a player, McKaigue provides the intangible qualities of leadership that every successful team needs. On the rare occasions that Slaughtneil find themselves floundering McKaigue is the man to whom his team-mates look to steady the ship.  - Patsy Bradley - Slaughtneil Another who’s career has spanned the ages, Patsy Bradley is an icon of Derry football. The quintessential quiet, hard man, Bradley’s aerial prowess rarely fails to catch the eye and his work-rate is immense. Has overcome injuries that might have restricted the career of lesser players Patsy’s toughness is the stuff of legend.  - Niall Holly - Coleraine Strong in the air and extremely mobile. Holly’s ball carrying skills have the been the starting point for countless Eoghan Rua attacks, with his languid style belying and athleticism allows him to glide past opponents. A perfect foil for the combative Bradley.  - Enda Muldoon - Ballinderry One of the most gted footballers ever to apply a boot to a size five, the Shamrocks man’s gts appeared to immune to the passing of the years as Ballinderry emulated their s antecedents in winning three in a row from  to . His ball to Raymond Wilkinson for the decisive goal in the  semi-final win over Banagher may be the best pass I have ever seen in club football.  - Benny Heron- Ballinascreen The only man in my team who doesn’t have some form of Championship winners medal to show for his efforts. Heron has been a prolic scorer for a Ballinascreen team that has regularly been in the mix for the John McLaughlin Cup without quite sealing the deal. With his phenomenal work rate and ability to score from both play and placed balls, Heron was a key factor in the St Colm’s club’s run to the  and  county finals.  - Sean Leo McGoldrick - Coleraine The oil that has kept the Coleraine engine running smoothly for a decade. Adaptable players can sometimes be the victims of their own versatility but Sean Leo McGoldrick’s quality is such that every manager in Derry would love to have him in their squad. One Coleraine mentor once told me that the one time in any game when he could relax was when Sean Leo had the ball because he knew it was secure. An incisive runner and an accurate passer the Eoghan Rua man can also chip in with a vital score when the occasion requires.  - Coilin Devlin - Ballinderry The flame-haired front man maybe didn’t have the profile of the other Ballinderry forward in this line-up but his impact for the Shamrocks in the early part of the decade was undeniable, bagged the decisive goal in the  final against Slaughtneil, and scored five points from play to earn man of the match honours in . Dooks pace and direct running made him a handful for opposing corner-backs.  - Colm McGoldrick - Coleraine The second member of the McGoldrick clan to make my team and you could make case for the inclusion of any of the brothers, but Colm is well worth his place. He was the fulcrum of the Eoghan Rua attack as they claimed their first county crown in . The intelligence of his movement is something that can’t be taught. As captain he scored four points in the  final as Coleraine doubled their tally of John McLaughlin Cups.  - Shane McGuigan - Slaughtneil The sharpest shooter in Derry club football in recent year. McGuigan’s scoring tallies speak for themselves scored - in the  Derry Championship and better that tally with - in . Performs well on the big stage top scored in the  Ulster final with - against Kilcoo and bagged - in ’s provincial triumph over Cavan Gaels. Every successful team needs a marquee man in their full-forward line, McGuigan is Slaughtneil’s. RELATED - Michael McMullans team of the decade- Click here...

Has held some of the finest forwards in club football scoreless during Slaughtneil’s rise to national prominence including Conleith Gilligan, Ryan McHugh and Seanie Johnston. googletag.cmd.push  - Brendan Rogers Slaughtneil Another Emmets dual star Rogers, has been the defensive rock on which Slaughtneil’s success has been built. Named Ulster Club footballer of the year for , as a youngster Rogers initially chose to focus on hurling but has established himself as one of the football’s best defenders in not just Derry but Ulster, an automatic pick for this selection.  - Ciaran Mullan - Coleraine A superb athlete whose ball-carrying ability and pace have made him a nightmare for opposing forwards who end up spending much of their time tracking back into their own half. A key man as Coleraine claimed the John McLaughlin Cup for the first time in  and was still a fixture when they claimed their second title in .  - Kevin McGuckin - Ballinderry Another Ballinderry man with an All-Ireland medal in his pocket, the fact he was still making the starting  for the Shamrocks in  is testament to his qualities. A Rolls Royce of a footballer the former Derry captain’s experience was crucial as the Loughshore completed a hat-trick of victories between  and .  - Oisin Duffy - Foreglen It’s a measure of Oisin Duffy’s consistent excellence that he makes this selection based on performances in the Intermediate Championship. Could play any position in the backline, his strength and pace made him an effective man marker but equally comfortable in possession. Still as effective as ever as Foreglen claimed the Intermediate crown last October.  - Chrissy McKaigue - Slaughtneil First rose to prominence on the Derry minor side that reached the All-Ireland final in  the current Derry Captain has been a fixture for club and county for a decade. In addition to his evident abilities as a player, McKaigue provides the intangible qualities of leadership that every successful team needs. On the rare occasions that Slaughtneil find themselves floundering McKaigue is the man to whom his team-mates look to steady the ship.  - Patsy Bradley - Slaughtneil Another who’s career has spanned the ages, Patsy Bradley is an icon of Derry football. The quintessential quiet, hard man, Bradley’s aerial prowess rarely fails to catch the eye and his work-rate is immense. Has overcome injuries that might have restricted the career of lesser players Patsy’s toughness is the stuff of legend.  - Niall Holly - Coleraine Strong in the air and extremely mobile. Holly’s ball carrying skills have the been the starting point for countless Eoghan Rua attacks, with his languid style belying and athleticism allows him to glide past opponents. A perfect foil for the combative Bradley.  - Enda Muldoon - Ballinderry One of the most gted footballers ever to apply a boot to a size five, the Shamrocks man’s gts appeared to immune to the passing of the years as Ballinderry emulated their s antecedents in winning three in a row from  to . His ball to Raymond Wilkinson for the decisive goal in the  semi-final win over Banagher may be the best pass I have ever seen in club football.  - Benny Heron- Ballinascreen The only man in my team who doesn’t have some form of Championship winners medal to show for his efforts. Heron has been a prolic scorer for a Ballinascreen team that has regularly been in the mix for the John McLaughlin Cup without quite sealing the deal. With his phenomenal work rate and ability to score from both play and placed balls, Heron was a key factor in the St Colm’s club’s run to the  and  county finals.  - Sean Leo McGoldrick - Coleraine The oil that has kept the Coleraine engine running smoothly for a decade. Adaptable players can sometimes be the victims of their own versatility but Sean Leo McGoldrick’s quality is such that every manager in Derry would love to have him in their squad. One Coleraine mentor once told me that the one time in any game when he could relax was when Sean Leo had the ball because he knew it was secure. An incisive runner and an accurate passer the Eoghan Rua man can also chip in with a vital score when the occasion requires.  - Coilin Devlin - Ballinderry The flame-haired front man maybe didn’t have the profile of the other Ballinderry forward in this line-up but his impact for the Shamrocks in the early part of the decade was undeniable, bagged the decisive goal in the  final against Slaughtneil, and scored five points from play to earn man of the match honours in . Dooks pace and direct running made him a handful for opposing corner-backs.  - Colm McGoldrick - Coleraine The second member of the McGoldrick clan to make my team and you could make case for the inclusion of any of the brothers, but Colm is well worth his place. He was the fulcrum of the Eoghan Rua attack as they claimed their first county crown in . The intelligence of his movement is something that can’t be taught. As captain he scored four points in the  final as Coleraine doubled their tally of John McLaughlin Cups.  - Shane McGuigan - Slaughtneil The sharpest shooter in Derry club football in recent year. McGuigan’s scoring tallies speak for themselves scored - in the  Derry Championship and better that tally with - in . Performs well on the big stage top scored in the  Ulster final with - against Kilcoo and bagged - in ’s provincial triumph over Cavan Gaels. Every successful team needs a marquee man in their full-forward line, McGuigan is Slaughtneil’s. RELATED - Michael McMullans team of the decade- Click here...

Aodhan Curran often draws sketches of people, both living and deceased. Families of those who have received one of Aodhans drawings say that it has brought them great comfort. As a result, the -year-old, who is currently studying to become a teacher, has offered to do a sketch of anyone who passes away from the virus. He has already been contacted by one family and within days of the person passing away, Aodhan had left the drawing at their home. He said the family were very thankful of the gesture. googletag.cmd.push “It is only a small thing but I think many of the families affected will get some comfort from it,” he said. Aodhan, who lives at Jacqueline Way in Derry, said he had always been interested in art. “I am studying to be a technology and design teacher at Ulster University in Coleraine but I have always loved art and doing sketches. “Over the years, I have done loads of drawings of people. “My uncle, Robbie Kennelly, died a few years ago and I did a drawing of him after he passed away. “His we, my aunt Margo, says the drawing is so special for her and it is lovely to hear that. googletag.cmd.push “From talking to other families, they love the sketches I have done for them and I just thought this would be a nice thing to do for some of the families of those who lose a loved one to coronavirus.” Aodhan said the circumstances surrounding the virus made it particularly dficult for families. “The people who area very ill with the virus are in the hospital on their own and then often die without their family being present. “And then there is the funeral service at which only a small number of people can attend. “It is a very dficult process for families to go through and many more will have to experience it over the next few weeks and months. “If my drawings can bring families even a small bit of comfort then I will be more than happy to help.” Any families who would like to contact Aodhan, can get in touch with him through his Facebook page Aodhan Curran Art.

Even in defeat, it was Derry who stole the show. What was supposed to be a Sunday stroll for Offaly turned out to be nothing of the sort as Derry flew the underdog flag with real pride. At the midpoint of the second half, Derry were level and pressing, and it took a strong finish by the overwhelming favourites to earn a six-point cushion at the end. Offaly’s manager, Pat Fleury, readily admitted that his team would have to make enormous improvements before the semi-final against Cork. googletag.cmd.push The truth is, Derry were always in contention in this game despite the dire predictions of a massacre. Geoffrey McGonigle ed from suspension to rattle in two goals and the full forward line of Gary Biggs, Michael Collins and John O’Dwyer scored - among them. There were high-class performances at midfield from Ronan McCloskey and Oliver Collins, and at the back, Derry held both John Troy and Gary Hannfy scoreless. We came down here to win, said manager Kevin McNaughton. We know we are not that far away and I always thought we were in with a chance, we were hurling so well. googletag.cmd.push There was the feeling throughout the first half that Offaly always had the upper hand, but once McGonigle pounced for goals in the final quarter, the complexion of the contest changed. Brian Whelahan had been left out of the starting lineup due to a hamstring strain, but he was quickly pitched into service to shore up a leaky defense, and Joe Errity was also sent into the action. Their presence had the desired effect as Derry managed only two scores in the closing stages, while Offaly had five points and a vital goal by Brendan Murphy. Derry were five points in arrears at the changeover, but they had the advantage of the breeze to come. McGonigle got the first of his goals when he latched on to Kieran McKeever’s probing delivery, and then when Stephen Byrne made a save from John O’Dwyer’s shot, McGonigle was perfectly positioned to dispatch the rebound. We put in a hell of a performance, said Ollie Collins, who was forced out with injury during the second half. This our first time down here. I’m certain this team will be back at this stage of the competition and go better.

No matter where you go or who you are talking to up and down the country, they always ask about Roly. There is always someone who knows him or has played with or against him.The above paragraph was taken word for word from Drumaness Millsrsquos th anniversary booklet in . It captures brilliantly the essence of Roly lsquoThe Manrsquo.Roly died on Wednesday, March , sparking a deluge of tributes on social media. True gentleman, one in a million, what a lovely man, one and only Roly, top man, a legend mdash these tributes, among many others, appeared again and again.Roly was an integral part of village le in Drumaness, dandering to the bookies or the shop. He would make multiple stops to say hello to everyone he met, discussing the issues of the day.I have known him for a!most  years. He worked in Sam Bellrsquos egg factory across the road from St Josephrsquos Primary School in Crossgar. The workers would kick a ball about the road during their break and even to my untrained eye he was dferent class. It was my introduction to Roly lsquoThe Footballerrsquo.Some years later Roly and his brother, John, knocked on our door in Crossgar. They wanted me to play for the Mills in the Newcastle Summer League and I was more than happy to do so.Playing with Roly was a great education for a young player. He made football look easy, was stylish and talented, possessing the rare gt of keeping the game simple.Small wonder then that when talk comes around to the Millsrsquo greatest ever player, Roly is always in the conversation, despite competition from the likes of Robbie Strain, Osie Gelston, Conor Walsh and Davy Mills.Legend has it that in those days boys were born with boots on in Drumaness because this was a village where sport was king. So it was that Roly also excelled at billiards and cricket, reaching a very high standard in both.But football and the Mills were Rolyrsquos first loves and he rarely missed training or matches. Inevitably his talent came to the notice of Irish League managers and he enjoyed spells with Portadown and Cltonville in the early seventies. Nevertheless, Roly was a home bird and sooner or later he would pull on the Mills shirt again.By now I was playing for the all conquering Downpatrick Rec team of that era and we pitched up to a Border Cup final early in  to play the Mills. We had just won the Steel and Sons Cup and had our eyes firmly on the double, but Roly and Osie Gelston had other plans and proceeded to inspire the Mills to a famous - win.Roly had reached the twilight years of a glorious footballing career, but there was still time to lead the Mills reserves to another giant-killing act, beating Castlewellan in the Bobby Dalzell Cup final in .After such a stellar playing career, Roly was expected to become a manager. He did dip his toes in the managerial waters once or twice, but with no offence intended to the managerial fraternity mdash myself included mdash Roly was probably too nice to be a manager. In all the years I have known him I canrsquot remember him raising his voice. He was just so easy going, decent and level-headed.As a result people liked Roly and this popularity unsurprisingly proved to be an asset in his working le. After Sam Bells he spent a number of years working in the Co-Op shop in Drumaness before taking up employment with well-known butcher Vincy Doran.He was a familiar sight in Vincyrsquos van, delivering to hotels and restaurants, but it was his weekend door-to-door run which played to his strengths and further cemented his popularity.He became known as Butch or Butcher mdash a nickname he loved mdash and Vincy to this day has nothing but good things to say about Rolyrsquos eight-year stint with him.Rolyrsquos next stop was with Jimmy Quinn, who owned a bakery in Downpatrick. Jimmy shrewdly ed Roly to the door-to-door market and with people still finding it dficult to say no to the personable Roly, their successful liaison continued for  years.Jimmy likes nothing better than relating Roly stories,none of which can be repeated here, and like the rest of us he will remember Roly with the utmost fondness.Unfortunately Roly wasnrsquot immune to the ups and downs of le and deteriorating health curtailed his working le. He managed to fight and beat prostrate cancer a number of years ago, but this time around the lsquoBig Crsquo has claimed this lovely man.Ironically it was during these latter years that he seemed to be ever present on the streets of Drumaness, allowing him to befriend a generation entirely unaware of his past sporting prowess.Roly married Betty Rice on October , , and together they brought Noel, Pauline, Betty, Carol and Christine into the world. After almost  years together as a couple they remained best friends, as well as husband and we.Apart from my football connection to Roly, I have been his neighbour for  years and since his passing I have heard him described as lsquoMr Drumaness Millsrsquo, but for me he was Mr Drumaness full stop. This village will never be the same without him.Rolyrsquos family should be immensely proud of his impact on those who knew him and how sad it was to see coronavirus rob them and Roly of the fitting send-off he deserved.However, the good news is that I know there are plans afoot to have a celebration of his le when normality s. Nobody deserves it more.

Hopefully wersquoll be back playing as soon as possible, I think thatrsquos the goal.ldquoI think we just have to accept it and sit tight and when it does pass, we can get things moving a bit quicker.Certainly things have happened fairly quickly for Sharvin in his career to date. He only took up golf seriously relatively late in his teenage years, but went on to have glittering amateur career.In  he was a member of the Great Britain and Ireland Walker Cup team, contributing three points and remaining unbeaten in a .-. thumping of the United States.Sharvin turned  the following year and joined the ranks of the European Challenge Tour.Having missed his European Tour card by a single shot in , Sharvin relocated to Dublin and It proved to be the right move.He amassed eight top ten finishes in  starts to earn a rookie season on the European Tour thanks in large part to his six top fives.Sharvin only missed four cuts, two of which came in the first two events of the season, before he kickstarted his campaign with back-to-back top ten finishes.However, his best performance came at the Irish Open at Lahinch where he finished tied for th and was also the leading Irish golfer.He showed impressive consistency during the  season and proved his elite-level credentials with a tie for th finish at the Irish Open, ending the week as the leading home competitor.He says: I had a really good year, I put myself into contention a lot which was great. I think I was ready to take that step and I think the way I played, I deserved to get my card in the end with a few good results.ldquoI also managed to play well in a couple of European Tour events as well which showed me that I was ready to take that step. Therersquos a relief that I have my card now but itrsquos only the start of it mdash I know I have to keep improving and moving up the rankings.At the Irish Open he finished ahead of future Open champion Shane Lowry, Ryder Cup star Tommy Fleetwood former world number one Lee Westwood and Ryder Cup captain Padraig Harrington.ldquoIt was disappointing to shoot level-par on Sunday, but I feel like I didnrsquot do much wrong, he said.ldquoIt was really nice to have that pressure of going into the final round of a big European Tour event with a chance to win. It showed me where I was mentally and physically, that I was able to come from the Challenge Tour and compete in a top-level European Tour event.ldquoThat was an unbelievable week. The crowds were incredible and I attracted a big following being the leading Irishman, and that was a great feeling.ldquoItrsquos a nice feeling when hundreds of people are following you and everyone is willing your ball into the hole. I think that really geared me up quite a lot. It was a class buzz.ldquoIt was dficult going back to playing the Challenge Tour in the middle of nowhere in France the week after, but that week gave me the confidence to string together more good results to get off the Challenge Tour.Sharvin admits itrsquos been a slow start on the European Tour, with a tie for th in the Oman Open his bestin four starts this year, but his belief in being able to compete at the higher end of leaderboards remains undimmed.ldquoI feel like my game is good, but I havenrsquot really put all the facets together. ldquoI think in Oman I was second in strokes, gained tee-to-green and just putted really poorly. I played quite nicely in Qatar and just didnrsquot get it going.ldquoItrsquos obviously such a short period of time so itrsquos hard to assess in four events, but I feel like Irsquom close. This break may help me improve other things and hopefully Irsquom a better player when we start again.Given his Walker Cup experience, Sharvin would dearly love to play in the Ryder Cup in the years ahead.ldquoThe Ryder Cup would definitely be up there for me. I grew up playing team sports and have been involved with them my whole le, so that would be huge.ldquoI feel like Irsquom pretty good in a team and having tasted a little success in team sports, I think thatI can get my game to that level, Irsquod be a good asset in that sense..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Ballynahinch.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch singer performs at nursing homes  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH man is serenading residents in local nursing and residential homes through the COVID- crisis with hit songs to remind them of happier times.The gesture from popular singer Wayne Rodgers is even more laudable as he lost all his work overnight in the lockdown as a driving instructor and a wedding band performer.The  year-old performed outside four homes on Monday, delighting the residents and carers in Redburn Nursing Home, Oakridge Care Home, Spa Nursing Home and Fishbourne House Care Home.Performing classic hits from artists such as Jim Reeves and Clf Richards, Wayne believes his singing is helping strike a chord with the elderly residents who need to be kept apart from family members at this time.ldquoThe singing helps the residents and it really helps me too as it passes the time for me as my work has had to stop due to the virus, said Wayne, who now lives in Bellaghy.ldquoIrsquove received photographs taken from the inside of the home showing residents enjoying my songs and itrsquos lovely to see.

It is certainly a strange experience for me.I was ordained in  in Downpatrick. New technologies and new means of communication came after that, and Irsquove struggled ever since. So the recent experience of having to install web-cams at short notice into the three churches in my two parishes of Portaferry and Ballygalget, has been somewhat traumatic.This week is the holiest of weeks for Christians. The passion and death of Jesus is commemorated, in preparation for the resurrection on Easter Sunday. We celebrate this in ious ways. We might well ask ourselves what happened to Lent and how on earth do we celebrate what will seem like a lsquovirtualrsquo Easter Coronavirus suddenly intruded into our Lent, at close quarters, and changed everything.My mother still remembers the glow in the sky over Belfast, when from her home in Ballykinlar, she heard the planes over South Down on their way to blitz Belfast. No doubt her grandmother would have told stories of the terrible pandemic of Spanish Influenza just over a century ago.But my generation and that of my nieces and nephews have known little of such things and we experience this pandemic a grave threat.At the moment of writing, the streets of Portaferry and Downpatrick are entirely empty, as are the great cities of Rome, London and New York.The unexpected severity of lockdown leaves us feeling bewildered, disorientated, shell-shocked. We are acutely aware of the suffering around us mdash illness, hospitalisation, loneliness in sudden isolation. As schools close we are anxious about increased tension in family le. The loss of our work and leisure patterns, financial and employment worries.In the Old Testament Jobloses so much of what he had mdash health, family, possessions and friends mdash yet he refuses to rebel against God in his suffering. This is incredibly dficult for most of us. His attitude of acceptance of his suffering can be of help to us. He says: ldquoShall we receive the good at the hand of God, and not take the bad Jobrsquos story can be useful to us at present. If you can get a chance, read it.Lent mdash an old English word for spring mdash is more challenging this year than we ever expected. As we celebrate Holy Week here are two words that figure in the writings of Henri Nouwen, a Dutch spiritual writer, that I find useful.The first word is security. Where do we look in our lives for security. A basic human need  In success, popularity, money, friends, family, insurance and so on  We mightnrsquot think we do. We will always be influenced by them, but deep down they will never provide us with security.Many of those things are good in themselves, but spiritually, the only true security will be found in the everlasting love of the One who loved us first and who wishes to love us into and for all eternity. Job understood that mdash security.The second word is patience. Patience means a kind of ldquosuffering through the present. Itrsquos from the Latin, patior, which means to suffer. But being patient does not mean sitting back and doing nothing. It is not being passive. Having patience is not easy for us. How do we wait patiently for God this Holy Week, Easter and beyond during this world pandemic Being patient is an active waiting mdash it means a certain experience of suffering through the present moment. To let the seeds of our suffering be sown in the ground so as to grow later into healthy, strong plants.It means avoiding the dead-end of what could have been for the ability to pay attention to what is happening before our very eyes, paying attention to the people and world around us. By that patience, we can begin to catch a glimpse of the first rays of Godrsquos glorious coming.Last week, I personally saw those first rays when I witnessed the staff in a residential nursing home in Portaferry decide to live-in with the residents for as long as this emergency would last.This week I witnessed those first rays when a cousin, a retired doctor, rang me to tell me he was volunteering toto work to bolster the Health Service.In one way or another have we not all been privileged to witness the generosity of spirit, despite danger, of those carers, nurses, doctors, medics, ancillary staff and many others Might this not be for us another glimpse that helps us experience in our present circumstances that Christ is indeed risen and lives now among us  It certainly is a glimpse for me.The Old Testament reading for many of us on Sunday last was from Ezekiel. ldquoThe Lord says this: I am going to open your graves. I mean to raise you from your graves and lead you back to the soil of Israel. I shall put my spirit in you, and you will live, and will know that I, the Lord, have said and done this it is the Lord who speaks.The people of Ezekielrsquos time knew their frailty and experienced uncertainty as we do today. Their faith in God had been severely shaken. Could they start again Security, patience, maybe these two words might stay with us over the next while as the reason for the hope that we have I leave you with the words of a psalm, which St Patrick himself echoed in his own writings, his lsquoConfessionrsquo.The words encourage us to place our hope in the Son of God who will sustain and strengthen us in our days, the Son of God, Jesus, who knew what it was like to stumble and fall beneath the weight of the Cross. With these words I ask God to bless us and keep us safe:ldquoI waited, I waited for the Lord and He stooped down to me, He heard my cry. He drew me from the deadly pit, from the miry clay. He set my foot upon a rock, and made my footsteps firm.With security and patience we can put our trust in the fallen saviour..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Huge.jpg","title":"Huge boost for foodbanks  ","story":"THE districtrsquos foodbanks have been provided with a pound, boost by Newry, Mourne and Down Council to help them respond to increasing need during the coronavirus pandemic.The funding has been provided via the local authorityrsquos community network and is one of a series of initiatives the local authority is spearheading to continue providing a range of frontline services and responding to the needs of the vulnerable and elderly in particular.This week, residents across the district have been thanked for adhering to advice to help stop the spread of coronavirus by staying indoors and keeping safe.And, as the Easter weekend approaches, council chief executive Marie Ward has appealed to people to continue to listen to the advice to stay at home and save lives.

","story":"AMBITIOUS plans to redevelop Ardglass harbour could cost in the region of poundm, a new report has revealed.The figure is contained in a detailed consultants report commissioned to undertake an in-depth feasibility study to look at potential developments for the harbour which is home to Northern Irelandrsquos third largest fishing fleet.The key issue the consultants focused on was deepening the harbour to facilitate larger vessels, with work also undertaken to look at improving harbour conditions, berthing pontoons for smaller vessels and increased berthing facilities.In addition, the study included a comprehensive review of possible harbour layouts, historic document research, topographic and bathymetric harbour surveys, quay wall inspection above and below the waterline and computermodelling.The consultants also liaised with the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairswhich has been given a copy of the consultants report ahead of further discussions with its officials on the way forward.Ardglass has the only all-weather harbour between Howth and Bangor and has three primary areas including the so-called fish dock within the south pier.There is also the Phennick Cove marina located behind a breakwater mdash which could be extended mdash to the west of the main harbour which can accommodate up to  leisure craft and the inner harbour which dries out at low tide.The consultants say that the inner harbour is particularly useful for vessel maintenance but not utilised as extensively as the outer harbour due to limited water depth.Last August, ious concept layouts produced by consultants were reviewed by members of the Ardglass Harbour Developments group which has been set up to oversee the regeneration of the port. The concepts were subsequently amended in November.The prime focus is on deepening the harbour and moving forward, a cost effective approach may be to zone dredge levels in particular areas.The report suggests deepening the outer harbour by nine metres and the area adjacent to Cochranersquos building at the inner harbour by two metres to facilitate crab vessels.In addition, consideration is being given to creating a pontoon with so-called finger berths adjacent to the quay wall in front of Cochranersquos with gangway access for crab vessels. No leisure craft would be permitted at this part of the harbour.Removal of the existing slipway at the southern end of the harbour adjacent to the beach is suggested as it is not generally used and considered too deep for access, with potential issues in relation to the removal of an area know as Church Rock to be investigated.Quay reclamation work is suggested between the north west corner of the existing finger pier at the ice plant and north western tip of the fish market quay.This would feature a new piled quay, backfilled and surfaced with a heavy duty concrete. Extending theof the quay wall by  metres is also suggested.The estimated cost of the harbour dredging is in the region of pound, with piling work and the new quay line and reclamation work estimated at poundm and poundm respectively.The breakwater extension is estimated at pound.m with the new pontoon facility estimated at pound,.The consultantsrsquo report makes it clear that the costings include primary construction elements but does not include licensing fees, site investigation, engineering design and tendering costs.Before anything happens, a marine licence is required for specic site investigation work, rock quality design and testing, sediment sampling of overburden, contamination testing and an environmental impact assessment.The regeneration jigsaw also requires detailed design work and planning approval ahead of tendering and construction.An economic appraisal may also be required.News of the proposed investment at Ardglass harbour comes after the portrsquos importance to the Ardglass fishing industry to the district and wider South Down economy was highlighted during a recent meeting with Stormont fisheries minister Edwin Poots.He met with South Down MLA Colin McGrath and local councillor Dermot Curran to discuss planned improvement work at the harbour, with the politicians also highlighting the need for additional investment in the harbour and its infrastructure.They described Ardglass harbour as ldquostrategically important for the Co Down fishing fleet, highlighting its crucial role in driving the South Down economy and its location as a central hub for processing fish landed at the port.Mr McGrath and Cllr Curran say further investment is ldquocritical to allow Ardglass harbour to expand to provide an economic boost, not only for the village but the wider area, and create new jobs..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Mourning.jpg","title":"Please stay in  ","story":"ldquoHE was my superman ndash the moving words from Loughinisland woman Maria Farrell whose father sadly lost his battle with COVID-.As her sister also lies in hospital fighting the virus, the mother-of-two has bravely spoken out to warn others not to be complacent about the deadly disease.Maria, who buried her father on Sunday, warned: ldquoIf you think you are exempt from this or you are immune to COVID-, you are barking up the wrong tree.ldquoMy dad went really quickly, hersquos tackled prostate cancer, heart attacks, falls, you name ithellip and hersquos bounced back.

She continues to battle in Altnagelvin Hospital, said Maria.ldquoItrsquos like a nightmare. As daddy passed over, our sister lay in another ward in the same hospital fighting for her le.

He also highlighted the need for financial support for the southern relief road scheme in Newry.ldquoI fully understand that the roads minister has a lot on her plate and recognise that she is not responsible for the failure of her department to invest in any major road scheme in the local area over the past number of decades, he continued. ldquoThe bypass should be in place by now. Itrsquos potential for Ballynahinch and the wider South Down economy is immense.ldquoThe multi-million pound road scheme can rid Ballynahinch of its traffic nightmare, help rejuvenate the town and encourage more visitors into the district and wider Mournes area.South Down MP Chris Hazzard signed off the eagerly-awaited bypass in December  when hewas roads minister in a previous Executive.The by-pass, which would be the single biggest road scheme ever constructed in the district, is expected to take in excess of  months to build, with roads officials insisting that it will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety.Major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road, with a new bridge constructed over the Moss Road.It is also proposed that a section of the by-pass will pass under part of the Crossgar Road with a  metre long bridge constructed to take traffic over Ballynahinch River.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the by-pass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Recognition.jpg","title":"Recognition for poet Stephen  ","story":"A BALLYGOWAN poet is celebrating after his debut anthology was recognised by two major awarding bodies.Stephen Sextonrsquos If All the World and Love Were Young was awarded the highly acclaimed American E M Forester Award which was previously won by Seamus Heaney in .His anthology, published by Penguin Books, was also shortlisted for this yearrsquos Shine Strong Award ndash an award presented annually to the author of the best first collection of poems published by an Irish poet.Stephen says his work centres on coming to terms with the death of his mother, Elizabeth, who passed away in .He said: ldquoI started writing a book of poems that initially were meant to be frivolous and entertaining.ldquoHowever, as I began writing, the intense grief I was battling at the time came to the fore.Critics say what developed was a touching tribute to his mother which they described as a moving narrative exploring bereavement, family le, memories and loss.The judging  consisted of poets Colum McCann, Jhumpa Lahiri and Paul Muldoon.As part of his prize fund for winning the highly acclaimed award, Stephen received , to travel and stay in the United States.Downpatrick poet Damian Smyth, head of literature at the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, congratulated Stephen on his award.He said: ldquoThe sense is quickly growing on both sides of the Atlantic that Stephen Sexton is already one of those rare poets whose obvious and prodigious lyrical gts are matched both by accessibility and universality.He added: ldquoIt is poignant that the person for whom the whole book is an elegy ndash his late mother mdashnever lived to see the acclaim lavished on her son.ldquoHowever, there are few contemporary works which describe the human processes of grief, loss, hurt and how love survives and endures as memorably and as movingly as this one, with virtuoso technique and profound wisdom, which I have to say is already a classic.

I have been transported to a time that has changed my perception of le forever.People with CF have a faulty gene which means the mucus in their bodies is much thicker and stickier than in other people.They donrsquot catch viruses more easily than other people but when they do, it affects their lungs by causing inflammation and increasing the amount of the sticky mucus. This makes bacterial chest infections more likely, some of which are resistant to antibiotics, leading to a decline in lungwhich is the leading cause of death in people with CF.As parents, for the first sixth months of Lorcaacutenrsquos le we were consumed with the fear. We were advised not to visit baby groups, not to let people with colds into the house, not to take him to the supermarket on a weekend when it was busy, not to let him play in soil, wet sand, or day-old playdough as well as taking many, many more precautions to keep him safe.We also discovered that my mother-in-lawrsquos COPD and my fatherrsquos bronchiectasis meant that Lorcaacuten would always have to be careful around his beloved Nana and Grandad in case he caught an infection from them. For the same reason, he could never be within six feet of someone  with CF because of the risk of cross infection. My world would never mdash could never mdash be the same.We rarely left the house. I gave up my job in the RSPB and postponed my studies. Much of our time was taken up with the heavy burden of treatment for CF, including daily physiotherapy and antibiotics. I spent a lot of time campaigning for a cystic fibrosis drug, Orkambi, to be made available on the NHS.And I cried a lot.Over the last three years, le has become more lsquonormalrsquo but beneath the joy of every milestone has been the fear of taking risks that could shorten Lorcaacutenrsquos le at any time.During this time we have learnt that there are some risks you need to take in order to be happy. Lorcaacuten began pre-school as well as swimming, gymnastics, and football classes and I resumed my studies and began working a few hours a week.There has been a lot of stress and sleepless nights, a lot of handwashing, and a lot of happiness. With the support of the public we won the campaign for Orkambi, a drug which can slow the decline in lungby up to % and can be taken by around half of people with CF. Lorcaacuten started taking it at the end of last December mdash the champagne was popped and finally we thought we could start to relax a little.Sadly it wasnrsquot for long. During the wait for Orkambi, Lorcaacutenrsquos lungs had become damaged, after catching a couple of colds in March, he ended up in the wonderful Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children for  days of IV antibiotics to treat a long standing chest infection.During those  days I watched the horrying news that COVID- was spreading. I grew ever more disturbed at the lack of action by the UK Government. How could our amazing health service, stripped bare by  years of austerity and cuts, possibly hold up under the strain of COVID- Lorcaacuten was moved to a room further away from other patients, masks appeared and I watched the eyes of the incredible staff in the hospital become more and more tense.With nearly every death I read that the patient was either elderly or had an underlying health condition. But why did that make it OK: Surely that made it worse  The message seemed to be that lsquoonlyrsquo the vulnerable were at risk but other peoplersquos lsquoonlyrsquo is my everything.As the days in hospital passed, I learned that the lung conditions of my son, mother-in-law, and father put them among the , in NI on the extremely vulnerable list. They would need to lsquoshieldrsquo for the next  weeks. Shielding means not leaving the house at all and having to rely on the government and the goodness of others to deliver medication and food to your door.When Lorcaacuten was able to leave the hospital, we arrived home mdash with great relief mdash to a lockdown. Once again, with no job to go to and my studies on hold, I am transported to those months of isolation three years ago.This time, however, it is dferent, because this time I have hope. For us, this too shall pass. We willto the normality so hard won in our lives. We, unlike so many others who will lose their lives, will have this as a memory to pass on. I let so much of Lorcaacutenrsquos infancy be marred by fear that I just canrsquot let it happen now. Every day I am thankful for my good fortune in a desperately unfair world. I am thankful for all the frontline workers and volunteers, for the Executive finally working together for the common good to sustain us and to protect the most vulnerable in society, for the kindness of people delivering food and medication to those most at risk.I am grateful to the other souls sitting in their homes feeling helpless and feeling like le is passing them by. But by feeling helpless we are helping more people have a le toto after this all ends.It will end but the world will never mdash can never mdash be the same and none of us will look at it in the same way either.Maybe it will be a world in which those who need support will begin to get it, a world in which our NHS will finally be built up rather than worn down, a world we protect rather than profit from. As I watch Lorcaacuten run happily and healthily around our safe home with his little sister, Saorla, I donrsquot feel fear for him. I feel fear for those putting their lives at risk for all of us, for those who will lose their lives and loved ones, and for those who are sitting in their homes feeling afraid.I often think that doing nothing is the hardest thing to do, but for the moment doing otherwise is a risk too great to take, for us all.

Performance of the Oberammergau Passion Play : Freelance“The nd Oberammergau Passion Play will be postponed due to the current situation caused by the corona pandemic.”In the Baian district of Germany, beside the Ammer River and framed by the Ammergau Alps, Oberammergau is a small town known for its woodcarvings, its NATO School and its internationally renowned -yearly Passion Play.The organisers of the Passion Play summarised the historical signicance of the postponement, explaining that the event “goes back to a vow made in . At that time, the people of Oberammergau vowed to perform the suffering, death and resurrection of Christ,no one died of the plague anymore.Engraving depicting the Passion Play in  : Freelance \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Therefore the plans to perform the Passion Play in  are currently beginning.”Held in the ‘decimal year’I attended a performance in , one of the most vivid and moving experiences of my letime, and indeed, I had toyed with the thought of ing this year.There would have been  performancesstarting in mid-May with an expected , visitors from around the globe paying between € to € for a ticket.The enormous production has been running since  except for two cancellations and a postponement.Crucixion scene in the Passion Play in  : FreelanceNearly half of the , residents of today’s Oberammergau are involved with the show - actors, musicians, front of house, backstage and looking after the horses, sheep, goats, cows and doves that add to the often intensely dramatic scenes.The other half of the townsfolk run the restaurants, shops, hotels, BBs and farmsteads where many of the visitors stay,they’re lucky.The nearest accommodation I could get in  was St. Anton am Arlberg in the Austrian Tirol.Participants in the production must have been born in Oberammergau or have lived there for  years.Oberammergau on the River Ammer in  : FreelanceIt’s not unusual for up to four generations of the same family to be taking part in the same run of plays, which can involve around  children on stage at the same time.In the th century, passion plays were held in many parts of Europe, often performed on carts in the street.They re-enacted Christ’s last days, from his entry into Jerusalem to his trial, crucixion, resurrection and ascension.In the bigger and more elaborate productions, when scene one ended the cart trundled off to another part of the town or city and scene two arrived, and so on!They were the ‘poor man’s Bible’ enabling even the most illiterate become familiar with Bible stories.But Oberammergau’s is the only play with its origins in a collective vow to God which has run, almost without a break, for approaching four centuries. This unique double-accolade brought the town a UNESCO World Heritage award.It’s quite likely that passion plays were already common events but a document in Oberammergau’s archives records “the first decades of the th century went by in peaceful calm…but then followed the Thirty Years’ War with all its hardships from  until . As early as , infectious diseases spread in Baia. This village was spared by dutul vigilance until the church festival in , when a man brought the plague into the village.”More than  local folk died and almost every family lost loved ones.“Faced with the great distress that the terrible illness inflicted upon the population,” the archive continues, “the leaders of the community came together and pledged to hold a passion tragedy once every ten years. From this day forward, not a single person perished, even though a great number of them still showed signs of the plague”.They made the pledge in  and the Passion Play was first performed at Pentecost in , on a wooden stage that some say was built on plague-victims’ graves near the church.Surviving documentation from the  production shows that the play ran ‘completed smoothly’ with seating provided ‘for spectators standing close by.’From  the date of the performance was changed to the beginning of each decade, by which time folk were coming from all over Germany to see substantial productions.Paint and painters for the  show’s scenery cost  guilders, ‘the gentlemen trumpeters’ got two guilders and  guilders went ‘to the actors for drink’!There was no performance in  when Maximilian III’s Clerical Council banned all passion plays and when another threat loomed in the s the so-called ‘mad’ King Ludwig II of Baia protected it from those who wanted to close down the ‘harmful’ passion plays. Following WWI the play was postponed until , and there was a special th anniversary show in  attended by Adolf Hitler.There were no performances in  during WWII, just the second cancellation…until now.Plans to perform the Passion Play in  are already under way, for over  five-hour shows, several thousand participants, a -strong orchestra and a -strong choir.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Ok, we have a ided society and all that. But we do have, I think, a much more cohesive society than maybe parts of England.“We have people who are maybe, on all sides, more prone to be looking out for each other... I think they’re maybe more likely to comply with their unusual or unprecedented restrictions on their movements.”He also said that the relative lack of large cities in Northern Ireland “would be a factor certainly”, adding: “You look at where we’re getting the bulk of our cases – they are happening around the predominately urban areas, Belfast in particular.”When it comes to when the current restrictions may be lted, Dr Waldron said: “It’s really, really hard to say. It’s going to be driven by so many things. I think it’s going to last well in to May at least. But what do I know ”What will aid hugely isthe UK gets antibody tests.These screen people to seethey have had Covid-, helping scientists identy those with some degree of immunity and who are no longer infectious.But this is “a way off” yet, said Dr Waldron.And as for a vaccine, that goal remains a “long, long way off”.THE RAW NUMBERS: NI makes up roughly .% of the UK population.But it accounts for only about % of the Covid- deaths in the UK.And as well as a lower death rate than the UK, the number of overall Covid- cases is disproportionately low too.Out of all UK-wide cases, NI made up .% of the total at time of writing yesterday .A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

It will cut planned capital spending to pound million from a budget of pound million and will work to grow online.MS said in a statement: \"Whilst we remain confident that the post-crisis future of the business and our transformation programme remains as strong as ever, trading over the next nine to  months in our clothing and home and international businesses is likely to be severely impacted.\"As a result, it is not possible to provide meaningful guidance on future earnings, although we are taking every step to secure future value for shareholders, colleagues and suppliers.\"The chairman of Wetherspoon has said that a decline in sales was accelerated when prime minister Boris Johnson told people to stay away from pubs.After rising in previous weeks, sales fell by . per cent in the week to March  and the slowdown has picked up further since the Prime Ministers statement, Tim Martin said.It came as the business reported profit before tax rose  per cent to pound. million in the half-year to January  on revenue of pound million.Health secretary Matt Hancock has warned that coronavirus will keep spreading as long as people continue to socialise.Speaking on talkRadio, Mr Hancock said: \"If you stay at home you are saving lives.\"I know, of course, this is a more dangerous disease for older people but not exclusively, some young people get it too.\"But, more importantly, the more that people continue to go out and continue to socialise, the more it will spread and the longer were going to have to keep these measures in place.\"So, were urging people to follow the public health advice.In the emergency Bill thats in front of Parliament right now, we are taking the powers to be able to enforce these measures, so we can make it happen by lawwe need to.\"Id rather not do that and the evidence so far is that the vast majority of people are following the advice, are doing what is sensible and right.\"The company said it was cancelling its interim idend, which had been p a year earlier.Mr Martin said: \"It is obviously very dficult to predict, in these circumstances, how events will unfold in future weeks and months, but we now anticipate profits being below market expectations, so long as the current health scare continues.\"As a result of this uncertainty, it is impossible to provide realistic guidance on our performance in the remainder of the financial year.\"The company has decided to delay most capital projects and to reduce expenditure, where possible, including the cancellation of the interim idend.\"As a result of these actions, combined with the Governments proposals on business rates relief and credit guarantee facilities, the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to maintain operations at a substantially lower level of sales.\"Nicola Sturgeon has urged anyone who left the medical profession in the past three years to consider ing to help the fight against coronavirus.Sharing a plea from Scotlands chief nursing officer Fiona McQueen, the First minister tweeted: \"Scotlands NHS needs our help to meet the #coronavirus challenge.\"Mr Hancock said some retired medics whoto work in the NHS to fight the coronavirus will be able to come \"straight back in\".Asked on the BBCs Breakfast programme when workers couldto the NHS, he said: \"Well, over the next couple of weeks because for some theyll have very recently left and they can come straight back in, their annual trainings been up-to-date and they can just restart.\"Imagineyouve left at Christmas, for instance, you can restart straight away. For others who have been out for a little bit longer, they may need more of a refresher because, of course, its vital that we keep people safe, thats the whole point of the NHS.\"So the letter will go out today, well then be engaging inidually with all those who respond and I very much hope that many, many thousands will respond.\"From those Ive talked to, I think people can see just how important this is. The training will happen for those who need it over the next couple of weeks, at the same time well allocate people to a hospital near them because theres a logistical exercise here as well.\"Mr Hancock suggested that tougher measures could have to be brought inpeople do not follow the Governments advice.He told the BBCs Breakfast programme: \"What I can say is thatpeople follow the advice, stay home which saves lives andthey keep apart from others, more than two metres, more than six foot, then we can tackle this and we can turn the tide.\"The scientists advise that we can turn the tide in  weekspeople follow the advice.\"If people dont follow the advice, then itll be longer and we might have to bring more and tougher measures.\"He added: \"We have brought these measures in earlier than Italy did in terms of where theyre up to with the number of cases.\"But were absolutely clear thatwe need to, we have the powers, in fact weve got a Bill in front of Parliament now to strengthen those powers further.\"But I think its far betterpeople follow the advice.\"The FTSE  has risen by more than five per cent in early trading as travel companies jump out ahead after a bruising few weeks for the sector sparked by the Covid- pandemic.Intercontinental Hotels jumped by about a fth despite revealing that demand for rooms was the worst it had ever seen, as markets opened on Friday.EasyJet also rose by around  per cent and cruise operator Carnival jumped by around . per cent.Meanwhile, the price of a barrel of Brent crude oil joined the rally, rising five per cent to . dollarsafter a massive fall earlier in the week.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has warned about the prospect of a recessionpeople do not receive their wages.Labour has urged the Government to ensure the salaries of workers are protected as businesses lose trade during the coronavirus pandemic.He told the BBCs Breakfast programme: \"We need the Government now to act to protect people to keep them in their jobs.\"In that way, what well be able to do is ensure people have an income coming in, their job will be protected, but we prevent the second wave of a recession hitting uswere not careful.\"Becausepeople lose their jobs, they dont have their wages, demand collapses in the economy and then you really do have a recession.\"The lesson from past crises like these is act fast and act big, so thats why were saying the Government should step in and say to employers, well cover  per cent of your wages, you keep people in work.\"Demand for a room at Intercontinental Hotels has reached its lowest point in history, the group said, as the travel industry continues to be battered by the coronavirus pandemic.The business revealed that it would be cutting costs, eliminating its idend and reducing salaries in a bid to save cash.However, shares in the group, which have been badly hit in recent months, jumped by around  per cent on market open in London as investors reacted positively to the companys proposals.Chief executive Keith Barr said: \"Demand for hotels is currently at the lowest levels weve ever seen.Intercontinental Hotel Group has a robust business model and the measures we are announcing today to reduce costs and preserve cash give us the capacity to manage the business through this unique environment and to support our owners during this incredibly dficult time.\"These were not easy choices and we are mindful of the impact these decisions will have on our colleagues and shareholders.\"However, we believe that these are essential to ensuring that we come out of this as strong as we possibly can and ready to capitalise on what remains an industry with excellent long-term growth potential.\"Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders , said the list of key workers to whom schools will remain open is \"perhaps more extensive than we might have expected\".He said: \"Realistically, theywill need to identy these children by lunchtime.\"Mr Barton added: \"We already know from the trajectory of this that were not going to have many staff.\"We have to be careful that the message to parents is not business as usual.\"Matt Hancock said that a communication will be sent to around . million people who are classed as vulnerable to set out specic action for them to take.The Health secretary told Sky News: \"The first thing were going to do is set out exactly what conditions that applies to.\"We expect about . million people to then get a communication from the NHS to say that they are part of this and what they need to do.\"Many of these people have pre-existing health conditions and so will be very worried right now, and I understand that, and theyll need very specic sets of action - for instance, how do you go about still getting your chemoyou have cancer whilst also social-distancing \"If you have cancer its particularly important to stay away from other people, but you also of course have got to keep going with your chemotherapy.\"He added: \"These are some of the most dficult and challenging cases so well be getting in contact with them, butpeople think that they are on this list and dont receive a communication from the NHS, then they also need to get in contact.\"So that is under way, the money was announced for it yesterday.\"A combination of money to the NHS and money to councils because theyve got a very big part to play in keeping people safe.\"ASCL general secretary Geoff Barton said schools will have first worked to identy vulnerable children, as they will know who they are, and will then be looking at the \"key worker\" category.He said the ASCL is telling members: \"You have to do your best to negotiate the key workers list. Youre doing this to a tight timescale, and what you offer children on Monday may be dferent to what you offer next Wednesday.\"Mr Barton said that initially, schools will be doing all they can so that pupils who need to can still turn up to their own school after the weekend.In the longer term, there will be more strategic planning of school provision, he added.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers , said: \"The Government has made clear that every child who can be safely cared for at home should be. And their advice makes clear too that this applies to children of key workers.\"For the vast majority of children and young people, school buildings will close tonight and not reopen for the foreseeable future.\"Taking up a place at school during this time of wider closure is the offer of last resort, for the minority of key workers, who have no alternative.\"School leaders have many questions that remain unanswered about how this will work in practice. We will continue to work with the Government throughout the day to provide greater clarity to schools to enable this reduced offer to be up and running as soon as possible.\"Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, added her voice to calls from school leaders urging parents to only send their children in as a last resort.She said: \"This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending. This will not achieve the goal of slowing the spread of the virus.\"So it is vitally important that parents follow government advice to keep their children at home, wherever possible. Schools can only accommodate a limited number of children and the fewer children making the journey to school, and the fewer children in educational settings, the lower the risk that the virus can spread.\"The competition watchdog has launched a taskforce to tackle businesses looking to exploit the coronavirus outbreak to take advantage of customers.The Competition and Markets Authoritysaid the outbreak has prompted concerns that people could be exploited by companies \"charging excessive prices or making misleading claims about their products\".It said it has already contacted traders and s over excessive pricing of hand sanitiser as part of its efforts.Andrea Coscelli, the CMAs chief executive, said: \"This is obviously a time when we all have to behave responsibly to protect our fellow citizens, and particularly those who are most vulnerable.\"We urge retailers to behave responsibly in the exceptional circumstances of the Covid- outbreak.\"Butthey do not, our taskforce is monitoring market developments to enable us to intervene as quickly as possible.\"We have a range of options at our disposal, from warnings to enforcement action to seeking emergency powers.\"The ceremonial of the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace, St Jamess Palace and Windsor Castle is being postponed until further notice \"in line with Government advice to avoid mass gatherings\", Buckingham Palace has announced.The palace said in a statement that the situation would be \"reviewed on an ongoing basis, with a view to restarting when appropriate\". article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Providing that people continue to be generous then there wonrsquot be a problem.As increasing numbers of people self-isolate to protect themselves from the virus, Claire said that the food bank was able to offer deliveriesnecessary.ldquoWe are a very open foodbank. If yoursquove got a need, just ask and we can do our best, said Claire.After the Church in Wales announced the suspension of public acts of worship, the Tabernacle and other churches in Penarth have been finding innovative ways to support their congregation.ldquoFrom this weekend we are going to be streaming virtual services, said Clair.ldquoOur musicians are recording pieces in their homes which will be shared online.ldquoAll our small groups meet on Zoom so wersquore in touch with our congregation.ldquoThe more elderly congregations are keeping in touch by phone and telephone to support them in every way ndash spiritually, emotionally and practically.ldquoThe epidemic is pulling everybody together and cutting across denominational boundaries.The Tabernacle Foodbank is open for donations and collections between am and pm Monday to Friday.You can also deliver donations to their collection point in Sainsburyrsquos on Windsor Road.The foodbank would particularly welcome tinned products, including curry, chilli, corned beef, and potatoes.For more information, visit: Info@tabspenarth or call:  . article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves.

I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
