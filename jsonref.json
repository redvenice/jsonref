Priest Father Martin Magill told mourners: \u0027I commend our political leaders for standing together. Why in God\u0027s name does it take the death of a 29-year-old woman with her whole life in front of her?\u0027\u0027Since Lyra\u0027s death, communities across Northern Ireland and the political spectrum have come together, united in condemnation at this murderous act.\u0027They have delivered a clear message - the people responsible for this act of terrorism have absolutely nothing to offer Northern Ireland and have no place in society.\u0027She added: \u0027Lyra symbolised the new Northern Ireland and her tragic death cannot be in vain.\u0027All of us must take inspiration from what Lyra achieved in her life and work even harder to make Northern Ireland a brighter, more peaceful and prosperous place for everyone.\u0027Mr Coveney said: \u0027This can be done. When you think about the agreement that was made 21 years ago and the obstacles they needed to overcome then, the challenges we face today pale into the background in comparison.\u0027Yes, we have difficult choices to make. The polarisation of politics in Northern Ireland, particularly in the last 12 months, poses real challenges. There are trust issues - let\u0027s not pretend there isn\u0027t - and we will have to try to overcome them.\u0027But having spoken to all the parties in the last few days, I believe there is an appetite to try and I can tell you the two governments are determined to assist that process in a way that will get it across the line.\u0027Mr Coveney said the governments had deliberately not set a deadline for the completion of talks, as this would not be \u0027helpful\u0027.He said: \u0027Time is short here and we will need to make this process work within weeks, rather than months.\u0027He said that it was hoped that progress will have been made by the time of the planned review at the end of May and that \u0027hopefully shortly after that we can find agreement\u0027.         Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney and Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley spoke in Belfats today and Ms Bradley said: \u0027Lyra symbolised the new Northern Ireland, and her tragic death cannot be in vain\u0027         DUP leader Arlene Foster and Sinn Fein\u0027s leader Mary Lou McDonald were among those giving a standing ovation to priest Father Martin Magill who questioned why it took a tragedy such as this to bring political leaders togetherMost of Northern Ireland\u0027s paramilitary groups have disarmed since a 1998 peace accord ended three decades of sectarian conflict. But a small number of dissidents refused to abandon violence, and have targeted police and prison officials in bombings and shootings.Security officials have repeatedly warned that political drift in Northern Ireland - along with uncertainty around Brexit - could embolden those bent on reviving violence.Arlene Foster yesterday denied Miss McKee was murdered because of the \u0027political vacuum\u0027 in Northern Ireland.The DUP leader looked uncomfortable as Mrs Foster sat next to Sinn Fein leaders Michelle O\u0027Neill and Mary Lou McDonald at the Protestant St Anne\u0027s Cathedral in Belfast, and they were also forced to stand and clap. Father Martin Magill received a spontaneous standing ovation as he called her senseless killing a \u0027huge injustice\u0027 and said he \u0027dared to hope\u0027 something so awful as Lyra\u0027s murder could be a \u0027doorway to a new beginning\u0027.Mrs Foster said today \u0027I don\u0027t accept that the violence that caused Lyra\u0027s death was caused by a political vacuum. It was caused by people who wanted to use violence to further their own warped political agenda. That\u0027s why Lyra is dead\u0027.  She also said she sympathised with Lyra McKee\u0027s partner, but said the party\u0027s stance on gay marriage will not change. She told RTÉ\u0027s Morning Ireland: \u0027We have a long standing policy which hasn\u0027t changed. That remains the position of the party.\u0027That doesn\u0027t mean I cannot sympathise and empathise with Sara and say to her that we feel her love. Her loss was all of our loss because this was a young woman who was doing great things in journalism and living her life in a city that she adopted.\u0027You shouldn\u0027t conflate the two issues of empathy and sympathy and a political issue which is the definition of marriage.\u0027Father Martin Magill said yesterday he \u0027dared to hope\u0027 something so awful as Lyra\u0027s murder could be a \u0027doorway to a new beginning\u0027.He said: \u0027Since Thursday night we have seen the coming together of many people in various places and the unifying of the community against violence. I commend our political leaders for standing together in Creggan on Good Friday.\u0027He then added: \u0027I am, however, left with a question: \u0027Why in God\u0027s name does it take the death of a 29-year-old woman with her whole life in front of her to get us to this point?\u0027Miss McKee was gunned down while observing rioting in Londonderry. She was standing next to a police patrol when she was struck by a bullet. The New IRA terrorist group has confessed that its members killed her.Yesterday\u0027s congregation included politicians from across Ireland\u0027s political ide, including the heads of Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionist Party, whose power-sharing deal has broken down, leaving Northern Ireland without a working government. Miss McKee\u0027s family – who are Catholic – said they chose the cathedral for the funeral because of its reputation as a \u0027shared space\u0027 in the ided city.Theresa May, who missed Prime Minister\u0027s Questions to attend the two-hour service, sat in the front row on one side of the cathedral, flanked by Irish president Michael D Higgins and Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar. Jeremy Corbyn sat a couple of rows behind.Father Magill also called on Miss McKee\u0027s murderers to follow her example of \u0027the pen is mightier than the sword\u0027.He quoted a friend of Miss McKee\u0027s who said: \u0027We have had enough. There is a younger generation coming up in the town and they don\u0027t need guns put in their hands. They need jobs, they need a better health service and education. They need a life.\u0027 As the 1,000-strong congregation broke into applause, Father Magill addressed her killers, saying: \u0027I plead with you to take the road of non-violence to achieve your political ends.\u0027         Theresa May, Ireland\u0027s Prime Minister Leo Varadkar (right) and Britain\u0027s Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Karen Bradley attend the funeral of journalist Lyra McKee         Miss McKee\u0027s partner Sara Canning, 35, cries at the service of thanksgiving for the life of the 29-year-old journalist.

They were joined by other relatives including Miss McKee\u0027s great-niece Ava, four, and the partner she had hoped to marry – Sara Canning, 35. Mrs Corner told the congregation how the death of \u0027our wee Lyra\u0027, the youngest of the six siblings, will leave an \u0027unfillable hole in our mum\u0027s life\u0027.But she hoped her sister\u0027s lasting legacy would lead to people trying to create a world where \u0027labels are meaningless\u0027, where \u0027every single person is valued\u0027 and \u0027where every single child gets the chance to grow up and to make their dreams come true\u0027.Quoting Miss McKee herself, Mrs Corner said: \u0027We must change our own world one piece at a time. Now let\u0027s get to work.\u0027Many friends of Miss McKee, who was a campaigner for LGBT rights, wore Harry Potter-themed T-shirts, scarves and badges to the service in honour of her lifelong love of JK Rowling\u0027s books.Outside, a crowd of several hundred people applauded as it was driven away for a private burial in a hearse with rainbow-coloured flowers on its roof which spelled out the words \u0027Team Lyra\u0027. "},{"url":null,"title":"Barbara Windsor says truly overwhelmed thanks public 100 000 donations","story":"Share this article She said: \u0027I am truly overwhelmed by the generosity of the British public in helping Barbara\u0027s Revolutionaries raise a staggering £100,000 towards the Dementia Revolution so far.\u0027I am so touched that Scott and the rest of the wonderful team of Barbara\u0027s Revolutionaries have taken on this marathon challenge for me and the 850,000 people living with dementia.\u0027I\u0027m heartened by every single donation that has been made - however big or small.

Then she stopped and looked up at me, puzzled. She had detected something odd, but wasn’t sure what. All I could see were dead leaves. Then she started digging, raking up the soil around her and thrusting her nose into the deepening hole. I watched with amusement and interest, until her muddy head emerged with a grubby velvet bag between her teeth.It was about the size of a hot water bottle — and, inside, I found a collection of jewellery, including necklaces, rings and bracelets. We handed it in to the police.Before we could resume our search, the phone rang. Cola had returned home on his own, filthy and exhausted, but otherwise none the worse for wear.In Brixton, South London, Molly came up against a problem during her search for a marmalade cat called Columbus, who had gone exploring and not come back.Columbus was not an ‘only cat’ — he shared a family home with three other felines, which meant getting a fur sample that was exclusively his proved difficult.We did our best, though, and set off in search.The neighbouring streets were a warren of houses and shops, yards and lock-up businesses, with criss-crossing roads and a railway line. This was going to be quite a challenge.However, we hit a promising lead when, after two hours, we visited a care home for senior citizens. Molly became animated as we walked up the driveway. I approached a nurse who, as luck would have it, was a cat-lover and invited us to search the grounds.While we were looking, I met Gracie, a tiny woman with white hair, a beret that matched her purple coat and spectacles with lenses so thick they gave her an almost cartoonish look.          The old methods of detective work are still the best. Nothing beats house-to-house inquiries for collecting clues and local information. But, these days, the reaction I get on the doorstep is a bit different from that of my days in the policeShe immediately took to Molly and explained that, because the residents were not allowed pets, she had started putting out cat food for the foxes and hedgehogs.As we chatted, Molly suddenly shot to the end of the garden and started to snuffle feverishly around a hole in a fence panel. Moving closer, I could see wisps of ginger hair on the splintered wood.We could safely say Columbus woz ’ere.I asked Gracie if she would mind keeping an eye out that evening and was somewhat taken aback to see her eyes filling with tears.‘How very kind of you to ask,’ she said. ‘It’s nice to feel wanted, for a change. You tend to feel a bit invisible when you get past 90.’At around 9.45 that evening, a tired and hungry marmalade cat crept through the hole in the fence, padded over to the plate of whitebait left out for him by Gracie and began to gobble it up.At the same time, the elderly lady sitting by her bedroom window squinted through her spectacles and picked up the phone. She dialled the number on the note she clutched in her hand.A couple of days later, I had a call from the nurse who had allowed me to search the gardens. ‘I must tell you about Gracie,’ she said with a chuckle.‘She’s been so happy since her adventure.

Developer Kieran Gannon’s Scanron is in the process of building an estate of luxury houses called Daneswell, costing up to €1.25 million, on the site of the former Smurfit printworks on Botanic Road.Permission was previously refused for six-storey apartment blocks on the site, but the new application follows the removal last December by Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy of the cap on building heights in the city. If the nine- floor block is approved it would be one storey taller than the nearby Phibsborough shopping centre tower.The existing planning permission for the site, which remains live, was granted in 2016, before the introduction of the fast-track scheme that allows applications for more than 100 homes, or blocks of 200 student bed spaces, to be made directly to An Bord Pleanála.Excessive heightThe 2016 permission allows 43 houses and 76 apartments in blocks up to four storeys tall. Permission for a larger scheme of 147 homes including 66 houses, 14 duplexes, and 67 apartments up to six storeys tall was refused in 2014 on the grounds of its excessive height. The new proposal would almost triple the number of homes permitted from 119 to 334.Dublin city councillors have described the application to change the development as “monstrous” and “greedy”.Independent councillor Cieran Perry said the change was not a move to provide more homes, but was in fact delaying the provision of homes.“This is a prime example of Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy’s interference in the planning legislation and system, causing a delay in actually building of homes for people. There was planning permission on the site for a significant amount of units now we’re back to square one because of the Minister interfering and facilitating developers’ greed.”OverbearingLabour councillor Áine Clancy said while there was clearly a need for housing in the area, the size and scale of the proposal would be overbearing on both the houses under construction in the scheme and existing homes on Iona Road and other surrounding roads.“I believe the heights previously approved for the site should be the maximum in this particular location.”People Before Profit councillor Andrew Keegan said a development of 299 apartments, all but nine of which are one- or two-beds, was designed for a “vulture-fund” sell-off. “This will be bought up by a vulture fund and the whole development will be for rent, that’s why they have all the one beds.” ‘Dangerous precedent’Sinn Féin’s Séamas McGrattan said the proposal sets “a dangerous precedent in other areas of the city”.The application states the site is “sufficiently large to accommodate a well-designed higher-density residential development without giving rise to any adverse impacts on existing residential amenities”. The proposal to increase heights would deliver more homes and was in keeping with national policies, it said.The council has until the end of this month to make a submission on the plans to An bord Pleanála."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Historian Marisa McGlinchey on death of Lyra McKee and state of dissident republicanismVaradkar, May announce negotiations to restart Stormont will begin on May 7thPriest who spoke at Lyra McKee\u0026rsquos funeral urged politicians to take example from her \u0026lsquodetermined doggedness\u0026rsquoIncrease in cannabis, cocaine, heroin seizures shows role of internet in narcotics tradeGovernment wants to increase number of medical specialists in public hospitalsTeenager was subject of care order in 2012 following violent attack on her motherDeveloper Kieran Gannon wants to stop existing scheme and build taller blocksUS has been lobbying allies to ban Huawei equipment from telecoms infrastructureHighest level of weather warning has led to flights and ferry sailings being cancelledESB, Garda, road and water safety agencies advise people to batten down the hatchesLyra McKee\u0026rsquos death \u0026lsquocannot be in vain\u0026rsquo, Northern Secretary Karen Bradley saysGarda search, assisted by Defence Forces, targeted feuding gangs in Corduff areaTreated sewage effluent is currently discharged into the bay at an outfall in PoolbegFour consultants reported dead bodies had been left lying on trolleys at UHWAshbourne parents forced to travel to Louth or Dublin to find schools with spare capacityWorking farm gives Dubliners chance to learn about raising animals and growing food\u0026euro3.1 million recovered in unpaid wages by WRC in 2018, up 75 per cent on previous yearTory\u0026rsquos biggest employer, \u0026Oacutestan Th\u0026oacuteraigh has been at centre of island life since late 1800sSherry FitzGerald London Property Show demonstrates the \u0026lsquorevival\u0026rsquo of regional IrelandWarning that the environmental impact of climate change could lead to a public health crisis in Ireland"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3872925.1556295878!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"people looking to come home to ireland cannot afford dublin","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Nicola Dunne, who works in London, is contemplating a return to her native Mayo.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Worcester-born Tom Wesley, 31, had been looking for an excuse to leave London when his Irish-born partner  got a new job in Ireland.Nicola Dunne is not tired of London, but there are days when it is exhausting. Like many others attending a London property show this week for those thinking of moving back to Ireland, she is contemplating a return.However, she is torn. “There is the worry that I will move back home and think what have I done. But then London has a bit of an expiry date on it. It’s just so draining,” she said.If she does come back, the Mayo-born Dunne, like others present at the invite-only Sherry FitzGerald London Property Show, is not thinking about living in Dublin, put off by the thought of paying high rents.From Mayo Abbey near Claremorris, Dunne moved to Leeds in 2008 before moving down to London eight years ago, working first for ITV News and now as a freelance stylist.“London is extortionate to live in and you get to a point where paying so much money for an apartment is just depressing. Dublin wouldn’t be any different,” she said.Saying she feels “like a Londoner”, Dunne is tempted by the slower pace Mayo could offer: “Whenever I go home I feel so relaxed and all I want to do is stay. Then I arrive back in London and the buzz is amazing.”Despite predictions that Brexit will increase demand in stock, the focus at the exhibition was on properties outside the capital, with sellers hoping to demonstrate the “revival” of regional Ireland.Des O’Malley, head of countrywide at Sherry FitzGerald, said more and more people were looking outside of Dublin, given prices in the capital: “Many people come over and look at Dublin.BrexitBrexit was an issue, but not overwhelmingly so, he said. “The underpinnings of the property market are very strong in the medium to long term. Unless there is a dramatic hard Brexit, we don’t expect any more price shifts.”Worcester-born Tom Wesley, 31, had been looking for an excuse to leave London. Then his Irish-born partner got a job in Ireland. One of his chief motivations for leaving is the “endless talk” about Brexit.“Honestly, I’m just so sick of hearing about Brexit. I could not care less any more,” says the civil engineer. “It does make me feel a bit embarrassed being from England. I have started looking for jobs, but not seriously yet.”Waterford native, 37-year-old John, no surname given, who has been in London for almost a decade, will move back home to his native county in July. “I had been looking to move out of London for a while,” he said, “There is definitely a pull home. Being from the countryside, I miss that element and London is just so busy. And then, of course, Brexit has given me an extra push.”But he will not be coming home alone, since he will be arriving back with his Portuguese boyfriend, Goncalo Gomes, 31, who will need to learn Irish if he is to continue his career as a primary school teacher.“We will be heading to the shops and the pub in the Gaeltacht, which is only up the road,” said Gomes, “We don’t want to live in the craziness of London any more. We want to visit crazy and then go home to our nice lives.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3873098.1556305094!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the new ira s actions are not a consequence of the north s political vacuum","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNorthern Irish Democratic Unionist Party  leader Arlene Foster (left) with Sinn Féin’s Mary Lou McDonald and Michelle O’Neill at the funeral service for  Lyra McKee in Belfast. Photograph: Charles McQuillanPoolReutersFather Martin McGill’s words to the politicians gathered in front of him, including Sinn Féin’s Mary Lou McDonald and the Democratic Unionist Party’s Arlene Foster, in St Anne’s Cathedral in Belfast have gone around the world.They were a clarion call in the wake of the brutal killing of 29-year-old journalist, Lyra McKee, provoking spontaneous applause and a standing ovation from the congregation including, awkwardly, the politicians.The absence of a functioning Stormont government in Northern Ireland has contributed to polarisation and diminished community relations, but the actions of the New IRA are not a consequence of the political vacuum.Nor is the escalation of activity by the New IRA a consequence of Brexit, as it made clear after a bombing attack in Derry in January, which could have killed and maimed.Then, the New IRA declared that all the talk of “hard” or “soft” borders had, or will have no bearing on their actions. Instead, they intend to pursue the traditional republican campaign for unity and independence.However, Brexit and Northern Ireland’s political vacuum are seen as opportunities to be exploited by republican groups who have described the collapse of Stormont as evidence that Northern Ireland is a failed state.The New IRASignificantly, the New IRA rejects being called the New IRA. Instead the organisation simply refers to itself as the IRA, insisting that it is anything but new. Equally, they bridle at being called dissidents.Rather, the organisation is keen to stress the continuity of the republican armed campaign, drawing its lineage like other republican groups back to 1916 and 1798.The New IRA has been more active than people may realise. From March 2018 until February of this year, it tried to carry out 15 bombings and 37 shootings, and killed two prison officers.In turn, the Police Service of Northern Ireland seized 45 of its weapons, 1.3kg of its explosive cache, and 3,333 rounds of ammunition in a number of operations.Though numerically small, it has support in Derry, parts of Belfast, Strabane and north Armagh, though, together with other groups, it commands a minority of support amongst nationalists.Saoradh, seen as the New IRA’s political arm, does not contest elections. During elections in 2016, it urged people to “vote with their feet” and stay at home, arguing that voting confers legitimacy on partition, north, or south.On Easter Saturday, Ardoyne’s Dee Fennell, who gave the Saoradh address at their Dublin commemoration, said Belfast IRA member, Tom Williams, executed in Belfast in 1942, “didn’t have electoral strength behind him”.“The Border campaign didn’t have electoral strength. The IRA in the 1930s when they were being executed didn’t have electoral strength. But their cause was no less legitimate,” he claimed.Similarly, Nathan Hastings, a former Saoradh prisoner in Maghaberry, has insisted that his “legitimacy comes from the illegitimacy of the British occupation in Ireland”.“As long as the British occupy Ireland there will be men and women who will resist them. It doesn’t matter what I think. This will be the case,” said Hastings, who was given 10 years for trying to ship arms across the Border.Collectively, dissidents, even though they reject the term, are united around the right to Irish sovereignty. However, they encompass a wide spectrum of opinion and are ided tactically on how that right should be exercised.Sinn FéinSome unreservedly support violence. Others are strongly opposed. Some do not support any of the armed groups that currently exist. However, they unite in their view that Sinn Féin has gone in the wrong direction since the 1990s.Prominent republican, Tommy McKearney says: “Sinn Féin has bought into the settlement. As it stands they are bound by the prevailing winds from London.“Their economic strategy is merely the administration of, at best, the tinkering with the decisions of London,” said McKearney, who argues that Sinn Féin has moved away from its traditional republican base.The killing of McKee provoked widespread condemnation and revulsion across the island, and beyond but it did so, too, amongst prominent “dissident” republicans, including Councillor Gary Donnelly in Derry.The Omagh bombing which killed 29 people in 1998 was carried out by the Real IRA. After the bombing the Real IRA, and its political wing the 32 County Sovereignty Movement (32CSM) never fully recovered.The honorary president of the 32CSM Phil O’Donoghue stated “that it was the first time I ever considered quitting”. The level of revulsion over McKee’s killing is so deep that it remains to be seen if Saoradh will sustain.There was also widespread condemnation, including within republican circles, of the Saoradh statement on the killing which described it as an accident while a republican volunteer was firing at the police.Saoradh cancelled its planned commemoration in Derry on Easter Monday, but it went ahead with its one in Dublin, with 200 people attending. Despite the revulsion, it is probable that the New IRA will continue with its campaign.If you stand at republican commemorations held by Saoradh, 32CSM, republican Sinn Féin or other groups throughout Ireland the traditional message articulated is one that could have been heard from Sinn Féin and the Provisional movement in the 1970s and 1980s.Sinn Féin’s transformation into a constitutional nationalist party has led to “dissidents” arguing that it is Sinn Féin who have dissented from traditional republicanism, not the other way round.Many “dissident” republicans are former members of Sinn Féin or the Provisional IRA. Many of those I interviewed for Unfinished Business were active in republicanism even before the Provisionals were founded in 1969.A central point of contestation between the “Provisional” and “dissident” worlds is the raison d’être for the Provisional IRA campaign.Danny Morrison, former director of publicity for Sinn Féin has stated: “To me our mandate was the sense of oppression, physically, that we lived under, the conditions that we lived under, and they – and they alone – justified armed struggle and that was our position. Not this other theological position which a lot of the older people were burdened with.”However, the New IRA reject this argument, asserting that the Belfast Agreement and altered structural conditions within the state of Northern Ireland do not alter anything for ideologically motivated republicans.Bernadette Sands-McKevitt, a founder member of the 32CSM and sister of hunger-striker Bobby Sands, famously stated that her brother “did not die for cross-border bodies with executive powers. He did not die for nationalists to be equal British citizens within the Northern Ireland state.”Jim McCrystal, an independent republican in Lurgan, and a former PIRA prisoner, argues that a mandate exists for “as long as the Brits are here in your country”.Belfast Republican Kevin Hannaway, a first cousin of Gerry Adams, argues: “The present leadership of Sinn Féin – if they were out for an Irish Republic,they failed. If they were out for civil rights, they got it in 1973. So what the f**king hell was the other 30 years of war for?”Unfinished Business: The Politics of ‘Dissident’ Irish Republicanism, by Marisa McGlinchey is published by Manchester University Press"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3873015.1556300741!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland only country in eu with no mechanism to discipline judges survey","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Irish legal system is close to the bottom of several EU league tables of indicators of government commitment to the legal system.Ireland is alone in the EU in having no mechanism for disciplining judges and has the third-lowest number of women judges in the lower and middle tier of courts, according to a new EU Commission report. Although the report shows Ireland’s courts and judges enjoy among the highest levels of public confidence in Europe, it finds the Irish legal system close to the bottom of several EU league tables of indicators of government commitment to the legal system.The report shows Ireland has the third-lowest expenditure on the courts as a share of GDP (0.2 per cent, a third of Bulgaria’s), the lowest but one number of judges (3.33 per 100,000 population, compared with 43 in Croatia), and the third-lowest number of women judges in the lower and middle tier of courts (38 and 20 per cent respectively).Ireland, however, records a one-third increase in per capita spending on the courts since 2010. And the number of Irish lawyers, at 262 per 100,000 population, sits squarely in the European median between Cyprus (443) and Sweden (58).But the report, the EU Commission’s annual comparative Justice Scoreboard published on Friday, shows that public perceptions in Ireland of the independence of the judiciary at 64 per cent (fairly good and very good) rank the country eight percentage points higher than the EU average and fifth in the EU league table.Of those, 83 per cent say they believe the status and position of judges guarantee their independence. Only 13 per cent say they are concerned over political or government interference.Public trustLevels of public trust in judicial independence throughout the EU vary from 18 per cent in Croatia to 87 per cent in Denmark, according to the accompanying Eurobarometer poll.In Hungary and Poland, where populist authoritarian governments with strong electoral support have been accused of eroding the independence of judges, citizens appear to share significant concerns about the measures their governments have been taking to politicise their judicial system.\u0026nbspIn Poland, the subject of EU Commission Article 7 proceedings for rule-of-law breaches, only one in two of those polled had faith in their courts’ independence, with 72 per cent of those without faith blaming government or political interference. In Hungary, also in the Article 7 process, only 43 per cent profess to be unconcerned, with four out of five of those worried, blaming political interference.Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova told journalists that the scoreboard was an important part of the commission’s toolbox of rule-of-law measures, not so much “a ranking, as a guide”, a benchmarking aid to reform. She warned that “challenges to the rule of law are mounting” and insisted that they were a fundamental threat to the European legal order which was based on mutual trust between its various jurisdictions.The commissioner said the survey did show some progress in the efficiency of the courts and the quality of their decisions. Among the specific issues raised by her were improved facilities for children and victims of gender-based violence, and increased transparency through the use of digital reports.There have been significant improvements in the time taken to process cases, though Italy was singled out with the higher courts taking on average 1,299 days to resolve cases. It also has by far the highest number of pending civil and commercial cases at 3.9 per 100 inhabitants (Finland: 0.1) .In EU trademark law the average length of time to resolve cases ranged from 108 days in Malta to 941 in Slovakia (just behind Ireland’s 841).

Early childhood is a period of rapid physical and cognitive development and a time during which a child\u0027s habits are formed.The recommendations go much further than recent guidance from the UK\u0027s chief medical officers.This recommended a break from screens every two hours for all children. It also said phones should be banned from meal times and overnight. At a glance | WHO guidelines on physical activity for childrenThe guidance, which will be launched at the European Congress on Obesity in Glasgow this weekend sets out different advice for children of different ages, up to the age of five. It stresses the importance of avoiding sedentary screen time, in a bid to ensure children get sufficient exercise. One in five children in England are overweight or obese by the time they start primary school, rising to one in three by the time they leave. But some experts said parents were being given conflicting advice based on limited evidence. In January the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health shied away from recommending a limit, but said children should not be exposed to screens for at least an hour before bedtime. Tim Smith, Reader in Cognitive Psychology, Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development, Birkbeck, University of London, said: “In recent months UK parents of 0- to five-year-olds and early-years practitioners have been bombarded with conflicting recommendations and guidelines about how and whether they should be managing their children\u0027s screen time and sedentary behaviour, e.g. from the RCPCH and Chief Medical Officers.“The release of new WHO guidelines does not help to clarify the situation, as its specific recommendations with regards to \u0027sedentary screen time\u0027 and their negative impacts on physical, cognitive and psychosocial health are, by its own admission based on \u0027moderate to very low-quality evidence\u0027.Duty of Care CampaignComment: Is this feast of fruitcakes really the future of British politics? Comment: In an age of censorship, even innocent pleasures can feel subversiveComment: The Conservatives may not survive the most lethal existential crisis in their historyUK weather: Storm Hannah leaves thousands without power amid 80mph winds, heavy rain and plunging temperaturesInsults, death threats and suspicious packages...

They included a burn bag for getting rid of secret documents, an Arabic notebook, a wig, foreign bank notes and a container marked TOP SECRET PULP. The public were invited to decipher the meaning of the items.Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, has over one billion users, It is perhaps best known for celebrities sharing red carpet snaps, and beach holiday selfies.The most followed Instagrammers in the world include Kim Kardashian, Beyonce, Ariana Grande, and footballer Cristiano Ronaldo, each of whom have over 100 million followers.CIA\u0026#039s cryptic first instagram postThe CIA decided to take to Instagram as part of a recruiting effort, hoping to attract a younger generation of agents and analysts.A spokesman said: We\u0027re looking to spark the curiosity of Instagram\u0027s users about the many ways CIA\u0027s global mission has us going where others cannot go, and doing what others cannot do.Joining Instagram is another way we\u0027re sharing stories and recruiting talented Americans to serve. Through the Instagram account we\u0027ll give a peek into agency life, but we can\u0027t promise any selfies from secret locations.The desk photograph immediately sent amateur sleuths on Instagram into a frenzy.Most quickly picked up the symbolism of a clock showing the time at 8:46 a.m - the moment the first plane hit the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001.Hanging from the chair is a security badge, which, on closer inspection, carries an old photograph of Gina Haspel, the current CIA Director.As social media networks have proliferated in recent years intelligence agencies have faced a mounting challenge in how to deal with them.The networks have been used by criminals and terrorists to communicate, and by foreign powers to undermine elections.The Internet Research Agency, the Kremlin-linked Russian troll farm in St Petersburg, launched a vast campaign on Instagram targeting the 2016 US presidential election, operating fake accounts with hundreds of thousands of followers.While it has become a source of intelligence the CIA and other agencies have faced a dilemma over whether to create their own Instagram accounts, balancing the boosting of their public profile against the need for secrecy.In 2014 the CIA did take the decision to join Facebook and Twitter. It\u0027s first tweet read: We can neither confirm nor deny that this is our first tweet. That account now has 2.6 million followers.The CIA Instagram account quickly amassed tens of thousands of followers and attracted a flood of replies.Many praised the CIA for its work, while others were critical of the agency and its techniques. There were replies in numerous languages, including Russian.The account did not list any others that the CIA was itself following. One Instagram users wrote: Don\u0027t believe that, they\u0027re following everyone.A spokesman for Instagram said: Our team worked with the CIA, as they do with many partners, to provide best practices and guidance when it comes to launching an Instagram account.The FBI is already on Instagram, posting photographs including agents undergoing weapons training. The US Secret Service also shares images of its canine contingent, and the US Transportation Security Administration publishes pictures of objects they have confiscated from passengers at airports.Please review our commenting policyComment: Is this feast of fruitcakes really the future of British politics? Comment: In an age of censorship, even innocent pleasures can feel subversiveComment: The Conservatives may not survive the most lethal existential crisis in their historyUK weather: Storm Hannah leaves thousands without power amid 80mph winds, heavy rain and plunging temperaturesInsults, death threats and suspicious packages...

I think it is sexist as being male is the default and women have to put up with it. It isn’t ever the other way around. T-shirts are trivial but it’s another side of the same issue of the world being designed around men. If organisers want to increase the amount of participation and make women feel more welcomed this would be a good way to do it.”With such a high rate of female participation in the event, which began in 1981, there are questions as to why the t-shirts have not become more representative of the body shapes of different women.Although female sport attire has traditionally been variations of the uniforms made for men, there have been recent moves to provide more bespoke outfits.Nike has announced the new football kits made for the 14 national teams ahead of this year’s FIFA Women’s World Cup in France will be especially designed for the women’s team for the first time.But many feel like not enough is being done by major UK marathon competitions to ensure gender equality at their races.Heather Castle, a 38-year-old from Lee, South-East London, has been running for 7 years and has completed the London Marathon twice before.She said: “Men aren’t made to wear women\u0027s t-shirts so I don’t get how in 2019 that we are still being made to wear mens t-shirts. I have altered a few of my race t-shirts because I work in theatre so I know how to use a sewing machine. It makes you feel like you are not really supposed to be there and not a member of the community. We run equal distances and there a lot of fast women out there but it still feels like we are not supposed to be here.“I am sure we are close to 50:50 participation- it’s not like we are only 5 per cent of the runners.  Every year previously the finisher t-shirt has always been the new balance unisex one that has been given out. I haven\u0027t heard anything about it being different to what it usually is this year. There is no fit to them and they usually have much longer sleeves which causes its own problems when it’s baggy under the arm, which traps a lot of heat so it\u0027s not particularly comfortable to run in. Some women have stopped taking the t-shirt when they see unisex because they know it doesn’t fit.”London marathon 2019 - the routeThe London Marathon organisers were asked to provide details for the t-shirt designs for this years competition but said they wanted to leave it as a surprise.A spokesperson said: “We have sizes XXS - XXL at the finish. Runners select the size they want and if they want to exchange after they get home they can contact us and we will endeavour to help.”Comment: Is this feast of fruitcakes really the future of British politics? Comment: In an age of censorship, even innocent pleasures can feel subversiveComment: The Conservatives may not survive the most lethal existential crisis in their historyUK weather: Storm Hannah leaves thousands without power amid 80mph winds, heavy rain and plunging temperaturesInsults, death threats and suspicious packages...

It\u0027s time to consider a change in approachClick to followThe IndependentHMRC has been given extra resources to tackle non payment of the minimum wage The problem with the welcome war between Labour and the Conservatives over minimum wage rates is that it means nothing if employers ignore them.\u0026nbspAccording to the Low Pay Commission, a record number of people were underpaid last year by those that chose to do just that.\u0026nbspIn a report published just a few weeks after the minimum wage celebrated its 20 year anniversary, it put the number at 439,000\u0026nbspand rising.\u0026nbsp\u0027Worrying\u0027 rise in number of people being paid below minimum wageMinimum wage at 20: Too many employers still trying to get around itTwenty years on, the national minimum wage is a successYounger workers were particularly vulnerable, even though employers are allowed to pay them less. Ditto women. The report tagged childcare as the occupation with the highest proportion of underpaid workers, with hospitality and retail, which similarly employ an unusually high proportion of female workers, also high on the list.\u0026nbspBut hang on a second, I hear you say. Wasn’t HM Revenue \u0026amp Customs (HMRC) given a bunch of extra cash by the Department for Business, Energy \u0026amp Industrial Strategy (BEIS) to bring enforcement actions?\u0026nbspThat is indeed the case, as BEIS was keen to stress in response to the report. And there is evidence that it is having results. HMRC identified an all-time high number of workers as underpaid in the 2017-18 financial year, securing pay rises and arrears for them while also levying fines.\u0026nbspYet the number of cases overall stood still. The figures were driven by a relatively small number of big cases.\u0026nbspWhat this tells you is that HMRC is deploying its resources where it can get the most bang for its buck.\u0026nbspAn eminently sensible policy given that its budget is not unlimited, even after the increases it has enjoyed and the complexities and expense involved in investigating underpayment – and bringing miscreant employers to book.The trouble is that this is inevitably going to lead to a long tail of often smaller employers that are cheating the system and may justifiably feel there is little risk to them in doing so.Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

Sometimes it can be as simple as delaying the introduction of new rates. Sometimes it’s a lot worse than that.\u0026nbspHelpfully the commission, which also advises on the rates themselves, has some sensible ideas for addressing the issue, which can be summarised as calling for a more holistic approach.\u0026nbspAs part of this, it wants to see more investment in communicating with workers, and employers, together with efforts to build confidence in complaints processes, and to help workers to use them.\u0026nbspIt would also like government to work more closely with unions, which obviously have considerable expertise in this area through the work they do for low paid members and could provide a great deal of assistance.\u0026nbspCheating the minimum wage not only cheats workers. It cheats the competitors of businesses that fail to pay it by disadvantaging them.\u0026nbspIn treating unions as the enemy, as the Conservative government is frequently guilty of doing, it risks undermining the success of one of its flagship policies.

But it’s only recently that everyone has been able to see what the store has in stock\u0026nbspfor them.Kibworth\u0026nbspBooks is among hundreds of independent UK booksellers who have started using NearSt technology, which allows small retailers to compete with Amazon by making their inventory visible in online searches. As well as listing stock online for potential customers to browse, NearSt has an add-on feature that makes the store appear in searches when people in the area Google the specific title they want.Retailers say high street footfall up March but shoppers didn’t spend Debenhams is on the brink, but could a retail genius save it?Government must protect British retailers from giants like Amazon“Now we have 8,000 titles findable by people who are walking past the shop, or in the pub three minutes down the road,” says Debbie James, who started Kibworth Books when she left the music industry 10 years ago. “They can Google a book from the pub and our shop will come up before Amazon, Waterstones and WHSmith.”NearSt was founded by Max Kreijn and Nick Brackenbury in 2015 with one mission: to get more people into high street shops. The startup comes at a time of rapid change for UK high streets. More than 30 major retailers have shut since Woolworths closed in 2008, according to the ONS. Job losses from the retail sector are expected to rise nearly 20 per cent in 2019, putting 164,000 people out of work and leading to the closure of a further 22,000 stores, according to the Centre for Retail Research.It’s an interesting time in retail,” Brackenbury says. “I think the high street has a ton of value but it needs to be unlocked.”Brackenbury and Kreijn met 10 years ago when they were working together at Ogilvy, the advertising agency. Brackenbury was a graduate trainee and Kreijn was a strategist in a small team of three or four people doing early social analytics.\u0026nbspNot long after, Kreijn left the firm to start his own company, an innovation consultancy helping big companies behave more like startups. He was spending a lot of time working out how big companies could take old assets and come up with something new, when he had a “literal lightbulb moment” – a lightbulb in his living room blew, and when he Googled for a replacement, the search threw up online shops, rather than stores near him.The next time Kreijn saw Brackenbury, he pitched him the lightbulb problem: how could they unlock the retail industry’s massive stock inventory, and make it available in the place where most people were starting to shop – online?\u0026nbsp“I told him I was sure someone had figured out his problem already,” Brackenbury says. “But when I looked at it I thought, ‘My god, why hasn’t anyone done this?’ And it turns out no one has done this because it is quite hard.”The technology developed by NearSt echoes work by Alibaba, the biggest e-commerce company in China, which has been converting 100,000 retail stores into Alibaba-linked smart stores. Customers in these smart stores are able to source products missing in some stores from others nearby, so they know where to look next – or where to order the product for home delivery.NearSt has had early success with booksellers as many of them use the same book supplier, Gardners Books, which makes it easy for NearSt to digitise the inventory used by multiple independent stores. But it is much more of a challenge to digitise and extract the data from hundreds of thousands of small shops.\u0026nbsp“The inventory is locked away in these archaic inventory systems that weren’t built for the modern world,” Brackenbury says. “So if you search for a product on your phone, it shows you hundreds of products in warehouses up the M1 corridor, even though you could be stood outside a shop that sells that very same product and you just don’t know about it. That seems bonkers.”NearSt has developed software to extract and understand rudimentary stock data and feed it into the internet, so that Google doesn’t just show online results, but also local availability.\u0026nbspIf an online inventory is the best way for retailers to take back the bite of their profit stolen by Amazon, why haven’t more done it? “The data challenge is hard for a retailer to do,” Brackenbury says. Many companies that do have digital inventories are using mainframe technology that was built in 1988. Even after the store has established a barcode, a stock level and a price, they must also have pictures, product descriptions and titles before it can be listed as a product online.\u0026nbsp“It’s a huge ask, and they’re busy so they don’t do it,” Brackenbury says. “We connect into old systems, extract information, understand what it is and enrich it so the retailer doesn’t have to do anything. They keep managing the inventory in the same way, but we make it visible on the web.”Last year, NearSt was approached by a Google employee who explained that the search company wanted to list local inventory. “It’s an incredible way for us to make a huge impact,” Brackenbury says of the partnership. “We looked at who we wanted to feed data into, and then Google came to us and said they could feed it into the world’s biggest search engine – that’s the way to achieve that mission.”The company has raised £1.5m to date and is in the middle of another funding round. Brackenbury knows that as the company’s mission grows, it must do what it can to safeguard the privacy of stores. He imagines opening inventory data to other technology companies, like Facebook and Uber, so that users can get instant delivery of branded spirits from local stores by nearby couriers, for instance. But he says this would have to be done with the consent of the retailers, so their inventory only appears when they want it to.At Kibworth Books, James say the decision to sign up to NearSt was a “no brainer”. She recently paid an extra £2 a day for the store to appear in local Google searches for titles around World Book Day. “I did it for two weeks to get my shop out there when families who weren’t aware of us were searching where to get the books from,” she says. “Looking at the statistics it was worth it, you can safely say footfall increased.”Independent bookshops on the rise for the second year runningBrackenbury meanwhile says that in a few years, live inventory technology will be so commonplace we will wonder how we ever did without it: “Within three or four years, this real time local inventory will seem completely normal to us in the same way that now\u0026nbspif you look up on your phone what time Boots shuts, Google tells you the closing time for the nearest store. Four years ago that didn’t exist,” he says. Whether it can save the high street remains to be seen.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The new owners include Barclays and Bank of Ireland, as well as US investment firms.It first put forward proposals in October to shut 50 stores over three years as it bids to cut costs. More detailed plans have now been formally laid out and will be put to creditors, 75 per cent of whom must approve before they can go ahead.Terry\u0026nbspDuddy,\u0026nbspDebenhams\u0026nbspexecutive chairman said: “Debenhams has a clear strategy and a bright future, but in order for the business to prosper, we need to restructure the group’s store portfolio and its balance sheet, which are not appropriate for today’s much changed retail environment.Created with Sketch.

A creditor vote\u0026nbspwill take place on 9 May.KPMG, which is handling the CVA, said consultations had\u0026nbspalready taken place with key creditors with further talks planned\u0026nbspto ensure the full details of the proposal are understood.Suppliers\u0026nbspwill continue to be paid “on time and in full, and terms of employment are not impacted”, KPMG said.A key part of rescue plans for the retailer is to slash its rent bill by closing stores and renegotiating leases with landlords.Leases will be retained at current rents for 39 stores, with the 22 stores earmarked for closure seeking rent reductions of 50 per cent until next year. The remaining stores will pay 25 to 50 per cent less rent under the plans.Debenhams sneaks out confirmation of CEO Bucher\u0027s departureHigh costs and large debts have made it difficult for\u0026nbspDebenhams\u0026nbspto invest as it attempts to deal with the threat posed by changing consumer habits and the rise of online giants such as Amazon.Gary Carter, national officer for the GMB union, said the closures were a travesty.\u0026nbsp“Although many will not be surprised by the closure announcements\u0026nbsp - this is devastating news for Debenhams employees who have battled hard to keep the company afloat, Mr Carter said.“They will join the tens of thousands of retail workers made redundant in recent months.“It’s another hammer blow for the high street, another established name gone and more retail space left empty.Last week, Debenhams chief executive Sergio Boucher quit\u0026nbspafter two difficult years in charge.\u0026nbspHe had faced fierce attacks from Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley, who was seeking to take over at Debenhams and described the administration as a “national scandal”.Mr Ashley’s company owned a 30 per cent stake in Debenhams\u0026nbspbut all shareholders were wiped out as part of the administration process.The stores to close in 2020:Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Welcome steps have been taken in that direction, but this work shows more needs to be done.”A government spokesperson said: “It is illegal not to pay the minimum wage and we are cracking down on employers who fail to pay the national minimum wage and national living wage.“We have almost doubled HMRC’s budget to £26.3m since 2015, ensuring it has the resources needed to investigate employers who break these rules.“HMRC has collected £15.6m of underpayment for over 200,000 workers and issued £14.1m\u0026nbspin financial penalties to employers that breached the rules – the highest amount ever.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Welcome steps have been taken in that direction, but this work shows more needs to be done.”A government spokesperson said: “It is illegal not to pay the minimum wage and we are cracking down on employers who fail to pay the national minimum wage and national living wage.“We have almost doubled HMRC’s budget to £26.3m since 2015, ensuring it has the resources needed to investigate employers who break these rules.“HMRC has collected £15.6m of underpayment for over 200,000 workers and issued £14.1m\u0026nbspin financial penalties to employers that breached the rules – the highest amount ever.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Or even \u0027Miss British Empire\u0027?!” he adds.\u0026nbspThe organisers, however, deny that there is any ideological motivation behind the contest.\u0026nbsp“Our name has nothing to do with politics,” Kateryna Burceva, who co-organised the contest in 2012, tells\u0026nbspThe Independent. Burceva is no longer involved in Miss USSR.Karina Barulina, a 2014 finalist from Moscow, agrees.It’s only named after the Soviet Empire, she says, to make it more inclusive.“It had been called this way deliberately to avoid discrimination, because it’s not only Russian girls participating, but Russian-speaking girls also. This name makes it more understandable.”Applicants shoot and present videos about themselves and their countries, whilst wearing in national costumes on stage.On the contest’s website, an applicant from Crimea is listed among the girls representing Russia.Russia annexed the Ukrainian peninsula in 2014, in\u0026nbsp a move considered illegal by the UN General Assembly. The vast majority of the international communities does not recognise Crimea as a part of Russia.Hunt enrages Slovenia by wrongly saying it was \u0027Soviet vassal state\u0027And while the organisers insist that the contest is non-political, they also invite diplomats to the show every year.However, Ukrainian, Belarusian and Uzbekistani diplomats said that they were first told about the contest by The Independent and insisted they have never attended.Titova was reluctant to name them, adding: “Kazakhstani diplomats attend with a great pleasure. I just do not know to what extent it is politically correct to mention them.”Moldovan diplomats came to the event back in 2016 according to the “Miss USSR UK” Instagram page.Representatives from the Kazakhstan and Moldovan embassies in the UK did not immediately respond to The Independent’s request for comment.Several former Soviet countries have spoken out against the competition.“The invitation of Lithuanian girls to participate in the event, named on behalf of the Soviet Union, shows great disrespect for the restored independence of Lithuania,” says a statement on the Lithuanian Embassy’s website.Imagine if someone organised a \u0027Miss Third Reich\u0027 competition for women from countries occupied by the Nazis? Or even \u0027Miss British EmpireLithuanian diplomats in the UK tell The Independent that they have asked the contest’s organisers to remove any reference to Lithuania from its literature, but that the organisers did not oblige.\u0026nbspA spokesperson from the Latvian Embassy told to The Independent that they advise women not to take part in the event, stressing that those who do, “by no means represent Latvia.”Aliyor Tilavov, political counsel at the Uzbekistan embassy, was similarly unimpressed.“We do not approve this contest and we have no connection to it. If someone has nostalgia for a Soviet Union, we do not,” he says.The contest also gathers “representatives of royal families, lords, directors and CEOs of global corporations,” according to its website.Titova, the director, declined to provide further information on this year’s guests.“They are quite influential and noble people. We care about our clients and do not disclose this information.”For John Lough, Russia expert at Chatham House and a former NATO representative in Moscow, the event seeks to reinforce a longing for the Soviet Union, and hope to use such VIP guests to do so.“It possibly seeks to reinforce an agenda that the Russian state would be very comfortable with, that ‘we are all one big happy family, whatever happened in history. We are all together’.”“That is clearly not consistent with reality,” Lough adds.Women compete to win a contract with an international modelling agency, which changes annually.This year, it remains a secret.Titova says that the first runners-ups will also get a trip to the hotel Rixos in Kemer on Turkey’s coast and a holiday exploring Montenegro on a 42-metre luxury yacht called Riana.“Miss USSR UK” was first launched in 2012 by Titova.If someone has nostalgia for a Soviet Union, we do notShe had moved to London a couple of years earlier to work as a nightclub promoter, but says she soon decided to promote her own beauty pageant.To take part in the contest, there is an online vote for the best-looking women. Votes have to be purchased, at a cost of 1 euro for three votes.The winner is likely determined by how much money backers are ready to spend, as the number of votes a person can buy is unlimited.But money itself is not a guarantee of getting a place in the show in the first place, says Julia Rebenok, a 2018 finalist from Ukraine.Women who win this first stage then have to pass a Skype interview.“The organisers look at your body shape and ask you to do a small catwalk on the camera,” Rebenok says.Selected candidates then pay a £300 participation fee and the preparation for the show begins in earnest.Inspirational and transformational coaches are employed to train the girls prior to the competition.The webinars are available for anyone to join. During one, Ekaterina Lebedeva, a psychologist and sexologist, teaches the applicants how to produce pheromones while performing on the stage.It possibly seeks to reinforce an agenda that the Russian state would be very comfortable with, that ‘we are all one big happy family, whatever happened in history“Listen, girls, you should remind yourself where our vaginal tube is. Now we begin to compress it, we compress our vaginal muscles. One, two, three…”“At the beauty contest, there will be men among the judges. You do not even need perfume. You will emit a smell of sexuality and it is not vulgar. Male judges will not understand why they like you, but they will like you,” Lebedeva continues.Lebedeva participated in the “Miss USSR” contest in Monaco last year, where she met her future husband, a Russian drummer. She was introduced to him by a contest’s choreographer, she says during her webinar.“I participated in the contest to get married,” she confesses.“Perhaps someone will see you at the beauty contest as there are some decent men. Behave properly.”The tickets to the show, starting at £400, are not available to the general public. The event is private - for “VIP clients” only.“A person files an application on the website and our team decides whether to approve it or decline,” says Titova.\u0026nbspTop TV and pop-stars perform at the events.Sonique, Sheyla Bonnick from Boney M and DJ Smash are among those who have provided entertainment in recent years.Despite the extravagance of the contest, “Miss USSR Management Ltd”, the company, owned by Titova, does not earn much, according to its balance sheets filed on Companies House.In 2016 the company first declared profit - £877 of current assets. In 2017 it showed a negative balance of £6,308.How Tintin satirised the Soviet UnionThe contest, though, has a strong financial backing from sponsors.“As long as sponsors pay, the contest exists,” says ex-organiser Burceva.Among the sponsors are London Luxury Chauffeuring, Caviar House, and The Elite London – \u0026nbspan exclusive jet-set lifestyle event for rich people.However, by far the biggest company backing Miss USSR UK is Rixos, the luxury chain of 25 hotels around the world.Rixos was founded by Turkish businessmen Fettah Tamince, but, according to emails leaked through Football Leaks and published by The Black Sea news agency in 2016, 50 per cent of the Rixos shares are owned by a Kazakh businessman Tevfik Arif. He has extensive links to Russia and used to work in Moscow for 17 years in the Soviet Ministry of Trade.He is also the founder of the Bayrock Group, which has worked with the Trump Organization on multiple projects.Arif was previously reported to be involved in a sex scandal - he had been arrested together with nine prostitutes from Russia during a party on the yacht in Turkey in 2010 and charged with financing an international prostitution ring, but in 2011 was acquitted.As long as sponsors pay, the contest existsEighty kilometres away lies the Rixos Sungate, where the finalists of “Miss USSR UK” spent a holiday in spring 2018. The next visit is planned for this summer.Sponsors put money into “Miss USSR UK” to advertise their businesses, Titova says.However, not many sponsors place the competition’s logo on their own websites.“We make a marketing strategy for a year and offer opportunities for companies to attract new clients,” she says.\u0026nbsp“Plus a photo shoot with our contestants.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The scenario has been developed by one of the Nasa organisations tasked with studying such near-earth objects, or NEOs.It will bring together not just Nasa\u0026nbspbut other international organisations to test out their response. Such exercises are used across the disaster response sector, to ensure that the real responses are as fast and effective as possible.These exercises have really helped us in the planetary\u0026nbspdefense\u0026nbspcommunity to understand what our colleagues on the disaster management side need to know, said Lindley Johnson, NASA\u0027s Planetary\u0026nbspDefense\u0026nbspOfficer.

Groups such as Nasa\u0027s\u0026nbspPlanetary\u0026nbspDefense\u0026nbspCoordination Office (PDCO) as well as the European Space Agency\u0027s Space Situational Awareness-NEO Segment and the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) have been working to better communicate the danger that such objects pose to Earth.Universe expanding faster than expected, Nasa data confirmsAs part of that mission, officials will play out such a scenario in an attempt to demonstrate how Earth might respond.There is no strict script in such an exercise. Instead, it will be used to test out how\u0026nbspNEO observers, space agency officials, emergency managers, decision makers and citizens would respond to the threat of an impact, and how that might become clear.It will start with the story that on 26 March, astronomers have found an NEO that could be hazardous to Earth. They will be told that it has been tracked for a\u0026nbsp few months and that it has a one in 100 chance of hitting Earth in 2027 – the chances that would require action from people on Earth.Those taking part will discuss possible preparations: how they would explore the asteroid, work out the best ways of deflecting it and dealing with its impact effects.Nasa has already participated in such exercises, working on some with\u0026nbspthe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Those exercises brough representatives from a variety of different federal agencies, including the departments of Defense and State.Previous exercises showed that the focus of emergency management officials was not on scientific details. Instead, they just want to know when, where and how an asteroid will hit the Earth, as well as what sort of damage is done, according to FEMA.Nasa continues to work on that science, however, in an attempt to better improve humanity\u0027s ability to predict the exact location and effects of any impact.NASA and FEMA will continue to conduct periodic exercises with a continually widening community of US\u0026nbspgovernment agencies and international partners, said Leviticus Lewis of the Response Operations Division for\u0026nbspFEMA. They are a great way for us to learn how to work together and meet each other\u0027s needs and the objectives laid out in the White House National NEO Preparedness Action Plan.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But it was just so infectious, and such a genuine joyous moment that for whatever reason, I went studio a couple weeks later, and I made this song called \u0027Vossi Bop.\u0027 But this is like three years ago, 2016 I made this song. Or 2015.And yeah, I just had the spirit of Vossi in me, and I was just like ... Yeah, it was very like, now that I think back on it, it just felt very from God, and very natural. Like yeah, this is my vibe right now. I think it just embodies everything that I\u0027m about. The confidence, the humour, the style, the flair, the anarchy, the chaos, just the vibe.

The public accounts committee lambasted Mr Grayling’s team for continual shortcomings\u0026nbspand said the project had been afflicted by\u0026nbspan overriding culture of over-optimism”.Earlier this month, MPs said it was unacceptable that DfT and Crossrail had not identified root causes of delays and cost increases, and demanded to know what consequences officials had faced for the string of failings.Crossrail’s\u0026nbsporiginal budget was £15bn, but it is thought to have run over by £3bn so far. The company said it had now developed\u0026nbspa robust and realistic plan\u0026nbspthat took full account of exactly what was to be done and how long it would take.Its chairman, Tony Meggs, said in a statement: “An enhanced governance structure has been put in place to strengthen the Crossrail programme.“We will be open and transparent about our progress and will be providing Londoners and London businesses with regular updates as we seek to rebuild trust with all our stakeholders.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Whatever comes out of that we put to the British people in a referendum versus Remain.Change UK \u0027would back\u0027 May in confidence vote to avoid election“There’s a debate to be had around whether you have a three-stage voting process that includes a clean no-deal Brexit because for some people, they believe that is Brexit. There’s maybe some debate to be had around that.”Pushed on whether she wanted no deal to be on the ballot paper, she added:\u0026nbsp“I have some sympathy for it. The Electoral Commission would have a view about how it might split the vote or whether it might artificially give advantage in one direction or the other. That’s the argument people say, ‘well, you’ll be splitting the vote if it’s the leaving deal or the no deal’. If that is the conclusion, then clearly, we can’t have that.“But I feel like we should be offering no deal because to some people that is clean Brexit. But one thing I am without doubt 100 per cent clear on is that ‘Remain as we are’ has to be on the ballot paper because that’s what we’re comparing. We’re in it, versus whatever the brave new world might look like.”Ms Allen also admitted that Change UK\u0027s process for vetting candidates for next month\u0027s\u0026nbspEuropean Parliament elections was not good enough after two candidates were forced to step down after having been found to have previously made offensive comments on social media. One had posted saying that black women scare me while another had made derogatory remarks about Romanian pickpockets.The Change UK interim leader said the party had employed a professional top end vetting company but that they had missed a couple of things.Created with Sketch.Which MPs have defected from parties to join the Independent Group?

It’s unprofessional, it’s not good enough. But we’re not perfect, nobody’s perfect. In life, in any area of life, you accept you can’t do everything yourself. That’s why you pay other organisations or businesses to do things for you where they have the skills, recognising that you don’t.Ms Allen said her party needed to focus on the really important stuff, including welfare and education, rather than Brexit alone.She said: Brexit is a massive, massive issue, but it cannot be everything that we\u0027re about.I want to get onto the exciting stuff, I want to sort welfare out, I want to deal with education, I want to get some proper funding in my schools.I want to get onto all that other stuff, but Brexit, as it is with everything in life, is just stalling and stopping us from getting onto the really important stuff.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Several\u0026nbspsenior shadow cabinet ministers want the party to support a public vote on any Brexit deal passed by parliament, but Mr Corbyn’s inner circle say he only supports a referendum on the government’s deal or to avoid a no-deal outcome. Other shadow ministers oppose another public poll\u0026nbspentirely.In their letter to the National Executive Committee (NEC), the MPs and MEPs said Labour had “a clear opportunity to win these elections” if it fully supports a Final Say vote.No-deal Brexit better than staying in EU, Jeremy Hunt saysThey wrote: “These elections are about the kind of Europe we want to live in, and we can’t make a convincing case in them without being clear about Brexit. Labour has already, rightly, backed a confirmatory public vote. The overwhelming majority of our members and voters support this, and it is the democratically established policy of the party.“Our members need to feel supported on doorsteps by a clear manifesto that marks us out as the only viable alternative to Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party.\u0026nbsp“We need a message of hope and solidarity, and we need to campaign for it without caveats. To motivate our supporters, and to do the right thing by our members and our policy, a clear commitment to a confirmatory public vote on any Brexit deal must be part of our European election manifesto. We understand the many different pressures and views within our movement, but without this clear commitment, we fear that our electoral coalition could fall apart.”The MPs and MEPs said “the world is watching” and that Labour “must be ready to rise to the challenge”. They added: “We must run a dynamic, energetic campaign around a radical manifesto to transform Europe and a clear position on Brexit.”Created with Sketch.Opposing protesters flock to parliament on would be date of Brexit Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pro-Brexit leave the European Union supporters attend a rally in Parliament Square after the final leg of the March to Leave in LondonThe protest march which started on March 16 in Sunderland, north east England, finished on what was the original date for Brexit to happen before the recent extensionA Brexit supporter sips a can of Stella in protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentDedicated anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray and likewise pro-Brexit campaigner Joseph Afrane go head to head near the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit marching band in Parliament SquareRemain supporters wave EU flags from a bus in Parliament SquareA Brexit supporter protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters protest outside of the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit flag is waved in Parliament SquareThe March to Leave nears the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters carry the coffin of democracyBrexit supporters take part in the March to Leave protest in LondonA Brexit supporter holds a sign outside the Houses of ParliamentA man holds satirical paintings of politiciansAn pro-Brexit float on the March to Leave march in LondonFar-right activist Tommy Robinson addresses protesters outside the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentA Tommy Robinson supporter arrives at the Houses of Parliament A jogger gestures rudely at a Brexit supporter outside of the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentPro-Brexit leave the European Union supporters attend a rally in Parliament Square after the final leg of the March to Leave in LondonThe protest march which started on March 16 in Sunderland, north east England, finished on what was the original date for Brexit to happen before the recent extensionA Brexit supporter sips a can of Stella in protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentDedicated anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray and likewise pro-Brexit campaigner Joseph Afrane go head to head near the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit marching band in Parliament SquareRemain supporters wave EU flags from a bus in Parliament SquareA Brexit supporter protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters protest outside of the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit flag is waved in Parliament SquareThe March to Leave nears the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters carry the coffin of democracyBrexit supporters take part in the March to Leave protest in LondonA Brexit supporter holds a sign outside the Houses of ParliamentA man holds satirical paintings of politiciansAn pro-Brexit float on the March to Leave march in LondonFar-right activist Tommy Robinson addresses protesters outside the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentA Tommy Robinson supporter arrives at the Houses of Parliament A jogger gestures rudely at a Brexit supporter outside of the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentThe letter was organised by the Love Socialism, Hate Brexit group. Signatories included 10 current shadow ministers, House of Commons Brexit select committee chair Hilary Benn and former shadow cabinet ministers\u0026nbspincluding Angela Eagle, Debbie Abrahams, Rachel Reeves and Owen Smith.Several prominent supporters of Mr Corbyn, including shadow Treasury minister Clive Lewis and former international development secretary Kate Osamor, have also added their names.It came as Labour MPs, MEPs and party members reacted with fury to the\u0026nbspleaked draft campaign leaflet, which suggested Labour would deliver Brexit by seeking “a better deal with Europe”.The flyer made no mention of another referendum, saying only: “The Tories’ chaotic handling of Brexit has left our country in crisis.“With Labour, Britain will have a proper say in future trade deals and businesses wouldn’t have to pay to trade with Europe.“Labour will keep a close relationship with the EU and protect workers’ rights.”It is understood that the leaflet, which was drawn up by Mr Corbyn’s team and staff at Labour’s HQ, was not signed off by shadow cabinet ministers or Labour MEPs.Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, was said to be “furious” at the omission of the party’s policy on another referendum.Sources said many MPs were also infuriated by the draft.One Labour MP told\u0026nbspThe Independent: “People went into complete meltdown and were utterly furious at what appears to be yet another attempt by a small cabal of disgruntled officials to undermine the entire rest of the party, with no reference to the very candidates these leaflets are meant to promote.”“I sincerely hope this is an early draft because it would be unacceptable for unelected officials to attempt to subvert Labour’s members, trade unions and elected representatives in this way.”Mr Corbyn\u0026nbsphas struggled to keep his ided shadow cabinet together on the issue of on another referendum. Some of his closest advisers and shadow ministers, including party chairman Ian Lavery, shadow Cabinet Office minister Jon Trickett and shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey are staunchly opposed to another vote.\u0026nbspBut others, led by\u0026nbspSir Keir ​and deputy leader Tom Watson, have pushed hard for the party to support a Final Say vote.A Labour spokesperson said: “There are a number of different texts for different leaflets in circulation, including for a freepost and for other campaign purposes. They all reflect existing party policy. Our manifesto for the European elections will be decided next Tuesday.”The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Allies of the former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, have previously briefed that\u0026nbsphe will be sitting this one out. “He believes the prospect of the UK fielding candidates is utterly preposterous,” one told The Times.It is quite extraordinary on one level that the government is avoiding relatively simple questions on an election that is likely to take place in just four weeks’ time.\u0026nbspUnder the current terms of the revised\u0026nbspArticle 50 Brexit negotiating deadline, the UK does not have to take part\u0026nbspin the European elections if a deal is secured in the British parliament by the end of play on 22\u0026nbspMay. However,\u0026nbspif no deal is done, then the British public will be heading to the polls on the following day to elect the next crop of MEPs.\u0026nbspGiven that no agreement in the cross-party talks over Brexit appear imminent, it seems fairly unlikely the prime minister will receive MPs’ backing for a Brexit plan\u0026nbspin just a matter of weeks.Experts have also warned that\u0026nbspeven if Ms May secures approval in principle, she has “no chance” of formally passing her deal\u0026nbspin time to pull the UK out of the elections and to avoid what many speculate will be a devastating set of results for the party.But confusion will reign over the Conservative Party’s strategy for the European parliament election campaign for as long as the prime minister clings to the hope she can win parliamentary approval for\u0026nbspa deal by\u0026nbsp22 May.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Brigette Bardot wrote a letter calling on the government to stop “animal genocide”, while Morissey responded by saying idiots rule the earth.The cull has also come under fire from some conservationists who argue that the government are focusing too heavily on cats, rather than addressing other factors that reduce bioersity such as urban expansion, logging and mining.Tim Doherty, a conservation ecologist from Deakin University in Australia, told CNN: There\u0027s a possibility there that cats are being used as a distraction to some extent, he said. We also need to have a more holistic approach and address all threats to bioersity.Despite the more creative methods employed in the government’s cat cull, inidual shooters are responsible for the 83 per cent of the cats killed so far, according to The Royal Melbourne Institute.And Australia is not the only country to focus on reducing cat populations, with calls in New Zealand to put a stop to domestic cats altogether.The country has announced a goal of becoming completely predator free by 2050. And last year, Omaui, a small coastal town in the South Island, considered banning people from owning cats\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspalthough it has since backtracked on this plan.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We demand the Government makes the following changes to help hard-working famililes before its too late. We want you to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Things have not improved for the former housekeeper, who has been forced to borrow money to pay for furniture and did not have enough cash to celebrate her eight-year-old son’s birthday.“I got my son a little truck for his birthday but that was it, she said. “He was happy to get something as I’ve had to sell the toys he has just to charge the electric and the gas,”Charlotte charges men £ for sex and other favours - bringing in around £ every week. She sees one client whenever she can as she appreciates the “regular” work.In fact, the mum feels so let down by the Government she claims her clients are the only people she can trust.Charlotte, who lives on an estate, had to give up her job when she had her son because she couldnt afford childcare.She moved onto Universal Credit in January  but fell £ behind on her rent while waiting for her first payment and was threatened with eviction.She says: “If I didn’t have to wait so long for my first payment, I would have been OK.“Something always goes wrong - five weeks is too much. I’m still just about managing now.“Winter has been hard, I’ve had to keep the house warm and the lights on, but it’s been so expensive to do.Her sons dad pays nothing towards his upkeep and while she received a £ loan from the government to tide her over when she moved onto Universal Credit last year, she claims she wasn’t told by her local job centre that it would need to be repaid.“That was the final straw when everything changed, and I saw how much debt I was in… the payments and the household bills, it all built up,” she says.Charlotte now receives £-a-month in Universal Credit after her rent has been paid to her landlord and her debts, including the £ furniture loan, are taken off.At one point, after shed paid the rest of her bills, she was left with just £. a day for her and her son to live on.Other women have also claimed that a long wait for their first Universal Credit payment has forced them into sex work.Julie, , from Merseyside told the BBC she had been left “so ashamed” after being forced to turn to sex work after an EIGHT-week wait for her Universal Credit payment.“I didnt go out looking for it, I said no at first ... it wasnt until about three weeks later that I said OK, yeah, because I thought I need to, because I need money’,” she said.Its something I never ever thought I would be ever capable of doing.”Apply for an advance - Claimants are able to get some cash within five days rather than waiting weeks for their first payment. But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently, or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free. You can find your nearest one on the Trussell Trust website.Women like Charlotte are often too ashamed to tell their families that they have resorted to prostitution to survive.“I can’t talk to anyone. It’s the guilt mainly. My family don’t know - they wouldn’t be happy. They’d be angry, furious, upset. They would be so judgemental.My son still doesn’t know about what I do for money either.”“And I’m sure there are other women out there in worse situations than me.”Charlotte is struggling with her mental health at the moment and is having therapy for a second time – but she hasn’t admitted what she “does on the side” as she doesn’t think her counsellor would understand.She is considering going to college to do a course as she wants to be an author, but feels things are stacked against her.“I know I’ve got lots to work on, but it’s too much sometimes,” she says.“I keep thinking, why is this happening “They say Universal Credit is working, but who is that for Why are people getting poorer but the government don’t care  Evensomething changes, I can’t erase what I’ve done now.Officials say that advances are available from day one on Universal Credit - and that Brits can get up to  per cent of their cash upfrontthey need it.But delays getting the welfare payments are causing women to rack up debt and some are selling their bodies while they wait for help, charities have said.We know from the stories of women that have contacted us that the delays in processing universal credit and the drop in benefits is financially crippling.It is essential that the vulnerable are protected and their welfare is paramount.”A representative for Beyond The Streets, which works to help women who have suffered sexual exploitation, said: We welcome the investigation in to failures in universal credit and the increase in survival sex.In October, MP Frank Field shocked the House of Commons when he revealed women in his Birkenhead constituency were selling themselves for sex for the first time as a result of hardship caused by the introduction of Universal Credit.After The Sun shared Charlottes story with Mr Field, he said he would write to Department for Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd about her case.Here we have yet another awful example of Universal Credit pushing vulnerable mothers, who are trying to protect their children, to rock bottom and beyond, he told The Sun.The DWP insists safeguards are in place to make sure all repayments are affordable and sustainable.It also aims to give people help to find routes out of the sex industry, with personalised work coaches in place to help people looking for alternative roles.The department insists it has responded quickly to feedback on Universal Credit by continuing to pay Housing Benefit for two weeks after people move on to the new system. Other legacy benefits will follow suit shortly.Ms Rudd has responded to the Suns campaign, saying shes listening to Sun readers as she tries to improve Universal Credit for working families.A DWP spokeswoman told The Sun: We’re committed to getting help to people when they need it most, and advance payments and budgeting support are available.Work coaches are trained to spot vulnerable people, including those working in the sex industry, and offer appropriate support.”*Charlottes name has been changed.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Why kill the innocents ”An obvious question from all right-minded people. But when you’re a murdering psycho, you want to wreak terror not just on those present, but in the minds of millions around the world.And the way they do that is to target innocent people in the normal, everyday scenarios we can all identy with.Attending a church or mosque with family and friends, taking our kids to a concert or a busy shopping mall at the weekend, cheering on marathon runners, queuing for breakfast at a holiday hotel . . .Who among us has not read about Sneha and her friends . . .  or the heartbreaking stories of the British father who lost his we and two children . . . or the Danish man who lost three of his four children . . . and thought of how we would copefaced with the same situation That’s terrorism. It projects fear on to the masses and seeks to make us alter our behaviour accordingly.With every fibre of my being, I want to resist the power of this pernicious tactic, but of late I’ll admit I have struggled.On Friday night, our -year-old attended a Shawn Mendes concert at London’s O arena with a friend and her mother. We wrestled with whether to let her go or not, then felt anxious from the moment she set off until she ed home.Equally, when she expressed a wish to meet her friends at a vast mall last week, we urged her to give it a miss and browse the shops locally. Irrational, yes, but that’s what terrorism can do to your mindsetyou let it.You don’t want to be that grieving family, so you try to minimise the chances of it happening.The truth, of course, is thata suicide bomber decides to board your train carriage, or walk in to your community centre, or drive a car that blows up just as you’re walking past — there’s not a damn thing you can do about it.But what we can do is stand together in our firm belief that these attacks — be it on churches or mosques — have nothing to do with religion.Just hours after the coordinated bombings in his country, the Sri Lankan minister of state for defence said preliminary investigations have shown, “this attack was carried out in retaliation for the attack against Muslims in Christchurch [New Zealand]”.Meanwhile, reports have emerged of young Christian men walking the streets near Sneha’s home of Negombo carrying long sticks and “looking for Muslims”.Again, this us-against-them mindset is what terrorism seeks to inflame.But this isn’t about Christianity versus Islam.The attacks in Sri Lanka, New Zealand, Manchester and London — to name but a few — are the actions of a warped few who have distorted the teachings of wholly peaceful religions to suit their own, murderous ends.We mustn’t allow one drop of poison to contaminate an ocean of humanity.DR GAIL BRADBROOK is the co-founder of Extinction Rebellion, the eco action group that brought central London to a virtual standstill last week.She says: “I think our protests have been awesome.“We’re making history at the minute, people are having a fantastic time on the streets and we really welcome people to come join us.”Yes, I’m sure workers on zero hours contracts would relish the opportunity to lose a day’s payto join her, so too the nurses whose arrival at nearby St Thomas’ hospital each day is critical to the wellbeing of thousands of patients.Dr Bradbrook may have a PhD in molecular biophysics but one fears she and her merry band of protestors may have skipped lessons in common sense.Why  would they glue themselves to public transport that encourages people to leave their cars at home while simultaneously causing air polluting traffic jams And why  would they stage a sit-in aimed to make the politicians take notice when the House of Commons rose on April  for recess and didn’tuntil yesterday  Duh.The majority of the population supports action on climate change, but this virtue-signalling nonsense only detracts from the cause by irritating ordinary people just tryingto earn a living. Begging the question: Why only now HOLLYWOOD star Anne Hathaway says she’s giving up alcohol until her son is .She’s a stronger woman than me.Meanwhile, she has also abandoned veganism after admitting that she “just didn’t feel good or healthy”. She says she immediately felt betterafter eating a fish dish from Iceland.I know what you’re thinking . . . was it the £ prawn ring as advertised by Kerry Katona No, Anne’s le-changing fish experience was a sustainably sourced salmon at a Michelin-starred restaurant in Reykjavik.Easy mistake to make though.“HEALTH tourism” is still an ongoing issue, with reports that ten people a day are jetting to the UK to have their babies delivered on the NHS.The bill for caring for , foreign maternity cases was around £.million in  , with only £.million of it clawed back.Meanwhile, three-year-old Victoria Komada, from Norwich, was born with twisted legs and faced a double amputation.And thanks only to the generosity of the local community in Norwich and those in Poland’s Szczecin, where her parents grew up, £, was raised for her to fly toFlorida for an operation to help her walk. Each week we see the plight of desperate people trying to raise money for treatments the NHS won’t fund.Just think of how many of them that unrecouped £.million might have helped.Some days, it feels like we in the UK have  of them.CERTAIN IVF clinics are exploiting older women whose chances of having a baby are very poor, the fertility regulator has warned.Since , the number of -plus women having IVF has doubled, with some clinics “trading on hope” despite a success rate of just one per cent for a woman of  using her own eggs.A spokeswoman for the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authoritysaid she would like these clinics to be honest about the low statistics.She’s right, but one suspects the number of older women opting for IVF will remain high.Because when you’re desperate for a child, even in a fertility lottery of just one per cent, there still lies the hope that it could be you.Fast forward years and they’re still performing though, despite a healthy diet and regular exercise, the batteries are running noticeably lower. Particularly as there’s now only three of them on stage.Howard,  this weekend, is a former breakdancer and perhaps the fittest of them all.But while his body is making all the right moves, his face is positively screaming: “Is there much more of this  Line Of Duty’s on in a minute.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We have assembled a erse group of candidates from across the political spectrum, from former Tory Ann Widdecombe to left-wing grandee Claire Fox.We are all unied in our desire to pressure Westminster to deliver what the people instructed.It is vital we restore parliamentary democracy. Through my service with the Royal Marines and the Special Boat Service, I witnessed the Arab Spring first-hand and saw the horrors suffered by a people with no representation in their political system.I never thought our political class would deliberately undermine the people.But they have done so by failing to deliver on the  referendum. This after the  General Election manestos of the Conservative and Labour parties clearly pledged to honour the result.Voters on all sides have been betrayed. The final straw for me was seeing the men who sent me to a questionable war in Afghanistan — Tony Blair, Lord Adonis and Alastair Campbell — conspiring to undermine the people.They have been colluding with other governments in Europe to stop Brexit.It is vital we stand up against the damage this hardcore group who want to create an EU super-state are inflicting on British democracy.It is deeply saddening to see the isions across our country. People voted to Remain and Leave for a range of legitimate reasons.We are in this position due to John Major and Tony Blair’s arrogance in not consulting thepeople on the treaties that embedded us in the EU — Maastricht, Amsterdam, Nice and Lisbon.The public should have been consulted on these major transfers of power from Parliament towards the supranational structures of the EU.We are now left with this political mess as their legacy.One of the greatest testaments to Britain is that so many people are willing to take huge risks to come and live here, to be free and prosperous.My ancestors came to the UK from Ireland in the th century to escape famine and persecution. They settled in Greenock in the Scottish Lowlands.I am deeply disturbed that Brexit has now come to focus on identity and immigration, instead of on democracy and who runs our country.We should celebrate immigrants as the heroes who want to be British and part of the national ­success story. Brexit is not a right-wing project. Five million Labour voters and a third of ethnic-minority voters backed Leave.Yet from some of the rhetoric spouted, you would think that Brexit voters are all ignorant racists.  The result is that the Leave voters feel patronised, insulted and ignored. Look at the  Labour MPs — many of whom represent Leave-voting constituencies — who voted for a second referendum to overturn the first.The contempt they show for the ordinary people who put their faith in the democratic process is breathtaking.If politicians fail to deliver the result of the referendum, they will be guilty of selling out the people and undermining Britain’s international credibility as a stable and free liberal democracy.The backlash from the public would be unthinkable.Beyond Brexit, I see an opportunity to implement the strongest animal welfare and environmental legislation in the world. It is a chance to reset our relationship with nature, away from the Common Agricultural Policy.I strongly disagree with those who want to weaken environmental policy.Yet the beauty of an accountable liberal democracy is that those decisions can be made in our own Parliament.A vote for the Brexit Party will send shockwaves across Westminster, reminding them that the people are in charge.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

although it can take a few months longer in some cases.However, around one tenth of men and half of women have the disease without any symptoms, which can mean it goes longer without being treated."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/NINTCHDBPICT000485544292.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"lord of the rings john rhys davies ovation brexit betrayal question time","story":"John Rhys-Davies, , was hailed by the audience when he said British politics would take a hitpoliticians didnt deliver the result of the  referendum.The Hollywood star, who played Gimili in the smash films, was applauded after he warned Remainers: You will damage democracyyou dont deliver Brexit.The mood of the people Ive been talking to -

Some have been forced to close early, or cancel “luxuries” such as swimming and music classes. The funding shortage is so severe that heads are begging parents for money to buy basic items such as stationery and toilet paper. For Britain’s private schools, it is a completely dferent story. Thanks to their dubious charitable status, they are exempt from paying millions of pounds a year in business rates. This loophole in the law only entrenches an unacceptable educational ide. It means an elite few benefit from an additional privilege, while the majority are taught in schools with crumbling buildings and rising class sizes. A government that cared about our children’s education would ensure every state school has the same facilities as private ones. They could force private schools to pay their business rates in full, and hand the £million in proceeds to the state sector. Streets behind The closure of nearly two dozen branches of Debenhams is another blow for our struggling high streets. Staff have been badly let down by its former private equity owners who lined their pockets while loading the firm with debt.  But Debenhams has also fallen victim to changing shopping habits and business rates that unfairly penalise bricks and mortar retailers but let online companies off the hook. Department stores are a major draw for shoppers, so when they disappear it can have a knock-on effect for neighbouring retailers. While it is not all gloomy - Primark yesterday said it was recruiting , workers - we must do more to help our high streets thrive. This means making online firms pay their fair share. No mean feet Good luck to all those running in the London Marathon tomorrow. It is quite an undertaking, but the weary legs and aching feet will be worth it for the millions of pounds raised for charity.

The novel, often hailed as the first true English novel, is now  years old. An instant classic, it has been translated into hundreds of languages and inspired Gulliveraposs Travels and The Swiss Family Robinson. Hollywood has also taken Daniel Defoeaposs lead and used it as the basis for hit films like Cast Away, starring Tom Hanks. But the work of fiction is actually based on an amazing true story.    And the events that proved irrestitable to Defoe are every bit as incredible as those within the pages of the novel. Scottish sailor Alexander Selkirk was a real le castaway was every bit as dramatic as Crusoeaposs. Defoe is even said to have met Selkirk, already a celebrity thanks to his seafaring escapades, at a Bristol inn, before penning his book. And while the author never confirmed that Selkirk was the model for Crusoe, the similarities between the two tales have led historians to believe that this is just where Defoe got his big idea. In The Le And Strange Surprising Adventures Of Robinson Crusoe of York, Mariner, Defoeaposs character runs away to sea and is shipwrecked on a Caribbean island.    As sole survivor, he is forced to fend for himself. He recovers weapons and tools from the wreck, then slowly learns to cope - building a hut and learning to hunt. In time he even grows wheat, makes pottery and raises goats, while creating a calendar out of notches on a piece of wood. After famously encountering Friday and teaching him English, Crusoe is eventually rescued after nearly three decades on the island. Just  years before the rip-roaring read hit the shelves, Alexander Selkirk had been marooned on the uninhabited island of Más a Tierra  miles off the coast of Chile in the South Pacic Ocean. The roguish son of a cobbler, from Lower Largo, Fe, the young Selkirk was often in trouble and fled to sea as a teenager. He soon became a buccaneer, joining William Dampieraposs privateers sanctioned by the British government to attack Spanish vessels. But in September , while sailing master of a ship called the Cinque Ports, Selkirk fell out with its skipper Captain Thomas Stradling, who had ignored his warnings that the shipaposs worm ridden timbers had made it unseaworthy. Fearing the craft was about to sink, he demanded to be let off on the island and was duly abandoned on the mountainous  squaremile piece of land, with only a musket, cooking pot and kne along with some bedding, cheese, jam, a flask of rum and a Bible. Selkirk had expected fellow sailors to follow his lead, but when they didnapost, immediately regretted his rash decision.However, the ruthless Stradling wouldnapost let him back on board the ship.  He would spend the next four-and-a-half years on the island.At first Selkirk stayed on the shore forlornly scanning the horizon for passing vessels, but was soon driven inland by wailing two-tonne elephant seals. As the reality of his situation dawned Selkirk showed incredible fortitude, just like Crusoe. He survived by hunting feral goats, even learning how to chase them down on foot, while harvesting wild turnips and cabbage too.Selkirk built a hut out of pepper trees for shelter, fashioned a new kne out of old barrel hoops and domesticated feral cats to help ward off the rats that attacked him at night. Eventually Selkirkaposs feet were so hardened by island le that he didnapost need shoes and he made new clothes from goat skins, while singing to keep himself occupied or finding refuge in reading the Bible just as Crusoe does in Defoeaposs book. While Defoeaposs character has to battle man-eating natives and pirates, Selkirk had equally narrow escapes.He was once badly injured in a fall from a clf and, when a ship did arrive, it turned out to be Spanish.Fearing capture, or death, Selkirk successfully hid up a tree while evading enemy sailors who urinated beneath it. Eventually, on February , , an English ship, The Duke, anchored off the island for supplies. Its captain, Woodes Rogers, found Selkirk barely able to remember how to talk. Yet by now the marooned man had become so adept at survival that he was able to help feed and restore Rogersapos ailing crew who had been suffering from scurvy. Indeed Rogers was so impressed that he gave Selkirk the post of second mate aboard the Duke. In the book, after being rescued, Robinson Crusoe discovers his estates have made him a wealthy in his absence. Selkirk himself ed to Britain in  having made plenty of booty after resuming his career as a privateer.  It also turned out that he had been right about the Cinque Ports, which had sunk shortly after leaving Selkirk behind.Its crew had either been killed or ended up languishing in Spanish prisons.By the time Defoe came to publish Robinson Crusoe, the story of Selkirkaposs amazing survival, against the odds, had already been made public in several accounts. There were other stories of castaways at the time that Defoe may have drawn on, but it seems that Selkirk was the most obvious basis for his hero. In , the connection between Selkirk and the novel came full circle when the Chilean government renamed the island where he had been stranded as Isla Robinson Crusoe - proving the international appeal of Defoeaposs story.  Indeed we have become obsessed with the idea of the lone castaway ever since the book came out on April , . Itaposs a theme on which Radio aposs Desert Island Discs has capitalised - where celebrities choose music and items theyaposd take with them to make the solitude bearable. And there have been other thrilling real-le tales of castaways to intrigue and fascinate us. Just like Crusoe, who goes back to his island for more adventures in Defoeaposs little known sequel, Selkirk never settled into le on land and later enlisted in the Royal Navy.He died at sea from yellow fever in . After hisfrom isolation he had once said: I am now worth  pounds, but shall never be so happy, as when I was not worth a farthing.

But after going through the surgery, the -year-old tied the knot with fiancé Jake and posed for the photos without a care in the world. The happy couple were pleased with the photographs of their special day.   Leanne told Chronicle Live : “My nose has always been an insecurity of mine from a young age and I always felt particularly self-conscious of my side profile.“Having surgery felt like a massive sense of relief.It’s the simple things that might seem trivial to some people but that would make me feel anxious like meeting new people or not worrying about where you stand for a photo.” Leanne, of Croxdale, near County Durham, added: “The photographs really played on my mind. I know it seems small but I just didn’t want to feel the way I had most of my le around a camera, on the happiest day of my le.” Leanne and Jake met in  as they both went to the same gym and they tied the knot at Newton Hall in Northumberland.    The project manager added: “I felt comfortable, confident and didn’t worry at any moment throughout the day when people were taking photos. We just had the best day enjoying our time together, and the photos were incredible - we were so happy with them.” Leanne researched ious surgeons in the UK before choosing Dr Andrea Giannitrapani at MYA Cosmetic Surgery in Newcastle and had the operation at the First Trust Hospital in Preston. She added: “Although my nose was an insecurity of mine, I consciously tried to never let it stop me from doing anything. Had I not had surgery, nothing about the wedding day would have been dferent - but I would have felt dferent, and I would have known. That’s what matters. “I told my friends and family and they were all really supportive and happy for me as they all knew how insecure I had been about my nose for so long.”  Management consultant Jake, , said: “Leanne has always been absolutely beautul regardless of the surgery. But I knew how much this meant to her and the real dference has been how much more visibly confident and comfortable she is.” A spokesman for MYA Cosmetic Surgery, said: “It is not uncommon for men and women who have been considering a Rhinoplasty procedureto go ahead with surgery in the run up to their big day. A wedding day is often one of those defining trigger moments where a patients consideration of surgery based on the insecurities they’ve had all their lives, really becomes apparent. “The likelihood is that they would still have gone ahead with the procedure at some point in their lives but something like this often makes patients realise how important it is to them. “However, our duty of care to each patient is to ensure that their decision is fully informed and that surgery will have a signicantly positive impact on the state of their physical, mental and social well-being for the long term, not just their wedding day.” "},{"url":null,"title":"girl put isolation school over","story":"NewsGirl put in isolation at school over Manchester Arena bombing tribute tattooKia Hiltons father has slammed the schools decision to place his -year-old daughter in isolation for three weeks and to prevent her attending GCSE revision classesShareCommentsByEmma Gill:,  APR NewsKia, , was placed in isolation after a member of staff noticed a tattoo of bee behind her ear \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA dad has slammed a school for placing his daughter in isolation for three weeks after a member of staff spotted her Manchester Arena bombing tribute tattoo.Kia Hilton, , was at the Ariana Grande concert on May , , where  people died when a suicide bomber launched an attack.Along with thousands of other Mancunians, Kia went on to have a bee tattooed on to her body as a symbol of the cityaposs courage and unity in the wake of the attack.Despite being under the  age limit for tattoos, with her parentsapos permission, Kia chose to have the small bee tattoo behind her ear, similar to the one Ariana Grande herself had done, reports the Manchester Evening News .Although Kia has had the tattoo since November last year, her dad says a teacher at her school, Hyde Community College, only spotted it earlier this week - and put the teenager in isolation. Brian says they got a call from school to say she would be in isolation for Kiaaposs remaining three weeks and would not be able to attend GCSE revision classes before and after school.    He said: Itaposs horrendous the way they have treated her.

Youaposd think the school would realise the special circumstances for her having it. We know sheaposs not  and Iaposd always said be in your s before having one, especially girls as I think they can end up regretting them, but in these circumstances we allowed it. Kia told us: I was just walking down the stairs at school and one of the teachers was looking at me and asked what I was doing, saying it looked like I was trying to hide earrings. When I said I didnapost have earrings in, he saw the tattoo and started shouting, saying it was against school rules.

After the M.E.N requested a response from the school, Kiaaposs family received a phone call telling them she was able toto normal classes from Friday morning - and do her extra revision classes - but with a plaster over the tattoo. A spokesperson for Hyde Community College said: “The school provided extensive support for pupils affected by the Manchester Arena bombing, including counselling.

Ria Alice, , purchased the three-bedroom house after making little sacrices while caring for four-year-old son Markus. The healthcare assistant was just  when she and boyfriend Reivan Grfin bought their first home in Nottingham - with no financial help from her parents. My motto was aposlive like you’re brokeapos so I got rid of all my online subscriptions and stopped getting takeaway coffees for example, inspirational Ria said. But the mother-of-one still enjoyed a healthy social le and managed to treat little Markus. She added: I never missed out on days out with Markus. We found local activities like Easter Egg hunts and Halloween trails that were just £ for admission or sometimes even free.    Even when I was saving, I managed to carry on enjoying a social le simply by visiting my friends for a cuppa rather than going out to a restaurant for dinner.   With a bit of work and research, it’s definitely possible for young people to get on the housing ladder. The social media influencer began saving when she was  and found enough for the £, deposit in July . Ria, Reivan and Markus moved in with her mum in the interim and she assessed all her outgoings.    Ria continued: Moving back in with my mum gave me a massive opportunity to be able to save up for a mortgage deposit. I was very lucky to be able to do this as it meant not having to pay rent or other household bills where. I also worked extra night shts which sometimes meant looking after our son Markus the next day with absolutely no sleep. It was definitely a killer. But you have to remember that these little sacrices won’t last forever. They’re temporary and mean you can make a better le for you and your family.    It all pays off in the end. The day we bought our first home was genuinely one the happiest days of my le. I was over the moon. Childcare was important so I could go to work. But my monthly subscriptions to Hayu, Tidal and Beauty Box weren’t. I cut out that spending and immediately had an extra £ per month to save. Every penny counts. And for mums who want to carry on treating their kids alongside saving, there are so many family-friendly, local activities to do for free or for as little as a quid.    The Victorian terraced house needed some work doing it when the couple bought it. But resourceful Ria and Reivan, a -year-old delivery driver, also budgeted on the renovations. I’m inspired to keep renovating properties now and moving up the housing ladder. It’s a project we absolutely love doing, she added. RIA’S TOP TIPS FOR GETTING ON THE HOUSING LADDER MOVE BACK IN WITH YOUR PARENTS: If you can, move back into your parents’ house or your grandparents – anyone who can accommodate you to cut out rent payments whilst saving. It makes a huge dference. WORK EXTRA: Whether it’s getting a second job, doing extra shts or joining an agency, find a way to increase your income and save more money. Once you get that extra salary in your bank account, put it straight into your savings.

Dog walkers raised the alarm when they made the grisly discovery in New Waltham, Lincolnshire, on Thursday morningThere are fears that more body parts may be nearby as Humberside Police widen their search area to include two large fields bordering the path and a stream, GrimsbyLive reports.   It is understood the foot and lower leg, which were found along an old railway line, are that of a female. One of the dog walkers told neighbours the foot was a size four and said it was attached to the lower part of a leg. The traumatised woman told residents she believes the body part belongs to a young woman. A police cordon has surrounded the scene since Thursday as police try to unravel the mystery.    The parish councilaposs chairman warned locals that a body or more body parts could be somewhere in the village, telling residents to be village and know where their children are at all times. A man who lives near the scene said of one of the dog walkers: She is still traumatised by what she found. It looked like a small foot around a size four and was a womanaposs foot. The man said the body part may have been taken to the path by an animal. He added: We can only guess. But it could be there is, sadly, a body in nearby woods or in the fields around here and an animal has taken part of it away.    That is why the search has been all around in the fields and hedgerows and verges. The body part was found close to a playing field at New Waltham Academy. Detective Inspector Rhodri Troake said: “The body part has now been recovered and has been forensically examined, and while we are still in the very early stages of the investigation, we can confirm it is human and is a small section of a lower leg and foot.   “Further detailed forensic examinations and analysis will now be conducted to ascertain the identity of the inidual and to establish the exact circumstances. “Numerous enquiries are being carried out as part of the investigation to determine what events may have occurred prior to this incident, how the body part came to be on the path and also theof time it may have been in situ in the area.  Additional information will be made available as and when we are in a position to provide more details. “A scene and police cordon will remain in place over the few next days as detectives and forensic experts continue enquiries and we would ask people to please allow officers space and time to be able to progress the investigation.” Chairman of New Waltham Parish Council, Grahame Williams, said: No matter where you live, a gruesome discovery like this would be quite shocking. What is perturbing is the possibility there are other body parts in the village. It is important parents know where their children are at all times and to be vigilant.  If anyone becomes suspicious about anything they should get in touch with Humberside Police immediately. A dog walker said he took his three dogs along the path at .pm on Wednesday night and he didnapost see the limb. He said: If it had been around the footpath when we were there, Iaposm sure my dogs would have found it. So I donapost think it was there the previous evening. The path is used by local schoolchildren. A mum said parents are so concerned by the discovery that more are accompanying their children on their walks to and from school. She said: One of the school kids was off school ill because he had been up all night because of the worry. Even I was worried when I went out to my wheelie bin at night in case I found something gruesome. Police have searched two large fields next to the path, and an underwater search team has scoured Buck Beck, a local stream. The search is expected to resume on Saturday.

Chris Marsh, , ditched his rented home last month in favour of the tiny  square foot wooden cabin on wheels. It boasts a master bedroom and second smaller bedroom, kitchen, double bed, washing machine, comfortable living area and large shower room over two floors. He previously rented a two-bedroom house in Hexham, Northumberland, for £ a month and forked out £ a month on electricity bills and £ on council tax.  But since spending  weeks building the new eco home himself, Chris now lives in the building almost for free after buying the land in Northumberland for £, in January with the original plan to build a full house there. Single Chris, who previously worked as a building manufacturer, now sells  of the mini homes a year to other buyers across Europe - with each one retailing for £,. He said: My old house was lovely but it wasnapost remotely economical it had single glazed windows and oil heating that Iaposd rarely put on with it being so expensive to run. The house was constantly cold and I was tired of paying out so much money each month - it was hard to maintain and keep it up to scratch.  I then came across these apostiny housesapos on an American website and thought Iaposd give it a try making one myself. Iaposve now been living in my new house full time since the end of March and completely love it - I wonapost be rushing to move back into a proper house any time soon. Since moving into the tiny house, Chris now only pays around £ a month in electricity bills and doesnapost pay for water as itaposs retrieved through a rain collection system. Chris, who lives on his own, has planning permission on the land where his house is located, meaning he is legally able to use it as a permanent form of residence.    He said the money he is saving from living in his eco house - which he only had to sacrice a few clothes to move into - is being put towards having an easier lestyle and for future retirement plans. Chrisapos business Tiny Eco Homes UK - which he launched in  - makes the properties bespoke for customers all over Europe and personally delivers them. Due to the unique materials Chris uses to build the homes, which take two to eight weeks to make depending on specications, he promises a le time guarantee as the wood wonapost rot. They are suitable for all types of weathers and climates, and are easily towed by car.    Chris, who currently has six builds on the go, said: Iaposve sold the houses to wide range of people - from young families and elderly couples, to first time buyers and people just wanting an accessible holiday home. Each house is completely dferent and I build it the way to customer wants it making. People are often shocked with how luxurious they are - many want an easy holiday home, but donapost necessarily want a caravan, so the tiny eco homes are a good in between.CHRISapos BILL BREAKDOWN: BEFOREWATER - £ELECTRICITY - £+ GAS - N A COUNCIL TAX - £ RENT - £ ANYTHING ELSE - £ TOTAL  £ CHRISapos BILL BREAKDOWN: NOW WATER - N A ELECTRICITY - £ GAS - N A COUNCIL TAX - N A RENT - N A ANYTHING ELSE - N A TOTAL  £ "},{"url":null,"title":"mum boys rare skin condition","story":"NewsMum of boys with rare skin condition heartbroken after grave was vandalisedSteph Greens sons Harry and Cody Churchill died within days of each other in Poole, Dorset, after battling epidermolysis bullosa Share\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _Steph-Green.jpg\" data-tracking\"facebook|share|\"\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _Steph-Green.jpg\" data-tracking\"messenger|share|\"\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _Steph-Green.jpg\" data-tracking\"twitter|share|\"\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _Steph-Green.jpg\" data-tracking\"whatsapp|share|\"\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _Steph-Green.jpg\" data-tracking\"linkedin|share|\"\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _Steph-Green.jpg\" data-tracking\"flipboard|share|\"\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _Steph-Green.jpg\" data-tracking\"email|share|\"CommentsByBradley Jolly:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video harry-codys-story-presented-cheryl-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Thugs have vandalised the grave of two toddlers who died of infections caused by a rare skin condition.Steph Green has been left heartbroken after finding the damage on Thursday.

The cull at Debenhams is expected to result in up to , job losses. Primark’s expansion is likely to create , jobs next year. Debenhams warned of more gloom by saying: “Further store closures to be confirmed in due course.” Bosses have already admitted they want to shut around  of its  branches in an attempt to slash costs. The initial  stores are expected to close early next year. Towns set to lose their Debenhams include Southport in Merseyside, Altrincham in Gtr Manchester, Stockton-on-Tees in Co Durham, and Chatham in Kent.    The closures are planned as part of a proposed Company Voluntary Arrangement, a process that has been used by other chains to axe branches. Debenhams is asking landlords of the  stores to halve the rent bill between now and the closures. Owners of another  branches are also being urged to agree big rent reductions. If landlords fail to back the plans, Debenhams could go bust. Executive chairman Terry Duddy said: “Debenhams has... a bright future, but for the business to prosper, we need to restructure the store portfolio and balance sheet, which are not appropriate for today’s… retail environment.” The retail firm went into a pre-pack administration this month, wiping out the stakes of all shareholders including Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley. It is now controlled by banks and hedge funds.    Debenhams announced yesterday that in the  weeks to March , sales at its UK stores slumped .%, with profits down .% to £.million.The GMB union said the store closures are “devastating” for employees, adding: “It’s time the Government stopped bickering over Brexit and did something to stem retail job losses.”The Mirror’s High Street Fightback campaign has highlighted the plight of towns.

But when he ascends the throne, he might not be known as King Charles. In fact, we might have to call him by a completely dferent name. Itaposs thought the Prince of Wales might not want to keep his name to reign as monarch thanks to negative connotations with former kings bearing the name Charles.  Itaposs not unusual for a royal to change their given name once theyaposre on the throne. When Queen Victoriaaposs son, Prince Albert Edward, became king in  he took the name Edward VII. And in  another Albert, Duke of York - the Queenaposs father - ascended the throne with the name King George VI. Both used one of their given names, just not their first name. So Prince Charles could choose Philip, Arthur or George as his aposregnalapos name. In  multiple reports circulated that Charles had held private talks with “trusted friends” about the possibility of using his third middle name, George.  Should he do this, he would reign as King George VII. Speaking to Studio , former royal butler Grant Harrold said: Normally royal children have two or three names. The reason is,possibly that child was to become a king or queen, they have to have a kind of pool to choose from. For example, Prince Charles,and when he becomes king, would be - people assume he would be Charles III.But he could technically be George VII because  George  is in his name. A former Buckingham Palace spokesperson, Dickie Arbiter, said this decision would also be a lovely tribute to Charlesapos grandparents. It would not just be a tribute to his grandfather [King George VI], but a sort of loving memory to his late grandmother, whom he absolutely adored, he told the BBC. But Clarence House quickly rubbished the claims, saying no decision had been made and it would be decided at the time Charles became king.  Given the luck of two former monarchs named King Charles, itaposs likely the Prince of Wales wonapost adopt this when he ascends the throne. Charles I, who became king in , dismissed parliament three times and resolved to rule alone four years later. He reigned without a Parliament for more than a decade, a period which was dubbed aposeleven yearsapos tyrannyapos. Following two civil wars, Charles was tried and convicted of being a apostyrant, traitor, murderer and public enemy to the good people of the nationapos and was beheaded for treason on January , . His son, Charles II, lived in exile until he was crowned King of England, Ireland and Scotland in .

Northern Ireland meanwhile is covered by a yellow rain warning, with the flooding of some homes and businesses likely. Western Power Distribution said more than , properties had been left without power on its network on Saturday morning, with the majority of those affected in Wales.    Hannah is battering Britain a day after hitting Ireland - where a red warning was issued - and leaving at least , properties without power, and a week after the UK basked in a C Easter heatwave.

Designed by prefab architecture specialists Modscape Concept, the unique building is just a concept at the moment. Aptly called Clf House, the design was created in response to a growing number of people who want to live in rocky areas deemed unlivable. The home was inspired by the shape of barnacles clinging to a hull of a ship, and it extends off the side of a clf, rather than sitting upon it.  The designers say: The unique positioning also gives the homeaposs residents an incredible connection to the ocean below, while alleviating construction problems associated with building on uneven rock. Rooms are stacked atop each other and held securely in place with engineered steel pins.

An elevator or stairs connects each floor, with the bedroom, living area and kitchen each having separate space on the ious floors.

Mariam Nabatanzi had her record number of babies by the time she was just  and all with the same father. Now , Mariam has had three sets of quadruplets, four sets of triplets and six sets of twins.Sadly, her husband walked out on her three years ago and she is now solely responsible for her huge family. Mariam, from Uganda, was married aged just  to her then -year-old husband.    Her first set of twins came along just a year later. Mariamaposs le has been marred by tragedy and she and all of her children are forced to live in four cramped homes built from cement bricks with a corrugated iron roof. They are surrounded by coffee fields. After her first sets of twins were born, Nabatanzi went to a doctor who told her she had unusually large oies. He advised her that birth control like pills might cause health problems, so the children kept coming.    Large families are common in Africa with women in Uganda giving birth to . children in average, one of the highest birth rates on the continent according to the World Bank. But even in Uganda Mariamaposs family is considered huge. By the time she was  Mariam had  children and, desperate, went back to see her doctor in a bid to stop her having any more Once again, she was advised to keep getting pregnant because he oy count was so high. Her last pregnancy, two and a half years ago, had complications.    She gave birth to her sixth set of twins, but sadly one of them died during the labour. Then her husband - often absent for long stretches - abandoned her. His name is now a family curse and Mariam swears whenever she refers to him. She said: I have grown up in tears, my man has passed me through a lot of suffering. All my time has been spent looking after my children and working to earn some money.  And with so many mouths to feed, Mariam will turn her hand to anything. She has worked as a hairdresser and an event decorator. Mariam collects and sells scrap metal, brews local gin and sells herbal medicine. Most of her wages are spent on food to feed her huge family, medical care, clothes and school fees to ensure her brood has the best start in le. On a grimy wall in one room of her home hang proud portraits of some of her children graduating from school, gold tinsel around their necks.  Her eldest child, Ivan Kibuka, had to drop out of school to help raise the family. The -year-old said: Mum is overwhelmed, the work is crushing her, we help where we can, like in cooking and washing, but she still carries the whole burden for the family. I feel for her. Mariamaposs mother walked out on her, her father and her five siblings three days after she was born. After her father remarried, her stepmother poisoned the five older children with crushed glass mixed in their food. They all died.  Mariam says she only escaped because she was visiting a relative. She added: I was seven years old then, too young to even understand what death actually meant. I was told by relatives what had happened. This harrowing tragedy sparked her desire for a huge family, although she originally hoped for six children. Providing a home for  youngsters is a constant challenge.  Twelve of the children sleep on metal bunk beds with thin mattresses in one small room with grime-caked walls. In the other rooms, children pile onto shared mattresses while the others sleep on the dirt floor. Older children help look after the young ones and everyone helps with chores like cooking. A single day can require  kilograms of maize flour, Mariam says. Fish or meat are rare treats.

took home the Local Weekly Sports Writer of the Year gong.Political reporter Adele Merson was named runner-up in the Political Journalist of the Year category – the only woman to make the shortlist – and was also runner-up in the Local Weekly Reporter of the Year award.Evening Express editor Craig Walker said: “Even before the ceremony took place, it was a successful occasion for us.“It was great

The awards are very much deserved.”Austin Lafferty, chairman of the judges for the Scottish Press Awards, said: “The press and media industry continues to change. The new model is a multi-, fast-moving online offering to targeted audiences, but traditional newspapers are not dying – they are re-forging successful ways of presenting news, analysis, features and lestyle material.“One thing’s for sure from a judging perspective – the quality of output has never been higher.”Dale revealed how the Scottish Prison Service had shut down a Facebook page belonging to a man who had been convicted of trying to kill three police officers.He also told how Snapchat had fixed a flaw that let people track messages that have been sent from or near schools and tracked down a man accused of killing an Aberdeen dad in  who was never prosecuted.Adele, who was also shortlisted for Political Journalist of the Year in , broke the news of former Aberdeen City Council spin doctor Takki Sulaiman receiving a £, pay-off from the local authority.Transport Secretary Michael Matheson also admitted in an interview with Adele that contractors hadn’t been straight with Government about the construction of the AWPR and she also revealed how the city council had appointed an employment consultant amid job role cuts.Adele was also nominated in the Local Weekly Reporter of the Year category, alongside Dale.Her highlights included revealing how an anti-Kingsford stadium group created a fake spokesman and a heartbreaking interview with the mum of a boy who fell from a block of flats and had to have half his skull removed.Meanwhile, Callum exclusively revealed Cove Rangers’ star striker Mitch Megginson had turned down the opportunity join a Premiership team in order to remain with the Balmoral Stadium side.He also told how discussions had been had about adding another tier to the Scottish football leagues – an issue of local and national signicance, while his story of Dons full-back Shay Logan admitting he’d received racist abuse from Celtic fans sparked a nationwide reaction.In the team awards, the Evening Express was nominated for its collaboration with the Edinburgh Evening News following the SPFL’s decision to hold both League Cup semi-finals at Hampden on the same day."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/04/2.42499714-1-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/04/2.42499714-1-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/04/2.42499714-1-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/04/2.42499714-1-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"discussions to continue over future of charitys aberdeen base","story":"An MSP has said discussions will continue with a children’s charity which faces losing its Aberdeen base.Aberdeen Donside MSP Mark McDonald hosted talks at Holyrood yesterday with management of Children st and other north-east MSPs after the charity announced funding struggles.The national charity has said its Aberdeen premises in North Silver Street could close as it looks to “redevelop” the services it provides after losing its core funding from Aberdeen City Council two years ago.He said: “The round table has proved informative and given us all a better understanding of Children’s st’s plans moving forward.“Children st recognise the emerging and changing needs of children need to be met throughout Scotland, and have reiterated their commitment to deliver appropriate support to families in the north-east.“A commitment was agreed from MSPs in attendance to be involved in the ongoing discussions around the role Children st can play in supporting families in the north-east, and I look forward to continuing these conversations with both Children st and local statutory bodies.”Five members of staff are facing redundancy at the charity as a result of the changes.The organisation, which provides hands-on support to meet the needs of families under stress due to a range of issues including poverty, mental health and alcohol or drug misuse, invested £, in its Aberdeen service last year alone.Children st chief executive Mary Glasgow said: “We welcome the interest and support shown by MSPs from across the north-east in the future development of our work to prevent childhood trauma and adversity in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire.“We also continue to have positive discussions with Aberdeen City Council.“Children st remain committed to co-designing and co-producing innovative and sustainable new services with children and families and other stakeholders, including MSPs, and our fantastic local fundraisers and supporters.”The charity previously committed to supporting the children and families in Aberdeen it is currently working with until the end of May.

Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"strathlachlan cup attracts players from all over argyll","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe annual Strathlachlan Cup Open Pairs indoor bowling competition took place on Saturday February  at Strachur Memorial Hall.There was a good turnout of  pairs with members from Cairnbaan, Colintraive, Connel, Innellan, Inveraray, Kilmun as well as the host club  Strathlachlan.There were some close games in the qualying rounds and the lucky four pairs to reach the semi-finals were Tom Paton and Moira Robertson, Strathlachlan Myra Campbell and Duncan Lauder, Innellan Fulton Ronald, Connel, and Robert Scott, Cairnbaan, and John #Joe# Campbell and Ross Speirs Senior, Strathlachlan.The finalists were Strathlachlan#s John #Joe# Campbell and Ross Speirs v Fulton Ronald and Robert Scott, with the visiting team going into the last end one shot up.

What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks.

Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"athletes tackle the crinan puffer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOver  pairs of running shoes were strapped on for this year#s Scottish Sea Farms Crinan Puffer on Sunday March .Athletes from as far as Dunoon, Campbeltown, Mid Argyll and beyond came to join the race # billed as one of Scotland#s friendliest and most inclusive running events.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a £, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14580367.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_180419rugby_02JPG.jpg","title":"ayr rugby club prepare murrayfield","story":"NewsAyr Rugby Club prepare for Murrayfield date with destiny against HeriotsThe club will bid to land a fourth Scottish Cup and complete a league and cup double this season when they head for the capital on Saturday.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  APR NewsAyr Rugby coach Peter Murchie and his players \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Make mine a double, writes Ron Evans.That was the cry at Millbrae when the pink and black faithful realised that their team had created the chance to win the Tennent’s Premiership and the Scottish Cup in what will be the last opportunity to achieve this feat under the current league set-up. Ayr have been there before of course in  when they won the Premiership by defeating Currie then the Cup final against Melrose with the unforgettable Cammy Taylor try in the injury time of extra time. This time, however, they take on Heriot’s in both games. Having won the epic Tennent’s Premiership play-off final against the Goldenacre outfit two weeks ago, the Nailsare again Ayr’s opponents on Saturday in the cup final at Murrayfield. It might be inappropriateto suggest that Ayr are going out to hammer the Nails on Saturday, but that is exactly what they plan to do. Now in possession of more senior cup and league medals than any other Scottish player, veteran full back Grant Anderson told some of the rookies for whom this is a first- time experience: “You think beating Heriots at Millbrae was good  “Doing it at Murrayfield will feel a hundred times better!” Skipper Pete McCallum, heading for his third cup final at Murrayfield with a won one lost one record, certainly agreed that it was great chance for the players to express themselves on the big stage. “Playing on the international pitch is always something really special so we want to enjoy the occasion and go out with a bang,” he said.  As was the case at Millbrae, there will be little to choose between the two sides, their regular league form having panned out with an away win each but in the winner-takes- all contest for the Premiership title showdown, Ayr were superior. “Yes, we are in a good place but there will be no complacency” said coach Peter Murchie. “It was a physical game and we would expect the same in the cup final. “Thankfully we didn’t pick up any injuries and we were able to give the squad a bit of a rest after the last game which has let us build gradually towards Murrayfield.” “The squad are totally motivated as you would expect from any team going into a cup final becauseyou can’t be motivated for that then I donapost know what would get you up for a game. “I have said several times to the squad that opportunities like this don’t come along very often in your career and you have to take those opportunities and make the very best of it. “Some of our squad have experienced this situation before and our senior players will be a big part of what we achieve but we have some really exciting young talent as well so we will give it our best shot and hopefully have a great finish to what has already been a memorable season.” It has indeed been memorable andAyr do add a fourth Scottish Cup success to the Tennent’s Premiership title, then the call will likely be for trebles not doubles all round. Good luck. Good luck.A ticket for the Millbrae breakfast,coach travel and entrance to the match is £.Other options include £ for match ticket and coach travel and £ for the match ticket only.

The cash withdrawals took place between July  and May  and Cowan helped herself to more than £, of the patient’s savings. The Scottish Social Services Councilheard how the offence came to light when the victim, known only as ‘AA’ and requiring “multiple care needs” decided to alert care home staff, believing that the money would never be repaid.When shocked senior staff at Glebe House found out about the incidents they called the police and reported the matter to the Care Inspectorate and the SSSC. But in the subsequent investigation, Cowan was understood to have shown “limited insight and remorse” in respect of her actions. The victim gave evidence during the hearing, telling the SSSC’s Fitness to Practise Panel how, during a conversation with Cowan, she told her she was “worried about money.” The victim initially offered Cowan money but that invitation was declined. However, in a later conversation, around a week later, Cowan, who had no previous record of wrong-doing with the SSSC, indicated that she “needed a certain amount of money.” On this occasion Cowan was given the lady’s bank card and PIN and the service user believed £ would be withdrawn. In the weeks and months thereafter, a similar scenario took place “several times.” Several cash withdrawals took place from the ATM at the Co-operative, Dalmellington. Cowan then came up with a “sob story” about a family member’s Christmas present and again, the patient handed over her bank card. This pattern continued and the patient did not report the matter at that point because Cowan “promised to pay it back” and she “believed her.” However, the victim’s concerns grew and she reported the matter to other members of staff after fearing she wasn’t going to get her money back. Another witness claimed she was “shocked” that a carer had taken a resident’s bank card and withdrawn money for her own use. During the investigation process Cowan started to make repayments of the outstanding amount. At the hearing in Dundee the victim was described as a “lonely and vulnerable inidual” but “very switched on” and an “impressive witness” who gave her evidence in a forthright manner and was found to be both “credible” and “reliable.” In their written judgement the SSSC found Cowan’s conduct fell “far below the standards” expected, labelled her actions were “serious and deliberate” and amounted to a “signicant breach of trust.” The Panel also stated they could not be satisfied that Cowan had “acknowledged the gravity” of her conduct, or that she demonstrated “meaningful regret.” The judgement concluded: “A Removal Order is the only sanction that will provide an adequate safeguard against yourepeating your misconduct. “It is the only sanction that will ensure that service users are not placed at risk of harm and will maintain public confidence in social services and the SSSC as regulator.” Cowan was neither present nor represented at the hearing. A spokesperson for East Ayrshire Council said: “We are aware of the situation and understand that care home management acted appropriately in conjunction with Scottish Social Service Council and Care Inspectorate when they learned about allegations against the member of staff. “Through our contract management arrangements we actively engage with all the care homes in East Ayrshire to provide assurance in respect of the quality of service provided to residents.” The Post did contact Glebe House Care Home for a response but did not receive one.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrEast Ayrshire CouncilSocial servicesDundee"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14579806.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_010419county_07JPG.jpg","title":"behind scenes south ayrshire council","story":"NewsBehind the scenes at South Ayrshire Council headquartersCounty Buildings mixes antiques with new modern offices in this revealing look behind the scenesShareBySarah Hilley:,  APR NewsCouncillors library at County Buildings \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIt is home to antiques, grand paintings and museum treasures. But historic County Buildings is also a modern workplace housing  staff delivering services for more than , people in South Ayrshire. From the grandeur of Provost Helen Moonie’s luxurious sea-view office to the dingy corridors of the basement, the  landmark is full of character. Our Local Democracy Reporter went on a ‘behind the scenes’ tour guided by council depute chief executive Douglas Hutchison. Looking around County Buildings, it is clear to see that history speaks through the detailed decor oozing out of every cornice. Two sweeping staircases sparkle with stunning stained-glass windows which hark back to the time when the whole of Ayrshire was ided into burghs. Each burgh had a crest, which are intricately etched into the glass. They include Ayr, Irvine, Troon Prestwick, Darvel, Kilmarnock, Largs and Saltcoats among others.  Nowadays Ayrshire is ruled by three separate councils but the County Buildings design still echoes a past when Ayr reigned supreme. Its former position of housing the entire admininstrative work of the county is reflected in its extravagant architecture. The main council chambers where all major decisions take place have sleek slide-back oak  – which open into other rooms. The chambers could have one of the finest council views in the country overlooking the Firth of Clyde. Every committee room has an open fireplace, which would have warmed the wind-battered building before central heating. Another room has a glass display cabinet showing a town clerk wig and Royal Burgh of Ayr Truncheon among other artefacts. Councillors have their own swish ‘members library’ with newspapers, tea and coffee. The details of meetings taking place behind closed doors are still written in old-fashioned chalk on the front of blackboards. Showing us around, Mr Hutchison said: “This the front face of the council where the council business takes place.” The director of people also took us to a secret location – a secure vault – which opens into a large room for storingpostal votes.Now there is a mission to make the historic building more up to date to adhere with current workday practices. The original architecture is in conflict with the needs of a al workplace where open-plan is the norm. Attempts to fit more people into open- plan space means walls must come down but due to the listed status of the landmark all alterations must be carefully managed. There is also a need to make room for staff coming from the John Pollock centre and soon-to-be demolished Burns House. In contrast to the splendid offices and committee meeting rooms on the first floor, a newly renovated office for employee services staff features skylights and a purple meeting pod. Mr Hutchison said: “It is a lovely building. But trying to fit a modern working environment into an old building is not easy. There is a lot going on to make it more modern. We need to make more efficient use of space. The days of everybody turning up at their desks are gone. We have to work more flexibly.” Mr Hutchison showed us empty offices stripped bare, which are currently awaiting a facelt. Money to maintain the seat of power is ongoing with windows getting replaced along with other repairs. Mr Hutchison said: “There is a programme of general investment in the building.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsMuseumsKilmarnockIrvineCosmetic surgeryFirth of ClydeTroonDarvelPrestwickLargsSaltcoats"},{"url":null,"title":"debenhams ayr stay open department","story":"NewsDebenhams in Ayr to stay open as department store announces list of  stores to closeThe department store giant has revealed the first list of stores set to close early next year.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  APR NewsDebenhams is an anchor store for Ayr Central \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailScores of jobs have been spared after Debenhams confirmed their outlet in Ayr Central shopping mall is to survive an initial axe.

The former Belmont Academy pupil said: “I was over the moon to find out I was a finalist as I really did not expect it. “I’ve followed Miss Scotland for years on social media. “It’s not a beauty pageant. It’s more like a ambassador for your own country - and I love Scotland.” Miss Scotland aims to raise funds for charities across the country, with each finalist raising money for a cause she chooses herself.    Carly said: “The winner represents Scotland at Miss World in Thailand in November. “Each winner tries to raise awareness and as much funds as possible. “Some girls have raised over £, for their charity and all funds stay in Scotland. “It’s the beauty with a purpose challenge which helps you gain points at Miss World.” And Carly wants to make others look and feel beautul as she is currently studying the profession at college. She said: “I am studying hair, beauty and make-up at Ayr College and loving the course so far. “My goal is to be happy and continue with my college education.” In between her studies, waitressing job at Mr Basrai’s World Cuisine and Miss Scotland responsibilities busy Carly still finds the time to raise money for charities close to her heart. She will be hosting a psychic night next month with ticket funds going towards Scottish Association for Mental Healthand private readings funds going to a charity for epilepsy. Carly said: “My next step would be to raise money for as many charities as possible as that’s what I love doing.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14564550.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18934953.jpg","title":"partick thistle chairman shares tweet","story":"NewsPartick Thistle chairman shares tweet showing injured wrist after celebrating Jags win against Ayr UnitedJacqui Low led from the front as Partick gained a massive win in their battle to beat the drop.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  APR NewsJacqui shows off her injured hand, left, and chats to boss Gary Caldwell before last nights clash\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA football chairman took one for the team last night - after injuring herself celebrating a vital three points.

That’s because Joe, who has died aged , was a one-man citizens’ advice bureau. Joe was incredibly well-versed on how local government works. And he knew the right people to contact in a range of agencies, including South Ayrshire Council. In recent years, Joe was best known as chairman of Riverside Tenants and Residents Association. But he was equally weel kent in the Lochside and Wallacetoun areas - working passionately to improve the housing stock. Joe seemed to be involved in everything pertaining to housing and community issues. He worked alongside Shelter, learning about legislation on homelessness. He also had close links with Riverside Evangelical Church and the Salvation Army - respecting the wonderful work they do in the community. Joe was also involved with the John Pollock Centre, the Mainholm Advice Centre and was on the Community Planning Board. He was a member of the late lamented Wallacetoun and Newton Regeneration Forumwhich provided a focal point for five communities in Ayr. Joe Lafferty hailed from Newarthill, Lanarkshire, and was a choirboy in his youth. He loved singing right up to his untimely death, being a member of the Ayrways Choir, which helps people with breathing dficulties. In his late teenage years and throughout his s, Joe worked abroad for much of the time. He was a project manager on building sites in countries including Nigeria and Pakistan. Joe ed to Scotland after his marriage to Jean, and became aware of the need for communities to have a voice. This became the driving force in the second half of his le. David Burns, South Ayrshire Council’s former head of housing, said he was sorry to hear of Joe’s passing. Mr Burns added: “He was a wonderful gentleman, always taking a keen interest wherever he felt there was a benefit for the community orhe felt ideas would have a detrimental impact on people. “He also made sure I kept my feet on the ground and often said, ‘Don’t change your ability to listen to the community boy, and you’ll do just rightly.” Joe was highly thought of by many senior SAC managers, and often engaged in banter with them, to make his point. Colleague and friend Pauline Mackie said of Joe: “He was never a man who shied away from his own past mistakes and was always very courteous and generous about others as well. He was never a man to bare a grudge. “His wisdom and knowledge along with his sense of humour made him legendary . People were drawn to him even though it meant not getting much of a word in once he got started. He was always courteous and never lost his sense of humour. “Joe also believed in sharing the knowledge he had gleaned over  years, believing knowledge would empower people and communities.” Pauline added: “ Joe, myself and Jackie Lennon considered ourselves the Three Musketeers in the Wallacetoun and Newton Regeneration Forum. “I believe we did make a dference to a lot of people, but sadly the project came to an end.” Joe’s funeral service will be held at noon at Masonhill Crematorium on April  - which would have been his st birthday. He is survived by Jean and their sons, Jack and Jamie, of whom he was immensely proud, and who, like their dad, have worked abroad.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilArmed forcesAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"new-toy-museum-location-and-thirlestane-castle-events","story":"Thirlestane Castle have announced an exciting programme for the summer, including an open-air cinema, and a new location for the Toy Museum.The castlersquos historic toy collection, which features toys, games and pictures from the past, has been relocated to the former school room on the upper ground floor.Thanks to the new location, the Toy Museum now resembles the scene of an early th century nursery in a country house, and it will prove a little wonderland for visiting children.The collection showcases items loaned from the Pollock Toy Museum in London, as well as the belongings of children who once lived at the castle.The castle, which dates back to the th century, is still the family home of the Maitlands.Edward Maitland-Carew said: ldquoIrsquom delighted our fantastic collection of historic toys will be back on display and am eagerly anticipating all of the special events, particularly the new Open-Air Cinema screenings.Thirlestane Castle features some of the finest decorative plasterworks in Europe, and one of the most extensive family collections of portraits and busts in Scotland.Mr Maitland-Carew said: ldquoItrsquos always an exciting time as we approach the start of a new visitor season here at Thirlestane Castle and I am delighted to be able to share Thirlestane Castle with visitors once again.ldquoWe are looking forward to welcoming back familiar faces, not least our wonderful volunteers, the Friends of Thirlestane.Attractions available every day include the Team Room and Gt Shop.

This mast should provide an lsquoemergency servicersquo for all the local residents and businesses should our land lines fail, as they frequently do.ldquoThere have been many occasions when accidents have happened with no means of getting help.ldquoThis will also be a great asset to tourists and traffic passing through our valley.The local branch of the National Farmers Union, which counts  members, has also thrown its weight behind the proposals.In a support letter, Selkirk branch secretary Rory Murray writes: ldquoIt is vital that in todayrsquos connected world, basic services now include the provision of a reliable mobile network, and not just for the obvious benefits to rural safety, should people be stranded without signal.ldquoA solid G signal will transform many agricultural-based businessrsquo ability to complete basic tasks that are now exclusively online, as the time constraints poor mobile phone signal and broadband signal places on rural businesses is a very real worry for our members.Despite this, Scottish Borders Council has received nine letters of objection to the plans, with objectors citing the height of the mast, the impact on the landscape and the potential detrimental impact on property prices.Mr Brian Russell, of Selkirk, writes in his objection letter: ldquoThat the Ettrick valley must have mobile masts is disappointing to those of us who came here to escape such things.ldquoOf course escape is now becoming impossible anywhere on this island, but at the very least we had hoped to be allowed to live far enough away from a base station not to be adversely affected.ldquoHealth concerns for masts and cell phones are largely discounted now, but itrsquos as well to remember that the questionable safety of very profitable technologies may not come out for decades after their introduction, e.g. in the s and s there was widespread use of agrochemicals. I was a farmer at that time and was told they were perfectly safe. Many of the chemicals we were using then have now been banned as unsafe for one reason or another.ldquoI fear the same sort of thing will happen with mobile technologies, the overuse of which masts like this one will encourage ndash technologies which are described as essential but are more often than not simply recreational or convenient.In a submission to council planners, the developers have tried to address some of the issues raised by the objectors.Damian Hosker, the principal planner at WHP Telecoms, writes: ldquoG connectivity enables iniduals and businesses to work and ecommerce effectively from home.ldquoThis means that car travel can be reduced which has a positive effect on the environment.ldquoMobile connectivity creates a sustainable community and promotes environmental issues.ldquoThe proposal is set against the backdrop of the forest. The screening could not be more prominent. WHP will, however, paint the installation green or brown or whatever colour the local planning authority wishes to see.ldquoThe value of property is not a planning issue, however, in an age where connectivity is ever more important for e-commerce, including: real-time tax s education health services requirement to attract tourists social wellbeing and emergencies there is expected to be a positive value to property as a result of being connected.ldquoNo connectivity in the UK is not acceptable to purchasers in the st century.As a result of the number of objections received, the application will be decided by councillors sitting on the Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning and building standards committee.The committee is due to meet on Monday, April  to deliberate on the proposals."},{"url":null,"title":"community-group-targets-steading-to-ease-ettrick-housing-demand","story":"PLANS are in place for a community development company to buy a redundant steading in the Ettrick Valley to ease housing pressures.With many farm and estate cottages being sold over the past decade or so, affordable rentable accommodation in the rural valleys south of Selkirk has dwindled.The Ettrick and Yarrow Community Development Companyhope to reverse the trend by buying Kirkhope Steading, outside of Ettrickbridge, and convert the buildings into inexpensive homes to rent.EYCDC have also launched a housing survey to identy the demand for affordable housing in the area.The group have commissioned Rural Housing Scotland to independently run the survey to gauge opinion on affordable rent, buying prices, size and type of home required.A paper copy of the survey, along with a reply paid envelope, can be found in the Post Office in Selkirk, Honey Cottage Caravan Park shop in Ettrick, the Cross Keys pub in Ettrickbridge and from the Gordon Arms in Yarrow.The survey form can also be filled in online at https:www.surveymonkey r TNDLDIn , a full survey was carried out which highlighted a need for more affordable housing in the Ettrick and Yarrow Valleys.And it is thought the need has increased signicantly during the past  years.Project Manager of EYCDC, Vicky Davidson said: ldquoWe are concerned that the lack of affordable housing is impacting on the number of children living in the valleys, with fewer families and young people able to find somewhere to live.\"We are urging anyone who might be interested in living in the valleys but do not think they are able to find a suitable house, at an affordable rent, to complete the housing survey as soon as possible.\"And to pass on the survey link to anyone who might like toto live there now or within the next couple of yearsthere was an affordable option available.\"The EYCDCs plans for Kirkhope Steading include some workspace areas and potential office units as well as rentable housing.Funding has been provided by the Scottish Land Fund to carry out an independent valuation, get a structural engineers report and to prepare some architect options for the site.This work is now complete and it was presented to a public meeting in Ettrickbridge on April .The proposal is to start work on the site in the beginning of  and be at completion during spring the following year.For more information contact info@ettrickandyarrow.org.uk"},{"url":null,"title":"council-to-chip-in-extra-42k-for-hawick-regeneration-scheme","story":"SCOTTISH Borders Council has agreed to chip in an extra pound, for a Hawick regeneration scheme, in order to receive a million pound grant from Scottish ministers.The local authority has already been awarded pound.m from Historic Environment Scotland to fund the Hawick Conservation Area Regeneration Scheme .However, the council intended to provide just pound, to the pot, to acquire a pound.m grant, but instead has had to stump up an extra pound, in order to secure pound.m.Along with private sector contributions of pound,, the project will have a budget of pound.m to go towards restoring shop fronts and historic buildings in the town centre.At a meeting of Scottish Borders Council executive committee on Tuesday, April , councillors waved through the extra money and emphasised the positives the CARS scheme will bring to Hawick.Hawick and Hermitage councillor George Turnbull told the meeting: ldquoThis is a great news item for Hawick and will help with the town centre regeneration.ldquoIrsquod just like to publicly record my thanks to the team which has put in so much work to achieve this, I wish the project well and every success over the next five years.Kelso and District councillor Tom Weatherston, who has experienced the CARS scheme in Kelso, added: ldquoI welcome this as great news for Hawick.

However, Mr Cameron had failed to noty Scottish Borders Council planners about the change of use, who found out once concerned neighbours began to complain about noise disturbances by rowdy hen parties.In November , Mr Cameron received an enforcement notice from the council outlining its grievances, which included concerns over noise disturbances, a detrimental impact on residential amenity and a breach of planning protocol.Mr Cameron subsequently appealed to the Scottish Governmentrsquos department for planning and environmental appeals , saying that because the property has been used for this purpose for more than ten years the council could no longer object to the change of use.The appeal statement also outlines the steps Mr Cameron has made in order to mitigate the noise disturbances from his property.This includes removing two hot tubs from the rear of the building, and instead installing a new one in the spa, which has triple-glazing to minimise noise impact.Mr Cameron has also proposed to remove the barbeque facility from the rear decking of the property, in an effort to stop groups of guests congregating outside.Finally, Mr Cameron has proposed employing a night manager to monitor the property and sound levels between pm and am on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, and to give the four closest neighbours a direct line to the night manager to raise any issues immediately.Despite this, the DPEA has ruled against the West Linton businessman, and has been two months to cease using the property as a party mansion.Chirs Norman, a DPEA reporter appointed by Scottish Ministers, writes in his ruling: ldquoBefore  November  the availability of lsquoGreenloaningrsquo for holiday letting, and its limited use for  weeks, was ordinarily incidental to its main use as a house.ldquoSome two or three years after  November  it ceased to be the appellantrsquos main residence.ldquoFrom  lsquoGreenloaningrsquo was continually promoted and used as self-catering accommodation for short-stay lets.ldquoOn the balance of probability and on the basis of the evidence before me I find that the unauthorised change of use of the house occurred between  November  and  November .ldquoTherefore the council is not time-barred from taking enforcement action and the appellantrsquos appeal fails.ldquoI find that the house is accessed from an unsurfaced road in the north-east part of West Linton and is in an area characterised by large, in the main, detached houses set in substantial garden grounds in a semi-rural part of the village.ldquoIts location some  metres from the A  and the centre of the village means that residents in the area enjoy a very high standard of amenity.ldquoI have studied the representations on the case and note the alleged impact on residential amenity caused by the use of the property for short-stay letting.ldquoI further note that the appellant has taken steps to curtail the effects of the unauthorised use, and in particular noise and alleged anti-social behaviour.ldquoI am also mindful of the support given by persons staying at lsquoGreenloaningrsquo to businesses in the village.ldquoHowever, I conclude that the unauthorised use of lsquoGreenloaningrsquo has an unacceptable impact on the character of the established amenity in this generally quiet part of West Linton.ldquoExternal activity can arise after . hours and a signicant change into the quiet residential area has been introduced.ldquoThe two-month time period for the cessation of the use is reasonable, given the impact of the unauthorised development on the amenity of this part of West Linton."},{"url":null,"title":"explorers-great-mystery-comes-to-borders-stages","story":"A LIGHT-HEARTED romp featuring starvation, scurvy, cannibalism and some jolly tunes comes to the Borders next week.The new play by Peter Arnott for Mull Theatre, Unspotted Snow, is based on the tale of Sir John Franklinrsquos ill-fated expedition to discover the Northwest Passage.In , Franklin and  men sailed off to discover a route from the Atlantic to the Pacic via the north coast of Canada, but were never seen again.A bold and adventurous account of tragedy, mishap, folly, arrogance and madness, it also serves as a cautionary tale of true-blue British heroism ndash and some ruthless news management.After nine years, news of the expedition was at last brought to London by the remarkable Orcadian explorer and physician John Rae, who worked for the Hudsonrsquos Bay Company.The news he brought was both tragic and grizzly. Unfortunately for Rae, it was the wrong story ndash true, but wrong in that it was not the story that Victorian England wanted.Unspotted Snow is a play of two halves: the first set on the barren ice flows of the Arctic and the second in the equally inhospitable environment of Lady Jane Franklinrsquos drawing room.As playwright Arnott explained, unlike Franklin and the majority of th century British explorers, Rae was uninterested in conquest and the imposition of religious, commercial, or imperial norms on the wilderness.ldquoLike John Muir in Calornia, he anticipated a much more lsquomodernrsquo holistic approach to the natural world, not seeing people as being conquerors of empty space but as inhabitants of a planet shared with other forms of le, he said.The story of the expedition has fascinated the general public, scientists and explorers for over  years.From early findings of frozen corpses and a few artefacts to the very recent discoveries of the expeditionrsquos boats, the Erebusand the Terror , successive generations have been enthralled by the ambition and daring-do of the explorers and by their terrying, macabre fate.That fascination, and the split between two realities, is emphasised by the two-part nature of the play.ldquoIn the first half, a kind of horror-comedy, we have an encounter between three of the last survivors of Franklinrsquos expedition and some Inuit ladies to whom they utterly fail to explain themselves, explained Arnott.ldquoAnd then, in a curious echo of that, we have the inhospitable wilderness of Lady Franklinrsquos Drawing Room, where John Rae again finds himself telling a story that his audience simply cannot, or will not, understand.Unspotted Snow will be performed at the MacArts in Galashiels on Thursday, May  and the following evening at the Eastgate Theatre in Peebles.Tickets for the Galashiels performance, priced at pound and pound, are available from the box office at   .And the Eastgate performance tickets, priced at pound, pound and pound for Under s, are available on  , or online at www.eastgateartsBoth performances begin at .pm."},{"url":null,"title":"dunaverty golfers april medal","story":"None more so than Campbell MacBrayne.

seeing the right clinician at the right time for their specic needs.The new service, developed in partnership by Riverside, NHS  and ELHSCP, ensured that urgent care was dealt with on the same day and patients should have ldquono anxieties about being seen by the right professional at the right time.Through this new way of delivering patient care, it not only provided an increase in the number of patient appointments with practice GPs and other healthcare professionals, but also provided an increase in appointmentfor patients with complex needs.A recent survey conducted within the practice demonstrated that more than half of patients agreed that they did not always need to see a GP.Work is also under way by ELHSCP to implement a new telephone and IT system that will support call demand into the practice.The importance of patient involvement in getting services right is ldquovery much recognised by the practice, which is encouraging residents to get involved with the Patient Participation Group.Speaking after meeting with the Cabinet Secretary, Mr Beattie said: ldquoI would like to assure all of my constituents that patient care is of paramount importance and that all

other organisations to ensure that improvements are made and I would encourage anyone with any issues regarding the practice to get in touch with them and become involved with the patient

at st lbs, lost four-and-a-half stones to get to st lbs since they joined Weight Watchers in June last year.Their journey started after the couple, who have a teenage son, booked a holiday to Florida.Carole said: ldquoI was so excited but the plane journey going left me feeling humiliated and not happy as I had to request a seatbelt extension as I could not fasten the original seatbelt. Thankfully no one heard me asking for it but the embarrassment of having to ask was enough to spur me on.ldquoAt this point, on what should have been an exciting time, I was left feeling down, and it was then that I decided that it was time to lose weight.ldquoNever again did I want to be in that position of asking for an extension. The next time I was flying I wanted to be able to buckle up like any other person.ldquoWhen I ed, I decided to join Weight Watchers at Musselburgh Hope Church, and it was the best decision I have ever made.ldquoI have now lost more than four-and-a-half stones and feel fantastic.

I knew I had to lose weight but I just never had the motivation to do anything about it.ldquoMy we was looking amazing and it was then that I knew it was time for me to get on the Weight Watchers wagon. Irsquom so glad I joined with Carole as I find it easy to follow.ldquoI can still eat my favourite snacks ndash crisps ndash which is something I was not prepared to give up. Thankfully I can enjoy these and still lose weight.ldquoDoing the Freestyle plan with Carole is really good although we do not always eat the same foods. The choice of foods that we can enjoy and eat means both us can enjoy what we want.ldquoThe support from the coach Lisa is fantastic and sometimes Irsquom the only male who stays for the weekly talk. This does not phase me as my weight loss is too important and everyone is really friendly. Even when my we canrsquot make it, I go on my own. Men should not be afraid of joining as Irsquove had a fantastic weight loss.ldquoMy food choices are now better and I pay more attention to what I eat. We both used to eat things like large bars of chocolate, deep-pan pizzas, lots of bread and cheese. There was no thought to what we were eating.ldquoWe now eat better with lots of fresh fruit and veg, and have more thought in what we are preparing and eating and are both enjoying our food much better.He added: ldquoA big tick to myself is that I can now buy jeans in Primark ndash something I was not able to do before.

Before that I had been at Stirling Albion for a decade so Irsquove been doing this for a while now.Irsquom there mainly to be an ear or a sounding board. Itrsquos more than a social worker as therersquos a pastoral element to it as well. And Irsquom there for all the clubrsquos staff and their families, not just the players and the coaches. Maintaining confidences and trust is key.On a Friday I train with the players. I take part in the warm-up and then often join in with the under-s. I try to keep up with them, although I end up being the ball boy half the time. Irsquom getting old now so itrsquos still a great feeling when I can nutmeg one of the young lads. After that Irsquoll have lunch with the players and wersquoll have a bit of a chat.I usually get referred to as The Rev or Padre. One of the players even calls me Pope. Therersquos a bit of banter too and Irsquom sometimes the butt of their jokes but you just have to go along with that.Irsquom a Christian so that will always be a part of what I do. Many players have no faith or a nominal faith. Sometimes, though, in a quieter dressing room you might get a player suddenly asking, ldquoSo, Rev, what are you preaching about on Sunday  and I then have a right to answer that.Irsquod never go into a group and say, ldquoLet me tell you about Jesus, guys. When a player is injured I donrsquot go up and offer to pray for them. There are times when a player might ask me to do that. But itrsquos not about me preaching. I leave that to Sunday at church.Whenever a new player signs Irsquom over right away to introduce myself. If theyrsquove not had a chaplain at their previous club, they sometimes donrsquot know how to react. Some even stop swearing when yoursquore in their company! But with time most of them realise yoursquore just there to help themthey need it.For the first half-season or so I didnrsquot go near the players at all. I didnrsquot want the club to think I was only there because I was in awe of them. So at the start I devoted more time to talking with the staff and that was great. It got my face known and people became more comfortable with me. And at the start of the second season I had the freedom to go around the place.After month after month of seeing you around, people might come up to you and ask, ldquoRev, could I meet up with you after training in a private place  I want to chat about something thatrsquos going on with my family. And then you help them through those situations.I went on a two-day mental health training course at Hampden. That was exhausting but insightful. It also taught me how to redirect people to get proper professional helpthey need it. Sothere are health issues you make sure they get proper medical support. If itrsquos gambling there are people who specialise in that as well.Irsquove already got a full-time job so donrsquot get paid for being chaplain. This is just my service to the club.

Soon you will reach a small side road branching off to the left signposted The Golden Road, so called because its tortuous route through the intricate landscape of the Bays of Harris made it extremely expensive to build. Before its construction in the s, all traffic between the villages went either on foot or by boat.Head downhill into the village of Miabhaig which is the first of many villages you will pass through. The Golden Road winds and twists through the east coast of Harris, sometimes called the Bays because of its miniature fjords. The single track road connects all the clachans or townships, which have either Viking or Gaelic names.The best part of the route is that it is the bends are almost D and every few seconds the view changes and shows the rough side of Harris. Soyou get to the Golden Road, you see the other side of the island known for some fantastic beaches.As you wind your way along it, at no great speed, you will pass small cottage industries, local artists, crafts and traditional Harris Tweed weavers along with seals and otters relaxing on the seaweed clad rocks. Many little bays are seen on the sea side of the road and old paths are signposted for walks on these vintage ways that were the only ways before the road was build.The mixture of sea, loch, Lewisian gneiss, heather and wet green and little rounded hills makes for a striking landscape as the road winds through lochans with water lilies and bog bean in amongst the lunar rocky landscape. Its like nowhere  in Scotland.Along the way stop at the Tweed exhibition Clograve-Mograver at Drinishader, where you can see the sheds of the weavers next to many houses. The Bays of Harris has enticed many artists over the years who have been attracted by the ever changing light and complex landscape.If you fancy a break, call in at one of a number of galleries along your way ndash some have excellent cafeacutes. Just after the turn off to one of these ndash Holmasaig Gallery at Cuidhtinis ndash the road descends to the shore. Keep following the signs for Roghadal , ignoring any side roads, and once there you will find St Clementrsquos Church, perched spectacularly on a rock.Rodel was once the main town of Harris and the Skye ferry used to leave from here but now it is a tranquil harbour and many ers view Rodel as a perfect ing destination in Scotland.From here head towards Leverburgh and back onto the A towards Tarbert. On the way marvel at Luskentyre Bay, possibly the finest white beach outside the Caribbean and follow the road for the final climb of the day back over the moonscape. So alien is its appearance, the area was used by Stanley Kubrick as the surface of Jupiter in his famous film,  ndash A Space Odyssey.The climb is long and unrelenting, but eventually you will be rewarded with a tremendous sweeping descent back to Tarbert.Pit stop: Various cafes in Leverburgh, including the Butty BusALAN SIMPSONHow long   miles, three-and-a-half hoursWhat makes it so special  Driving into Scotland by the scenic routeLeft, right or middle  Left is the quickest, straight up the Afrom Carlisle . Right, via Berwick on Tweed, you wind your way along the south-east coastline, past Lindisafarne, beaches and caravans and a nuclear power station, which has its own sci-fi charm.But middle is best. Middle is the A. Middle starts in Darlington, runs up over the Tyne and rolls and bumps through rural Northumberland and then begins to climb into the Cheviot Hills until, at ftin altitude, it reaches Carter Bar on the border and suddenly Scotland is laid out in front of you.Ancient Romans, English soldiers, Scottish soldiers theyrsquove all come this way .It must have been a miserable march. But driving it is a rollercoaster of blind summits and stunning vistas and, once yoursquore in Scotland, the delights of Jedburgh and Lauder.If you have the time, detour at St Boswells to Dryburgh to see Walter Scottrsquos famous view.Pit Stop: Try Carfraemill in Lauder at the foot of the Lammermuir Hills.TEDDY JAMIESONThe Cool List:  Scottish golf courses every fan must playHow long   miles,  minutesWhat makes it so special: A scenic coastal drive with points of interest round every bend.This section of East Lothian is being branded as Scotlands Golf Coast ndash starting at the Musselburgh Links, Scotlands oldest golf club, it takes in fine links courses such as Longniddry, Gullane , Muirfield, Archerfield and North Berwick. Watch out for cyclists ndash part of this route is also the John Muir Way.Dont worryyou dont want to pack the plus-fours and the Pings ndash this short stretch has something for all the family. Starting at Musselburgh, you take the left fork down the coastand proceed through Prestonpans . You will quickly pass through Cockenzie ndash now minus the iconic twin chimneys of the recently-demolished power station ndash and Port Seton. Each boasts a picturesque harbour, and the three villages are something of an artists colony, Port Seton being the birthplace of John Bellany.Theres a fine picnic stop at Longniddry Bents, where you can exercise youngsters and empty the dog, before the traffic crawls through Aberlady and Gullane. Take a short detour to see the ruined medieval fortress of Dirleton Castlebefore ending up at North Berwick, where you can take in the beach, some bespoke shops, and marvel at how many xs can cram into such narrow streets.Pit stops: Since this is such a short drive, pit stops are best on thejourney: start with fish and chips in North Berwick and follow it with ice cream from Lucas in Musselburgh .DREW ALLANThe Cool List:  Scottish golf courses every fan must playHow long   miles but it will take all dayWhat makes it so special: Ferries and islands. Five in one day. Thats pretty special.From the ferry, turn right at Brodick and head to Sannox, where the gentle scenery and winding road from the port is replaced by open hillsides and a much faster, sweeping highway, almost devoid of traffic, with the ragged, jagged peaks of Cir Mhor in the distance. Coming down into Lochranza you pass the Arran Distillery and the ruins of Lochranza Castle, which must rank alongside Eilean Donan and Urquhart Castle for its spectacular location.From here, the ferry for Claonaig make its way across the Kilbrannan Sound to Kintyre. Then its along the narrow B onto the A. Itrsquos like a superhighway after the single track: wide, with fast, sweeping corners to Tarbert, with its pretty harbour, like something out of a Katie Morag book. Back on to the ferry, the next stop is Portavadie on the single track before it opens up towards Tighbnabruich and heads for Colintravie. Then itrsquos on to the dayrsquos shortest crossing, to Bute, which takes less than three minutes, then along to Rothesay and onto the fth and final ferry to Wemyss Bay.Some of the roads are poorly surfaced but that doesnt matter. This is a route to take in the scenery, the castles, wildle, lochs and, of course, the sea views.Pit stops: The Sandwich Stop at Lochranza is the perfect place for a piece. They also do artisanal sandwichesand soups and coffees.GARRY SCOTTTornapress to Applecross, Wester RossHow long   miles, around  minutesWhat makes it so special  Hairpin bends and the promise of a seafood feast.It may not seem very far on the map, yet this drive packs a punch, traversing Bealach na Ba ndash a winding, single-track road through the mountains of the Applecross peninsula ndash complete with hairpin bends, jaw-dropping views and plentul nature sightings.Starting from near sea-level at Tornapress next to Loch Kishorn, the road rises to ftin . milesof climbing, reaching  per cent at its steepest gradient. There is a viewpoint at the top with panoramas across to Skye and beyond on a clear day.You may not want to hang about too long as the reward of a hearty feed awaits at the Applecross Inn once you descend the other side.Pit stop: Grab coffee and cake at the Bealach Cafe in Tornapress but save room for a pint of prawns at the Applecross Inn.SUSAN SWARBRICKCircuit from Spittal of Glenshee, Perth and Kinross.How long  Approx  miles, four days .What makes it so special  If you have already driven the hugely popular North Coast  or you are a looking for a quieter destination, the North East  is an ideal alternative for a multi-day driving route.The circuit heads through the north-east of Scotland, visiting the Cairngorms, Speyside, Moray, Aberdeenshire and Royal Deeside. Famous for its drier and sunnier climate, the north-east also delivers with a fantastic ersity of landscapes, from majestic mountains and wild moorlands to glorious glens, rocky coastlines and pristine beaches.The  miles could be driven in one day although that would be missing the point of such a great journey. Instead, four days to a week allows you to stop at numerous attractions, including castles, heritage centres, distilleries, golf courses and nature reserves.A suggested starting point is Spittal of Glenshee in the Cairngorms National Park. Travelling clockwise, day one will take you to Aberlour in the heart of whisky country. There are plenty of visitor sites including two mountain resorts, Glenshee and The Lecht Ballindalloch Castle the distilleries of Glenlivet and Aberlour and a walk to Linn Falls.Day two heads north to meet the coast at Spey Bay before turning east to reach the seaside town of Banff. Mountain vistas turn to rolling farmland and then the fabulous Moray coastline.Spey Bay is famous for dolphin watching, while a string of pretty shoreline villages, including Findochty, Portnockie, Cullen and Portsoy, are recommended for a stop-and-stroll.Take a walk along a section of the Moray Coast Trail and marvel at rock formations called Bow Fiddle and Whalersquos Mouth and visit the atmospheric ruins of Findlater Castle.From Banff, day three will take you to towards Aberdeen for a suggested overnight at Maryculter. In the far north-east corner is the fishing town of Fraserburgh, home to a vast expanse of sandy beach and the fascinating Museum of Scottish Lighthouses. Further south are other highlights, including the natural phenomenon of Bullers of Buchan, Cruden Bay and Slains Castle.On day four, the NE heads west again through Royal Deeside, where the attractions came thick and fast. The castles of Crathes, Balmoral and Braemar beckon, or why not park the car and take a walk into the countryside for yet more wonderful views of hills, mountains and the winding River Dee Pit stop: Treat yourself to a cone at award-winning Portsoy Ice Cream, enjoy a dram at the Quaich Bar at Craigellachie Hotel and dine at highly rated Rothesay Rooms, Ballater.FIONA RUSSELLThe Cool List:The Best Scottish Railway JourneysHow long   miles, around  minutesWhat makes it so special  Steep climbs and sweeping descents.This drive begins with the steady climb out of Lennoxtown on the hallowed Crow Road . As you near the end of the first stretch, it is worth pulling over to enjoy the views for a few moments from what is dubbed ldquothe car park in the sky.Continue up through the Campsies towards the summit and then follow the sweeping road back down towards Fintry. Itrsquos a popular route for cyclists so do take care and give them space.From Fintry continue on the B where you will reach a turn-off and head left for Arnprior or straight on for Kippin.Both routes offer pretty scenery but via Arnprior is shorter as the crow flies to meet the B which runs past Lake of Menteithand Inchmahome Priory. Turn left onto the A and follow signs for Aberfoyle.Pit stop: The Courtyard Cafe, Knockraich Farm, Fintry is home to a coffee shop and artisan dairy. Be sure to try the farm-made ice cream.SUSAN SWARBRICKHow long   milesdepending on the route, allow - hoursWhat makes it so special  Neolithic monuments and stunning landscapesTo be honest, there is no one set route to follow on the Orkney mainland. Rather prepare for a magical mystery tour as you venture off the main roads to scoot along B routes and single-tracks.Head west out of Kirkwall along the A to the junction for the A. From here head north and follow the road in an anti-clockwise direction around the mainland. It is a pretty drive with plenty of points of interest, not least an opportunity is to visit the iron age Broch of Gurness near Evie.The Neolithic monuments at Orkneyrsquos heart ndash Skara Brae, Maeshowe, Ring of Brodgar and Standing Stones of Stenness ndash are within easy driving distance. Built , years ago, this former settlement, large chambered tomb and two ceremonial stone circles form a Unesco World Heritage Centre.On the west of the mainland is Yesnaby with its towering sandstone clfs and majestic sea stack which is a wonderful spot to watch the sunset. Heading south, the turn off is on the right, around a third of a mile before the junction where the B meets the A.No visit to Orkney would be complete without driving over the Churchill Barriers, a series of four causeways linking the mainland to the islands of Lamb Holm, Glims Holm, Burray and South Ronaldsay.Lamb Holm is home to the Italian Chapel, built from two old Nissen huts by prisoners-of-war in . Continue south across Glims Holm and Burray towards the farthest tip of South Ronaldsay and the Tomb of the Eagles, a Neolithic chambered tomb located on a clf edge.Pit stop: Gerrirsquos Ice Cream Parlour, Stenness. Try the monster cone with seven scoopsyou dare.SUSAN SWARBRICKHow long   miles, one hourA bit unusual, this, but it will allow you to indulge your Colin McRae rally driver fantasies ndash albeit at a much slower pace.This forest drive takes you through the woodlands of the Queen Elizabeth Forest Park on a quiet forest road from March to October. Beware, its bumpy going.The route, which costs pound, is one-way and takes you past three lochs ndash Lochan Reoidhte, Loch Drunkie and Loch Achray.The entrance is on the Ajust north of Aberfoyle. There are several car parks on the route as well as picnic areas and short walking trails.Pitstop: The Lodge Forest visitor ventre on the A has a cafe, walks, a shop and also the Go Ape aerial adventure trail. The Brig o Turk Tea Room is a charming spot for a coffee and a cake.GARRY SCOTTDays Out: Scotlands top  beachesHow long   miles, a nice half-hour drive hellip but there are so many places to stop, best leave a full afternoon.What makes it so special  The unexpected, off-the-beaten-track beauty.The sign just past Pitlochry heading north on the A is unassuming ndash \"Clunie , Foss \" ndash but the road itself is an absolute joy. This little single-track route to Tummel Bridge, along the south side of Loch Faskally and Loch Tummel, takes you to places that you may not have seen before, but which you will never forget. Leave an hour at least to explore the Linn of Tummel ndash an amazing gorge where this grand river is pushed into a series of boiling pots and waterfalls check out Clunie Dam ndash a properly wild feat of engineering at the foot of Loch Tummel stoplong the lochside to marvel at the views.At Tummel Bridge, you have a choice hellip go back to your starting point along the usual, north side of the Loch , or head into the mountains, past Schiehallion and down into Tayside. A real treat either way.Pit stop: Take a picnic hellip yoursquoll be glad you did!ANDY CLARK.

Irsquove bounded down the steps, through the sticky front door and on past the people sitting in what looks like a giant window box with rice paper .Now Irsquom standing awkwardly in a between-raised-tables channel under quaint market-stall roofing while Edinburgh folk look and frown and I swither about whether to go all the way back and pull that door tight shut again. For them. I get it. Itrsquos cold out. Or go on underneath the hanging lanterns, past the fairground-style booth and round a corner into the next room to seeI can find someone who actually works here.Umm, I shut the front door again, properly this time. Then press on towards the Sea of Swirly Twirly Chinese Lanterns and just as I reach the corner a waiter comes running, literally.OK, any speed above excuse me in here looks like running, but he is simultaneously moving and apologising and sitting me at a tiny table which is about the only one in the whole place not under a hanging lamp. And also revealing there are terrible staff-shortages tonight and he has to serve all these peopleby himself. Andhellipwait for thishellipmake all the ramen too.Crikey, I think, looking towards the door. Suddenly itrsquos a very long way away. Too bloody far to run. We establish importantly anyway that there are definitely chefs in the kitchen and I settle in for a long wait. Which simply doesnrsquot happen.

Or even close.Whatever, the tuna is plump and pink and pleasantly fresh . And Irsquove been distracted again. Goruden cod finger, made with katai pastry ndash which I thought was actually Greek. This is sitting at the table looking like three giant shredded wheat fingers, one of which is rudely stuffed in a glass of what looks like cocktail sauce but is actually, er, mango mayo. Frankly  Not for me.The sickly mango mayo may just be the accidental reinvention of a Mr Men Yoghurt, and the shredded wheat pastry tastes like fried shredded wheat, and while there is some promised Scottish cod deep inside itrsquos so outgunned by everything  it was pointless even showing up.Fortunately, and just as the remnants of this are being dragged off in shame, my original waiter is back from his ramen booth and is asking what I think of the Crazy Tonkotsu Ramen. Which he just made. Himself.The broth is cooked for  hours, he proudly reminds me, as I slide head-first into slippy, slurpy, soupy-land of pork slices, seaweed sheets and jalapeno strands, all underpinned by a very good, creamily smooth, properly seasoned stock and just the right chilli tingle.Umi Japanese Cuisine then  Mad but definitely not bad. I cant help really liking this place.Joanna Blythmans restaurant review: One Square,  Festival Square, EdinburghUmi Japanese Cuisine Deanhaugh StreetEdinburgh  Menu: Crazy kitschy mix of Japanese staples, proper sushi, interesting ramen, -hour broths and those goruden cod fingers.  Service: Full marks for being honest about staff shortages which actually made no dference as the service was swt, pleasant and warm.

The UK, including Scotland, would not have erged from EU laws and regulation, and there would not be any of the border problems between Scotland and the rest of the UK that a hard Brexitmight entail.If Brexit does go ahead, then the challenges will be bigger.On independence, Scotland as a European country would be entitled to apply to join the EU.

But there will be substantive issues to negotiate, in particular where the UK had special deals and opt-outs.Scotland is unlikely to benefit from the UKrsquos current budget rebate, so its own budget contribution would have to be agreed in the negotiations.Scotland would also be unlikely to get any opt-out from the euro, so it would have to commit to eventually joining the euro .

But EEA membership might look more problematicthe rest of the UK did end up in a customs union with the EU .EEA members have to be in EFTA ndash and EFTA members have their own trade deals and cannot, without an exemption, be in a customs union with the EU too.Overall, an independent Scotland should have the prospect of a relatively swt and smooth route to re-joining the EU, subject to negotiating the substantive issues covered above.Read more:SNP hit back as Theresa May claims independent Scotland could not stay in EUThe politics of how the EU member states would look at Scotlandrsquos application to re-join would also be much more constructive, not least in the face of Brexit.Accession would still require unanimity, and the future politics of dferent member states, including Spain, cannot be guaranteed.

It must be noted however that only  MS store was surveyed.Morrisons: Good support for UK fresh pork, given the history of links with Morrisons and Scottish agriculture it would be great to see ato them stocking Scottish product in Scottish stores.

With % of their bacon and % of ham all coming from British pork they perform well, but there is definite room for improvement in their sausages.Tesco: Good to see some Scottish fresh pork in Tesco stores and some good Scottish sausages, some small but notable improvements as industry notes that Tesco have started to use Scottish Pork in one of their ham ranges.

asthat werenrsquot enough to be getting on with, a new front opened this week. War has been declared on the elderly ndash by the House of Lords .Recently, I went on record ndash always a mistake as a columnist, I find it preferable to keep my opinions to myself ndash praising the House of Lords as a civilised counterpoint to the bawling brouhaha that is the House of Commons. I take that back now and, never one for half-measures, believe the Lords should be abolished forthwith.The brass neck of them. The out-of-touch ignorance of them. The dim-witted, cloth-eared, pig-headed, hair-raising, nose-blowing, ear-waggling, tongue-wagging cheek of them.You say: ldquoWhat are you getting so het up about  Yoursquore usually quite calm, not to say, you know, a little sleepy. I will tell you what Irsquom getting so het up about, madam. This shower of old gits wants to take the few perks that elderly people get so that the money can be spent instead on the young.Donrsquot get me wrong. I would shower gold on the younglingsI could, evenI would not allow them to drive, vote or be out on the streets after pm . But, rather than rob old Peter to pay young Paul, there is a better way to raise money for them, and I will outline this below, once I have thought of it.So, what does the Lords want to do exactly  Well, its Select Committee on Intergenerational Fairness ndash the what now  ndash has suggested scrapping winter fuel allowances, free bus passes for those under , free TV licences for over-s, and automatic pension rises of at least . per cent.Consider the list. Consider these few pathetic perks, offered to folk after a letime of working. Consider that our state pension is the lowest in the developed world. And consider taking it all away. That is the British way today.There is a definite malice at the heart of the British state. It wasnrsquot always like that. After the Second World War, it looked to make things better for the people. Now it is forever checking to see what it can take away, what it can save, what it can cut. It is a nasty, miserly, malevolent state.Actually, maybe it always was. After all, the predication of the pension is that you would peg out just a couple of years after becoming entitled to it. But at least the state of old instituted the thing and gave the impression of caring.Bizarrely, the Lordsrsquo reason for hammering the old is that theyrsquore apparently all well-off nowadays, which must come as a surprise to the millions who live off nothing more than the state pension. Many folk will have suffered unemployment and poverty under Margaret Thatcher and now find themselves with nothing to look forward to, even these meagre perks, in old age.Those who worked all their lives in low-wage Britain probably know how the system works anyway: you pays your taxes and gets sod all back. By my reckoning, the British state owes me a fortune. And the House of Lords owes the elderly an apology. They must think every old person, like them, gets pound a day for gently snoozing, with subsidised food and drink into the bargain. If they must pick on a section of society to subsidise the young then let it be football.Yes, football. The wages of many players are stratospherically absurd. TV companies make a packet out of horrendously priced sports packages, paid for by folk with more money than sense, who also actually attend games, which are today the province of only the well-heeled upper working class who made their own fortunes by overcharging people in their ldquotrades.Let all of them pay to subsidise the young: the players, the clubs, the TV companies and the spectators. This measure would undoubtedly prove popular across the nation, uniting us all once again and inconveniencing only a privileged few who have had it too good for too long.***THE Axis of Evil is being reborn. I choose my words carefully. Like most decent ratepayers, I am not in favour of evil, as it is arguably a bad thing.Readers who survived the th century may recall that the original Axis of Evil, a term invented by US President and leading philosopher George W Bush, comprised Iran, Iraq and North Korea. There was also a B team of Cuba, Libya and Syria. I think we bombed most of these, thus putting paid to their evil plans for world domination .This week, a new Axis of E began to take shape when North Korearsquos chief narcissist King Kong-un visited leading Russian narcissist Vladimir Putin, after falling out with top US narcissist Derek Trump. Canrsquot put my finger on it, but there may be a pattern here.N Korea is also reaching out to China, never far off when evil is afoot, resulting in the possibility of a new Triumvirate of Badness threatening the peace and order brought to the world by the West.Kong has now invited the Russian president over to his bit to cement the alliance, which unfortunately comes at a time when Britain doesnrsquot have any bombs left.***IMAGES from history often become fixed in our minds, reflecting perhaps signicant world events or, sometimes, moments of horror.An incidence of the latter was brought to mind this week when Jack ldquoLord McConnell, the former First Minister, recalled wearing a pinstripe kilt that sent shock waves around the world.On medical advice, for the sake of readers of an easily frightened disposition, we are unwilling to reproduce the image here. But, for my money, it wasnrsquot so much the kilt as the accompanying blouse that led to record levels of intercontinental vomit.Lord Jack of that ilk was appearing at a photocall while attending a fashion event in New York and, as he later revealed, had become too fat as First Minister to get into his jaickit, thus forcing him to display the full horror of the blouse atop the unconventional kilt.This week, still hounded by the press  years later, Jack was unrepentant, claiming he didnrsquot regret the gaffe in the least. ldquoIrsquom glad people got something to laugh at. It doesnrsquot bother me a bit, he said, as he ed to the House of Lords in a big red cloak and a Napoleon-style cocked hat.***FEMINISTS are burdz who are quite easy to wind up, so we will choose our words carefully here as we consider the Scottish Maritime Museumrsquos decision to stop calling ships and boats ldquoshe and to go gender-neutral.I have no strong views on the matter, accepting on the one hand that the practice is antiquated but also feeling confused as it was never a derogatory reference, as I understand it, butanything a complimentary one, ships often being objects of beauty and wonder.Perhaps itrsquos the objectication to which folk object. I noticed one reader saying that it might have related to these busty dames that used to adorn the prows of vessels, which is arguable I suppose.At any rate, irate lassies would scratch the word out on the museumrsquos displays. Itrsquos odd to think how worked up people get about such small things. Online, the working up went the other way, as top males protested about ldquoerasing history and more ldquopolitical correctness practised by an oppressive minority.However, for the sake of a quiet le, it is understandable how our institutions succumb to the sensitivities of the feminist, or she who must be obeyed.Read more: Watch out, Bozzie Bear is about to be let out of his box"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-why-wont-reckless-unionists-try-to-come-up-with-a-compromise-on-the-constitution","story":"If the SNP gains the number of Westminster seats forecast , then it would be impossible for London to veto any proposed referendum , and Unionists would then be required to contest that referendum when they were at their lowest point, electorally.

The same poll shows the SNP, the party proposing this unpopular proposition, miles ahead ndash roughly  per cent ndash of each of its.This is only the starkest evidence of a phenomenon that has dogged Scotland for  years: voters are unimpressed by Labour, the Tories and the LibDems, the SNP seemed a viable option but not many took its obsessive nationalism seriously and voted it into power in .The opposition has been in ious states of disarray ever since and so far hasnt produced the policies and leadership to offer an alternative government, either as one party or a coalition.Until that happens the SNP and Greens will from a government in  with an ambivalent clause tucked away in their manestos enabling them to claim a mandate to batter us into submission on a referendum and independence.Allan Sutherland, Willow Row, Stonehaven.Read more: One in five Scots back Nicola Sturgeons Indyref planTHEY may not be to Robert IG Scotts taste , but marches and demonstrations,con-ducted responsibly, have their place in a democratic society, allowing people to express their opinions and support for their cause, whether that be climate change, gay rights, anti-war, or Scottish independence. However, Mr Scott is wrong to claim that all the electorate are seeing is marches and rallies the SNP is in its third consecutive term at Holyrood, and has more MPs at Westminster than the Scottish Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat parties put together. As for Mr Scotts assertion that \"the current position at Holyrood is unacceptable with a minority SNP government deciding on policies relating to Scotland\", I would point out that the Scottish electorate can vote Holyrood governments out of office, unlike the position at Westminster, where the arithmetic adds up to Scotland being saddled with the governments England elects.As Westminster wallows in the chaotic Brexit mess, Holyrood is providing calm and competent government, and it is not only the opinion polls which continue to show strong support for the SNP at the latest test of public opinion at the ballot box, local government by-elections in Clackmannanshire Central and Leith Walk were both won by the SNP.Ruth Marr, Grampian Road, Stirling.TODAYS broadcast of BBC Politics Liveincluded some discussion of the case for Scottish in-dependence ,in the course of which one  member, Nick Ferrari, who is apparently a journalist and broadcaster and not a car thief, revealed the interesting news that Scottish schools are now infested with rats. He seemed to be suggesting that this was something that should be considered by persons considering the case for Scottish independence, although I am not entirely sure whether he thought independence might make rat infestation more or less likely to occur.Herald readers will no doubt wish to satisfy themselves of the rat-tolerance ratings of the ious political parties should it become necessary in the future to elect the government in an independent Scot-land. The need for this circumspection is unlikely to be highlighted in any BBC political discussion, since these are iniably conducted based on an underlying assumption that an independent Scotland would be a one-party state governed in perpetuity by the SNP.Willie Maclean, Braehead Avenue, Milngavie.BY next week I expect that climate change activists in Scotland will be disappointed that the SNP conference has not announced plans to oppose all exploration and production in Scotlandrsquos North Sea.Together with the Greens, the SNP constantly criticises the UK Government on environmental and climate change issues such as fracking while boasting of Scotlandrsquos efforts on renewables. Ian Blackford states that ldquoThe UK Government must start taking this issue seriously and it must start now. Meanwhile, we continue to produce hydrocarbons and import fracked gas for us or others to burn. This approach is like that of Norway, making a big gesture out of its Sovereign wealth fund not investing in hydrocarbons while continuing to issue exploration licences in the Arctic.The effect of removing Scotlandrsquos internal carbon emissions from the global total is negligible. An im-mediate ban on North Sea oil wonrsquot happen because even the SNP realises the electorate know that such measures would severely affect living standards and aspirations. The SNP is willing to risk harming the economy for its separatist obsession ndash but not to save the planet.Its approach on global warming is to pretend to be doing something so that it can say ldquoIt wisnae me, it was the bad boys that did it. The flatlands around the moral high ground are littered with the bones of fallen hypocrites.Whether wersquore in or out of the EU, Europe will do tits own thing on emissions but the most effective use of our votes as iniduals is to use them within the UK to influence the reduction of the UKrsquos overall larger effect on global warming. Any strategy must consider the disruptive effects on our socie-ty and mitigate against them.Mark Openshaw, Earlswells Road, Cults, Aberdeen."},{"url":null,"title":"family fun at aberdeenshire wellbeing festival","story":"As part of the Aberdeenshire Wellbeing Festival, Live Le Aberdeenshire will be running free cultural and sports events across the region, with over , opportunities for people to get involved.Highlights include three Best Medicine Comedy Nights in Macduff, Inverurie and Stonehaven in partnership with Breakneck Comedy and the Alcohol and Drugs Partnership, and an animation workshop delivered by Andy Symanowski, director and animator of Aardman Animations’ ‘Shaun the Sheep’ series.Live Le Aberdeenshire, a business unit of Aberdeenshire Council, is also working with Luminate, Scotland’s Older People’s Festival, and CityMoves Dance Agency in Aberdeen, to present Chance to Dance, a whole day of movement workshops for those aged over .

The council’s Infrastructure Services Committeeapproved the kerbside collection policy and procedures last year, including guidance on how to deal with contaminated bins. Any non-recyclable material placed into the recycling bin is classed as ‘contamination’, which could spoil the recyclates in any load. The recycling reprocessor may then reject whole loads as a result. Any rejected loads of recycling are disposed of at an additional cost to the taxpayer, for which there is no council budget available. Income which they would have generated to invest in services is lost.Collection crews will now visually check each recycling bin for contaminated recycling before emptying as a matter of course – those with severe contamination will not be emptied. Households consistently presenting severely contaminated bins will be offered advice and support to properly separate their waste. Those who ignore that advice could run the risk of their recycling bin being removed.Moderately contaminated bins will be emptied and an orange tag will be attached, providing information to the householder on how to properly use the recycling service. If a bin has not been emptied and tagged explaining why it has not been emptied, it is contaminated and the offending materials must be removed before the next collection. Crews will notto empty a rejected bin until the next scheduled collection day for the same bin.Bins considered to have little or no levels of contaminants will be emptied as normal.Collection crews will keep a record of bins unemptied due to overloading or contamination and this will be checked before a decision is made toto empty any bin reported as a missed collection.For those with a lot of recyclable materials, additional, free recycling bins can be requested by contacting the council’s Wasteline. Additional non-recyclable waste bins may also be authorised where there is a genuine need following a home visit and assessment by a Community Waste Officer. data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.buchanobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Police Scotland\"  Police urge revellers to be safe and responsible viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BUCH | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BUCH | Article Teaser\"The council’s Head of Roads, Waste and Landscape services, Philip McKay, said: “It’s important residents understand how to recycle properly and make best use of the facilities available to them. “Sending waste to landfill costs more than double the amount it costs to recycle and tackling the levels of contamination in kerbside bins is intended to reduce the amount of recyclates sent to landfill.“We will be enforcing the procedures in a staggered rollout, tackling problem routes first.

Also among those present was Janine Miller, we of Australian national Greg Miller who also lives in Orkney.This year the wreath was laid on the final resting place of –year–old Royal New Zealand Navy Volunteer Reserve pilot, LieutenantThomas Noel Bush, who was tragically killed on December , .Lt Bush’s Hawker Sea Hurricane fighter plunged from the sky above Kirkwall straight into the Peedie Sea — while, only yards away, people were in their homes, or going about their daily business.On that fateful day, Lt Bush arrived to pick up the aircraft and, following a few pre-flight checks, took to the air.However, within minutes witnesses heard the aircraft`s engine revving at high speed and, from a height of approximately ft, it ed straight down into the Peedie Sea, killing the pilot instantly.Local emergency services and personnel from HMS Sparrowhawk were quickly on the scene, but nothing could be done for the unfortunate pilot.Lt Bush’s body was recovered from the wreckage and he was buried, with full military honours, in St Olaf`s Cemetery, on the outskirts of Kirkwall, on December , .Kirkwall branch of the Royal British Legion chairman Dougie Manson said: “Those who died came from far and wide to serve their countries overseas, coming here today is the least we can do to remember them.

We know that breastfeeding can be challenging, but we also know that a problem shared, is often a problem halved.

The council say that all profit would stay in the islands, enabling the local authority to preserve and enhance key services that local people value and depend upon. This, OIC believes, will provide a foundation for communities to drive transformational projects of their own.The council hopes that developments will allow it to join other local developers in making a meaningful contribution to a Needs Case for a new interconnector for Orkney, thereby substantially supporting the vital renewable energy industry in Orkney, including future development of the marine energy sector.OIC believes that the wider economic development value of a new cable to Orkney could be highly signicant, particularlya substantial proportion of local ownership can be secured — which could help employment and income remain in the county.Plans for a development of up to around MW in Hoy were announced to the local community last year — with sites for a development of up to MW on the island of Faray and up to MW on shoreside farmland at Quanterness outside Kirkwall now also being investigated.The proximity of the project at Quanterness to Kirkwall could also enable a separate private wire network project in which the council could directly supply electricity to its own buildings as a means to reduce costs.Public engagement events have been organised for Kirkwall, Eday and Rendall over the coming fortnight. Proposed plans for the developments will be on display at these, with elected members and council officers on hand to discuss the plans with members of the public. The proposed Quanterness site has the potential capacity for six m blade tip height turbines. The site on Faray has enough space for up to eight m blade tip height turbinesThe event details are as follows:An event will also be held in Westray, with the date yet to be confirmed.The current proposal at the third site in Hoy is to erect seven turbines, compared to the  presented in the original plans.The proposals for each site are expected to evolve as further site investigation work and consultation is undertaken. Site investigations, including bird and telecommunications studies, will be ongoing at all three sites.The council#s intention is to reach planning permission stage by the end of , ensuring all views and issues are fully explored and considered before any final decisions are made.  Proposals for how the applications will be determined are currently being considered.Councillor James Stockan, Orkney Islands Council leader said: “It is vital that the Council now takes an active ‘developer approach’ to energy projects in our islands. Not only does this allow us to maximise the resources available to us in the islands to support services and projects for local people, but it also allows us to contribute signicantly and in a meaningful way to allow our world-renowned local energy industry to survive and thrive through a new grid connection.“Our strategy is one that meets uncertainty head-on. The final details of proposals are by no means set in stone whilst investigations are carried out at the three sites, nor are all three sites guaranteed planning permission — and of course we also wish to take into account public opinion on the developments. Widening the net and moving to investigate three separate sites, allows us a degree of flexibility in the make-up of the final outcome.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The attraction’s website is slightly better, listing walking and cycling above car, but on a page called “Directions and Car Park”.In stark contrast, the Queen’s Gallery at the Palace of Holyrood next door has the opposite travel priorities in its publicity material. The “How to Get There” section of the leaflet for its current exhibition lists “on foot”, followed by “by bus” and “by tram”, and puts “by car” last.But I was even more impressed by the Edinburgh International Festival, which has espoused the green travel message for several years in its main programme.Under “Planning your trip”, it urges festival-goers to “please consider the environmental impact of your chosen form of transport. Travelling by train or bus can often take the sameof time as flying when you consider check-in times”.: Why protesters should be wary of ‘ years to climate breakdown’ rhetoric – Myles AllenIt adds: “We encourage our audience to think green and explore the city on foot, by bike or by public transport wherever possible”. This approach should be obvious – and the norm.Protest group Extinction Rebellion is noisily highlighting the urgency of action on the environment. But, as I’ve argued before, it’s not governments which will make a dference but the everyday actions of all of us.Many people find dficulty in relating to the big picture of where our planet is heading. But how we choose to travel is a very signicant part of that because transport accounts for one of the biggest sources of emissions and pollution.Some venues give discounts or offer priority treatment for those visitors who arrive by greener means. It’s not always going to be possible for everybody, or indeed for any of us every single time we make such journeys.However, visitor attractions and the tourist industry in general, which is so important to Scotland’s economy, must take seriously its responsibilities to set an example, being a signicant transport generator by its very nature.: World seems ambivalent about swt action on climate change – IPCC chairThere are partnerships between attractions and transport operators to incentivise visitors to take non-car options.But there are also many more opportunities to provide attractive, seamless travel choices. Planning a day trip from Glasgow to Mount Stuart on Bute on Sunday, I came across a combined train and ferry ticket and a combined ferry and attraction ticket, and I’m told there’s also a combined ferry and bus ticket between Rothesay and the house – but alas there’s not one with all four.Being able to do that – and online, in advance – is what people now expect to be able to do, considering pretty much anything  can be ordered from your mobile phone.Instead of venues, especially those in urban areas, offering free or discounted parking, regardless of need, they should be vying with each other to have the greenest credentials.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"why the snp does not speak for scotland pamela nash","story":"The priorities of SNP delegates gathering at the Edinburgh International Conference Centre for their party conference are at odds with the people of Scoltand, writes Pamela Nash.AS senior SNP politicians deliver their conference speeches today, it is increasingly obvious that they are talking only to their party – not to the country.The same was true with Nicola Sturgeon’s statement to parliament earlier this week, when she set out her latest proposals for breaking up the UK.She didn’t talk about the crisis in education. Or the crisis in our hospitals. Or the crisis on our railways.For the SNP, it is independence first, second and always.No matter how loud the applause in the Edinburgh International Conference Centre is this weekend, Nationalist politicians would do well to understand that their own priorities are at odds with the people of Scotland.We know this from the latest opinion polling published this week.Voters were asked to rank issues in order of which they thought should be the most important for the Scottish Government to prioritise.The NHS was ranked in the top three by  per cent of respondents, with the cost of living on  per cent, the economy on  per cent, and education on  per cent.Constitutional affairs and independence scored just nine per cent.I suspect you would get a very dferent resultyou surveyed SNP delegates at the EICC, which just shows how out of touch with reality the SNP has become.While they talk among themselves, the message from the public is clear: get on with the day job.: Kenny MacAskill: Sturgeon did NOT just call for independence referendum by The First Minister could start by fixing the mess her Government has made of our once-envied education system.It emerged this week that some schools are having to teach pupils studying for National , National  and Higher qualications in the same class.An obsession with the constitution means a generation of children is being let down by this Government.Amid this crisis, the idea that we should spend the next two years having yet another debate about independence is the height of irresponsibility.But that is precisely what Nicola Sturgeon wants to do. She wants to ide the country once again and hold an unwanted second independence referendum before .How do we know it’s unwanted  Because the people of Scotland have said so.Only one-in-five voters support the SNP’s reckless plan to hold another contest before the next Holyrood election.People remember the ision and the toxic atmosphere from  and they don’t want to go through that again any time soon.And they certainly don’t want to go through it while the country is still ided over Brexit.Whatever your views on Brexit, we can all agree that it has revealed just how dficult and complex it is to leave a political union.The UK has only been in the EU for four decades, and it is a much looser partnership of countries than the United Kingdom is.: Nicola Sturgeon ‘facing rebellion’ over post-independence currency plansJust imagine how dficult it would be to tear Scotland out of a centuries-old union in which we are considerably more entwined.It’s little wonder that so many people who voted ‘Yes’ in  have changed their minds. According to this week’s poll, a third would now vote to remain in the UK.Despite campaigning every day since September , the SNP has managed to turn more people off independence. Support for leaving the UK now stands at just  per cent.Most Scots know that we are stronger together and want to build a successful economic future based on our shared culture, history and institutions. Institutions such as our currency – the pound.Today, the SNP will vote to scrap the pound and adopt a new currency in an independent Scotland, putting salaries, mortgages and pensions at risk. According to the polling figures published today, that is supported by just  per cent of voters – while  per cent want to keep the pound.By remaining in the UK, we can keep our pound, grow our economy – without extra red tape for businesses – and use a stable currency backed by the strength of the UK’s central bank and its  million taxpayers.But, instead, today’s conference debate will focus on when to inflict economic harm on communities: immediately in the short-term or after a few years.And it will be coupled with the SNP’s growth commission blueprint which confirms breaking up the UK would lead to even deeper austerity.This isn’t the future most people want for Scotland. It’s not a choice we should have to make.We don’t want another independence referendum.We don’t want to create further ision and have a debate about whether to erect barriers between our friends, families and neighbours in the rest of the UK.But I know the SNP will never drop its narrow nationalist agenda. It will never stop campaigning for separation.So that is why those of us who believe in solidarity must continue to campaign as well. We speak for the majority of Scots who want a Government focused on building a better future for the people of Scotland as part of the UK.We must continue campaigning so that Nicola Sturgeon stops listening only to Nationalists and starts listening to the nation.Pamela Nash is chief executive of Scotland in Union©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"edinburgh festival chief hails transformational new concert hall","story":"The first new concert hall to be built in the Scottish capital for  years will be #transformational# and #le-changing,# according to the two arts institutions it is set to be #created for.The ,-capacity New Town venue, which will also have a -seater “studio” theatre, will create both a flagship venue for Edinburgh International Festival concerts and a year-round home for the Scottish Chamber Orchestra.: Poll: Only  in  Scots want  indyref voteThey have predicted its Dunard Centre’s “world-class” design, facilities and acoustics, overseen by award-winning English architect Sir David Chipperfield, will allow the city to host a whole new range of concerts, artists and audiences throughout the year.Named after American arts philanthropist Carol Grigor, who has pledged to underwrite the project via her Dunard Fund, secured planning permission on Wednesday, less than three years after plans were first revealed.: Video: Bus crashes into house in East WhitburnNow due to open in , the £ million venue – which also has £m worth of backing from the Scottish and UK governments and the city council – is earmarked for a site tucked behind Royal Bank of Scotland’s historic head office building on St Andrew Square.EIF director Fergus Linehan said: “This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to help secure Edinburgh’s reputation as one of the world’s great creative and cultural capitals. “Its state-of-the-art facilities, world-class design and exceptional acoustics will provide an outstanding environment for musicians of all kinds to perform to the widest possible community. Artistically and socially, it’s a truly transformational project for the Festival.“There is the whole question of what a new world-class venue can do in terms of being in constant use every day of the Festival. You can turn it around from one thing to another very quickly, and also have the capacity to be able to run events in the main hall, the studio space and the foyer, all at the same time. “We want to use this venue every day. We don’t want to spend two days getting a show ready for two performances. It’ll be an incredibly busy space.“We’ll always use the Usher Hall and do those kind of concerts. A lot of the new developments in music don’t always lend themselves to an enormous space like that. If you’re talking about new composers, and digital or electronic work, they don’t really fit into that. “It’s also about how you do music. If you go into a big venue like the Usher Hall it sort of creates dferent kinds of protocols that you have to observe. When you go into a really cool building designed by an amazing architect it becomes a really exciting place to be. It will makes it a lot easier for us to attract new and younger audiences.”Mr Linehan insisted the new venue would not replace the Queen’s Hall, which already hosts a series of EIF classical concerts each year, adding that there was still a need to carry out a full refurbishment of Leith Theatre, reintroduced to the Festival programme last year after  years.He added: “A venue for an evening concert of the highest possible standard for around , people doesn’t really exist in Edinburgh at the moment. In terms of music, the Festival is missing a couple of big colours off its palette.“There’s also the really interesting question about where the heart of the Festival is at the moment and how that may change with the other developments happening around St Andrew Square.”Gavin Reid, chief executive of the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, said: “The impact of the new venue will be transformational. “It will enable the Scottish Chamber Orchestra – along with many other organisations and iniduals – to ­perform in one of the great concert halls of the world, thus attracting the most exciting talent to play in Scotland, and through our creative ­learning programme, involve as many people as possible from all over the city and beyond in something utterly le-­changing.”Scottish culture secretary Fiona Hyslop said: “The ­economic and cultural benefits will be felt throughout Scotland.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"letters second independence referendum should have 60 threshold","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Time will tell but I suspect that history will not be too kind to David Cameron, whose political career was over before he reached age .

But any prospect of the UK government repeating the granting of a Section  order, which would allow Scottish ministers to hold a legally binding vote, was ruled out by Mr Lidington.“We don’t see any evidence that there is a demand from the people of Scotland to review the decision they took in ,” he said. “That referendum was said at the time to settle matters for a generation.“We don’t see that a Section  order is called for. I don’t see how it would help put right problems with Scottish schools and hospitals.“Devolution in Scotland has given many additional powers to the Scottish Parliament and some of those powers have not even be used.

While Mrs May’s administration has ruled out granting one, the Prime Minister is widely expected to stand down in the coming monthsa Brexit deal can be secured. Mr Lidington refused to speculate on whether a new Tory government would be more likely to grant the order. The minister’s remarks were seized on by the SNP, with the party’s Westminster leader describing them as an “arrogant diktat”.Ian Blackford said: “Scotland’s future cannot and will not be decided by the arrogant diktat of this shambles of a Tory government, which has been rejected by Scottish voters at every election and which is soon likely to be out of office.“Whatever people’s views on independence, a strong majority of people back the Scottish Parliament’s right to determine the nation’s future.“Overwhelmingly, it is Holyrood – not Westminster – which the people of Scotland believe should have the right to decide this country’s democratic path.“The Westminster system is broken beyond repair and does not serve Scotland’s interests – something now conceded at senior levels in the Scottish Tory ranks.” But the Scottish Conservatives said the new polling proved there was no demand for another referendum.The Survation poll found more people were in favour of Scotland remaining in the UK than leaving.

Scotland doesn’t want yet more referendums – we want to move on and focus on the things that matter: improving our schools, making our streets safer and growing high quality jobs in Scotland.”A stand-off currently exists between the Scottish Government and Westminster over a second referendum. Power over the constitution lies with the UK government and Prime Minister Theresa May has so far rejected Sturgeon’s demands insisting, ‘Now is not the time.’A poll by the pro-independence Progress Scotland organisation earlier this month concluded that support for independence had fallen to below  per cent.But SNP deputy leader Keith Brown, who has been tasked with preparing the case for a second independence campaign, said Brexit turmoil has seen a backlash against the pro-Union parties in Scotland.“Since , across Westminster, the SNP have often been the only adults in the room, the only party focused on offering a serious sensible way forward out of the Brexit mess,” he said.“The Scottish Tories have completely sold out Scotland’s interests over Brexit and are happy to let Westminster do whatever they want to Scotland. “Meanwhile, Labour are quietly signing up to deliver a Tory Brexit – against the wishes of the people of Scotland – and without putting the issue back to the people.

The Ballymenawanted to know how Morris came to be in the band. Morris tells how his grandmother had a small hotel in Carnlough and every Saturday night a “Sing Song” was held in the bar. It was mainly Ballymena people attendance.  He remembers Johnny Mitchell, who worked in the Waveney Laundry, bringing his friends every week. Johnny also brought musicians from Ballymena to play including Nellie King on piano and George Kernohan on accordion. Morris said: “George, who had a barber shop in Harryville would leave his accordion during the week with his grandmother. He would let me try to play it, upside down as I remember my first attempts! “During the summer months George’s brothers used to visit as well. ACCORDION“They were great singers and often talked about how well other relations were doing who had emigrated and formed a group called the Irish Rovers in Canada. The first time I heard “Bonnie Kellswater” sung was by an older man called Jimmy Fullerton. Great days, great times and a great introduction to performing music.”He continued: “Eugene O’Dornan from the Braid and I played as teenagers in our first band together. Eugene’s sister Maureen entered, or more properly bluffed me into entering a talent contest as I was very shy and horried at the thought. “Anyway the competition went well and from it I joined a Ballymena based band called “The Countrymen” managed by Harry Lynn and George Dillon.  Leo McCaffrey was the compere at the competition. Leo became a great friend and mentor and a major influence on my music career.”In  Morris went with Leo to play in the famous “Blarney Stone” in Vancouver. Members of the Irish Rovers would come into the Blarney Stone as they knew Leo well. Morris said: “I became great friends with Wilcil McDowell, the Irish Rovers’ Accordion player. I was already a fan of Wilcil’s playing as he too occasionally visited my grandmother’s hotel in Carnlough.“It was through Wilcil that I started to play keyboards on Irish Rovers recordings and take part as a guest musician on some of their videos.” When Morris retired from his day job he was delighted to take up an offer in  by George Millar, the bandleader, to join the Rovers. He said: “When Wilcil decided last year to stop touring with the band I moved from keyboards to playing accordion. Touring Canada with the band also meant I was able to meet up with some other Ballymena musicians now living there.“Paul Fynes who was in the Countrymen with me, and Kevin Erwin who played with Leo. Kevin was ill during my last visit and sadly passed away last year. One of the most talented people I have ever played with.”CONCERTCommenting on the concert which took place in Ballymena on March  Morris said: “It was lovely to perform in what I knew as Ballymena Town Hall.“ It was a great concert and I was so pleased it was a such a success, especially for George and Ian Millar. “Never easy playing in your home town with your relations sitting in the front row!“It never ceases to amaze me that after  years the Irish Rovers continue to play to sell out shows throughout Canada and the USA. They are a fabulous band and brilliant people to work with. “George and Ian are proud of being from Ballymena and the town is mentioned at every show. “The Irish Rovers videos, which are broadcast on American television really show off the local area and the Antrim glens. I’m sure this has a real positive impact on Tourism here. “The warm reception in the Mayor’s parlour just before the concert I think is a well deserved honour for the Millar family and it was an honour to attend it.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1733277.jpg--.jpg?1555495901000\n","title":"ballymena city of the eight towers","story":"Local children have created a new fantasy tower to add to Ballymena’s famous ‘crest’ !And it is one of a number of striking features on is new imagination-fuelled mural which has appeared asby magic in Bryan Street, with the help of Artists Leo Boyd, Laura Nelson and local children.Workshops were held in The Braid Arts Centre on the theme of comics and cartoons and, as a result, local children have delivered a new fabulous monster sized artwork for the town centre.The Bryan Street painting, which is part of a larger arts project called Opening Doors being delivered by the Arts Service of Mid and East Antrim Borough Council, was supported and partnered by BID, which is the Ballymena Improvement District.BID and Councils Arts Service identied some sites in the town centre for re-imaging and engaged professional mural artists to deliver workshops for local children.

He began his career in  as a Chemistry Teacherin Wallace High School, moving to Regent House School where he later was appointed Head of Chemistry and then to the Principalship of Rathfriland High School. From his early career,Simon excelled not only as a vibrant and engaging classroom teacher, but also as the leader of the largest Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme in the Province whilst at Regent House.Simon brought to Portadown College this lelong passion for adventure and outdoor pursuits by participating in Duke of Edinburgh expeditions and instilling a love of the outdoors in all of the young people who participated in these ventures.A hallmark of Simon’s Principalship was his heartfelt interest in students and staff as iniduals. So as to ensure that each knew their value, he was always ready to offer a gentle word of encouragement and would urge them to, “Do something today that your future self will thank you for”.Regardless of background, belief or personal circumstances, students, staff and parents were received with a warm smile and a sincere willingness to work towards a positive outcome. In all such situations, Simon gave of his time generously and graciously, always setting aside his own priorities to support others.Simon was a strong educational leader with distinctive values which he brought to a range of challenging situations. As a College community, we are indebted to him for the dedication and industry he demonstrated in working alongside the Board of Governors to advocate for the Dickson Plan, consistently placing students at the heart of his educational vision.A man of strong personality and principles, Simon espoused high standards in allaspects of College le and never once shied away from any criticism this might have attracted.Simon’s service to education in Northern Ireland extended beyond Portadown College and included holding office in the Craigavon Area Learning Community, Association of ControlledGrammar Schools and the Post-Primary Principal’s Association. His long standing career had also involved acting as Chief Examiner for A Level Chemistry with the CCEA.A passionate traveller who enjoyed adventures in the most far-flung corners of the globe,Simon was ever keen to share his experiences with students and staff alike, encouraging each and every one to get out into the world, savour its magnicence and seize every opportunity. One of Simon’s most distinctive qualities was that he never lost a childlike sense of awe and wonder at the beauty of the world. He took particular delight in his garden at the foothills of the Mountains of Mourne and regularly enjoyed walking these hills with his much loved Irish Deerhound companions, Oisin and Uther.Current and former students will remember with fondness his infectious sense of fun and wicked humour, from his cameo roles in College charity events to a starring role in “PC Happy”. In jovial banter with students, staff and Governors, he also shared his love for sport, in particular his longstanding support for Ulster and Irish Rugby, alongside Coventry City and Crusaders football teams.A man of eclectic taste, Simon derived considerable joy from art and music of all genres - classical, Irish folk and contemporary. Proud of his Banbridge roots and passionate about his Ulster culture, he demonstrated a reverent respect for tradition, as exemplied through his meticulous attention to detail and great pride in leading the College’s annual Act of Remembrance.Indeed, Simon often reflected poignantly on the sacrice of others and had served proudly as an officer in the Royal Naval Reserve for almost a quarter of a century.Students and staff alike will hold dear the sentiment of Simon’s final Easter Assembly, inspired by his many visits to Coventry Cathedral, in which he spoke on the theme of Forgiveness and the message of Hope in the death and resurrection of Jesus themes deeply important to Simon and ones which he sought to enact in his daily le.As a College community, our loss is immeasurable. However, we will endeavour to uphold the College Motto “Fortiter et Humaniter” in Simon’s memory:May the road rise up to meet you.May the wind be always at your back.May the sun shine warm upon your facethe rains fall soft upon your fieldsand until we meet again,may God hold you in the palm of His hand."},{"url":null,"title":"traffic and","story":"The Department for Infrastructure has warned motorists to expect icy conditions on roads in the north, west and south of the Province tomorrow morning.

They know they are in the UK but don’t realise they are on a dferent land mass to England. We provide basic information on housing, hospitals, police serviceand run walkabouts and talk-abouts to bring people around and show them basic things like buying a bus ticket or using an ATM. These are things that you and I take for granted.“Our other main thing is the reach to resilience programme. We deliver family support across Belfast. This can be everything from learning to say no, IT skills, safety on the internet and workshops.“The European employment service programme also provides information on free movement on labour across Europe, something which is attracting huge interest given the threats of Brexit.”It is perhaps the John Hewitt Bar, located just around the corner from the Belfast Unemployed Resource Centre, which is the hidden gem of the organisation.Not many people know that the BURC own the bar as a social enterprise, meaning all profits go back into funding their key projects outlined here.The bar was the first social enterprise bar set up in the north and continues to run as a competitive business in the Cathedral Quarter, serving food and it is very popular for its range of beers.Aisling says the location of the BURC is beneficial for service users and hopes their programmes will continue to benefit those who need them.“These programmes are hugely important. The centre is located on the outskirts of the city centre, people can come all over. We can reach a wider network of people and bring the programmes to them.“We are also keen to deliver programmes in their own areas before they feel safe to come to the city centre office.“Our overall aim is to try and bring people back into the local community.“One such challenge today is some people coming to us to report incidents of racism because they don’t feel comfortable going to police. We can help support them and give them advice on how to deal with such an issue and not just accept it as an everyday occurrence.“Overall, the general feedback from people has been very positive. For mothers, learning how to say no is an important issue. We want to give people the confidence, skills and knowledge to try things a bit dferently and explore the way they react to things.“Many of our programmes have come out of other ones – all our work is led by the inidual and other service users.“We want to give people skills of a community leader to empower themselves and help them in every way possible.”Belfast Unemployed Resource Centre,- Donegall Street Place,Belfast,BT FNTel:   Email: info@burc.org or esol@burc.org For more information, visit www.burc.org"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"its double delight for little daithi","story":"THE family of little Dáithí Mac Gabhann are celebrating after learning that their son has made the shortlist for the annual British Heart Foundation’s Heart Hero awards.It was discovered during a routine -week scan that little Dáithí’s heart had not developed as it should have and it was found that the now two-year-old toddler had Hypoplastic heart syndrome.

Seph and Máirtín also spoke of how their campaign has taken striking visual awareness with the addition of Dáithí’s pink Is Deontóir Mé slogan and picture emblazoned on a black taxi.“To see the logo on the taxi fills us with so much pride, everyone is going to see it on the road and evenit makes somebody stop and turn around, maybe think twice about organ donation for a wee second, it makes all the dference.”Máirtín added: “I can’t really put it into words how happy we are to find out that Dáithí has been shortlisted for the Heart Hero award. We have sparked up a great relationship with the British Heart Foundation for a couple of months now. They do absolutely unbelievable work that will benefit Dáithí and people like Dáithí, they also work on the promotion of organ donation as well.“In these very hard times, to hear that Dáithí is worthy of this award is great for us. “We are really looking forward to going back to London as Dáithi’s hospital is not that far from where we are going to be – not that we were looking to go into an ICU ward but we can’t wait to bring Dáithí in. The last time the staff saw him he was such a tiny baby, his chest was open, they were preparing us for the worst. Dáithi is turning three when we are over and we can’t wait to show him off to all the doctors and nurses who saved his le.”“Being from West Belfast, I’ve used black taxis all my le, five times a week, twice a day, all my le. To know we have my son on the taxi in bright pink is brilliant, everytime we see the taxi we cheer, Daithí shouts out the car window ‘meeeeeeeeeee’. We want to thank driver Micky Russell for helping us to create awareness, it looks class, we are delighted,” he said.Micky added: “There are only two things you can see from space, the Great Wall of China and my taxi,” he laughed. “It’s an absolute privilege to have the wrap around on the taxi, to create that visual awareness. The taxi is up and down the road, the Shankill, I’ve tourists in the taxi as well, they would ask ‘why the colour ’ I can say to them about organ donation and Dáithí.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"julie file locked for 45","story":"THE sister of a -year-old Lenadoon girl killed by aplastic bullet in  has hit out a decision to lock the National Archives file on her death for another  years. Julie Livingstone was ing from a local shop on the Stewartstown Road when she was fatally injured by a plastic bullet on , May . The round, which was fired from a British Army vehicle, struck her on the head and she died the next day. Earlier this week, researchers at the Pat Finucane Centre in Derry revealed that files held at the National Archives in Kew, London, relating to Julie’s death are to be kept closed until . Earlier this week it was reported that a further file relating to the plastic bullet death of a child has been locked for decades. -year-old Paul Whitters, who died on April , ,  days after being struck in the head with a plastic bullet fired by the RUC in Derry, has been closed until .It is extremely unusual for inidual files to be held on people killed in the conflict – the fact that these two files relate to schoolchildren has raised questions about why their deaths have been given such attention and what facts lie within the files that the British government wants to hide. The Northern Ireland office has said the files have been closed “in the interest of national security”. Reacting to the discovery, Julie’s sister, Elizabeth Livingstone, said that justice had been withheld from her family “for long enough”.“None of us – my brothers or sisters – are going to be alive by the time the file is opened again,it ever is,” she said. “Our parents have already passed away and nobody who ever knew Julie will be alive by then. What could possibly be pertinent to a -year-old’s death – a child’s death – that needs to be kept a secret  What is it that we’re not allowed to know about our sister’s death  We had to go through three inquests to clear Julie’s name. Ultimately, Julie was found to be an innocent victim, but that was after several years of us struggling to get a fair inquest. We already thought that justice had been withheld from us for long enough.”She continued: “It’s not a case of ‘Are they hiding something ’ This is about what’s being hidden. It’s obviously something that would prove to be an embarrassment to the British government and the NIO. Our Julie was a -year-old innocent victim. She was going about her own business when she was shot in the head and murdered. What could they possibly not want us to know about it  Your imagination runs wild. The only thing we could do for her was to get justice and now this has happened.”Paul O’Connor from the Pat Finucane Centre described the decision to close the files as “perverse”.“The decision to close Julie’s file until  was made earlier this year,” he explained. “There’s another file on plastic bullets in general, which is closed until  and it beggars belief. I have never seen anything like this before. We see lots of files closed for a long time, but these two files on the deaths of children who were killed by plastic bullets, one by the British Army, one by the RUC.” He added: “There is a total culture of secrecy within the NIO, within Ministry of Defence, and from all of those who want to protect the reputation of RUC and the British Army. They don’t want this information to come out, but it will come out. I’m confident that this file will not be closed until .”The Livingstone family have since written to the Secretary of State, Karen Bradley, to request a meeting about the NIO’s decision. Relatives for Justice CEO, Mark Thompson, called on Ms Bradley to order the release of the files.“Julie was  years of age when she was killed by a plastic bullet in ,” he said. “Her father Archie travelled these islands and Europe telling the world what happened to his baby girl. Along with the other families and injured in the United Campaign Against Plastic Bullets, he wanted to make a positive dference, to shine a light of truth and justice in the face of the horror his and other families endured. All families who have experienced state violence know that the British government will go to any s to protect its own interest. This strategic policy of impunity for the killing of Irish children clearly extends even to librarians and archives keepers. They too are complicit in the policies that accompany British state violence. This decision, undoubtedly made under direction, was made while families are asked to engage in a consultation on dealing with the past. This discovery points to the bad faith behind this consultation, as well as displaying the callous indference of those responsible. The least Karen Bradley can do now is meet with the families of Julie Livingstone and Paul Whitters. The very least the keeper of the archives can do under Bradley’s instruction is give the families these files.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Feature-pic-copy.png","title":"road safety on agenda for lisnasharragh rep","story":"MANY of you will have heard about the need for road safety improvements to four specic spots in the upper Ormeau area, writes Stevie Jenkins. They are the crossing at Ormeau Road and St John’s Avenue, the intersection of Knock Eden Park and Knockbreda Road, the entrance to Cherryvale Playing Fields and outside the Good Shepherd Church. I was delighted to be able to update the community face-to-face at the inaugural ‘Empowerment through engagement’ public meeting in the newly-built Good Shepherd Parish Centre. We took those present through the criteria obtained from the Department for Infrastructure for each of the locations. There followed a very constructive conversation with the local stakeholders present. The residents, school, youth and sporting organisation leaders all had ideas about how we could work together to build a profile to meet the department’s requirements, thus speeding up progress and change. We then arranged a face-to-face meeting between the stakeholders and the department. We voiced our concerns, including the fact that, at no time in the assessment process for new crossings, was there a public consultation.Such was the success of the meeting that arrangements were made for a second meeting on mental health, an interactive session with the superb local organisations Aware, Inspire and PIPS. Each of these bodies showcased what they do and how we can improve mental wellbeing in our area. Again, the focus was on introducing the local community to important organisations who can help us to access better services. One of the most pleasant effects of the meetings is the frequency of inquiries from constituents about the next meeting. An inquisitive community is an empowered community. I am delighted to confirm that the next meeting is on local history and will take place in May."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"the pen is mightier than the sword","story":"Address by Father Martin Magill at the funeral of Lyra McKee at St Anne#s Cathedral.May I speak in the Name of the Living God.First of all, I want to thank Dean Stephen Forde for his kind invitation to give this reflection today. I have no idea what you Sara, Lyra’s partner must have felt on Thursday night when those shots rang out and Lyra was hit and fell to the ground.I can’t begin to imagine what you Lyra’s mum, and you her sisters and brothers must have gone through when Sara phoned to tell you Lyra had been shot. I can’t imagine the agony of your drive to Altnagelvin hospital knowing that Lyra had died.Many of us here in this cathedral have been praying for you since we heard the dreadful news and will continue to do so.Since the story of Lyra’s murder broke on Holy Thursday into Good Friday, there has been an enormous sense of grief and solidarity with you from many people at this huge injustice. Many, many wonderful things have been said about her including the warm and deserved tributes paid to her by the Secretary of State and by MPs of all parties in the House of Commons yesterday evening. In death Lyra, has united people of many dferent backgrounds, as further evidenced by this erse congregation at her funeral.Like so many others I couldn’t believe it when I heard the am news on Good Friday morning that Lyra McKee had been shot dead the previous night. I’d met Lyra on several occasions, we had kept in contact by phone, ‘what’s app’,and Twitter. I would however have to confess that I wasn’t aware of her great love of Harry Potter. I hadn’t heard the term ‘Hufflepuff’ until I did an internet search and found this definition # ‘Hufflepuff is the most inclusive among the four houses valuing hard work, dedication, patience, loyalty, and fair play.’ It struck me that the definition could just as easily have been about Lyra. Whilst Harry Potter didn’t feature in our conversations what did and it was our last exchange on Twitter at the end of March when Lyra tweeted me with a photo of herself dressed in a nun’s veil with a glass of cider accompanied with these words: ‘Got roped into performing as part of a Sister Act tribute act for Foyle Hospice. Hey @MartinJMagill, you need any help with mass tomorrow ’Let me give a brief overview of Lyra’s le. She was born on st March . She attended Holy Family PS just off the Limestone Road. In her early days at school, she struggled with reading and required extra support.Things changed dramatically when one of her teachers, Mr O’Neill began to read to her class The Twits by Roald Dahl. This was the spark that got Lyra interested in reading and then thanks to her granny Patricia Lawrie buying her each of the Harry Potter books as they were published this led to her le long interest in Harry Potter and later on to exchanges in social media with JK Rowling.Lyra’s love of reading was further nurtured when she went to St Gemma’s High School, just off the Oldpark Road also in North Belfast. Her interest in journalism began at the age of  when she wrote for the St Gemma’s school newspaper.Shortly afterwards Lyra became involved in a charity called “The Headliners’ which gives young people a voice by using journalism and media as a tool for learning and campaigning. This project played an important part in her being awarded the Sky News Young Journalist Award . After school and further education, Lyra studied online journalism at Birmingham City University graduating with an MA degree. Over the years her writing has won her much acclaim such as her letter when she was  to her  year old self about growing up as gay in Belfast. In , aged just , she was acknowledged internationallyas an exceptional achiever with an exciting future by Forbes magazine in their  under  listbecause of her work as an investigative reporter.Last month thefeatured Lyra in an article considering the  rising stars of Irish writing. Her memory also lives on in her TEDx talk, #How uncomfortable conversations can save lives”, about the  Orlando nightclub shooting. Her book on the murder of Rev Robert Bradford, the Member of Parliament for South Belfast, called Angels with Blue Faces was due to be published later this year.Lyra came to see me as part of her research on a book she was working on called Lost Boys. We met on several occasions and kept in contact. I knew absolutely nothing about  year old Thomas Spence and  year old John Rodgers, who vanished at a bus stop onthe Falls Road in West Belfast in November . They were both living in St John’s Parish at that time where I am presently the parish priest and it was for this reason Lyra came to see me. By the time Lyra had told me their story and what she hoped to do, I was fully behind her. Nichola her sister who spoke earlier described Lyra like #a dog with a bone’ when she had found something that interested her.I certainly experienced her gentle, determined doggedness. When we exchanged greetings on New Year’s Day and I wished her well not only in the writing of Lost Boys but also in her search for the remains of the boys which she made clear to me was very important to her. She replied in this way: ‘If that#s the only thing that comes out of this, it#ll be worth it. It#s the only thing I really want out of it, to find them and the others.’In the course of her investigations, Lyra had discovered that other children had disappeared and she had wanted to find their bodies.I pray that her work will be taken up and that their bodies will be found and even more importantly that there will be no more ‘lost boys’ or ‘lost girls.’When I consider Lyra’s determination, it strikes me that she was the embodiment of the St Gemma’s school motto: ‘truth and charity.’ On Good Friday, the day on which Christians all over the world recall the suffering and death of Jesus Christ we also wrestle with the mystery of suffering. For you Lyra’s nearest and dearest, you came to know the experience of Good Friday in your own lives. For those of us who follow Jesus, we believe that the shedding of his innocent blood on the cross was enough # in the words of the hymn: ‘the cross has said it all’. We don’t need any more innocent blood to be shed.The irony could not be more poignant when we consider the signing of the Good Friday agreement which was about ensuring there would be no more deaths like Lyra’s. Earlier in this service, we listened to Matthew’s account of the Beatitudes which was chosen by her family in remembrance of Lyra learning these by heart when she was a pupil at St Gemma’s. The beatitude ‘Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God’is very timely. Many of us will be praying that Lyra’s death in its own way will not have been in vain and will contribute in some way to building peace here. Since Thursday night we have seen the coming together of many people in ious places and the unying of the community against violence. I commend our political leaders for standing together in Creggan on Good Friday. I am however left with a question: ‘Why in God’s name does it take the death of a  year old woman with her whole le in front of her to get us to this point ’ As Christians recalled the death of Jesus on the cross, we remembered that his death was not in vain but was for us the doorway to eternal le. I dare to hope that Lyra’s murder on Holy Thursday night can be the doorway to a new beginning. I detect a deep desire for this. One of Lyra’s friends was reported as saying: ‘We have had enough. There is a younger generation coming up in the town and they don#t need guns put in their hands.They need jobs, they need a better health service and education. They need a le, not a gun put in their hands.’ To those who had any part in her murder, I encourage you to reflect on Lyra McKee journalist and writer as a powerful example of ‘The pen is mightier than the sword’.I plead with you to take the road of non violence to achieve your political ends. It was encouraging to see that those who provide a political analysis to the organisation responsible for her death chose to call off their parade on Easter Monday following the call from Fr Joe Gormley, the parish priest in Creggan where Lyra was killed. To those still intent on violence, I ask you to listen to the majority of the people on your beloved island of Ireland who are calling on you to stop. I pay tribute to the courage and determination of the women who in a very powerful gesture of non violence,one by one placed their hands in blood red paint on a wall and said loudly ‘we are not afraid.’ I commend the + people in Creggan who have contacted the police. There is a rule in many of our communities that we do not, we should not, give information to police and that, to do so is to become a ‘tout.’ But that was one of a number of rules # rules that also said that it was OK to brutalise children for petty crimes, or rules that say you can live in the locality until you are told you can’t or rules that said that the only way we could gain ‘freedom’ was by other fellow-human beings losing their lives. But this week I have seen these rules turned on their head. I have seen many people stand up and condemn this culture of violence and coercive control. We need to send a very dferent message and so I appeal to those who have information about Lyra’s murder but who haven#t yet come forward to do so now. If you want to see an end to these brutal rules, and see a new society built on justice and fairness, on hope and not fear, then you can help build that society by letting the police know what you know. There will be special measures put in place to ensure your safety and where you will not be intimidated by coercive controllers,you do so.To the many politicians present in this cathedral today, let me say again those words which one of Lyra’s friends had said: ’the younger generation need jobs, they need a better health service and education. They need a le, not a gun put in their hands.’ As politicians you will be familiar with the first report of the Independent Reporting Commission published last October which examined in depth paramilitary style attacks and found a clear correlation between these attacks and areas of social deprivation. Lyra’s friend is right in pointing out that our young people need jobs, and education and training to get those jobs. All our young people need a le that gives them an aspiration for the future. As our politicians we need you to be working together to make that happen so that especially for those living in deprived areas that they will feel the peace process is working for them as well – and especially for young people living in these communities. To the press and media which Lyra was so proud to be part of – I ask you to report on what is being done in these areas – to praise good work where you find it and report when it is not happening. I know you as politicians have a very dficult job to but then so too did Lyra. There is another valuable lesson from her le # she was like ‘a dog with a bone’ when she believed she could make a dference. When it comes to our peace process, I would love to see this dogged attitude to the rebuilding of an Assembly that works for the common good. As I listen to the radio every morning, all I seem to hear about ious initiatives in Northern Ireland are these words, ‘without a minister, this can’t be taken forward’. I pray that Lyra’s murder may be the catalyst needed for parties to start talking, to reform that which was corrosive in previous Assemblies and to begin anew. On Easter Sunday, Christians all over the world celebrated the most important event of the Christian year, the resurrection of Jesus. It was because of his resurrection that we believe in le beyond the grave and in the words of today’s second reading from John : ‘in my Father’s house there are many dwelling places.’ It is in this hope of eternal le and happiness that we gather in prayer and now into the tender mercy of a loving God and Father I commend Lyra McKee.

If you open a calendar on any given week you will find a reason for politicians to hold off engaging with each other..pushMarching season, conference season, elections, pressure in Westminster, negotiations in Brussels and issues within inidual parties are just a few examples.Little more than a week ago the usual script had been written, and was widely accepted, for the weeks ahead.Politicians in Westminster, Brussels, Dublin and Belfast were taking an Easter break in the assumption that there could be no engagement while local and European election campaigns were being fought in Northern Ireland in May. The script said the parties were on the doorsteps and would inevitably maintain partisan politics until the elections had past.Just after pm on Thursday April  that script was torn up by the senseless and heartbreaking murder of a woman whose name we have all come to know, Lyra McKee, whom, by the outstanding tributes of her partner, family and friends, we all wish we had known in le.As a politician and Tanaiste there are many things you experience that are unique but there are only a handful of experiences that you know will stay with you until the end of your days.Being in the front pews of St Annes Cathedral as an unstoppable wave of applause, hope and demand hit the most senior politicians from the UK and Ireland in the base of our spines is one such moment I will never forget.The words of Father Martin Magill summed up the desire and frustration of all communities in Northern Ireland in a sentence,\"Why in Gods name does it take the death of the -year old woman, with her whole le in front of her, to get to this point \"Last summer violence in Derry saw live bullets being fired and police officers narrowly escaping injury or death. In January seven young people were minutes from being killed after they passed the car bomb that sat in the centre of Derry. However, on April  the cowards claimed a victim. The fact that it was a journalist and writer who was a shining example of everything Northern Ireland can achieve is the reason so many people have come together to mourn.The night before Lyra McKees funeral I sat in Strand Road police station in Derry with the officers who had tried to save her le. These men and women are hardened by the fact that petrol bombs can be thrown at them in the course of their everyday work but on Tuesday night they were numbed and vulnerable at the fact that a young woman had died beside them. Despite their Land Rovers being alight with petrol and live ammunition being fired at them, the PSNI left its secure position to get to Lyra McKee after she had been hit. They made the decision to drive to Altnagelvin Hospital, officers performed CPR on Lyra for the entire journey and they stayed and supported her partner and friends as the horrible news of her death was confirmed. The leadership shown by the PSNI in Derry has rightly been applauded by the community it serves.While I heard Father Magills rallying call for political leadership loud and clear, I also heard what he said about the events in Derry as the news of Lyras murder sunk in: \"I commend our political leaders for standing together in Creggan on Good Friday.\"Arlene Foster, Michelle ONeill, Colum Eastwood, Robin Swann and Naomi Long were not ordered to release a joint statement by anyone or told to go into the Creggan. When a dark moment threatened to drag Northern Ireland back to a dark past their natural inclination was to do the right thing.We now have a window where the Irish and British Governments are calling the parties together. We have all spoken in person and on the phone many times in the last week and without exception I believe all the party leaders are genuine in their desire toto Stormont.As we meet in the weeks ahead, a conversation I had with Mrs Joan McKee will be foremost in my mind.Standing in the side chapel of St Annes was the President of Ireland, the Taoiseach, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom as well as myself as Tanaiste, the Secretary of State and ministers of both governments. Despite all the power of those elected offices we were standing there as a group that was utterly powerless to comfort a woman who had, as Joan put it, \"lost her baby\".We owe it to Joan and Lyra McKee to make sure no other ceasefire babies are murdered in the prime of their lives and to make sure that Northern Ireland has a ing government.There is never a perfect time to do the right thing in Northern Ireland. However, there is a right time and that time is now.Simon Coveney is Tanaiste of the Republic of Ireland"},{"url":null,"title":"36000 food bank packages handed out in a year in","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

More than a thirdof food bank referrals made due to a delay in benefits being paid in Northern Ireland were linked to Universal Credit.From this data, and other insights from food banks in the Trussell Trusts network, the charity believes ending the five-week wait for a first Universal Credit payment should be the Governments first priority to help create a future without food banks.\"Year-on-year we are seeing more and more people in Northern Ireland struggling to eat because they simply cannot afford food,\" said Dave Magill, Trussell Trust operations manager for Northern Ireland.\"This isnt right. We know Northern Ireland is on a clf-edge with less than a year to go before we see the extra flexibility currently available to people under our benefits system come to an end.\"We have real concerns about the impact this will have on our communities.\"Our benefits system should anchor us all from being swept into poverty.

But they also couldnt have missed the venting of pent-up anger and frustration from ordinary people during the funeral at the political impasse of the past two years.The Belfast priest, a friend of Lyra, didnt even have to finish a sentence before mourners erupted in applause as he asked why it had taken the New IRAs murder of the journalist to unite politicians.Fr Magill took two attempts before he could complete the question: \"Why in Gods name does it take the death of a -year-old woman with her whole le in front of her to get to this point \"Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSet data-dfpadtargetingThe coffin of journalist Lyra McKee is taken out of the church after her funeral at St Annes Cathedral on April ,  in Belfast, Northern Ireland.Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Prime Minister Theresa May pictured at the funeral and service of thanksgiving for the le of journalist Lyra McKee and Prime Minister Theresa Mayleave St Annes Cathedral in Belfast on April , , after attending the funeral service of journalist Lyra McKee \"Irish Prime minister Leo Varadkarand Prime Minister Theresa Mayleave St Annes Cathedral in Belfast on April , , after attending the funeral service of journalist Lyra McKee \"Irish President Michael D Higgins consoles Sara Canning, partner of the murdered journalist Lyra McKee as her funeral takes place at St. Annes Cathedral  and Irish President Michael D Higgins pictured at and at the funeral.

Lyra McKee was murdered in Creggan in Derry on Thursday th April.Photo by Kelvin Boyes   Press Eye.\"The funeral of Journalist Lyra McKee takes place at St Annes Cathedral in Belfast on April th  \"Mourners begin to gather for the funeral of Lyra McKee at St Annes Cathedral in Belfast on April th  In a response redolent of what happened at Princess Dianas funeral in London in , hundreds of people who had gathered outside the cathedral also clapped as they listened to a relay of the priests words in Donegall Street, where from early morning it was obvious that Lyras send-off was going to be a funeral like no other.Young people dressed in the colourful garb of Harry Potter characters and comic book heroes came in their hundreds to say their painful farewells, but also to give thanks for their slain friend, who they called \"a girl in a million\".Some mourners carried rainbow flags in honour of Lyra, a committed campaigner for LGBT rights.Prime Minister Theresa May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn took time out from their fraught Brexit negotiations to join Irish President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to pay tribute to Lyra.Few disputed the north Belfast author and journalist was destined to write herself into the annals of the great wordsmiths, but sadly she made headlines of horror and heartbreak across the globe after being killed by dissident republicans.One friend said she hoped the message from yesterdays funeral that would go out around the world would be how the murder had crystallised the fact that there was for once at least a united Ireland - united in abhorrence of Lyras murder by a New IRA gunman.However, the tears of sorrow yesterday for Lyra were also fused with tears of laughter as her friends and family celebrated her remarkable le that, they said, was full of fun and joy. And compassion and love.People from a myriad of backgrounds, from all generations, of all sexual orientations and from all religions and none, showed the world - which Lyra had at her talented feet - an unmistakable and unshakeable determination that they will not allow her death to have been in vain, and that as in her le, her passing must make a dference.It was also a powerful message that the New IRA must listen to the demands that it should give up violence once and for all.Even the choice of St Annes Cathedral for the service was powerfully symbolic in itself, a recognition of an all-too-rare shared space in what has been a ided city.Only pre-eminent churchmen, sports stars, business leaders and musicians are usually accorded funeral services in the historic building.And normally they have been older men and women who have lived their lives, not a young woman who was still on the threshold of hers and who wasnt even born of the Protestant persuasion.The service was broadcast live by the British-based  hour news channels and dozens of photographers and journalists from English newspapers were in attendance.Lyras murder may have catapulted her into the public domain, but at her funeral her love for her family was also underscored by inspiring addresses about the private side of the daughter who would phone her mother Joan  times a day to check that she was all right - \"even when she was upstairs\".Lyras sister Nichola Corner spoke on behalf of herself, her distraught mother, her sisters Joan and Mary and brothers Gary and David.Nichola told mourners that Lyra had been buried with a flower in her hair in response to her love of the Scott McKenzie song San Francisco.She said the family didnt have Dumbledores time turner to change the past.\"But within each of us we have the power to create the kind of society that Lyra envisioned,\" she added.\"In the words of Lyra herself, we must change our own world, one piece at a time. Now lets get to work.\"Lyras friend Stephen Lusty - a self-avowed \"middle-class, middle-aged Protestant heterosexual British male engineer\" - told the congregation that she had told him just hours before she died that she was going to propose to her partner Sara Canning in New York.\"She showed me pictures of the ring she had bought for Sara and told me of the fabulous plans she had of her proposal in May,\" said Mr Lusty.\"She made me put a date in my diary for the wedding in Donegal in  and gave me strict instructions to wear my kilt, which she always wanted to borrow, adorn it with some Harry Potter, and to find or refind my own version of Sara.\"He laughingly referred to the questions she would ask him out of the blue about whether it was closer to drive to Derry or Londonderry, or why Protestants ate more vegetables than Catholics.Mr Lusty said that after he introduced the indefatigable Lyra to the late southern politician Brian Lenihan, he described her as a \"star\".But he added: \"I would rather do  rounds in the boxing ring with Paisley than do that again.\"He said that in her online journalistic work Lyra received \"more than her fair share of cyber abuse and trolling, but she never hated anyone\".He said his generation had sung about an alternative Ulster - the words of a song by Belfast punk band Stf Little Fingers - but added that people here should now build an alternative Ulster and make peace a lasting legacy of Lyra McKee.Speaking at the beginning of the service, Dean Stephen Forde said: \"Lyra was a person who broke down barriers and reached across boundaries, this was her hallmark in le, this is her legacy in death.\"As a journalist she pursued truth wherever it took her, never content with the sullen silence of unanswered questions.\"She was a child of the Good Friday Agreement.\"She was a primary school pupil in north Belfast when the Agreement was signed.\"She grew up to champion its hope for a society that was free from the prejudices of the past and open to the possibilities of a new future for the people of these islands.\"In her short le Lyra had amassed an extensive network of friends and influential contacts, especially in the realms of crusading and investigative journalism.And the esteem in which she was held was reflected in the fact that upwards of  writers and broadcasters formed a guard of honour for her as her coffin was carried out of the cathedral.The size of the overall attendance underlined the reality that St Annes was the only church big enough to accommodate everyone who wanted to pay their respects to the diminutive girl with the towering and prodigious spirit from a couple of miles up the road in Ardoyne.For many of the people at the service it was their first ever visit to the Church of Ireland cathedral.Lyras family had requested that everyone should give her a dignied send-off but the -minute service wasnt all about solemnity and sadness. Lyras partner Sara had said on Facebook that the \"love of her le\" would like itpeople would wear Hufflepuff, Harry Potter or Marvel-related items at the service.Her friends didnt let her down and Hufflepuff colours were everywhere on scarves and T-shirts emblazoned with #teamlyra.No one was expecting to see DUP leader Arlene Foster or Sinn Fein vice-president Michelle ONeill wearing Hogwarts outfits.But the fact that they were there at all was interpreted by many as a sign of hope.However, that is what many commentators said when the same duo shook hands at the Requiem Mass for Martin McGuinness in the Bogside just over two years ago.\"And look what good that did us,\" one observer pointed out yesterday.But she added: \"The only dference today is that the calls at the funeral were so vocerous and so unanimous that its hard to see how they can be ignored.\"Famous faces voice support for familyAs hundreds gathered at St Anne’s Cathedral yesterday for the funeral of Lyra McKee, many other prominent voices shared their support on social media.Comedian Patrick Kielty posted: “Today Lyra McKee is laid to rest. She believed in peace, tolerance and equality. The exact opposite of those responsible. They will never win because Lyra will always be the future. And her truth will continue to be told.”Actress Bronagh Waugh said: “Thinking of Lyra’s family and friends and partner Sara who have the unfathomable burden of laying her to rest today.“Thinking of the people of Derry, of Belfast. But most of all I’m thinking about Lyra and what a bright and shining light she was.”"},{"url":null,"title":"boojum eaterie rapped over easter advert","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

And the organisation insist that while their members are concerned about the recent charging of soldiers with historical killings in Northern Ireland like Soldier F in relation to Bloody Sunday, their commemoration on Saturday, August  will be a memorial, not a protest.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetThe day will start in Lisburns Wallace Park with a drumhead service before a parade around the city where wreathes will be laid at three dferent points including the scene of a  explosion which killed six soldiers ing from a charity fun run in a minibus.Other floral tributes will be left at Lisburns war memorial and at a statue in honour of the UDR.Organisers say all veterans will be welcome at the commemoration, dating right back to the B Specials and the RUC along with ex-members of the UDR and the Prison Service.But representatives of the Garda Siochana and the Irish Army have also been invited to take part.\"Its a completely inclusive programme,\" said Ian Simpson, media spokesman for NIVA and the chairman of the NI Prison Service Benevolent Fund.One of the centrepieces of the NIVA remembrance day will be the display of the names of soldiers, police officers and prison staff that died in Northern Ireland.There will be , names on a big screen and in remembrance books, twice the number of personnel listed in official records as having been killed in terrorist attacks.NIVA say their roll of honour also includes men and women who died as a result of suicides, accidents and stress-related illnesses which developed as a result of the Troubles.NIVA say they are not inviting serving military chiefs or Royal family members to the Lisburn event although a retired Army general will take the salute.Ian Simpson said: \"The VIPs on the day will be the widows or the families of the people who died. All the organisations within NIVA will nominate representatives to take the salute too.\"He said the decision to hold a separate memorial event here rather than to take part in the national one in England was because this is where it all happened.\"There will be veterans attending both events,\" added Ian. \"And we will still be going to a ceremony we hold every year at the Ulster Ash Grove at the National Arboretum in September. But we thought it was important to have a local ceremony to remember everyone who died or was hurt.\"Organisers are hoping that upwards of , veterans will take part in the parade with , relatives and members of the public in attendance.Tens of thousands of service personnel were injured in the conflict which saw , soldiers coming to Northern Ireland over the  years of Op Banner.\"Taking in the police and the UDR you are talking about half a million people who saw service,\" said Ian, who added that while remembrance of the dead will be the main priority, it wont be the only focus of the Lisburn event.Old security forces vehicles and a scout helicopter will be there for people to see in the centre of Lisburn along with private collections of unorms, decommissioned weapons and regimental memorabilia.\"We want it to be a special day,\" said Ian, who has urged opponents of the security forces to respect the NIVA commemoration. We will be there to remember our fallen colleagues in a peaceful and dignied way and we would ask everyone to respect our day. We are not out to offend anyone.\"Organisers say the parade around Lisburn will include  local bands who have been issued with strict code of conduct about what is expected of them with no colour parties or flags on display.The original hope was that the Ministry of Defence would have given their approval for military bands to take part but their permission was not forthcoming.\"We were disappointed especially as so many people who were here during Op Banner were serving the MoD and some gave all,\" added Ian.He insisted that NIVA are hoping to avoid controversy on their day of commemoration, especially in the wake of the charging of retired soldiers with murder.In a statement NIVA said: \"Service personnel have to act within the law of the land. But this does not get away from the fact that veterans justiably feel that the scales of justice are tilted against them and that the likes of Soldier F are being sacriced as a sop to placate Republicans whose latent threat of ato violence is seen by them as influencing government policy.\""},{"url":null,"title":"exunionist mps country pile sells after three years","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

have a narrow window in which genuine progress can be made and we must act now,” she added.Mr Coveney also urged young Catholics to join and support the Police Service of Northern Ireland , saying it “takes real courage to transform your community despite often intimidating circumstances”.He said: “They know that communities have to be able to see themselves in the communities they’re working with.“If you want to show your support for a better future, show your support for the police.“Support young people who are brave enough to consider joining that police force.”In a direct message to dissident republicans, he said: “They are a small minority who try to control communities through fear and intimidation and twisted, warped thinking.“They are not protecting communities, they are endangering them.”Mr Coveney said there was an “urgent need for positive and determined action” because “we are leaving far too much wide open space for other kinds of voices that don’t believe in democracy but that peddle hate and fear”.I think what every decent-thinking person in Northern Ireland wants now is to see us take that spark of determination that I think we have all felt in the last few days and to seewe can build a momentum from that to do something real and positiveSimon CoveneyHe said the British-Irish Council would convene on May , the day after fresh talks on powersharing begin.Mr Coveney added: “I think what every decent-thinking person in Northern Ireland wants now is to see us take that spark of determination that I think we have all felt in the last few days and to seewe can build a momentum from that to do something real and positive.”Asked how confident she was that the fresh round of talks would succeed, Mrs Bradley said: “I think what we saw this time last week – with the party leaders coming together, going to the Creggan estate, standing united, putting out a joint statement – really gives me a clear indication that the party leaders do want to do this.“We are very realistic about what’s going to be involved and what’s going to be needed. It isn’t going to be easy, but I am absolutely determined – as is Simon – that we will make a success of this.“I truly believe, from my conversations with the leaders this week, that they agree with that.”Mr Coveney added: “I think it’s dferent this time. I think there’s a real understanding that Northern Ireland desperately needs its own government right now.”He said that Northern Irish people could see that “the ordinary day-to-day stuff of politics is not working”.“People are saying, ‘Enough. Do your job. Establish Stormont in a way that will allow it to work again through an executive that hopefully involves all parties’,” he added.Earlier, Prime Minister Theresa May and Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said: “We also heard the unmistakable message to all political leaders that people across Northern Ireland want to see a new momentum for political progress.As Prime Minister and Taoiseach, we are determined to work together to ensure this process comes to a successful conclusionPrime Minister and Taoiseach“We agree that what is now needed is actions and not just words from all of us who are in positions of leadership.“We have agreed to establish a new process of political talks, involving all the main political parties in Northern Ireland, together with the UK and Irish governments, in accordance with the three-stranded process.“The aim of these talks is quickly to re-establish to full operation the democratic institutions of the Belfast Good Friday Agreement – the Northern Ireland Executive, Assembly and North-South Ministerial Council – so that they can effectively serve all of the people for the future.”The Prime Minister and Taoiseach added: “We understand the complexity of the underlying concerns of all parties, and the need for renewed trust, mutual respect, generosity and new thinking to resolve the issues.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Leo Varadkar and Theresa May after the funeral of Lyra McKee at St Anne’s Cathedral, Belfast “As Prime Minister and Taoiseach, we are determined to work together to ensure this process comes to a successful conclusion.”They will review progress at the end of May.The pair also agreed that there should be a meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference during the same period.The conference will consider East West relations, security co-operation, and political stability in Northern Ireland.Mrs Foster wants a twin-track approach where the devolved institutions are restored quickly to deal with issues such as running the health service, while a separate process addresses disagreements like that over same-sex marriage.Sinn Fein deputy leader Michelle O’Neill has rejected that and said issues such as marriage equality and protection for the Irish language need to be delivered to pave the way for restoration of the devolved institutions."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

The ferry is a real benefit to Strangford, it canrsquot be a liability.Cllr Enright claimed that the DfI ldquoin order to save on staff costs, have not been using the queuing area on the Strangford side.During a recent meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, roads officials confirmed that they were evaluating introducing an earlier morning sailing from Portaferry to Strangford.Councillor Gareth Sharvin said he was also concerned about the regular traffic congestion in Strangford after being contacted by local people caught up in the weekend traffic jam.He said: ldquoI donrsquot understand why there is ferry traffic congestion when there are good ferry traffic lines around the harbour. I will be contacting the Departmentrsquos permanent secretary, Katrina Godfrey, to have a full review and overhaul of the ferry services to ensure that this does not happen again.Strangford businessman, Robert Duffy, owner of a Mace grocery store, confirmed that the village was snarled up with traffic on Saturday evening but reported traffic and the ferry had been running smoothly over the rest of the Easter bank holiday weekend.However, Mr Duffy added: ldquoThe traffic was only bad for a couple of hours on Saturday evening and it was compounded by Saturday night mass in Strangford.ldquoSaturdayrsquos problem was that there was only one boat on. There was racing in Kirkistown and you had between  and  motorhomes travelling from Bishopscourt and that happens every single year.ldquoIrsquove been here  years and it is what it is ndash holiday traffic. The queue management was very good, I was down the street on Sunday and Monday and it was moving well.The Department of Infrastructure was unable to provide a response..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch U","story":"BALLYMACARN Park was bathed in sunshine as the talented lsquoHinch U- squad battled with Virginia for a place in the showpiece Ulster Carpets Cup final at Kingspan Stadium.Despite the heat, both sides put on an excellent display of running rugby in an entertaining encounter with Virginia drawing first blood, taking advantage of an uncharacteristically passive lsquoHinch defence to score from deep with their first attack.lsquoHinch began to work their patterns and took the lead with a typically powerful carry and score from Morgan Croskery and a fine finish from Jojo Naga.Virginia battled back and spent the final minutes before half time battering the lsquoHinch line.Fine close quarter defence enabled the home side to clear their lines but more sloppy defending from the backs allowed Virginia to gain territory and they scored to leave the tie evenly poised at -all.During the half-time break the lsquoHinch coaches asked for more urgency in defence and better ball protection in attack and were rewarded with a superb  minutes of rugby from their side.A line out move was executed perfectly for Matthew Torney to pop up a short pass for a charging Croskery to steam onto the ball and over the line untouched.The home forwards then bullied their opponents in consecutive mauls and Torney used all his power to help himself to a typical close-range score as the Virginia forwards tired.Any thoughts of a comeback were derailed by much improved line speed in defence as Cameron Patterson led the line superbly, driving his man back behind the gain line repeatedly and galvanising his team.James McMaster and Luke Braithwaite were also busy, using their power to disrupt attacks and win turnovers.A Croskery sin-bin was easily absorbed and when Naga finished an excellent Dan Hewitt chip ahead to give his team a  point lead, the match was effectively over as a contest.lsquoHinch emptied their bench to give everyone some time on the pitch and the game lost a little of its intensity as it entered the final  minutes.To their credit, Virginia battled up field for a consolation score with the last move of the match to leave the final score -.League champions, City of Armagh, await the local boys in the final on May  at Kingspan Stadium on what will be a great occasion for this dedicated group of players.Their quarter-final exit from the league play-offs did not do them justice and they have regrouped well over the past few weeks to put together an excellent cup campaign.Hooker Harry McCarroll epitomised the work ethic on Saturday with an all-action man of the match display and senior players continue to set the standards as the season reaches a conclusion.All support welcome on May ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Cormac recognised with two accolades  ","story":"A STUDENT and upcoming politician at Downpatrickrsquos St Patrickrsquos Grammar School recently won two prestigious awards in consecutive days.Cormac Savagereceived the awards for his work in the local community, including engaging young people in politics and for his efforts with local charities like the Mid Down MS Support Group.Cormac mdash who is currently a Member of the Youth Parliament representing South Down mdash was nominated for a Michaela Foundation Wings Award and a Youth and Future Talent Awardin the inspirational young person category by St Patrickrsquos Grammarrsquos head of music, Celeste McEvoy.Cormac delivered a rousing speech last November in the House of Commons with the UK Youth Parliament about the topic of homelessness and, in particular, its gender impact on safety.Also late last year, Cormac gave , local young people the chance to have their voices heard about which issues are most important to them as part of the lsquoMake Your Markrsquo campaign.His first accolade came through The Wings Awards run by the Michaela Foundation in memory of Michaela McAreavey, the young bride murdered on honeymoon in Mauritius in .Cormac said he felt ldquooverwhelmed to have won one of the four awards in the age - category with  young people shortlisted.The awards, set up by Michaelarsquos husband John and her father, Tyrone manager Mickey Harte, seek to recognise young people who have been ldquomotivators within their local community.The following night, Cormac was recognised as an lsquoinspirational young person at the YAFTA awards run by Newry and Mourne Youth Council and Down Area Youth Council.Cormac said the whole experience felt ldquosurreal, adding that it was a ldquototal honour.

The Town Committee asked for the money to go towards a two-week festival they are organising in the town this summer.But councillors bluntly pointed out this week that they have already pumping enough money into the resort for other activities and had already sufficiently helped the Town Committee.Councillors pointed out that the council had spent a ldquovery considerable amount of money in promoting a nine-week summer entertainment programme in Newcastle and had given specic help to the Town Committee in the funding of a joint press conference, advertising and publicity material, as well as providing Radio Newcastle and other facilities.Because of all this ldquoit would not be appropriate to gibe a cash grant in addition.However, the decision did not go down well with Castlewellan councillor Mrs Ethel Smyth, who said it was regrettable that the council had decided to give nothing to the Town Committee.She thought thatthe council could not help by giving the full pound, they should at least have given a part and she hoped the council would have another look at the request.Newcastle councillor Mr Norman Bicker, a member of the Town Committee, said he hoped the council might be able to do something, but he realised there was already a big council programme and he agreed that it was not possible to allow more money.The councilrsquos recreation officer, Mr Bryan Coburn, also pointed out that there was already considerable investment in finance and labour in Newcastle and he felt it would not be appropriate to give more.BALLYGOWAN mdash Bicycling Ballygowan minister, the Rev James Harper, peddled into town last week with a beaming smile on his face for he had just taken part in a smash hit -mile cycle to raise funds to build a new hall in his area.Mr Harper led a team of  modern bikes into Ballygowan on an  year-old penny farthing, which had been loaned to him by cycling enthusiast Albert Watson.The sponsored -mile bike ride took in Raffrey, Derryboy, the Pikestone, Crossgar and Saintfield.

The townspeople will not only enjoy the one-day festival, but any profits made from the event will be ploughed back to provide Christmas lights for the townrsquos streets.DRUMAROAD mdash Outbreaks of sheep worrying hit the area at the weekend when more than  lambs were savagely attacked and killed by marauding dogs.Mr P J McGrady, a farmer from Drumaroad, lost ten lambs over the weekend, He spotted a black dog with white spots on his land and he rushed into his house for his shotgun, but the dog had gone when he went outside.BALLYNAHINCH mdash A pair of talented Ballynahinch sisters, Lesley and Gail Newham, are among four students from the South Eastern Music Centre who travelled to Grantham in Lincolnshire with the British Youth Symphony Orchestra this week.This is the second year in succession that the sisters have been chosen to join the  young musicians from all over the UK who will be giving concerts for the next two weeks.Mr David Newham, father of  year-old Lesley, who plays a horn, and  year-old Gail, an oboeist, is director and advisor of music for the South Eastern Education and Library Board.STRANGFORD LOUGH mdash A speedboat with the engine still attached was found drting in Strangford Lough close to Don OrsquoNeill Island on Saturday by Mr Paul McCann, of  Springvale Park, Dpwnpatrick.The speedboat was taken to a temporary mooring at Castleward Bay provided by Strangford Sailing Club.

The event was finished off by further prayers and hymns with soup served to all.The call for the Church of Ireland community to boycott the event was ignored as several additional ministers attended the event for the first time.Former Bishop Trevor Williams, recently retired from the Church of Ireland diocese of Limerick and Killaloe and former rector of Newcastle, said he felt it was important to attend the event.ldquoThe Christian message for me is one primarily of love and concern for others and on this Good Friday thatrsquos precisely the message, the cross of Jesus Christ and what he gave to the world, he said.ldquoJesus said love one another as I have loved you so that is the importance of this day. We learn most from those who are dferent so this walk today gives us an opportunity to realise that each of our traditions have something to offer, each has something to learn from each other.Church of Ireland minister, the Rev Adrian Dorrian from the Lecale group of churches, said he felt it was important to attend the walk.ldquoWe have a similar walk of witness in Downpatrick today, he said. ldquoBut, given the coverage this year and the protest letter which we disagree strongly with, we wanted to show support. Dean Henry Hull would have been here but he has other Good Friday service commitments. Irsquom very glad to have been able to come and represent the other churches in the town.Castlewellan parish priest, Fr Denis McKinlay, said: ldquoItrsquos been a great turnout today and great show of support and solidarity from some very important people. After all it is a peace walk and itrsquos about peace, reconciliation and hope and we all have to learn from one another. Surely that has to be a great thing In welcoming the walkers to St Paulrsquos, the Rev Brian Cadden said: ldquoIt is a real sense of joy today, despite dferent expressions of the Christian faith, that we can come together to share the most basic aspect of our faith which is the death of Jesus Christ on the cross.St Malachyrsquos parishioners, Harry and Margaret McCartan from Newcastle, have attended the walk for years.Mr McCartan said why there were there: ldquoTo bear witness with our Christian neighbours, thatrsquos what it is all about, he said.ldquoThatrsquos exactly it, this is nothing to do with politics, added Mrs McCartan.He continued: ldquoWhy be a Christianyou are afraid to show it Gerald King from Annsborough said he attended the walk due to recent newspaper coverage.ldquoI came today after seeing that letter because them men are wrong, he said. ldquoLove one another as I have loved you, thatrsquos what this is about.St Malachyrsquos parishioner Mary Steele, who walks every year, said: ldquoItrsquos been lovely and peaceful and calm. Itrsquos a prayerful day and it should be. Good Friday is the day and the resurrection is the day. Let those without sin cast the first stone.Fellow St Malachyrsquos parishioner Philomena Rice was there with her three grandchildren as she has done in previous years.ldquoI think itrsquos important to show my grandchildren the other church, she said. ldquoThey like coming out to this, carrying the cross as they call it.Ronnie Hamilton, secretary of the Castlewellan Area Bible Prayer Group said: ldquoIrsquom very happy with the turnout today and itrsquos more than we normally have.

Poor Sarah, however, was cornered by McNeilly in the Avoca at the presentation, who was heard regaling her of his past triumphs, including his  minute k and  minute  miler.Perhaps there was some consolation for Sarah in that she wasnrsquot subjected to Joe McCann recounting his illustrious Armagh .

It is understood that it could be early July before this work is completed.There have been a series of issues associated with the regeneration scheme to provide new paving, street lighting and furniture in Irish Street with the initial start date delayed as Phoenix Gas took longer than expected to complete its work at this part of the town.Signicant issues have now arisen with the foundations for the blast wall which surrounded the former police base, but of major concern is problems with the sewer network.A series of frenetic phone calls to politicians and NI Water were made recently after raw sewage flowed out of an old section of piping for over a week.Businesses say they have been told that major sections of the sewer network need replaced and that contractors recently discovered that one large section of the sewer was completely blocked with concrete and has most probably been like this for decades.All businesses have reported a downturn in trade since work in Irish Street started and a temporary one-way traffic system was introduced, while there is concern that a number of parking spaces have been lost and that the width of the main street has been substantially narrowed in places.Calls have been issued for a rates reduction given the impact the work has had on business with traders highlighting that the delay in completing the scheme, ironically designed to help attract more shoppers, is outside their control but has had a signicant impact upon them.Mr Alan Oakes, of Plus  Print, said the sewer outside his business collapsed for eight days, with main contractors apologising for what was happening.ldquoTrade has been poor since the works started on January  and with further realistic delays forthcoming, we donrsquot know what the future might hold, he said.ldquoOne business in Irish Street has now closed, traffic is at a standstill, deliveries are impossible and collection from businesses is a nightmare while footfall is at zero. The management of the entire streetscape has been disastrous from day one and now more delays are anticipated.Mr Oakes said what concerns him most has been the lack of communication provided by Newry, Mourne and Down Council. He also fears that the sewage infrastructure in Irish Street is at breaking point.He added: ldquoWe are a family-run business with  yearsrsquo experience in the town and an employer. These past few months been very testing and dficult for all businesses in Irish Street.Another trader said that given the loss in trade businesses have experienced, they should be entitled to a rates rebate.He said: ldquoWe all accepted that the street upgrade was needed but the work was supposed to take three months. Now they are saying that it will be the end of June and even into July before it is completed. What is going on ldquoEveryone has taken a hit and, given that fact, we deserve a rates rebate. Business is hard enough without having to put up with this. We were told the work would take three months, but we will be into a seventh month before this over.A spokeswoman for the Department of Infrastructure said the Irish Street scheme is a project it is managing on behalf of Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Department for Communities.ldquoThis is a full refurbishment of the existing streetscape, with the provision of new street lighting, street furniture and carriageway resurfacing, she explained.ldquoUnfortunately the scheme has encountered a signicant number of unexpected delays due to utility alterations and dficulties with construction around the old blast wall foundations at the PSNI station.The spokeswoman confirmed that in consultation with the contractor carrying out the work, it is now anticipated that further delays are ldquounfortunately unavoidable at this stage with the finish date of the main paving works now expected to be June .She also revealed that a full road closure will then be required to carry out resurfacing of the carriageway.The spokeswoman added: ldquoWhile we appreciate this unavoidable delay has caused concern, please be assured that all measures to expedite works are being taken.South Down MLA, Colin McGrath, said it was ldquodisappointing to learn that the completion of roadworks at Irish Street have been delayed until the end of June.ldquoWhile residents and business owners will want to see the work completed to the highest standard, that this will be at the cost of another two monthsrsquo interruption which is disheartening.

But the Bangor-based artist says she now plans to borrow the DVDs from a friend and catch up on the first seven series after being commissioned to work on the new ‘Glass of Thrones’ campaign.Six large stained-glass-style  depicting characters and key events from Game of Thrones – much of which was filmed in Northern Ireland – are being unveiled at locations around Belfast – one a week to coincide with the airing of each episode of the eighth and final season of the award-winning HBO show.The first one depicting the heroes and heroines of House Stark was unveiled at Donegall Place last Monday, with the second – a House Lannister-inspired piece – going on public display outside the Waterfront Hall on Easter Tuesday.Others will be erected at key visitor sites such as the SSE Arena and Titanic Belfast over the coming weeks.By the end of series eight, the stained glass  will form a new Game of Thrones trail, leading fans across the city to the final window at the Titanic Studios, where much of the show has been produced over the past decade.Debra, whose artistic skills were recommended to Tourism NI and Tourism Ireland for their joint venture, said it is “an honour” to have been commissioned to complete the public artworks, which will be seen and photographed by visitors from around the world.She explained how each week a lead printed glass  is delivered to her home studio, and she then uses special resins to colour the ‘window’.“The glass comes to me with the lead line in it and then I use coloured resin to bring it to le,” she said. “A design company do the illustration and digitalise the design and then another company prints the leadwork onto the glass and then the glass gets brought to me and I do the colour.“The designers send me a guide and then I can use a bit of artistic licence, but there are certain elements from the series that have to be the right colour.“Within reason I can adapt it a bit and add texture. What I am trying to do is recreate the feel of stained glass windows by giving it more dimension.” Debra, who is originally from Rugby in Warwickshire, moved to Northern Ireland in . Friends to take part in Belfast Marathon for Age NI Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"A graduate of Loughborough College of Art, she previously worked as a freelance textile designer and has been a professional artist for the past  years.Describing herself as a “colour-passionate artist of joyful art” who produces “happy, uplting paintings”, Debra says she has mostly been focussed on landscapes and gardens recently, but stresses she has painted a wide iety of subject matter over the years. Admitting the themes depicted on the ‘Glass of Thrones’ pieces – sword-wielding warriors and fire-breathing dragons – are something she’s not that familiar with, she said: “The subject matter is very dferent. But working with colour is right up my street.“For me it is a joy because it is something dferent and I love to experiment with new materials.”Askedshe is a fan of the show, Debra laughs: “Not yet. But I will watch it now because I have seen all these characters coming to le and it has sparked my interest.“I am going to borrow the DVDs from a friend. When the windows are complete I am going to watch it becauseI start trying to catch up while I am trying to paint the windows that would be a disaster. Each one takes a full seven days – it is a very intense workload.”Game of Thrones has been a global TV phenomenon watched by millions of people around the world. The show’s incredible success has brought huge economic benefits to the local economy, with hundreds of thousands of visitors coming here each year to see the locations used in the show.Tourism NI and Tourism Ireland are hopeful that ‘Glass of Thrones’ and other visitor attractions will attract even more GOT fans to Northern Ireland in years to come.• TV show has led to huge tourism boomGlass of Thrones is a joint campaign by Tourism Ireland and Tourism NI designed to showcase and celebrate Northern Ireland as ‘Game of Thrones Territory’ to millions of fans worldwide.John McGrillen, CEO of Tourism NI, said Game of Thrones tourism is currently worth about £ million annually to the local economy. And he is convinced initiatives such as Glass of Thrones, and the opening of other new visitor attractions over the next year or so, will help continue the GOT-fuelled tourism boom for years to come.“HBO are certainly of a view that they have only scratched the tip of the iceberg in terms of audiences across the globe, so we believe this will be good for us over the next decade,” he said.Niall Gibbons, CEO of Tourism Ireland, said the new artworks are a “fun and innovative way to bring the destination to the attention of Game of Thrones fans around the world.”try catch

We agree that what is now needed is actions and not just words from all of us who are in positions of leadership.“We have agreed to establish a new process of political talks, involving all the main political parties in Northern Ireland, together with the UK and Irish Governments, in accordance with the three stranded process. The aim of these talks is quickly to re-establish to full operation the democratic institutions of the Belfast Good Friday Agreement - the NI Executive, Assembly and North-South Ministerial Council - so that they can effectively serve all of the people for the future.“We have asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the Tanaiste to meet later today in Belfast to set out our proposed approach and to commence the talks process as soon as possible after the local elections in Northern Ireland.“In addition, we have agreed that there should be a meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference during the same period. The Conference will consider East West relations, security cooperation, and political stability in Northern Ireland.“We understand the complexity of the underlying concerns of all parties, and the need for renewed trust, mutual respect, generosity and new thinking to resolve the issues.“As Prime Minister and Taoiseach, we are determined to work together to ensure this process comes to a successful conclusion.“We will review progress at the end of May.”Robin Swann: UUP leader warns of dangers of not restoring powersharing Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES |  photos from the funeral of murdered journalist Lyra McKeeSpeeder clocked at mph on notorious NI roadLyra McKee killed accidentally by republican volunteer claim SaoradhLyra McKee shot dead during riot -

Now, the bridge has several operational regulations like alarm levels ndash we canrsquot balance the high level of noise needed for a bridge and the low level needed for a residential area. This is the reality that the council have to consider and resolve.A Vale of Glamorgan Council spokesman said: ldquoThe swing bridge is maintained and operated by Quay Marinas, who manage the Penarth Quays Marina site.ldquoIt was closed due to a number of safety concerns, with upgrades needed before it can be reopened, including audible warnings.ldquoThe council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report following which our health and safety officers and those from Quay Marinas will discuss possible solutions which may enable the bridge to be reopened in the future. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

So many people say lsquowhy wonrsquot the council talk to us \"Cllr Steffan William askedsports pitches could be ldquofenced off to prevent dogs walking on them, but the councilrsquos operational manager Colin Smith said this ldquocould be quite costly for the council.At the start of the meeting, Mr Smith said: ldquoWe know the majority of dog owners are responsible and we donrsquot want to limit them from the green spaces the Vale has to offer.There were also calls for more dog waste bins throughout the Vale at the meeting.Councillors heard there have been just six prosecutions for dog fouling in the Vale of Glamorgan in the past year.Cardf councilrsquos PSPO against dog fouling will see dog owners fined poundtheyrsquore found without bags or the means of picking up after their pets.But Mr Smith said: ldquoThe legal team were concerned it wouldnrsquot be lawful.

They will also be supporting local communities and families as once orders are underway, the product will go into mass production in Welsh factories.Much of the product has been made in a family-run steel fabricators in Ferndale in the Rhondda.John said: ldquoI love the fact that the ZIGZAG has been made within  miles of my home in Penarth. Irsquove visited the factory literally hundreds of times in the last three years and that wouldnrsquot have been possibleit was made in China, but what it proves more than anything is that businessmen and women really need to look thoroughly at whatrsquos under their noses.ldquoIrsquove been amazed by the talent Irsquove seen on these shores - there are some incredible businesses here doing some world beating things, and they need our support. Regardless of how you voted in the referendum, whether wersquore in or out we should all be proud of what we produce on this island and Irsquom here to show you that itrsquos possible to create a great product without having to go to the Far East.ldquoIt has taken me three years to develop the ZIGZAG - from the seed of an idea to the living and breathing product you can see today. I want you to support our crowdfunding campaign so we can give a boost to the factories in Wales which have supported our development. Theyrsquore ready to make your ZIGZAG now!Factory boss, Jason Keetch, who runs the factory making the ZIGZAG, said: \"It has been an absolute pleasure working on the ZIGZAG with John.The majority of our workload consists of manufacturing sub components for larger designs so we rarely get to make a recognisably finished product like this. Seeing first hand the progression of the design and working so closely with John on it has made this project feel extra special.ldquoMy whole team are proud that the ZIGZAG is a fully Welsh product and that we have been a part of its story. Wersquore excited to see where it now goes!Those who pledge their support and buy a ZIGZAG in the first -days of the crowdfunder, which ends on Sunday  May, will benefit from an early bird price of pound.To find out more, visit: igg.me at zigzag-oven article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In England the local government budget has seen cuts that are twice as large as here in Wales and school spending has been much better protected.When I met Penarth head teachers I was honest about our choice to protect NHS spending.Health has consistently been the top priority of the public and I still face demands from all parties to spend even more money on the NHS.To deliver signicantly more money for schools and the local government budget would mean taking money out of the NHS.Keeping our commitment to the NHS affects every other public service, including our schools. That is the reality of nearly a decade of austerity.That does not mean that schools have been abandoned.For example the Welsh Government chose to increase funding to our st Century Schools programme. That means more new schools like the Penarth Learning Community and thanks to the budget deal secured by Labour councillors more money to renovate Victorian schools in the Vale.This year changes to teachers pensions by the UK Government have created a multi-million pound hole in school budgets. The UK Government only passed on  per cent of the costs to Wales. The Welsh Government funded the missing  per cent but that is money that canrsquot be spent somewhere .Despite the fact that local government in Wales has a much better funding deal than across the border in England I recognise that our councils have an incredibly dficult challenge setting a budget.We all saw that in the Vale, where nearly half the ruling Conservative group refused to back the budget proposal from their own leadership. There is a choice to be made between reducing services or raising council tax. Even after council tax rises most councils are still reducing services.Education and social services are the largest spending areas for local councils. Each council decides their own spending priorities and dferent councils have made dferent choices.The local funding formula for schools in the Vale was reviewed and simplied by the previous Labour administration and agreed by local head teachers. Itrsquos simpler and more transparent as a result.Itrsquos disappointing that the Vale Council leadership refuses to recognise that it has any responsibility for school funding choices. For example Cardf council has put a larger proportion of its budget into schools than the Vale.I welcome the Welsh Government review into the local authority funding formula. The wider review should provide an updated picture.However that in itself does not mean that there will be more money flowing into school budgets in the Vale.That still comes back to choices about how much money we are prepared to invest in our public services rather than a competition between public services that each of us value. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He shook my hand, and showed me some of the facilities.I was shown how the ldquoMagic Carpet works, an interactive board on the floor. It lit up with a flower pattern, that moved and shimmered when stood on.I was then invited to the soft play room, where Elias flung himself over the equipment, scampering above me and the assistant. He grinned for the camera.Ysgol Y Deri particularly shines in the creative approaches it takes to putting its students first.In the big school I was shown to ldquoThe Holodeck, a Star-Trek-esque room filled with projectors and touchscreen sensitive walls.There was a French quiz projected across the walls, and the students jumped around the room selecting the correct words.The sensory experience was not only impressively creative, but vital to some studentsrsquo learning.The school has many similar rooms built to offer a multi-disciplinary team approach to the youngsters and offer a fully holistic experience.They have a large team of therapists on site, including nurses, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, music therapists and play therapists.They also offer a huge range of interventions, designed to put their pupilsrsquo happiness and education at the forefront.They offer yoga, mindfulness lessons, climbing, gardening, wood work, pet therapy, rebound therapy and hydrotherapy, as just a small example. Timetables are crafted to suit inidualsrsquo needs, as some pupils respond better than others to certain lessons.I was shown to a classroom where a group of seven students worked on their laptops.These students were proud of their work and excited to talk about maths.We were then ushered through as a group for a photo with next doorrsquos class, a group with physical disabilities.The students waited patiently as overhead cranes helped those who could not walk into position.Everyone smiled. Thumbs and peace signs were flashed.Afterwards, a Learning Support Assistant tapped me on the shoulder and reminded me to take a photo of Caitlyn.I pointed the camera at her, and Caitlinrsquos smile immediately reached her ears.Maxine, a fellow student, told me how proud her family were of her and her work.The happiness of every one of the pupils is palpable, filling every area of the school, as does the pride of the teachers.ldquoWe have our pupils come back in every now and then, said Stacey Long, the schoolrsquos transition officer.She helps pupils move on from the school and into adult le.ldquoThey always tell me how much the school meant to them, how helpful it was in getting a job.ldquoWe try hard to get pupils ready for adult le where we can.ldquoWe have a coffee shop on campus where several students get plenty of work experience.The curriculum covers both the national curriculum as well as general le skills.One interactive quiz I was shown could be rapidly switched from a lesson on the Great Fire of London, to a quiz on which materials go in which recycle bin.There are plenty of extra-curricular activities on offer too, including choir and youth club and regular trips outside of school.I was given a glimpse into a gym, along with a music recording room with plenty of recording equipment, and the school radio room.Outside, pupils are given a huge playground with an outdoor classroom, space to play sport, a climbing wall and little walled off sections for each of the primary classes.Developer Barratt Homes was also on the site, building a sensory garden for students to enjoy.Last week a group of pupils of ying abilities went on a trip to Paris, where they were involved with ious Comenius [European Union education] projects and forged links with numerous schools in other European countries. Several pupils couldnrsquot wait to tell me about it, showing off photos.Chris Britten, the head teacher of Ysgol Y Deri, said: ldquoWe work with every child. They are all dferent and we treat every one as an inidual. We meet their needs so they can flourish, both in school and after they leave. He is immensely proud of his staff and pupils.Itrsquos easy to see why. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The reading of Markrsquos gospel was by David Cocks.At Nica the hymn lsquoHere is love, vast as the oceanrsquo was sung.The next reading was given by Ciara McAlpine. Finally at Tesco the hymn lsquoWhen I survey the wondrous crossrsquo was sung, with Sarah Long reading.Matt Lewis of Bethesda commissioned the new cross and led the short service at Bethesda.Many thanks go to Councillor John Fanshaw for the loan of the excellent PA system. Everyone was kept safe by the traffic marshal Brian West.The Friends of Belle Vue Park held an Easter celebration of their own.They said: ldquoWe had a fantastic time with crafts, games, seed planting and selfies.ldquoThere were so many amazing Easter hat designs, it was hard to choose!ldquoThanks to all the hard-working volunteers who made the event possibleAs well as events held by churches and chapels, Easter egg hunts were a recurring theme for many venues.Cosmeston Lakes hosted their own hunt over the course of the weekend, inviting people to try their luck at solving clues for prizes.Llantwit Major Surf Lesaving Club held an Easter egg hunt on Easter Monday, with face painting, name the bunny, refreshments and hot drinks.St Fagans National Museum of History held their own ldquoBig Museum Easter Trail, asking visitors to solve clues and follow the trail around the museum infor an ldquoegg-citing prize. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tont_1.jpg","title":"next  cde global","story":"Posted on Friday April  by Ulster Business For the last  years, Co Tyrone-headquartered CDE Global has designed and installed almost , turnkey wet processing solutions across the world.The business, based in Cookstown and headed by founder Tony Convery, has seen its turnover soar to just shy of £m – rising by more than £m in the space of just  months.

The egg processing business includes big names such as Marks and Spencer and McDonald’s among its customers.Frylite, which started le when Eamon McCay opened a cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises, has seen its turnover increase to £m, with pre-tax profits sitting at £.m. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff.And helping highlight the firms which are still based in Northern Ireland and retain ownership here, accountancy firm Harbinson Mulholland hosted its inaugural HM Homegrown event in Belfast.Showcasing the top  SMEs here, it highlighted that Northern Ireland boasts more homegrown businesses per head of population than Wales, Scotland and all regions across the north of England.And almost % of them operate in just three sectors – manufacturing, construction and wholesale retail.

The results of this research demonstrate that just because businesses are local in origin does not imply, they are not global in ambition that because they are from traditional sectors does not mean they are not modern in outlook. Indeed, local homegrown businesses have a sense of place and origin that can really create competitive advantage.“Northern Ireland has demonstrated its ability to sell its agri-food, manufacturing and construction products and services overseas, but internationally successful companies tend not to emerge in isolation. “Domestic competition drives innovation, efficiency and productivity improvements, which in turn develop businesses which can take on any competitor across the world. As a result, there is merit in Government identying the most appropriate ways to support the continued growth of successful clusters to help power the economy into the future.”And Darren McDowell, senior partner of Harbinson Mullholland said that homegrown businesses were the backbone of the practice’s client base.“The Top  list underlines the vibrancy of this group of companies and the spending power they give to local communities through employment.“Attention is often focused on other sectors, but this research demonstrates the continued importance of traditional businesses and industries to the local economy and the extent to which they can be successful.”There’s also a raft of multi-generational businesses here, which have kept both ownership and controlOne of those is food giant Henderson.

We’re also proud that we have built a sustainable business which continues to proactively develop and expand, and provides employment for over , people in Northern Ireland.”    More than  years ago, John Henderson set up a stall selling butter, eggs and cheese – he was a well-known figure and frequently was a judge of cheese and butter at the annual Balmoral Show.That subsequently progressed into a stall at St George’s Market in Belfast, and then in , the business was incorporated as a limited company.In , William Agnew married John Henderson’s daughter, and in  William joined the company as a salesman, taking a controlling interest when John Henderson retired three years later.

Close to a thirdsaid their employer was less committed to achieving gender equality, with womenmore likely to believe there was a need for improvement, versus % of men. Only % of all respondents said their employer was committed to achieving gender equality, with men overwhelmingbelieving this to be the case versus % of women. There’s clearly still a long way to go.Most business leaders are well aware of the merit of employing a erse workforce. Diversity in areas including age, employee background, gender and religion affirms a message of inclusivity within the organisation and to a wider external audience, creating a strong position andHiring methods are an integral element of increasing ersity among employees, and CVs are one of the many ways in which the process can be improved. Many organisations will judge candidates based on their most recent job listing, potentially overlooking talented and competent applicants without a steady course of uninterrupted career progression. This can particularly disadvantage many women in professional sectors who have prioritised childcare at points throughout their career.Whether you believe it or not, we all have unconscious bias built in to our responses to others. So,you could eliminate those biases from the process, would you do so More and more organisations, including many here in Northern Ireland, now recruit based on blind CVs, where information such as age, race and gender is removed to prevent subconscious biases from influencing hiring decisions.Using competency-based application processes assesses essential soft skills such as communication, emotional intelligence, problem solving and self-motivation, rather than testing specic knowledge, which can be learned more quickly than soft skills. The absence of a CV can change the way you prepare questions and open interviews up to discussions that wouldn’t otherwise take place.Favouring competency-based applications or requiring blind CVs is a sign your organisation is taking steps to fairly assess candidates based on their skills and experience. These methods of talent-based hiring also demonstrate a commitment to overcoming the perceived disadvantage of career breaks which will positively contribute to erse representation across all sectors.The practice of blind hiring is not without its shortcomings. For instance a candidate’s personal information can only be withheld during the initial screening process. Once a line manager conducts a one-to-one interview there is no way to suppress a candidate’s gender, ethnicity or age. While applying the principle may result in a wider pool of first-round interviewees employers subsequently be faced with the same ersity challenges, for example, seeking graduates with a first class honours or a high :.At Hays we have trialled blind recruitment at assessment centres for a number internal of appointments. The absence of a CV opened up a depth of enquiry and supporting examples from interviewees where the receipt of a CV might not have encouraged the same level of enquiry and open-mindedness.Demand for transparency around targets and performance is also at an all-time high. So,your organisation is transparent in their ersity reporting, it proves their willingness to make a public commitment to achieving a fairly recruited workforce and makes them accountable for measuring and reporting their progress.  You’ll undoubtedly make some excellent new hires that you may not have appointedyou maintained your traditional processes.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/stats_r1.jpg","title":"statsports takes on premier leagues alex oxlade chamberlain and raheem sterling","story":"Posted on Thursday  April  by Ulster Business Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and chief global strategist Jarlath Quinn Newry firm STATSports have taken on board Premier League players Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Raheem Sterling as signicant investors as well as global ambassadors for the burgeoning tech firm.

The struggling chain has entered into a company voluntary arrangement . It follows a pre-pack administration for the high street business. Five Northern Ireland Debenhams stores are continuing to trade, but it has confirmed  other stores will shut, outside Northern Ireland. It’s thought more than , jobs could be at risk. Debenhams is the anchor tenant at five shopping centres in Northern Ireland, including Newry’s Quays Shopping Centre, Ballymena’s Fairhill, Belfast’s CastleCourt, Craigavon’s Rushmere and Londonderry’s Foyleside. The firm’s earlier administration angered shareholder Mike Ashley, owner of Sports Direct, who has called for the process to be reversed. The administration wipes out the stakes held by Sports Direct and all other shareholders. The stores that are due to close are: Altrincham, Ashford, Birmingham Fort, Canterbury, Chatham, Eastbourne, Folkestone, Great Yarmouth, Guildford, Kirkcaldy, Orpington, Slough, Southport, Southsea, Staines, Stockton, Walton, Wandsworth, Welwyn Garden City, Wimbledon, Witney, Wolverhampton. Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, director Aodhán Connolly, says \"rising costs, a sluggish economy, and changing shopping habits are making le incredibly hard for the industry\". \"Those pressures are being exacerbated by ever-increasing public policy costs which are making it more expensive to employ workers and operate from physical premises. These factors will lead to a very dferent retail industry over the next few years. \"The challenges department stores face are a microcosm of the immense changes affecting the retail industry. As more consumers shop on-line, there is a challenge to encourage shoppers into stores, and then to get them to spend when they are there. One of the big trends we are seeing is retailers innovating to try and create a number of reasons for customers to visit the store. That can be through offering food and drink, dferent services, and by investing in customer service. The big advantage a physical retailer has is those trained helpful colleagues who can provide detailed guidance on products to help customers. \"It’s notable those retailers who have invested in evolving from purely physical retail to a multi-channel offering are those who are in the strongest position. Many of the larger stores are particularly affected by government policy which has consistently made operating from property more expensive.
