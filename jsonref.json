Heard filed for orce the following year, and the orce was finalized in 2017.The former spouses have both been in court during three weeks of testimony at the grand neo-Gothic court building.Ms Wass reminded Mr Justice Nicol there were \u0027well-documented episodes of violence and destruction\u0027 over Depp\u0027s adult life and that the actor had accepted he was violent to inanimate objects but not people.However, she said there was an incident earlier in his career when he assaulted a photographer with a plank of wood when under the influence of drink and drugs.She also said his evidence that he was not violent towards people was \u0027meaningless\u0027 when he was as intoxicated as he was on occasions and \u0027wouldn\u0027t have known what he was doing\u0027.Ms Wass continued: \u0027In answer to what we suggest is overwhelming evidence of domestic violence or wife-beating behaviour, catalogued over a three-year period between 2013 and 2016, Mr Depp\u0027s response is to claim that he is a victim of an elaborate hoax that has been perpetrated against him by Ms Heard and her friends.\u0027The barrister said Depp had accused Heard and her friends of \u0027having painted on injuries, manipulated photographs and destroyed property which they then went on to photograph in order to create what he describes as some sort of insurance policy for Ms Heard\u0027.Ms Wass added: \u0027What exactly Ms Heard was insuring against in the course of this hoax remains unexplained.\u0027She told the court that such a hoax \u0027would have entailed Ms Heard engaging in a pre-planned conspiracy over the period of the entire relationship with Mr Depp\u0027, adding: \u0027Such a suggestion, we say, is risible.\u0027Ms Wass told the court: \u0027The approach taken by Mr Depp from the time Ms Heard obtained a domestic violence restraining order against him on May 27 2016 was as follows: to deny that he ever assaulted Ms Heard, to accuse Ms Heard of being the violent party and to reverse his role with hers.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Barbie unveils four diverse dolls expose girls public leadership roles","story":"Share this articleBarbie® Unveils 2020 Campaign Team Set to Encourage All Girls to Raise Their Voice | Mattel, Inc."},{"url":null,"title":"Kodak CEOs fortune swells 79 mln stocks rally U S government loan","story":"Share this articleKodak executive chairman addresses jump in trading activity before government deal was announcedKodak\u0027s top exec sees $200 million windfall on stock frenzyTweets and Articles Sent Kodak Shares Surging Before Official Announcement -

also called fulfillment centres - adapted and expanded to be able to safely store the food from suppliers before it is delivered to buyers,It means suppliers, who include bakers and butchers, will have their goods transported to the hubs ready for Amazon to distribute themselves.The same will happen with any supermarkets who decide to opt-in to the ambitious new system.A MailOnline survey suggested a selected shopping basket ordered through it would be cheaper than the same Waitrose shop.But if a partnership does emerge it would place the firm\u0027s products in a much more affordable delivery system.A spokesperson for John Lewis said: \u0027It\u0027s early days and we are still exploring and developing our plans but we will give a further update in the autumn.\u0027In the meantime however we have identified that Waitrose has a smaller presence in the convenience market than other supermarkets and we will also make Waitrose food available in more John Lewis shops.\u0027A spokesman for Amazon said he was unable to comment on the story. "},{"url":null,"title":"A driver ran petrol caught riding e scooter WRONG WAY M11 motorway fuel","story":"Share this article \u0027I am lost for words!

This is therefore a sensible precautionary measure.\u0027 Dr Tom Wingfield, a senior clinical lecturer and honorary consultant physician, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, also said the move was \u0027particularly timely\u0027. Mr Hancock earlier warned that a new spike in Covid-19 cases is \u0027clearly\u0027 beginning to emerge in Europe as he said \u0027we\u0027ve got to do everything\u0027 to prevent it reaching the UK.He said on SKy News: \u0027I am worried about a second wave. I think you can see a second wave starting to roll across Europe and we\u0027ve got to do everything we can to prevent it from reaching these shores and to tackle it.\u0027He said 10-day isolation measure was \u0027part of that, but so, too, are the measures we\u0027re taking, for instance, to ensure that we don\u0027t directly bring cases back to this country where there\u0027s a big spike in cases\u0027.\u0027So, absolutely, on a second wave it is something I worry about and I worry about it because we can see it happening,\u0027 he added.His comments came after Prime Minister Boris Johnson admitted he was ‘extremely concerned’ about the possibility of a second spike and claims that the UK could be a fortnight behind Europe, where cases are rising again. Mr Hancock also warned travellers that new countries could be added to the quarantine list in the coming days after passengers arriving in the UK from Spain were ordered to isolate for two weeks as cases there increased.He said ministers are looking at ways to reduce the 14-day period, possibly by the use of multiple tests, amid pressure from the tourism industry.But he said ministers are constantly considering whether to add countries to the quarantine list and when pressed if new nations could be added in the next few days, he replied: \u0027Yes.\u0027Government data showed the seven-day average of new cases in the UK had increased to just over 700 compared to around 550 in the second week of July.However, the figure remained far lower than at the start of May when the average was close to 5,000.It comes as official analysis said England had the highest levels of excess mortality in Europe in 2020 so far.The analysis by the Office of Nation Statistics revealed that by the end of May, the death rate in England was 7.55 per cent higher than the average for the previous five years.Spain ranked second at 6.65 per cent, followed by Scotland (5.11 per cent), Belgium (3.89 per cent) and Wales (2.78 per cent).The excess mortality measure is seen as the best way to compare deaths during the crisis because it takes into account not just Covid-19 deaths but those from the indirect impacts of the pandemic, such as delayed access to healthcare.   Labour\u0027s shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth described the Office for National Statistics analysis suggesting England had the worst death rate in Europe as a \u0027devastating moment\u0027.\u0027We can no longer hide from the fact the Government has not handled this crisis well and needs to urgently learn lessons from its mistakes,\u0027 he added.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Rare Chinese vases sell 324 000 sitting unnoticed couples mantelpiece decades","story":"Share this article \u0027Emperor Qianlong was arguably one of the greatest collectors of art and these vases, likely to have been commissioned by him, reflect this through their complex potting, impeccable painted decoration in enamels, and the inscription of an ancient poem.\u0027The couple who consigned the vases were of course delighted when they heard the result.\u0027They were so pleased that we spotted the vases among the contents of their house in west London.\u0027They were in the process of downsizing and disposing of most of their possessions and had never looked at them closely enough to appreciate their true worth.\u0027I was told that they had been furnishing a mantelpiece for many years and the vases may or may not have made the cut to be moved to their new house.\u0027Like many inherited objects, one attaches a certain degree of sentimental value but may not appreciate their true value.\u0027We have been truly privileged to be custodians of these wonderful objects, and thanks to a hugely successful sale, we have found them a new home.\u0027The 8in tall vases are finely decorated with lotus blooms connected by twisting scrolls, symbolising purity, on a ruby body.

She had a special tray with folding legs that served as a desk. She would sit up against a stack of pillows, with a cashmere cardigan over her nightdress, and write longhand on loose sheets of foolscap. Pots of tea were ferried to her by my grandfather, who would have been fully dressed in a tweed jacket and tie and working from his study downstairs. All the men in my family had a study or office, and worked jobs with regular hours unlike Grandmother, who would break off from her writing to dig in the garden or peel the spuds for dinner. I never remember, as a child, being told to shush because Grandmother was working. The only indication of her status as a writer was the piles of New Yorker magazines scattered around the house. She published 15 stories in the New Yorker between 1959 and 1976. Many years, this was her bread and butter.Mary Lavin, or Grandmother (never Granny or Nana or, God forbid, Gran), made her name as a world-class short story writer from the unlikely setting of the Abbey Farm, near Navan, County Meath. The mother of three small children, she was widowed as a young woman, becoming a single mother and lone farmer in one fell swoop. While the male writers of her generation worked out of sight in holy sanctity, Grandmother took up a table in Bewley’s cafe on Grafton Street and wrote there until my mother and aunts joined her from school. In the evenings, the men gathered in the pubs around Baggot Street, while Grandmother cooked spaghetti bolognese and held court at her mews in nearby Lad Lane. If she broke the mould, it was for the simple reason that there was no other way for her to write and meet her peers. She had young children at home. Needs must.Of course, women’s lives have always been dominated by the needs of others. Surveys of the ision of labour during the lockdown revealed – to the surprise of nobody – that women still ended up performing the vast majority of housework and caring duties. Female writers, no less today than in my grandmother’s day, must find a way of working amid all this noise, and they do. Anne Lamott famously said that, before she had a child, she couldn’t write if there were dishes in the sink – but afterwards she could write if there was a corpse in the sink. Christine Dwyer-Hickey, the winner of this year’s Walter Scott prize for her novel The Narrow Land, believes that being a housewife is the best scenario for a writer, because you use your time with great economy. Edna O’Brien worked while her children scribbled her notes and pushed them under the door. It has always been thus.O’Brien was the Sally Rooney of her day, the first female Irish writer to become a star both critically and commercially. First published in 1960, The Country Girls is a novel whose success was richly deserved, but quality alone was never enough to guarantee a female writer a hearing. It was the novel’s scandalous theme – sex – that made all the noise. Writing by women was more often dismissed as “quiet”, a label long attached to my Grandmother’s work. Curious to find out if this label was deserved, I recently set myself the task of reading through her entire body of work – more than 100 stories – and was amazed by what I found.The stories, written between the 1940s and 80s, chronicle the sinister pathologies that run through families: jealousy and treachery among women, abusive and sometimes subtle bullying by men, small-town snobbery, bigotry and savagery. In the story Asigh, a young woman is maimed by a violent father. In the Middle of the Fields features a young widow faced with an unwelcome advance from a neighbouring farmer. Sarah is about a country woman who bears three children by three different men and ends up dead in a ditch with her baby. If Ireland found these subjects quiet, Ireland needed its hearing adjusted.Grandmother’s voice – which I hear in my mind as rich and deep and assured – was only considered quiet because it was a woman’s. Women’s lives were not considered to be of general interest in Ireland until Gay Byrne started talking about them on the radio in the 1970s, but women were writing about their lives all along. Kate O’Brien was writing about female sexuality – not just heterosexual – from the 1930s onwards, but she had to live in Spain to do it. Maeve Brennan was making a name for herself at the New Yorker, if not at home, from 1950. In the decades since, we’ve had Jennifer Johnston, Maeve Binchy, Anne Enright, Marian Keyes and Dwyer Hickey – among others – producing books about love, life, pregnancy (wanted and unwanted), motherhood, alcoholism, abuse. Despite the great seriousness of their subjects, they struggled to be taken seriously by a high culture that, in Enright’s words, “automatically tilts male”.Take the great Irish poet Eavan Boland, who died in April aged 75. Boland wrote about her own life, and by extension women’s lives, including a famous poem about feeding a baby. Dismissed initially as too domestic, her stature rose steadily over the years – outside Ireland first and eventually at home – until she came to occupy her rightful place in the canon. In 1999, Night Feed was voted one of Ireland’s best-loved poems, and it is now hard to fathom how a piece of writing about the most elemental of human experiences could ever have been dismissed as unworthy.The label “women’s writing”, with its implication of being of no interest to readers other than women, is an insult that has not gone away. When I received my first contract, I was shocked – then upset and angry – to find that my work was described as “women’s commercial fiction”. I refused to sign until it had been amended to plain old “fiction”. No writer wants to be fenced off from a body of readers, because ultimately it’s the readers that matter.Publishers may have the chequebooks and the marketing budgets, but the beating heart of the business is the person standing at the display table in a bookshop. If that reader is open to picking up, and more importantly carrying to the till, a book by a female writer – or a book by a gay writer, or a black writer, or an Asian writer – then the table is level. The fact that Sally Rooney is selling like hot cakes while being acknowledged as a writer of importance would certainly give you hope. But it was only this summer that Bernardine Evaristo, who won the Booker prize last year for Girl, Woman, Other, became the first woman of colour to top the paperback fiction bestseller lists in the UK. So, we’re not there yet.There’s a famous poster of Ireland’s great writers, all male, that has long hung in classrooms all over the country. Back in 2005, the  marked International Women’s Day by producing a version that featured, for the first time, the country’s great female writers – among them, my grandmother. A similar poster is now widely on sale in Dublin’s bookshops, and you can also get it as a mug or a tea towel, which caused a great laugh in our family because Grandmother was never much of a girl for doing the dishes. In any case, it’s good to see her finally make the tea towel. I only hope it doesn’t take half a century for our writers of colour, such as Kit de Waal, Emma Dabiri and Melatu Uche Okorie, to get there too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00db60bb359c9b132499a9cf88589f1dd18a6e4b/0_69_1936_1162/master/1936.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19f37204250596e7ab2e83d18d20dd8c","title":"airbus slows plane making covid 19 loss aircraft orders","story":"Orders for new aircraft plunged from 290 in first quarter to eight in April-JuneAirbus has further slowed the rate it makes planes after recording a loss of €1.9bn (£1.7bn) in the first half of the year amid the chaos caused by the coronavirus pandemic.Orders for new aircraft collapsed during the second quarter, as the slump in air travel prompted airlines to cut spending commitments drastically.Airbus reported on Thursday it had only eight new orders between April and June, compared with 290 in the first quarter.The European aerospace manufacturer and its US rival, Boeing, have been hit hard by the pandemic, previously announcing swingeing job cuts as they slowed production.Airbus is cutting 15,000 jobs, including 1,700 in the UK, where it produces wings, to cope with what its chief executive, Guillaume Faury, described as the industry’s “gravest crisis”.Airbus will now produce only five of its wide-body A350 planes per month, down from the previous rate of six. It had cut the A350 production rate from about 10 per month in April, as it reduced production of its bestselling A320 narrowbody by a third, to 40 per month.Airbus has an order backlog of 7,584 commercial aircraft as of 30 June, but it has decided to rein back spending as it struggles with lower revenues, with airlines queuing up to slow delivery rates in order to spread out payments.Revenues slumped to € 18.9bn for the half year, compared with €30.9bn in 2019, after deliveries of commercial aircraft halved.The lockdowns around the world have also caused continued operational issues. At the end of June, about 145 commercial aircraft could not be delivered because of the pandemic, Airbus said.Airbus reported a €12.4bn cash outflow during the first half of 2020, although the cost-cutting it announced in April meant only €4.4bn of the outflow came in the second quarter, better than analysts had expected.Faury said on Thursday it was “our ambition to not consume cash” during the second half of the year, aside from any requirements for acquisitions or to help customers with financing, as the company retrenches.“The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on our financials is now very visible in the second quarter, with H1 commercial aircraft deliveries halving compared with a year ago,” Faury said.“We have calibrated the business to face the new market environment on an industrial basis and the supply chain is now working in line with the new plan.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab4cc7053ba777c33b944159e7c0edace15fd94b/0_234_4105_2461/master/4105.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee7f0879e46e04ae46c8c682b1497cfa","title":"argos to stop printing catalogue after almost 50 years","story":"Move towards online shopping sounds death knell for catalogue once found in three-quarters of UK homesArgos is to stop printing its catalogue after almost 50 years, as the buying bible once found in three-quarters of British homes becomes yet another victim of the inexorable move to online shopping.More than 1bn copies of the bi-annual catalogue have been printed since its launch in 1973, and at its height it was Europe’s most widely printed publication, with only the bible in more homes across the UK.However, Argos is to stop printing the title, with the retailer saying that online shopping offers “greater convenience” than flicking through its print catalogue.Coronavirus has hammered the publishing industry and seen numerous titles closed, including music magazine Q, but the company said the pandemic was not responsible for the decision to cease printing.The catalogue has had its celebrity moments over the years.

Times change, and these days it is not a manufacturing giant like ICI but a high street bank that has taken on the role of the economy’s bellwether.If what’s happening at Lloyds Banking Group really is a reflection of what is happening to the UK as a whole – and there is a good argument for that – there is plenty to be concerned about. Lloyds has a big presence in the mortgage market, car loans, credit cards and business lending. It is almost entirely UK-focused.So when the bank says that one reason for increasing its provisions against future losses is the heightened risk of mortgage default, alarm bells should start ringing in the Bank of England and the Treasury. Likewise, the fact that many of the companies that have taken advantage of the government’s bounce-back loans have left the balances in their accounts.Nobody expected the Lloyds Bank results for the second quarter to be anything other than dreadful, and those predictions were duly confirmed by a pre-tax loss of £676m. What Rishi Sunak and Andrew Bailey would have been hoping for was some sign of a strong recovery in the second half of 2020.There is not much evidence of that. Lloyds is gloomier about growth, unemployment and house prices than its rival Barclays, and sees a risk that a rise in unemployment as the Treasury’s furlough scheme is wound down will lead to greater mortgage distress.Those of an optimistic bent might say that Lloyds has always tended to take a conservative view when it comes to provisioning and that there is a chance losses will not be as big as it expects. But companies are stashing away their bounce-back loans for a reason they fear a tough winter ahead.The US growth figure – in line with what economists had been predicting – overshadowed the release of new jobless claims. These rose for a second week and provide a better picture of what’s happening to the US economy right now. They suggest that the recovery that began in May has run out of steam.The reason is obvious. The number of new cases of Covid-19 has more than doubled in the past six weeks and is running at 70,000 a day. With the number of deaths up from a daily low of 490 in early July to more than 1,000, restrictions have been tightened and consumers have stopped spending. A slowing economy and rising unemployment is the result. Not what an incumbent president would want with an election three months away.In a sign of things to come, the group behind the John Lewis and Waitrose brands has announced that it is thinking about turning some of its unwanted retail space into housing. The deli counters will become master bedrooms, the trolley parks bike racks.It’s the right approach, and certainly has a better chance of reinvigorating town centres than the online sales tax currently being considered by the Treasury. The idea that a structural problem that long predates Covid-19 can be solved by making shopping at Amazon more expensive is moonshine.A much better solution is to turn town centres into places where people live, socialise and spend money. That means fewer big supermarkets and department stores – and more homes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a909da2ea8e42a07fb3bbcdba7b78129ffee8f6c/0_0_3472_4421/master/3472.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=f52a399d043bb0f2151ff348aa59b3ef 1440w","title":"exclusive tone deaf ministers reject bame review of english curriculum","story":"Exclusive: schools minister rejects proposal by cross-party MPs for more black input into history syllabusCalls for a review to add more black, Asian and ethnic minority (BAME) history to the English national curriculum have been turned down by the government, the  has learned.Nick Gibb, the schools minister, said there were no plans to hold a review of the syllabus after 30 cross-party politicians wrote a letter demanding that black historians and leaders be asked to offer revisions to what is taught, as well as new topic ideas.Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrats’ education spokesperson, who led the appeal, accused ministers of being “tone deaf” to their request, which she said would try to give more space to the historical injustices that have led to racism.Responding by letter, Gibb said education played a vital role in tackling inequality and that the Department for Education had been discussing BAME history with different organisations. He added that it would continue to explore what else could be done to support its teaching in the classroom.Gibb listed the lives of Mary Seacole and Rosa Parks the achievements of early civilisations such as Benin in west Africa between 900 and 1300 and the transatlantic slave trade and its abolition as examples of subject areas that could be considered by teachers.Moran, who was formerly a teacher, said: “The Black Lives Matter movement has not only exposed the inequalities faced by black people in the UK, but it has galvanised people right across the country who are desperate for change.“If we are to tackle the institutional racism in our society, the curriculum must not only be erse, but we must equip young people with an understanding of the historical injustices that have led to that very racism. As a former teacher, I know just how fundamental education can be in driving change in our society.“The government’s rejection of a review of our curriculum demonstrates their reluctance to follow their platitudes with any meaningful action.”New topics backed by the politicians could have covered the Windrush generation and the positive contribution people of all ethnicities have made to Britain.Dr Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, has said that the curriculum must be improved. The Black Curriculum, a social enterprise, suggests that black history be taught through topics such as the pre-colonial black presence in Britain and 21st-century geopolitics, including migration patterns and deportation.Sir Peter Bottomley, a former Tory minister and the father of the house, was among those who signed the letter asking for a re-evaluation of the history syllabus in light of the global BLM protests over the police killing of George Floyd.Another former Tory minister, Dan Poulter, also signed it, as well as Labour’s former shadow equalities minister Dawn Butler and the Green party MP Caroline Lucas.Gibb said that, as part of a broad curriculum, pupils should be taught about different societies and that this can include the “voices and experience” of BAME people.“This can include historical examples of black Romans, Tudors, Stuarts, Georgians and Victorians, and of course extend to other minority ethnic groups.“It can also include the role of the countries of the former British empire in both world wars, and the part black and minority ethnic people have played in shaping the UK in the 20th century. I believe there is clear scope to teach the shared history we have,” he said.The Welsh government is carrying out a review into the way black and minority ethnic history is taught in schools ahead of the introduction of a new curriculum in 2022. It is being led by Professor Charlotte Williams OBE, a leading academic who has written about ethnic ersity in Wales.

And we are doing exactly that.”One draw is Minerva’s unusual curriculum, which is rooted in Nelson’s student campaigning at the University of Pennsylvania 25 years ago. “I realised that colleges were fundamentally failing in their promise to educate,” he says. “A liberal arts education is supposed to teach students to think freely, critically and logically. But our elite universities no longer do that at all.”The Minerva offering is very different to what most UK students were accustomed to, prior to the coronavirus pandemic shifting universities online. There are no lectures, faculty buildings, or exams. All teaching is done through online video classes. There is only one programme of study for first years, and rather than reading maths or history, students take courses aimed at teaching transferrable skills such as critical thinking and problem-solving, through classes named “multimodal communications”, “empirical analyses” and “complex systems”. Subject specialisms are chosen in the second year. There is no campus students are housed in a residence hall in San Francisco in their first year. Subsequent year groups spend semesters variously in Seoul, Hyderabad, Berlin, Buenos Aires, London and Taipei.The first undergraduate class enrolled in 2014. Among them was British teenager Kayla Cohen, who, armed with top A-level grades, had been selected out of 2,000 applicants to join a cohort of just 30 freshers. “It was a privilege, it was exciting,” says Cohen, now a 25-year-old graduate. “I remember the thrill of going to San Francisco, meeting my class, and feeling like I was joining the birth of something special.”Twenty-year-old Jade Bowler has just completed her first year at Minerva, and admits she was sceptical when she first learned about the institution from an online advert. “I was half-convinced it was a scam, it sounded like a cult,” she says. Bowler originally planned to read biology at Bristol University, so there was surprise when she decided to go to an obscure new US university. “I posted about my choice on social media and had thousands of people telling me not to go. But I just had a gut feeling that this was the future of education.”Minerva’s appeal, Bowler says, was its practical teaching style. “It’s so different from just sitting in a lecture theatre. You learn as you do, not learn by rote. And I have learned so much more in the past year than in any year of my life.”Study after study has shown the efficacy of active learning, and Nelson says Minerva has taken that research and implemented it. As such, professors are not supposed to speak in classes for any longer than a few minutes at a time, and students are expected to contribute to class discussions and group work.The online live video platform Forum is instrumental in facilitating this. “To achieve this kind of education, you have to have data,” says Nelson. “You have to actually be able to track how engaged every single student is.” This is achieved through a system that colour-codes students based on how much they talk in class.Allison Littlejohn, professor of learning technology at University College London, worries about the implications of data gathering for students. “Staff can see when a student logs on, how long they spend on an activity, how much they contribute to a discussion. There are real problems with this method: it puts a lot of pressure on students, and there are issues with privacy and surveillance. Everything a student does is monitored.”Currently half a dozen UK students have offers to study at Minerva this autumn. But despite its undeniable novelty, Littlejohn is doubtful that a university without lecture halls, societies and sports teams has mass appeal. “Lots of people go to campus-based universities not just for love of their subject, but for the whole experience of being a student on a campus, and all the social and extracurricular opportunities that offers,” she says. But Nelson believes the lack of a campus is a draw for some students. “At Minerva, you live in the heart of a city, in seven different countries,” he says. “There’s no campus cafeteria, or bar, or gym – your gym is the gym at the end of the road. Instead, you live as an adult in a city. You learn to be a global citizen.”Either way, Minerva’s innovations certainly pose a challenge to a sclerotic university model in both the US and the UK. Even if the venture does not upend the landscape of higher education in the way Nelson intends, campuses across the world will at some point have to address the deficiencies he identifies – and many already are as a result of the pandemic.“Many campuses are now realising the importance of flexible online learning, flipped classrooms, and interdisciplinary programmes,” Littlejohn agrees. But she adds: “There will always be a place for the campus, and for in-person teaching. At a campus with world-leading researchers, you see how academics spend their time and what they do. You see first-hand how knowledge is created.”The other crucial question is what’s really driving the success of Minerva’s graduates. Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, says: “A mix of excellent pre-university qualifications and a hyped-up higher education is likely to be a winning one. It is worth noting that it is much easier to deliver an excellent education to people with high prior qualifications than to students with more challenging backgrounds.”For the time being, Minerva graduates seem satisfied with their gamble. “I’ve learned so much, and I’m not sure I’d leave any other university with that same conclusion,” says Liberty Pim, who has just finished her final year. “Minerva built a completely new university without the constraints of a traditional university. When I applied it felt like a big risk, but it paid off.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/276b18c0ecb9c18cb1a49fee64711c7e12d8bb31/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=ff79a55c5da2792358ac04aeb6e5afe9","title":"swabs masks action film making through a pandemic","story":"British film-makers are back at work – and going to extraordinary lengths to protect cast and crew from Covid-19. Is it possible to make great movies behind face masks and Plexiglass?“You get used to sticking a six-inch cotton-wool bud up your nose and down your tonsils every morning,” says Richard Clark. He is describing his typical working day. “The masks are quite suffocating. They’re quite sweaty. You don’t drink as much water, and so people dehydrate. You get headaches. Certainly on the first week, by five o’clock, a certain kind of fugginess comes over everybody. Concentrating during those last two hours … you can feel it being a little bit harder.”It sounds like the experience of a frontline care worker, but this is film-making in the age of Covid-19. Clark is directing the second season of Fox’s apocalyptic sci-fi series War of the Worlds in south Wales, with a crew of about 70 people. Having shut down in late March because of the pandemic, the UK’s film and high-end television industry is back in business, which can only be good news. But it is by no means business as usual. As the director of one of the first productions to resume, three weeks ago, Clark has been negotiating a whole new way of working – not quite as dystopian as the programme he’s making, but strange and slightly sci-fi all the same“To be honest, you get used to the patterns and the rituals pretty quickly,” he says. “Testing is the key thing: temperature checks for everybody every morning, and 30 members of the crew and the lead actors are tested every morning.” There is a full-time Covid-19 consultant on set to keep an eye on social distancing and cross-contacts. Sets are fogged every night, as are all the costumes. Props are kept sealed in bags, then only handled by the cast member using them. Even dining is different, with no more catering truck and lunchtime socialising. Meals are inidually packaged and served, and eaten in a huge marquee. Each table is two metres long, so one person can sit at either end.“The main philosophy behind how we operate is essentially: ‘You’ve got to protect the cast,’” Clark explains. In War of the Worlds’ case, that includes Gabriel Byrne, Elizabeth McGovern and Normal People’s Daisy Edgar-Jones. “Ultimately, the crew are replaceable, including – to an extent – the director. But the lead cast are not, so you’ve got to prioritise safeguarding those personnel who, if they went down ill, would cause the whole thing to collapse.” There is a complex system of coloured armbands denoting the degree of proximity to which crew members are allowed to the actors. Everyone must wear masks, even when shooting outdoors. Some, such as hair and makeup, must wear visors, too.It is a similar setup over at Pinewood studios, says Sarah-Jane Wright, the head of production at Working Title. She has just returned from the set of Last Night in Soho, Edgar Wright’s new movie, a psychological horror set in 1960s London. Shooting was just about finished when lockdown started, but a week of additional photography was still needed. With a larger crew, their system is even more complicated than Clark’s. Personnel are ided into discrete pods. Pod A is the cast (which includes Anya Taylor-Joy, Diana Rigg and Thomasin McKenzie) along with crew who have to be close to them, such as the director and camera operators. They have their own separate entrance and check-in area (again, temperature checks and Covid-19 swab tests are routine), separate bathrooms and their own dining facilities. Pod A can only interact with their “pod unit base”, which consists of hair and makeup, second assistant directors and others.Pod B contains other technicians and crew who have to be on set. They are separated from pod A by Plexiglass and barriers. Pod C is standbys, electricians, grips, riggers and props, who have their own marquee outside the set. “If a light needs changing or props need adjusting, they can only go on to the set when pod A and pod B have cleared it.” Then there’s Pod O (office and props, who are nearby but never come on set), and Pod H (people working remotely). Plus 24-hour cleaners and a team of between six and 10 Covid-19 coordinators, swabbing nurses and medics. “We have a very good Covid adviser who does actually have a metal measuring tape to make sure everyone is two metres socially distanced.” Because everyone is in masks, things are quieter than usual, says Wright. “It can feel as if you’re going to work in an operating theatre. But it has so quickly become our new normal.”Before coronavirus, film and high-end television production in the UK was booming. Inward investment, mostly from the US, was at a record-breaking £3.65bn in 2019. This year was on track to exceed that. The major film studios were fully booked, new ones were being built across the country to cope with the demand and Hollywood productions were queueing up to take advantage of the UK’s expertise and tax breaks. Then, with the imposition of lockdown in March, everything changed practically overnight. “We went from pretty much full employment to zero employment and everything stopping,” says Adrian Wootton, the CEO of the British Film Commission (BFC), which is responsible for persuading foreign companies to come and film in the UK. “We had something like a billion pounds’ worth of production mothballed or suspended in the UK.”The BFC, British Film Institute and others have been working ever since to figure out how to get film-making back up and running, talking to industry, studios, unions, government, public health bodies, right up to No 10. It was the biggest consultation they have ever done, according to Wootton. The end result was a 53-page document of guidelines for working safely during Covid-19, published in June but continually updated since. It has served to kickstart the recovery process. “Pretty much from the minute the guidance was published, people started rehiring their teams, and started going back into active preproduction,” Wootton says.That recovery is proceeding apace. At the beginning of July, Tom Cruise arrived in the UK to resume filming on Mission: Impossible 7 and 8 at Hertfordshire’s Leavesden studios (filming in Italy was halted in February). Cruise was one of a number of actors to be granted exemption after standard quarantine rules were relaxed to allow Hollywood crews to work in the UK under socially distanced conditions. Across the Pinewood lot from Last Night in Soho, Jurassic World: Dominion is back on set, having shut down in March. Other titles such as The Batman, Disney’s The Little Mermaid and Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them 3 are preparing to start up again. Netflix expects its UK series such as The Witcher and Sex Education to be filming by the end of September. Bollywood is also returning to the UK: Akshay Kumar’s Bell Bottom is due to shoot in Scotland in August.Film-making is also expected to be slower under the guidelines, although Wright and Clark report no major schedule delays. “At the moment, we are shooting about 18 setups a day, which is what I aim for in a high-end drama,” says Clark, “so we are not dropping anything.” Much of that is down to the military-level planning required in the preproduction phase. Another factor could be the reduced number of interruptions, now that nonessential personnel cannot casually drop by to “see what’s going on” or surreptitiously gawp at Tom Cruise.Long-term lessons could yet come out of this situation. As with many sectors, the film industry seems to have realised how much more people could be working remotely. There are also, suggests Wootton, lessons about sustainability – never one of the industry’s strong points. “Big productions such as James Bond move around the world, and you can’t see that changing, but there might be more: ‘Do we really need to go to that country? Do we really need to send hundreds people on a jet there for several weeks?’”As for the creative impact, the new working conditions make certain scenarios more difficult. Crowd scenes, for example, or street scenes requiring lots of extras, all of whom must be tested, monitored and socially distanced. But there are always workarounds. This week’s shooting on Last Night in Soho was originally supposed to have taken place in the real Soho in central London instead they have had to recreate the streetscape on a soundstage with visual effects filling in the gaps. Clark has not had to make changes to War of the Worlds’ scripts, he says, but he, too, has had difficulties finding locations, since so many places are shut down or high-risk, which has necessitated building more indoor sets.One small but significant difference, Clark observes, is how protective equipment and social distancing affect human interaction: “It puts a slight wall between you that wasn’t there before. It’s surmountable, but you feel it. There’s a kind of intimacy in terms of directing, and particularly with the cast. We shot a very emotional scene this morning and it was quite upsetting for the actor, and it was hard maintaining a distance from them. Usually, there would probably be a touch on the arm, a physical reassurance. Actors make themselves very vulnerable, and they need the support and reassurance of directors to help them go there, and know that it’s safe. That reassurance is slightly harder to provide if you’re a metre-plus away from them with a mask on.”Nobody wants this “new normal” to last, but film crews are well accustomed to coping with adverse and unpredictable conditions, points out Sarah-Jane Wright. “If any industry was going to adapt to this, the film and TV industry is built to just take this on board and run with it. If this is our normal for the next year, I feel we can achieve it. When I visited the set, there was a real sense that everyone was really, really happy to be back at work … although it’s hard, because you can’t see people smiling through a mask.” Clark agrees: “Being in a mask 10 hours a day is not fun, but these are not exactly terrible problems. We’re all bloody grateful to be working, to be honest.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0df7f3c41344530ec306f6e8cfbdb061c4c7957/1333_0_6667_4000/master/6667.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c58c135b2c21ae7f30c9c6fd6344de9","title":"toronto film festival lineup mark wahlberg halle berry","story":"Halle Berry’s directorial debut also on programme but whether physical screenings will take place remains up in the airThe Toronto film festival has announced its main line-up for this year, although it still uncertain whether physical screenings will take place.As with the Venice and Cannes film festivals, the selection appears to have been significantly affected by the coronavirus pandemic, which has caused production shutdowns and release delays across the industry. Arguably the most high-profile inclusion is the Mark Wahlberg drama Good Joe Bell, directed by Reinaldo Marcus Green (Monsters and Men), based on the real-life story of a father whose son killed himself after being bullied.Also receiving world premieres are Concrete Cowboy, starring Idris Elba and Stranger Things’ Caleb McLaughlin, about the “urban cowboy” subculture in Philadelphia, and the Spike Lee-directed David Byrne’s American Utopia, a filmed version of the Broadway show.Toronto will also host premieres of two notable directorial debuts: Halle Berry’s Bruised, in which Berry plays a mixed martial arts fighter attempting a comeback, and Regina King’s One Night in Miami, in which Muhammad Ali, Malcolm X, Jim Brown and Sam Cooke meet on the night of Ali’s victory over Sonny Liston.Toronto’s closing presentation will be the BBC series A Suitable Boy, adapted from Vikram Seth’s celebrated novel and directed by Mira Nair.Other highlights of the programme include the Kate WinsletSaoirse Ronan romantic drama Ammonite, inspired by the life of 19th-century paleontologist Mary Anning and which was included in Cannes “branded” selection earlier this year, and Chloé Zhao’s Nomadland, starring Frances McDormand as a retiree forced to go on the road, in a premiere shared with the Venice film festival.Toronto previously announced it will stage a “hybrid” festival, with all industry events taking place online and with a group of “ambassadors”, including Barry Jenkins, Natalie Portman and Taika Waititi, hosting digital sessions. The festival will require permits from local authorities to put on physical screenings, but the city has recently allowed cinemas to reopen under social distancing conditions.The Toronto film festival is due to run 10-20 September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1eaa26299f74f04a594d20dccc2771ab5765c06d/0_62_1734_1041/master/1734.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76cf396501d3ab4fbdc5c472a8186947","title":"waterworld kevin costner cult classic","story":"With its shallow pleasures and B-movie bravado, is the notorious box-office bomb angling for a reappraisal? When looking back at the most infamous films of the 1990s – Batman \u0026amp Robin, Judge Dredd and Star Wars: The Phantom Menace spring to mind – it’s easy to pinpoint why each failed so miserably. Joel Schumacher’s superhero sequel had Batnipples, wooden acting and a  pantomime-level script Judge Dredd had a miscast Sylvester Stallone and rubbish “comedy sidekick” Rob Schneider The Phantom Menace had Jar Jar Binks, plastic CGI and abundant racist stereotyping. And yet it’s harder to recall exactly why Kevin Reynolds’ Waterworld, which hit cinemas 25 years ago this week, ended up being one of the worst Hollywood turkeys of all time.Perhaps it’s because it was released slap bang in the middle of a Hollywood decade otherwise known for the return of sharp-edged indie film-making, and really feels like a brash and bombastic 80s action flick. Maybe it’s because Kevin Costner’s taciturn acting style was unsuited to such an over-the-top adventure. Perhaps only James Cameron can make expensive movies about the sea that connect with audiences. But there isn’t really anything notable about Waterworld to suggest it truly deserves such a low reputation, other than the fact it was the most expensive film of all time and an appalling box-office bomb.The film’s production problems are well documented. Steven Spielberg had warned Reynolds not to shoot on open water after his own struggles filming Jaws, but nobody listened. Costner, at the peak of his fame and power, fought so hard to get his ideas included that Reynolds walked away before production had wrapped. Joss Whedon was flown in for a bout of last-minute rewrites that he has since described as “seven weeks of hell”, largely because he was required to edit in Costner’s ideas with zero filter. The movie’s star almost died in a squall, and a multimillion dollar set was ripped apart when a hurricane hit the shoot location just off the coast of Hawaii. And yet watching the movie in 2020, you would never guess any of this happened.Waterworld was originally concocted as a Mad Max rip-off by screenwriter Peter Rader, with Reynolds even hiring that series’ director of photography, Dean Semler. One suspects if Reynold’s movie had been made for $10m, as Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome was, instead of $175m, it would be remembered as a decent little film for a rainy day when one’s mind turns to the end of human civilisation as we know it. But Reynolds and Costner did not have Miller’s modest budget. Even 2015’s Mad Max: Fury Road, which experienced its own production setbacks and was shot 20 years later (by which time budgets had ballooned), barely passed Waterworld’s mammoth production costs.Reynolds’ film has silliness in abundance. Costner’s unnamed Mariner is a fish-man whose species has evolved to develop gills that allow him to spend copious amounts of time underwater. This is despite dolphins and whales having yet to develop the same mutation despite the tens of millions of years that have passed since their ancestors last set foot on land. It cannot have been long since the waters rose and covered the Earth, or the sea planes, boats and guns, scavenged in abundance by human survivors, would have rusted into nothing. And yet this matters not one jot: the scene in which the survivors of humankind, lingering on a grimy atoll, discover that Costner is a mutant retains a trashy comic-book cool, as well as going a long way to explaining his solitary existence. Ultimately, it’s all good B-movie fun.Dennis Hopper makes a fine villain as the one-eyed, ferociously acquisitive Deacon, a man who wants to eat the world and its remaining resources, a feverish Gordon Gekko of the dystopian high seas. Along with Speed, Waterworld marks the finest moment of Hopper’s enjoyable late-career devolution into furniture-chewing bad guy.The action set-pieces, from the Mariner’s battles with sea pirates to his underwater wrestling match with a giant mutant fish, are preposterously ambitious yet pulled off with aplomb. His transforming trimaran makes the Batmobile look like something from a secondhand toy shop. The humans are superbly decked out in post-apocalyptic future-wear.If you are not looking to give your cerebrum an overly taxing workout, Waterworld is a thoroughly rousing, pleasingly throwaway 135 minutes. It should certainly not be considered the nadir of Costner’s career when he also starred in movies like Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves and The Postman. Perhaps it’s time to let those critical water-levels fall back to reveal the existence of a perfectly watchable sci-fi cult classic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d471daa58fae077df54e759557f22b3a8d0f7db/204_0_5735_3443/master/5735.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=64f3b20002e87ea888cc55a49c51f9fa","title":"microsoft flight simulator game","story":"With its stunningly realistic visuals and cutting-edge use of geographic and weather data, this flight sim offers a virtual chance to travel freely once moreFor a few seconds, it seems real. A Cessna 172 Skyhawk flying low over a rural landscape dotted with fields and farmhouses, a copse of tall trees casting shadows over the swaying grass, a winding country lane. Then, on the horizon, the landscape gives way to rugged coastline, and, as the plane flies closer, we glimpse the rippling waves glinting in the evening sun. In real life, I have not seen the ocean for five months and, although I’m just sitting in my kitchen watching a virtual presentation of a video game, I feel a surge of emotion.When the latest instalment in Microsoft’s decades-old Flight Simulator series was first shown at the E3 video game event last year, it drew gasps from the audience. Using two petabytes of geographic data culled from Bing Maps, together with cutting-edge, machine learning algorithms running on the company’s Azure cloud computing network, the game presents a near-photorealistic depiction of the entire planet.The statistics involved are mind-boggling: there are 37,000 airports in the game, 1.5bn buildings, 100m lakes, two trillion trees. Most cities are procedurally generated by the AI, based data from OpenStreetMap and an algorithm that provides architectural rulesets for the program to work from. It knows the types of buildings that dominate a French city and how they differ from those in an Indian equivalent, but the artists go in and add specific landmarks that locals and tourists will recognise. However, another 400 key cities have been closely replicated by hand, using detailed photogrammetry. Fly over Seattle, for example, and you’ll recognise almost every building.This was impressive last year, but now, given the current pandemic, it feels genuinely wholesome. While watching the two-hour demo of the game given by its lead designers, I realised with a visceral lurch how much I missed visiting new places. Being able to zoom above rolling landscapes once again was almost a relief. In the past, Flight Simulator offered a super-technical, incredibly authentic flying experience to sim fanatics, and this edition does that, too – the cockpits, instrumentation and flight mechanics of dozens of planes are faithfully reproduced. But now it seems developer Asobo Studio has sought to capture the spiritual, emotional element of flight as well.“Lockdown has had a big impact on us,” says project head Jorg Neumann. “To counteract it, last week I was playing in Suriname, the week before I was in Nepal. This week I’ll pick some other place on Earth to explore. I am able to visit the planet again now and that means a lot. The trailer that Sebastian Wloch showed during our presentation, it’s based near where he grew up in the Pyrenees. I love that! I want to go there and see it. I think that helps you relate to people.”After watching the demo, I wonder if it won’t be the big, grandstanding landmarks that will really get you but rather the quiet moments of natural beauty. Clouds are three-dimensional and volumetric, built from multiple layers that reflect light and cast shadows – they look plump and fluffy meanwhile, the sea varies in colour depending on the mud and algae content, and the water is translucent and as you fly over. In some places, you’ll see coral reefs beneath the surface. There are full daynight cycles, too, and seasonal shifts utilising weather data supplied by Swiss specialist Meteoblue, so the conditions you encounter in the game are true to what the real world is experiencing in that moment. These forces combine to produce authentic weather effects – a fog rolling in from the sea, a storm gathering on the horizon. Get enough rain on a sunny day and the light is scattered through the droplets, causing the beams to reflect and refract. Flight Simulator, it turns out, is also a rainbow simulator.These are the things we see when we’re flying over a landscape, or even travelling by train or car – the sky changing colour, the clouds forming, their shadows like dark handprints across the fields the lights from distant cities twinkling like constellations and then fading away. These are the things I miss – these quiet moments, the Earth and I, in transit together.And it seems the game is being partially designed for dreamy travellers like me, who perhaps don’t want to fully engage with the instrumentation panels of an Airbus A320, but do want to swoop through the clouds over the Italian alps or touch down somewhere in rural Ohio. Various autopilot functions can take over almost all the complexities of flying, allowing you to control your plane with a joypad alone. You choose an aircraft and then go wherever you want. In fact, select a small enough plane and you can land wherever you want, too.“The Savage Cub has a very short landing distance,” says Wloch during our demo. “You can touch down anywhere on the planet. You can land north of the Golden Gate bridge, and you have this great view over downtown San Francisco. You can just sit there and enjoy the sunset. You can land in the desert, on a mountain, anywhere – these planes are great to explore countries, to discover the planet.”Through its extraordinarily ambitious visualisation of the world, the latest title promises something more than a hardcore sim for flight fanatics: it promises to be a vast, gamified take on Google Earth, something that allows us to revisit nostalgic places and relive our memories. I will certainly fly along the Amalfi coast – the last place my family holidayed together while my father was still alive. I will follow the east coast of Australia where I went backpacking with a university friend. “Many of us on the team frequently visit places that mean something to us,” says Neumann. “We hear the same things from the Alpha audience, many of whom send us pictures of places that have special meaning to them.” For added immersion, there is even VR support coming, at first just for HP’s Reverb GT headset, but later for Oculus and other devices.Right now, a lot of us feel like we’re trapped. News footage shows gridlocked roads leading to coastal getaways and beaches crammed with people, and these images are loaded with anxiety. People need to get away, but should they? The idea of travel as a form of freedom has been soiled – there’s something paranoid in it. During this time of uncertainty, a game that offers the sense of travel, the idea of a route, a view, a destination, seems almost therapeutic.When I put this to Neumann he nods in recognition. “I’ve been sitting in this house since March. It feels like the world is kind of collapsing,” he says. “I won’t say the timing is fortuitous because it’s terrible what is going on. But maybe Flight Simulator will be helpful, maybe it will be soothing … The world is still out there.” That is something, I think, that we all need help remembering.• Flight Simulator is available on PC from 18 August, and on Xbox One at a later date.

Who among us hasn’t tried to resist the lure of the cake aisle? The connection between food and wellbeing seems particularly salient when it comes to gut health. And, it turns out, by making simple changes to our diet, we can start to take care of our tummies. Try popping some of the items listed below into your shopping basket and see if you notice a difference.Potatoes Pile plenty of potatoes into your shopping bag, but resist peeling them because their skins contain fibre. Fibre helps to maintain a healthy digestive system, passing through our small intestine without being broken down. The UK government recommends we aim for 30g of fibre a day although British adults manage to eat only around 19g on average. Potatoes are also a source of resistant starch, a form of starch that can’t be digested in the small intestine and so is classified as a type of fibre. This, too, may aid gut health.WholegrainsChoosing wholegrain varieties of bread and pasta is an easy way of boosting your fibre intake. Unlike the refined grains used in white bread and pasta, whole grains include the bran, the fibre-rich outer layer that gets stripped when grain is refined. Remember to check the label on any packets you buy so you can be sure about the ingredients, fibre content and nutritional values. European regulations state that a product claiming to be a source of fibre should contain at least 3g of fibre per 100g or at least 1.5g of fibre per 100 kcal, while a product claiming to be high fibre should contain double those figures.Wheat bran A daily intake of 10g of wheat-bran fibre is known to support your gut health by helping to accelerate the transit of food through your intestines. An easy way to boost your intake is by eating breakfast cereals high in wheat-bran fibre, such as the Kellogg’s high fibre range, which includes Bran Flakes, All-Bran Original and Fruit \u0026amp Fibre.Oats These are another handy breakfast option. Oats are known to provide a type of fibre often referred to as soluble fibre. This fibre dissolves in water and forms a gel in the gut, which can beneficially impact digestion and metabolism. Remember oats aren’t just used to make porridge but are the basis of muesli, oatcakes and oat bread.Leafy vegetables Parents down the generations have told children to “eat up your greens”, and it turns out they were right. For example, broccoli and kale can provide a source of fibre.Probiotics and fermented foods We can enrich the ersity of our gut microbiome by eating probiotics – technically defined as live bacteria that, when consumed in a viable form and adequate amounts, are beneficial to health. Kefir, a fermented milk drink, is an example of a food providing a probiotic source. Such foods may complement a fibre-rich diet, in the context of gut health. Other fermented foods such as certain yoghurts, sauerkraut, miso and kimchi are examples of probiotic sources.Bulgur wheatIf you’re bored of potatoes but need something on the side, this wholewheat grain is your friend. It comes in four sizes, from fine to very coarse, and is great as a basis for salads. Mix it with anything from tomatoes and cucumber to parsley and lettuce, for a tasty side dish.PulsesThese come in all sorts of varieties, with some of the most familiar being lentils, chickpeas and kidney beans. All three contain fibre, as well as resistant starch, and can be added to soups, stews, curries or salads.Nuts and seedsPumpkin, sunflower and flax seeds are handy if you’re looking for a fibre snack while on the go. Nuts and seeds can be sprinkled on stir fries, blitzed into curries, stirred into homemade cereal bars, or added to breakfast cereals. And don’t forget nut butters, which come in varieties such as cashew and almond as well as peanut.Assorted fruitsIf you fancy something sweeter, remember that plenty of fruits contain fibre, such as strawberries, blackberries and pomegranates. Avocados might be savoury but they are a fruit, and another good option.BananasWhen green, these are a good source of resistant starch. As a rule of thumb, the greener the banana, the more resistant starch it contains, so try to eat them before they turn completely yellow.PrebioticsFibre reaches the large intestine undigested. Once there, some types of fibre become “food” for the good bacteria in our gut. These types of fibre are referred to as prebiotics. Small amounts can be found in foods such as chicory root, onions, garlic and artichokes. But you can also opt for foods with added prebiotic fibre."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b473ddf12486a48df79edc79336b9da1ddb50475/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c64d254b4a65ad0ee81b15a92a6965c","title":"we realised we were a necessity how a high street baker used google to keep serving his community","story":"For Sam Mensah of London bakery Uncle John’s, the right digital ingredients equipped his business to rise to the challenge during lockdownThe bright yellow signage of Uncle John’s Bakery stands out like a beacon on West Green Road, in the north London suburb of Tottenham. Famed for its lovingly made Ghanaian sweet bread and other regional specialties such as drop doughnuts and meat pies, the bakery has served London’s African-Caribbean and wider community for 25 years.Sam Mensah took over the family business in 2015. “When my parents came to Britain in 1982, they had nothing behind them education-wise, but they were ready to seize the opportunities life in the UK could provide,” he recounts.“They longed for the comfort of Ghanaian sweet bread, but the available imports were stale on arrival. So they started baking their own, to a family recipe, using somebody else’s bakery after midnight. Soon they started selling it by word of mouth. Then they had it packaged, placing it in Ghanaian shops. Eventually they built up enough momentum to open a shop of their own.“It wasn’t always easy, but whenever things looked bleak, my mum reminded my dad of a Ghanaian motto: obeyeyie – things will get better. I think – and especially now, when people might feel like they need to give up on things – you have to have resilience.”Resilience and persistence is clearly baked into the family DNA, as Mensah too proved when he set aside a successful music career to take over running Uncle John’s from his ageing parents. Tackling a steep learning curve, he not only added two new production units and gained the certifications needed to be able to supply supermarkets, but also comprehensively rebranded the store and built up a digital and social media presence.And as the UK went into lockdown in March, it was this spirit of resilience that made all the difference. Mensah says he did have a moment of panic: “We closed the store for a couple of days. Then we realised the wholesale side was moving fast and that we were a necessity – that people will buy our bread. So we reopened, putting measures in place to protect our staff, and publicised our new opening times on social channels, and above all, on Google My Business.”Using Google My Business – a free tool for businesses to manage their online presence across Google, including updating opening times on Search and Maps - meant customers could not only see the bakery’s new hours of business, but also that online ordering was available, either for pickup, or for delivery within an eight-mile radius. Uncle John’s also delivered flour – a hot commodity at the peak of the lockdown.If luck is when preparedness and opportunity meet, Mensah had the perfect package at just the right time: an optimised website with Google Maps integration, a strong social media presence, and an informative Google My Business profile. Positive Google reviews further buttressed his credibility, reassuring first-time customers. With all the pieces coming together, what could have been a crisis became a springboard for further growth.Mensah is clear what a lifeline it has proved to be: “With Google My Business, we have been able to communicate our business’ adaptations during this current pandemic, and helped bridge the gap between our business and consumers by keeping customers informed. And in turn, through reviews, we are able to understand what the customer wants and adjust accordingly.”And the effects go well beyond his premises Mensah was also able to publicise his NHS initiative – priority service and free loaves for NHS staff. “Serving our community at this time is more important than ever,” he says. “We’ve given out more than 2,000 loaves so far.”In fact, this community ethos was what drove Mensah to take over the family business in the first place: “What really helped me make that decision was having a daughter of my own. I wanted her to see what legacy is about. I felt that this business was something very important within the community, and for the generation that comes after me.”For Mensah, the way forward is now clearer than ever. “Our goal is to stand our ground among all British companies, not just black businesses,” he says. “And it’s no longer just for us. It’s for all the people who are placing their trust in us.”To find out how Google can help your business adapt, visit: g.cosmallbusiness"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02ca2b34aca535690caaac5b04dc78a6b62b394c/0_320_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=ef98e233b31258e57eb41fa97e5d0c33","title":"qanon does suppressing online conspiracy theorists work","story":"Twitter recently announced it would stop promoting content linked to the baseless QAnon conspiracy theoryLast week Twitter announced it would stop promoting content associated with QAnon – a baseless internet conspiracy theory that has had an outsized impact on political discourse, causing real-world harm through targeted harassment campaigns.But does filtering out conspiracy theorists help public discourse – or can it strengthen their paranoia that they are being suppressed? And can these ideas be fought with education? We spoke to experts to see whether it will work.Russell Muirhead, who co-authored the book A Lot of People Are Saying, which digs into how misinformation spreads online, says that social media work to validate and legitimize conspiracy theorizing and misinformation.“On a platform like Twitter, and to some extent on Facebook and YouTube, repetition comes to substitute validation. If enough people like the tweet, or watch the video, or like the video on YouTube, it confers a kind of legitimacy,” he says.He gives the example of a common refrain of Donald Trump’s to exemplify this: Trump will say “I don’t know if it’s true but a lot of people are saying it” – as if people simply repeating misinformation means it must have some truth to it.“That’s very threatening to our ability to understand the world and to democratic politics. Because anything people retweet enough times seems true – regardless of whether or not it is,” he says.Muirhead points out that before social media, it was the norm for media outlets to have a gatekeeping function. Editors, the gatekeepers of traditional media, are tasked everyday with deciding what makes it on air or into print – and an established first criterion is truthfulness:“The more likely a claim is to be judged false, the less likely the editor will decide to put it in the paper or on the air. What’s happened with Google, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter is the gatekeeping function has been displaced: anybody can say anything to anyone in the whole world, pretty much for free,” he says.Dr Whitney Phillips, author of This is Why we Can’t Have Nice Things, points out that a “marketplace of ideas approach” to misinformation (which posits that if you combat problematic speech with more speech, the truth will eventually prevail) doesn’t work in our current online environment.“That ideal does not take into account algorithms the various affordances of digital media that float and incentivize certain types of sensationalist content – it is simply not the case that all voices carry equally on social media or that all information carries equally,” she says.But one problem is that misinformation and conspiracy have generally found fertile ground on social media, according to Phillips.But does refusing to publish misinformation and baseless conspiracy feed into the conspiracist mindset, making conspiracists more determined in their worldview?Muirhead suggests not. He mentions Spotify’s decision, followed by subsequent outlets such as Apple, YouTube and Twitter to take conspiracist Alex Jones’ radio show Infowars off its platforms. Jones spread a debunked conspiracy theory about the Sandy Hook massacre, suggesting it was staged by actors. He was held liable for defamation in US courts for those claims that also led to real-world, palpable harm: a grieving father was subject to death threats, and the woman who hounded him was given a five-month prison sentence.Phillips explains that the conspiratorial mindset does, of course, affect the ways that conspiracists take in information, but argues that the cost to society of letting these ideas flourish is too great to ignore.“But QAnon is not just a random narrative with no consequences – for years it’s been bubbling up and people have been conducting violence under its auspices … For Twitter to take that stance, that they are acknowledging harm and predicating moderation decisions based on harm I think that’s good,” she says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b19d8e31d91efcaf484d023e31e8957d9b04947c/0_90_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ab36af472711eba69ff54732c1b498c","title":"how did britain get so overweight podcast","story":"As the government launches a newly interventionist strategy to tackle obesity, the ’s Felicity Lawrence looks at whether it goes far enough to take on the might of the food industryBoris Johnson once scoffed at what he saw as the “nanny state” instincts of politicians who sought to tackle the growing waistlines of the British public.

If successful, it could lead to more flying probes on other planets.Perseverance will also trial technologies to help astronauts make future expeditions to Mars.One such device includes an instrument, called Moxie, that will work on making oxygen from the planet’s atmosphere which is mostly made up of carbon dioxide.Meanwhile, scientists in the UK will help Perseverance select the Martian samples to be brought back to Earth.Researchers at Imperial College London and the Natural History Museum will identify samples that could contain evidence of past life and study the mineralogy and geochemistry of the different rocks found in the crater.Prof Mark Sephton, an astrobiologist at Imperial, said: “I hope that the samples we select and return will help current and future generations of scientists answer the question of whether there was ever life on the red planet.“With one carefully chosen sample from Mars, we could discover that the history of life on the Earth is not unique in the universe.”Sue Horne, the space exploration programme manager at the UK Space Agency, said: “We will continue to explore the heavens so long as the moon, Mars and the myriad celestial bodies beyond spark fires in our curiosity and if Perseverance helps us find life on Mars, it will be a defining moment for humankind.“The UK Space Agency is supporting these endeavours to explore our solar system with leading-edge robotics, and it is a credit to our expertise in the UK that researchers from both Imperial College London and the Natural History Museum are part of the international crack team working on this Nasa mission.”It is also a busy week for Nasa, as the US space agency gears up to welcome two astronauts home as they attempt a splashdown off the Florida coast on Sunday.Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley will arrive in the Crew Dragon spacecraft, called Endeavour, which was designed and built by SpaceX.The duo will complete a mission that was designed to test SpaceX’s human spaceflight system, including launch, docking, splashdown, and recovery operations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/723cb07c703bf847469a47ebb12536b3da36288c/0_129_3600_2159/master/3600.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=9bdf217309aebb754140200a28914039","title":"chess magnus carlsen aiming to continue his 15 match winning streak","story":"The world No 1 is on form in the Legends of Chess event and also found time to challenge for top spot in Fantasy Premier LeagueMagnus Carlsen is on a 15-match winning streak against his major rivals this weekend. Norway’s world champion, whose target is to become the Goat (Greatest of All Time), starts his $150,000 Legends of Chess semi-final on Friday afternoon.At the 29-year-old’s other passion of Fantasy Premier League, though, it was a near-miss. Carlsen twice led the field of seven million earlier in the season and was fourth going into last Sunday’s matches before dropping back to 11th.Asked to explain why he is doing so well, he replied: “I don’t have obvious weaknesses in my play that they can try and exploit.” That answer sounds a homespun variant on what used to be said about Boris Spassky and later Garry Kasparov, that they had a universal style which could adapt to endgames or complex tactics, to hot opening theory or strategic grinds. Carlsen showed his range of skills this week when he won a filigree rook ending against Peter Svidler then twice crushed the ex-champion Vlad Kramnik in the middle game.On two occasions when Carlsen was under pressure in his mini-matches, tied at 2-2 and into an Armageddon decider, he showed something special which has no equivalent among previous great champions. In Armageddon, White has five minutes on the clock for all moves, Black four minutes, and a draw on the board counts as a win for Black in the score table.There is no per-move increment, so that when the clock ticks down to the final seconds the game becomes a physical and mental test of instant reactions and mouse speed. Carlsen is a fan of one-minute bullet, where only the blitz specialist Hikaru Nakamura and the prodigy Alireza Firouzja can match him, and he knows the dark arts of pre-move, anticipating the opponent’s reply.Early in his mini-match with Vasyl Ivanchuk, Carlsen blundered horribly into a forced mate (74 Qb3?? when 74 Qe6 or Qe8 wins instantly) and at 2-2, Armageddon and 30 seconds each the game was in the balance when Carlsen launched a barrage which ended with Ivanchuk losing both on time and on the board while his opponent still had 14 seconds left.Carlsen struggled with his form against Russia’s No 1, Ian Nepomniachtchi, who kept pace with the champion for most of the group stage. Always a harsh critic of his own play, Carlsen said later: “ I am getting Lewandowski level chances, but I am converting them at a Firmino level. For those who don’t watch football, that’s pretty bad.”On move 52 in the Armageddon game, Nepomniachtchi with a time advantage rejected a move repetition and went for an endgame where Carlsen had only 25 seconds left on the clock. In the final position, 29 moves later, Carlsen still had 13 seconds left. He was completely winning on the board, and for extra insurance could wipe out the Russian army so that his opponent would not have mating material. Generously, he agreed a draw.Carlsen’s match against China’s world No 3, Ding Liren, last Sunday started four hours early so that Carlsen could manage his Fantasy Premier League team. Back in December, he became No 1 at FPL for a few days and repeated that for a single day in late June. He dropped back again, then made another surge to No 4 in the final week. He would have been No 1 for a third time had he selected Raheem Sterling as his captain instead of Marcus Rashford.The final day was an anti-climax even though Carlsen outclassed Ding on the chessboard, as he dropped to 11th in FPL. He had even enlisted his chess coach, Peter Heine Nielsen, to try to create a model team designed to pass the three ahead of him. A clue to what went wrong was his tweet: “Hoping (Michail) Antonio gets 3 bonus.” But the West Ham striker, who had scored all four against Norwich, went goalless.Carlsen’s competitive instincts and his near-miss this season will surely mean that in his wish list for 2021 winning the FPL will rank close behind retaining his over-the-board world title.The Legends of Chess semi-finals, Magnus Carlsen v Peter Svidler and Ian Nepomniachtchi v Anish Giri, start at 3pm on Friday free and live on chess24 with grandmaster and computer commentaries.While over-the-board chess in Britain remains stymied, tournaments are happening in Central Europe. The first major international event, the traditional Biel grandmaster tournament, proceeded normally. Players were separated by a plexiglass screen for their classical games, and wore face masks for the blitz section. Boards in the amateur tournament had extra spacing.The England No 1, Michael Adams, had a good result in the GM tournament and was in contention for a shock victory until well into the final round before ending a close third behind Poland’s top seeded Radoslaw Wojtaszek. Adams began badly with two classical losses, then hit a purple patch in the blitz section where he began with seven straight wins and reached 9.51o before being caught by the Pole at the finish. The 48-year-old Cornishman’s most visual game was a sacrificial splurge , though marred by a simple missed win at move 21.3682: 1 Rh8+! Kxh8 2 g6 and White will mate by Rc8."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a214e517aa31258e27861dea973dc8bc5487f37/146_211_5013_3009/master/5013.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d83c912cfe274ba3ef96f777dac91a68","title":"seven week test window likely to persist world rugbys new plan","story":"World Rugby’s decision to double the length of the international window in the autumn following the cancellation of the summer tours to the south may become the norm as further talks on a global calendar are planned.There will be six Test weekends from 24 October and one rest week, allowing the Six Nations to be completed before the Rugby Championship is staged in one country in the south and the Six Nations are joined by Japan and Fiji for a tournament in Europe.World Rugby’s approval of the Test window being extended means clubs will be obliged to release players under regulation nine.

He dismissed Banton in an under-19s match for South Africa a couple of years ago - and he’s done it again in big school! Banton top-edges a pull high in the air, and Lorcan Tucker takes a comfortable catch. Campher has a wicket with his fourth ball in international cricket.13th over: England 77-3 (Banton 11, Billings 9) Banton gets his first boundary with a wristy sweep off McBrine. KP, on commentary, is good on why Banton needs to improve his rotation of the strike against spin, and how he can construct a typical over against a bowler like McBrine.12th over: England 71-3 (Banton 6, Billings 8) Billings pulls consecutive deliveries from Young for four to move to eight from three balls. He has so much class that, even allowing for the stop-start nature of his England career, his modest record is pretty hard to fathom.“Evening Rob,” says Alex Bramble. “Hope you’re enjoying the return of Morgan and the troops as much as I am. Huge fan of KP the player and there’s a lot to like about him on the mic. Just one (slightly pedantic point): his pronunciation of inningses is a bit sneaky little hobbitses, which is possibly where the similarities with Smeagollum end...”One of the fine I like about his commentary is the frequency with which he addresses Rob Key as “Bob”. It reminds me a bit of Blackadder and Captain Darling.11th over: England 62-3 (Banton 5, Billings 0) Banton has started watchfully, especially against the spin of McBrine. That’s fair enough as the run-rate isn’t an issue. McBrine has half an appeal for LBW when Banton drags a sweep onto his pad and away for a couple of runs.10th over: England 59-3 (Banton 2, Billings 0) Sam Billings is the new batsman. Eoin Morgan, the selfless git, has demoted himself from No4 to give the fringe batsmen a chance to play a longer innings.Deja Vince. After playing some delightful strokes, James Vince falls in frustrating circumstances. He had a big drive at a tempting delivery from Young and edged it straight to the keeper. Vince goes for an ephemeral 25. 9th over: England 54-2 (Vince 21, Banton 1) Vince makes it four fours in five balls with a firm sweep off McBrine. He is such a beautiful batsman he could make a flat-footed reverse hoick look elegant.8th over: England 49-2 (Vince 17, Banton 0) High-class batting from James Vince, who hits Young for three boundaries in four balls: a drive through mid-off, a clip through midwicket an finally an effortless pull stroke.7th over: England 37-2 (Vince 5, Banton 0) Banton gets two thirds of the way down the track before realising Vince has sent him back. He gets home comfortably but that’s another reflection of England’s scruffy start.“We need more fracking information from John Starbuck,” says David Wall. “Does he use mango puree (like in the cans you can buy)? Cheesecake is the only cake worth spending time eating and my regular recipe is pretty good (as well as adaptable and forgiving). But my niece wants a mango cheesecake for her birthday so I’ve been thinking how best to do that. Personally I’m not so keen on fruit cheesecakes (too reminiscent of the Sara Lee freezer imposters) but even bad cheesecake is good.”6th over: England 36-2 (Vince 4, Banton 0) The precocious Tom Banton is the new batsman.Jason Roy can fuggoff himself! He has been trapped LBW after hitting Young’s two previous balls for four. It was a fine delivery that nipped back to hit the flap of the back pad, with Roy surprisingly slow to get his bat down. He knew it was out and walked straight off without discussing a review.5th over: England 26-1 (Roy 16, Vince 3) After a slow start, Roy gets down on one knee to clout McBrine over midwicket for six. The last time I watched him bat, I hadn’t seen Succession. Now every time I think of his name I picture a man in a shawl cardigan telling me to fuggoff. On the plus side, at least there isn’t an England batsman named Walnuts.“Mango and ginger biscuit cheesecake,” says Damian Clarke. “Could you let Mr Starbuck know that I just might be a little in love with him?”4th over: England 14-1 (Roy 6, Vince 1) Vince scrambles to make his ground after being sent back by Roy. I think he would have been just home had Young’s throw hit the stumps, which it didn’t. It’s been a rusty start from the England batsmen, which I suppose is understandable in the circumstances.3rd over: England 12-1 (Roy 5, Vince 0) “Hi Rob,” says Peter Rowntree. “Dave Willey showing he is still a force to be reckoned with in white ball cricket. Recalling his early career, he suffered horrendous injuries to his back and neck, making it almost inevitable that his body would never really stand up to the longer formats of the game. For all that, he is a very fine cricketer, and a very likeable young man.”He sure is, and he accepted his omission from the World Cup squad with admirable dignity. He still played his part, I truly believe that, especially in the 2018 series against India. Had England lost that series, I don’t think they’d have won the World Cup. Bairstow has gone! It hit him in line and was going on to hit leg stump.2.5 overs: England 12-0 (Roy 5, Bairstow 2) The offspinner Andy McBrine comes on second change... in the third over. Bairstow survives a very good shout for LBW after pushing down the wrong line ... but Ireland are going to review. He might be outside the line of off stump if not, it’s plumb.2nd over: England 11-0 (Roy 4, Bairstow 2) The sight of Roy and Bairstow means another airing for the stat that keeps on giving: of the 125 openers to score 1000 runs or more in ODIs, Roy and Bairstow have the highest strike-rates. Bairstow’s record as an opener is astonishing: average 51, strike-rate 110.Craig Young shares the new ball with McCarthy (and Stirling). A loose delivery deflects for four leg-byes, and an LBW shout against Bairstow is caught in the throat because of an inside edge.1st over: England 4-0 (Roy 3, Bairstow 0) Roy bagged a first-baller for the Lions against Ireland the other day. He almost makes it back-to-back golden ducks when he misses a big drive at McCarthy’s first ball, and then gets off the mark with a sliced drive past backward point for two. It was a no-ball as well, called by the third umpire under the new system. It also means a free hit, but Roy can only mow it to midwicket. No-balls are the least of Ireland’s worries. McCarthy has injured himself and is leaving the field after only five deliveries. Paul Stirling bowls the last ball of the over.“Hi Rob,” says John Starbuck. “Tell us: do you like cheesecake? If so, I recommend a form developed by this household. Use mango as your fruit and ginger biscuits as your base. It takes a few practice runs to get it just right but is really toothsome.”I don’t, I’m afraid: I have what might generously be described as a confused palate. But I’m sure plenty of our readers do, so thanks for the tip!The players are back out on the field. Barry McCarthy will open the bowling to Jason Roy.Thanks Simon, evening everyone. So far the match has been predictably one-sided, but there have been some nice inidual stories: Gareth Delany’s eyecatching cameo, Curtis Campher’s unbeaten 59 on debut and David Willey’s maiden five-for in his first ODI since May 2019. It will take another - a Barry McCarthy five-for, perhaps - if Ireland are to turn this into a contest.Right then, I’m off. Rob Smyth will take you through England’s response. Please send your thoughts to him here. Bye!44.4 overs: Ireland 172 all out (Campher 59*) Campher comes down the track and miscues his shot, which drops just beyond the reach of Morgan at cover! Then Young hoists one way into the late afternoon sky, but just beyond Roy as he runs back from mid-off! And then he miscues again, and this one forces Roy to e forwards but he completes the catch and ends the innings! It’s also Willey’s first ODI five-fer!44th over: Ireland 168-9 (Campher 58, Young 9) Young gets a leading edge that goes just beyond the grasping left arm of the bowler and away for four. A little later Campher has a royal heave and the ball skims straight past him and just wide of off stump!43rd over: Ireland 160-9 (Campher 57, Young 3) “Watching the MLB these last few days demonstrates how hard baseballers throw the ball deploying (it seems) two techniques - one for the infield and another for the outfield,” writes Gary Naylor. “All these coaches, but players still throw like they did in schoolboy cricket.” This is interesting, and would probably be even more interesting if I ever watched baseball. I remember reading about Fred Spofforth being able to throw a fresh egg 50 yards in such a fashion that it wouldn’t break upon landing, and thinking that some nuances of throwing have been lost somewhere, beyond mere pace and distance.42nd over: Ireland 157-9 (Campher 56, Young 1) A single off the last keeps Young on strike and denies Mahmood a wicket maiden.Barry McCarthy sends the ball soaring in a delicious arc straight into the pouch of Vince at deep square leg!41st over: Ireland 155-8 (Campher 56, McCarthy 3) Willey, having laid waste to the top order, comes back to wrap things up. Nothing is wrapped, nor is any waste laid.40th over: Ireland 152-8 (Campher 55, McCarthy 2) Into the final 10 overs we rip. For a long time it didn’t look like Ireland would make it this far, but Campher’s 111-ball (and counting) 55 has ensured they will have at least something to celebrate.39th over: Ireland 145-8 (Campher 52, McCarthy 1) Moeen completes his allocation, for no wickets and 37 runs, mainly thanks to the 10 scored in over 35.38th over: Ireland 145-8 (Campher 50, McCarthy 0) McBrine rips into Curran, hitting consecutive and extremely handsome fours before hoisting down the ground for what was clearly intended to be a six but never quite made it. He didn’t stop there, though, and the last ball of the over goes straight to the hands of Billings.McBrine shifts gear, starts really motoring, and then ruins it by picking out Billings at deep square leg!37th over: Ireland 131-7 (Campher 50, McBrine 28) Moeen gets one to rip off the pitch, from wide of off stump to being on its way well wide of leg when it hit Campher. Bairstow has an optimistic appeal, but to no avail. Next ball he gets the single he needs to reach his half-century. It’s been an excellent debut for the 21-year-old, who has dug his team out of a large hole to reposition them in, well, a much smaller but still quite daunting hole.36th over: Ireland 131-7 (Campher 48, McBrine 28) The players take drinks, after which Curran comes back. McBrine takes a bit of a wild swing at the last but top-edges over Bairstow for four.35th over: Ireland 124-7 (Campher 46, McBrine 23) McBrine goes on one knee and swings his bat in a great arc. The camera pans upwards to follow the ball’s trajectory towards the boundary, then the cameraman realises it’s not there, pans downwards again and there it is, rolling harmlessly towards a fielder. Last ball of the over he goes again, and this one he catches cleanly and sends soaring into the stands for six!34th over: Ireland 114-7 (Campher 45, McBrine 14) McBrine pulls Mahmood’s final delivery, a handsome shot. Straight to Rashid though, so just a single for it.33rd over: Ireland 110-7 (Campher 42, McBrine 13) There were as many boundaries in the fourth over of this match as there have been in the last 23 overs. Three, since you ask. 32nd over: Ireland 106-7 (Campher 40, McBrine 11) Mahmood comes back, and Ireland score a few singles. It still looks a fine batting track I think, particularly in the blazing sun.31st over: Ireland 103-7 (Campher 39, McBrine 9) “Richard Noble got me thinking about ‘that region’,” muses Dave Brown. “I remember opening the batting for my school when I stopped the bowler in his run up, realising I forgot to don my box. I trudged off to the changing rooms to rectify this. Came back to face the first ball of the game ... skittled. It felt a long walk back.”30th over: Ireland 99-7 (Campher 37, McBrine 7) Rashid is all bowled out, his 10 overs costing 26 and bringing one wicket (and a run out).29th over: Ireland 98-7 (Campher 36, McBrine 7) Moeen’s fifth over goes for a couple.The ball would have cleared the stumps, concludes ball tracking, and anyway hit the batsman so far from the stumps that the technology can’t be relied upon, leading to a rarely-witnessed umpire’s call for excess distance.He came way down the track to Moeen, making the on-field umpire’s job difficult, but though he’s unmoved England think they might have him. 28th over: Ireland 96-7 (Campher 35, McBrine 6) Runs! Rashid leaks seven, including a thumping crack over cow corner from Campher the brings the first boundary for 12 overs.27th over: Ireland 89-7 (Campher 30, McBrine 4) Campher’s is - wait for it - the sixth slowest score of 30 or more against England since 1990. It’s the fourth slowest since the turn of the century, if that helps.26th over: Ireland 87-7 (Campher 29, McBrine 3) Rashid’s eighth over yields but a single single. 25th over: Ireland 86-7 (Campher 28, McBrine 3) “So this isn’t a series, but three matches in the World Cup Super League,” notes Gary Naylor. “If England win the first two (some way to go I know), there’s no incentive for Morgan to sit one out and let Moeen lead or Rashid to step down and let Liam Livingstone bowl. Disappointing.” This is true. As with all leagues, it’s not just about having to play the good teams, but when you have to play them. For now England will just want to bank as many points as they can lay their greedy mitts on.24th over: Ireland 83-7 (Campher 26, McBrine 2) Rashid’s doing good work here, getting some smart turn. And Vince’s near-miss (see 10th over) has got Richard Noble reminiscing. “That’s actually not all that bad,” he avers. “I faced the same rolling ball, kneeling to field it in classic pose at the Toronto Cricket Club while fielding at deep third man in front of the club patio. There I was next to multiple polite folk quaffing champers and masticating gently upon prawn sandwiches. The ball popped up ... not at my face ... but ‘whither a gentleman wishes a hard ball not’. There was much swearing. There are photos apparently on the web.”22nd over: Ireland 79-7 (Campher 24, McBrine 0) Singh comes in, seems desperate to get off strike as quickly as possible, is beaten by a beauty, hits one straight to Morgan at short cover, and the next time he gets bat on ball he just starts running.God that’s painful. Singh works the ball to point, calls for a run and sets off Campher tells him not to be so silly Banton returns it to Bairstow and Singh is out by miles.The partnership is broken! O’Brien tries to lift the ball over deep extra cover and, um, doesn’t.21st over: Ireland 79-5 (O’Brien 22, Campher 24) Moeen comes on, and the 50 partnership comes up.20th over: Ireland 76-5 (O’Brien 20, Campher 23) A Rashid maiden Campher misses a sweep and Bairstow whips off the bails, but the batsman’s back foot is grounded. “It’s nice to see David Willey make a successful return to the one-day side,” writes David Wall. “He must have been pretty devastated to be left out of the World Cup squad after being a regular and important member of the starting XI for much of the previous four years. At least in his public messages he seemed to take it well, just offering his support to those that did get picked, but it must have stung. Hopefully he’ll be part of the next T20 World Cup squad at least. Plus it’s nice to see a (former) Northamptonshire player at international level, they’re a rare bunch in recent years.”19th over: Ireland 76-5 (O’Brien 20, Campher 23) Three singles and a wide, courtesy of a bouncer that overbounced.18th over: Ireland 72-5 (O’Brien 18, Campher 20) It’s now looking like the benign batting track that Balbirnie thought it was when he decided he would like to bat on it as soon as possible. Of course he wouldn’t have thought he’d be batting on it as soon as he was, but that early-innings wicket avalanche is feeling increasingly distant.17th over: Ireland 70-5 (O’Brien 18, Campher 20) “I was looking at England’s top ODI bowling performances and was astonished by how many of the top ten were made up of medium-paced dibbly-dobbly not-quite all-rounders. I wonder if Willey is going to join that list today,” ponders Tom van der Gucht. “Please don’t tell Willey or Collingwood that I described them in such a way... Or Flintoff...” Here’s a list of England’s ODI five-fers. It’s good to see the ’s very own Vic Marks on there.16th over: Ireland 69-5 (O’Brien 17, Campher 20) Campher miscues a cut, and cries of “catch it!” die as it lands wide of Moeen and runs away for four.15th over: Ireland 60-5 (O’Brien 13, Campher 15) The players have a drink. Finally Ireland have a partnership of sorts, a pair who look minded to stay around and eat up some balls. It still looks likely to be a choice between losing fast and losing slow for Ireland, mind."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ca999c9eabd4118de6db649480e9936065827a9/0_136_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=b940ad26baa4b548920fe13be88bb0d5","title":"quiet as a deserted chapel test driving a hybrid car","story":" Mike Pattenden and his wife Andrea Walker take the Honda CR-V hybrid out for a spin. Here’s what they discover …Despite being the self-conscious subjects of a photoshoot in the busy car park in Bedfordshire’s Dunstable Downs, no one paid a blind bit of notice to us. Clearly, as a couple, my wife and I were as commonplace to the families, walkers and kite flyers up there on a breezy Sunday morning before lockdown as the Honda CR-V hybrid that was actually the quietly unassuming star of every shot.There were plenty of SUVs in view, even a few other Honda CR-Vs – hardly surprising, given it’s the world’s most popular SUV. More than 9m have been sold since it was launched back in 1995.When it comes to cars, “popular” is a good thing. It means dependable, safe and cheap to run and, consequently, as eye-catching as denim. And yet, this fifth-generation model of the CR-V is remarkable in its own way. It’s a hybrid with an engine that combines the best aspects of petrol combustion and electric to power it.Our CR-V is powered via a combination of a 2.0-litre Atkinson-cycle engine and two electric motors via Honda’s integrated motor assist (IMA) system, meaning it runs in three modes: EV, hybrid and petrol, constantly defaulting to electric at speeds below 30mph. In this mode, the electric motors are used to drive the wheels, using energy from the battery that was previously harvested from the petrol engine while driving at higher speeds. This means the petrol engine is generally used at lower revs, making it more fuel efficient and quieter.And, golly, is it quiet. Honda’s noise-cancelling system makes it feel like a deserted chapel as we drive around this Sunday morning, albeit one with heated pews.“You’d hear a squirrel squeak if you ran over one,” observes my wife as we drive stealthily over to Ivinghoe Beacon, where we like to walk at weekends. Luckily, no such tragedy occurs. Honda’s cross-traffic sensor warns me of a jogger as I begin to reverse (I spot him a moment later in the handy rear camera), and the CR-V hybrid has a collision detection system that prevents a rear-end shunt by slamming on the anchors for you. Having recently endured a trip to Bristol in horrendous stop-start motorway traffic, aggravated by a succession of these infuriating incidents, I’d make this feature mandatory in every car.As for efficiency, the car shifts modes seamlessly, meaning it’s incredibly thrifty, capable of 56mpg in town. You can have fun stretching its electric running, too, through regenerative braking via two paddles behind the steering wheel that slow it like changing down gears in a manual, although, given its powertrain, the CR-V hybrid is an automatic. And because of the way it tops up the batteries, there’s no recharging, so no “powernoia” on long journeys.“You don’t really have to do much, do you?” says my wife approvingly, when she takes the wheel. “I could get used to this.”On the motorway, the car switches to petrol mode at high speed and proves adept at eating up the miles in comfort. There’s a suite of driver-assist features including adaptive cruise control that will adjust distance to the car ahead, lane-keep assistance, in case you wander, and a speed limiter that will automatically maintain a specified speed – handy for the inevitable 50mph surveillance sections. For someone who views a future of driverless cars as dystopian, this level of autonomy feels perfectly acceptable to me.Inside, it’s roomy and well supplied with storage points. The centre console swallows my wife’s chunky handbag whole. There are cup holders for coffee addicts and bottle racks in the door pockets, along with charge points for phones.The boot is roomy enough for a dog. Put the rear seats down and you could probably fit a Shetland pony in. Shell out for the top-of-the-range EX model and it’s also automated, meaning you can open it by waggling your foot underneath, handy for the big shop. All but the most basic models boast a centre console with a 7in touchscreen. I had the radio set to 6 Music within a couple of minutes and the sound from the nine speakers was impressive. You can use its Garmin navigation system or set up a smartphone instead, if you wish.CR-V stands for “compact recreational vehicle”, but perhaps “considerately reinvented vehicle” is a better fit?Honda has raised the ambition of its Electric Vision strategy to ensure that all European mainstream models feature electrified powertrains by 2022, three years earlier than originally planned. On the path to this goal, they’ve released their first hybrid SUV, the CR-V, which features Intelligent Multi-Mode Drive (i-MMD) technology, enabling it to shuffle seamlessly between power sources.

It’s flattish, and gives an insight into the mining history of the county – the tramway used to provide the mines their transport route to the sea. You can see the old mines scattered across the landscape as you pedal along. Park at Portreath and stop off at the Hub bike shop and cafe for picnic supplies (or a puncture repair kit). If 22 miles is too far, park at Bissoe and enjoy a circular ride.RachelThe Family Cycle Trail in the Forest of Dean is a gentle meander through this ancient hunting forest. The path is an old railway route from the area’s mining days. History enthusiasts can visit heritage sites on the way, but those just along for the views and the wildlife won’t be disappointed. Look out for wild boar (the largest population in England) and pine martens as you cycle. Stop off for lunch at one of the numerous picnic spots along the way. It’s circular, fully waymarked and suitable for the whole family, including the dog. Melissa LeeFor the millions of us living in the south-east of the capital, the Sustrans Waterlink Way is a hidden treasure. I pick up the track under the Docklands Light Railway bridge at Deptford (the route starts at nearby Greenwich) and enjoy the pleasant, flat and traffic-free six miles along pretty rivers and through local parks. You’ll finish in Beckenham, where David Bowie played early gigs. Book a swim at the now re-opened Beckenham Place Park  lake and bring a picnic to have in the area’s biggest green space before starting the return leg. A great option for a mini-adventure in the city.Lucy AtkinsonWe love the Marriott’s Way, which follows the route of a disused trainline between Norwich and the Bure Valley in Aylsham. It’s 26 miles of footpath and cycleway, with lots of wildlife and local history. You can access it in central Norwich, and there are exits to visit villages and pubs along the way. The first eight miles is paved, making it easy for children after that there are tracks interspersing the paved paths and fields. It’s so beautiful in summer: you could be cycling in rural France! It has handy mile markers all the way along so you can keep track of distance.Amanda CashWe never tire of the Wirral Circular Trail, a former railway line connecting West Kirby to Chester. It’s safe, flat and with cafe and park stops aplenty. Take in the views of north Wales and Dee estuary, have a breather on the beach at Calday or Thurstaston, stop off at Parkgate for award-winning ice-cream at Nicholls, then continue on through the birdlife haven of (recently reopened) Burton Marshes and cross the border into Cheshire and on to the Chester Greenway. Alternatively, follow the inland route at Neston to Willaston for eats and refreshments at Pollard’s Inn. Both West Kirby and Chester have regular direct trains to Liverpool.Matt LuntThis article was corrected on Friday 30 July.

Now, they’re merely a route into a circuit where contestants bounce from one programme to the next in search of juicy headlinesThe veracity of reality TV programmes was, once upon a time, a major sticking point for viewers. If we caught out contestants with an obviously choreographed fight (the moves rarely change – a pointed insult before a splash of wine in the face), it was almost grounds to contact Ofcom. Now, though, we barely bat an eyelid at their flagrant falseness. The producers are practically characters on the shows, so obvious is their presence.Each time we settle in for an episode of The Only Way Is Essex (Towie), the opening sequence reminds us that, while all the people are real, “some of what they do may have been plucked, plumped, trimmed” or whatever other beauty-based pun Denise van Outen uses to mean “heavily scripted”. The final scene of MTV’s The Hills notoriously owned its viewers with a direct nod to its fabrication, the cameras panning away from a brooding Brody Jenner to reveal that he was standing on a backlot, with the lights, camera and action of Tinseltown surrounding him. Everything from the trees to the Hollywood sign were revealed to be fake, inferring that the stories we had been following for four years were, too.Watching these shows no longer requires the suspension of belief: now, there is outright agreement that the “reality” in the title is purely decorative. One show that barely bothers to uphold any notion that the events are taking place in our world is Celebs Go Dating. When it launched in 2016, we expected action that would have real-life ramifications, with a cohort of unlucky-in-love personalities dating members of the public. While it seemed unlikely that every contestant would find someone to join them happily ever after in the Daily Mail’s showbiz section, the show really has proved little more than a PR exercise. Four years and eight series in, not one couple is still standing – but there have been plenty of articles off the back of it for all involved.It goes without saying that the recent cast of Love Island signed up in the hopes of, at the very least, accruing a social media following the size of a small province. But a romantic relationship of some sort is still considered at least a byproduct of appearing on the show, even if cast members regularly voice disbelief at finding love on a show supposedly engineered for the purpose. With Celebs Go Dating, however, neither the celebs nor the viewers seems to have any expectation that anyone will leave with a partner. Unlike Love Island, the show has never pretended its aims go beyond self-promotion. It almost entirely comprises reality TV stars who became famous for stints on other reality shows.Of the cast members on the current Celebs Go Virtual Dating, Pete Wicks hails from Towie, Chloe Ferry from Geordie Shore and Shaughna Phillips from Love Island, while the fourth – professional rugby player Levi Davis – is best known from his stint last year on Celebrity X Factor. It is Wicks’s second time on the show and he is not the only repeat performance – Chloe Sims, Joey Essex and Sam Thompson have all come back for more, never finding “love” (which is not surprising as it is not what they came on for). In the series before, of the eight celebrities, six were from reality TV shows. Every year a Towie alumni is cast – usually two at a time.Celebs Go Dating, like other shows of its ilk, exists primarily as a recycling bin for reality stars. It is a television genre in itself, seemingly created to sustain those whose CVs consist only of similar programming.

Officials have said that the recent infections involve a new strain of the virus that has originated outside of the country, and which seemed to be more virulent.So far, 30 cases of the virus have been detected in or around Da Nang, while two cases have been confirmed in Ho Chi Minh City, and one has been reported in both Hanoi and Central Highlands. There are growing fears that tens of thousands of people holidaying in the coastal city of Da Nang may have transported the virus across the country over recent weeks.“We have to act more swiftly and more fiercely in order to control the outbreak,” the state broadcaster VTV reported Phuc as telling a meeting of government officials. He said tourist hubs throughout the country should increase vigilance.The Covid-19 pandemic is currently unfolding in “one big wave” with no evidence that it follows seasonal variations common to influenza and other coronaviruses, such as the common cold, the\u0026nbspWorld Health Organization\u0026nbsphas warned.Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u0026nbsp1918 influenza pandemic\u0026nbspthat killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics. Until now that had been what was expected from Covid-19.How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u0026nbspresurgence in infections\u0026nbspdespite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u0026nbspcramped dormitory accommodation\u0026nbspused by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.In June 2020, Beijing suffered from a new cluster of coronavirus cases which caused authorities to re-implement restrictions that China had previously been able to lift. In the UK, the city of Leicester was unable to come out of lockdown because of the development of a new spike of coronavirus cases. Clusters also emerged in Melbourne, requiring a re-imposition of lockdown conditions.Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.However Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, says “‘Second wave’ isn’t a term that we would use at the current time, as the virus hasn’t gone away, it’s in our population, it has spread to 188 countries so far, and what we are seeing now is essentially localised spikes or a localised return of a large number of cases.”\u0026nbspThe overall threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune iniduals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry is that with\u0026nbspa vaccine still many months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.The government is evacuating 80,000 people from Da Nang, mostly tourists who had been taking advantage of discounted travel deals, who will be required to isolate at home. The city has been placed under strict lockdown, with flights suspended.VTV reported that the cases in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City were linked to the cluster in Da Nang.Life in Vietnam had been returning to normal, with many people no longer wearing face masks and domestic tourism booming, but the country is again on high alert. In Hanoi, authorities are tracing people who may have had close contact with a man who works in a pizza restaurant and who is suspected of having Covid-19. Barriers have been placed near to the man’s home, while the restaurant and local area have been disinfected.In Ho Chi Minh City, a hotel has been locked down and a nearby hospital in Binh Tan district has stopped receiving patients for three days, after two suspected Covid-19 cases emerged.About 18,000 tourists who had been in Da Nang have returned to Ho Chi Minh City, officials said on Tuesday. Hanoi authorities had earlier said they were expecting 15,000 to 20,000 to return from the city.The country responded with speed and agility to the pandemic earlier this year, deploying aggressive contact-tracing systems and quarantine measures – avoiding a major outbreak. Despite sharing a border with China, Vietnam has recorded 446 450 Covid-19 cases, and no fatalities.This figure does not include 140 construction workers infected with Covid-19 who were evacuated from Equatorial Guinea on Wednesday, and who will be treated at a hospital outside Hanoi.The source of the new cases is not clear, though the government has responded with a series of arrests linked to illegal immigration.

It comes as global cases passed 17m, after five of the last seven days saw one-day jumps of more than 250,000 new infections.The 723 new cases announced by the Victorian premier Daniel Andrews marked the 25th consecutive day of triple-digit increases in Australia’s second most populous state. Ten of the 13 deaths are believed to be connected to aged care homes. Australia’s previous deadliest day was Sunday, when 10 people were reported to have died.In response to the record high, Andrews announced that from midnight on Thursday, people living in several regional districts south-west of Melbourne would no longer be allowed any visitors to their homes. Andrews also mandated the wearing of face coverings outside home for the entire state, from this Sunday.In the state of Queensland, meanwhile, two coronavirus-infected Brisbane teenagers who dodged quarantine after returning from Victoria will face court, as the state braces itself for a possible outbreak of community transmission. The 19-year-olds returned from Melbourne via Sydney but allegedly lied on their border declaration form to avoid having to quarantine at their own expense in a hotel. A third woman travelled with them, but at this stage has tested negative to the virus and remains in quarantine.The actions of the women has sparked a massive tracing mission for Queensland Health. Shopping centres, restaurants, a school, a church, and aged care centres have been closed. A third woman – the sister of one of the teens – has also tested positive to the illness.Australia’s most populous state of New South Wales reported 18 new coronavirus cases overnight, and a Sydney correctional facility underwent deep cleaning after a prisoner tested positive. The inmate had recently been in Victoria and was arrested for driving offences before being bail refused.Elsewhere in the Asia Pacific region, Japan will from next week lift a ban on the re-entry of some foreign residents, imposed to limit the spread of coronavirus, the foreign ministry has announced. Up to 90,000 foreign nationals with residence permits, including students, business people and trainees, are currently stuck outside Japan after authorities banned re-entry from more than 100 countries in response to the pandemic.The United States meanwhile, which continues to have by far the highest number of cases and deaths, passed 150,000 fatalities late on Wednesday, according to Johns Hopkins University figures.California, Florida and Texas, the three largest US states, all set one-day records for fatalities from Covid-19 on Wednesday, a Reuters tally showed, and the Miami-area school district said students would not return to classrooms when the new academic year begins.The US has registered 10,000 deaths over the past 11 days, the fastest surge since early June, prompting heated debate about the best course forward.

In the latest week for which data has been published, from 16 to 22 July, 366,397 people were newly tested in hospitals, care homes and the community, and just over 4,000 were positive.But this falls considerably short of the number of new infections in England estimated by modellers, such as the MRC Biostatistics Unit in Cambridge, which published new data on Wednesday showing there were 3,000 a day – a figure similar to that produced by the Office of National Statistics.The deputy director, Dr Daniela De Angelis, told the  it was not possible to predict whether that number would go up or down over the summer. “If the track and trace programme was to work well, we could hope to keep new infections under control. But there are too many unknowns at the moment, including whether the programme is working, the pandemic abroad, the reopening of schools, and going back to workplaces. There are too many elements that we do not know the impact of to make any realistic guess,” she said.Neither the number of infections nor of deaths is heading for zero, which is of concern to both scientists and politicians, first as people travel abroad and then as the weather worsens into autumn and winter.The latest data from the programme shows that the numbers testing positive for coronavirus have increased for the third week in a row, from 3,800 to 3,900 to 4,100. Increased testing explains part of the rise, but infection rates in England and particularly in some cities and regions have also slightly increased.The main focus now is on getting more people tested. “I urge everybody to get a free test as soon as you experience coronavirus symptoms and to follow the advice you’re given if you are contacted by the service. If we all continue to play our part, then together we can stop the spread of this virus,” said Dido Harding, the chair of NHS test and trace.A public campaign to encourage testing is being launched on Thursday with a 60-second TV advert. Part of the new push is said to include the launch of the long-awaited contact tracing app, although there is still no date set.“The NHS test-and-trace service is a vital part of enabling us to get back to safely doing the normal things we love, and will become ever more important as we approach winter,” said Harding.“By working in partnership with local public health and local authority teams, we are already helping stop the spread of coronavirus across England, by reaching over 200,000 people who may have been at risk of passing it on.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e67be67b569853d60a1802281133552860e5595/122_946_4710_2827/master/4710.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2da7b6775fe928c2aaf41b5458952223","title":"i can see the despair on their faces lebanons economy unravels","story":"Prices of most goods have nearly tripled and the value of the national currency is plummetingby  Martin Chulov Middle East correspondent. Photography by  Achilleas ZavallisFrom her wedding dress shop in the impoverished northern Lebanese town of Akkar, Suzanne Hammoud has been selling bridal gowns for more than 15 years. She has revelled in her customers’ excitement as their weddings approached, and often stayed in touch as their lives progressed, sometimes making outfits for their children.But this year, Hammoud has become more of a buyer than a seller of dresses. Sales racks are full of gowns she has bought back from families who have no other means of income left, except for selling their memories.“I’m buying their used dresses at cost,” she said. “I can see the despair on their faces, and I don’t have the heart to say no. Even the few brides who are still coming in have hopelessness in their eyes. When they used to come to us, I saw them happy and hopeful.”On the dusty high street of one of Lebanon’s poorest corners, and across all pockets of a country conditioned to hardship over decades of war and tumult, the effects of a catastrophic economic implosion are straining its social fabric. The resilient Lebanon that somehow always made it through is fast becoming a fable, and ghosts of a recent past are stirring again.The country has defaulted on one bond payment and a second is due soon. A fire sale of state assets is being mooted as a fallback. After that, there is little left to trade, except human capital, which is leaving Lebanon en masse.All the while, the political system blamed for much of the chaos remains at a standstill and reforms demanded of Lebanese leaders by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), in order to unlock aid, are being stonewalled because of the very threat they pose to a system built on patronage networks.To many who lived through the country’s civil war, it seemed things could never be as bad again. “But they are,” said Ibrahim Haddad, a commando officer in a Christian militia throughout the 15-year conflict, which was declared over in 1990. “The politicians now have learned nothing. They don’t know how to protect the country, or the martyrs. They have not earned respect.”Since 2004, Haddad has built and maintained a memorial garden for Christian fighters who died during Lebanon’s worst conflict. On a mountain top owned by the church, he has seeded the state’s emblematic cedar trees across manicured lawns, adorned with iconography and plaques commemorating each military unit. A chapel dug out of a giant rockface stands as a centrepiece.Dressed in military fatigues, the 63-year-old has devoted nearly every day of the past 16 years to tending the gardens, which appear as a statement of the status of Christians within Lebanon, as much as they are a tribute to their fallen.“This is our Arlington cemetery,” said Naji Khairallah, another veteran of the Lebanese Forces militia. “You won’t see anything like this elsewhere in Lebanon. It means a lot to us.”In his office, made of stone and iron doors wrought from a ship’s hull, Haddad added: “The Christians of Lebanon are not the Christians of Iraq, or Egypt. We know how to protect ourselves. We know how to fight.”Nearby, the two military leaders of the militia turned political bloc, which now holds a whip hand in Lebanese affairs, were buried under cutouts of their likenesses. Casualties from more distant battles with Israel were scattered around the still, silent room. Outside, the hustle of the new economic reality was being conducted in hushed phone calls in which the latest dollar rate was disclosed like a bookmaking racket. “It’s 9,200 to the dollar now,” said one exchange shop owner, of the dollar rate, which was pegged at 1,500 Lebanese lira before the crisis. “It will be lower tomorrow.”As controls on Lebanon’s financial system continue to weaken, the black market is eclipsing the formal economy. The government has been powerless, or unwilling, to stop the fall of the lira, and stymie a huge outflow of capital. Prices of food and clothes – almost all imported – are increasing daily, a trend amplified by the transfer of dollars to Syria to try to stabilise a similarly plunging currency.Up to $21bn (£16bn) has been drained from the country in the past year, financial experts say, by a political and commercial elite who oppose reforms that would replace patronage networks as pillars of political and economic life with merit-based appointments, a reined-in banking system, and a robust private sector.Alain Bifani, the director general of Lebanon’s finance ministry for 20 years until he quit in June in protest at flatlining negotiations with the IMF over terms of an international bailout, said: “We were very close to having those who benefit so much from the system having to contribute. And this would have undermined the system of power and privilege they had put in place and allowed a modern state to emerge.“But they got scared and they weren’t strong enough to take this step. They would not touch the happy few. Those who had benefited most wanted to throw the losses on the 5 million Lebanese, by taking over public infrastructure.“If you want to rebuild a state, you have to rebuild its assets. How do you do that if you dispose of everything?”In West Beirut’s Hamra Street, director of al-Madina theatre, Nidal Al Achkar, is sitting in a room surrounded by framed photos of actors. Power cuts have cast an eerie darkness over the normally bustling boulevard outside. The arc of chaos from the end of the civil war, to the beginning of what many see as an even greater existential crisis, troubles her. She has just reopened for business after closing down for six months.“When the war finished, they didn’t sit around a table and ask themselves questions,” she said. “So, all these people started ruling the country again, and nobody stopped them. And this time they started stealing.“Money, power and religion, they have worked together for hundreds of years. If one falls, the other will pick them up. It’s a world built on sectarianism and family traditions, not ideas that look to the future, but those that tie them to the past.“This city of Beirut has no hope any more. There is no trust. They have nothing to dream about. What are we going to dream, what are we going to eat, when is the electricity going to come, how much is a kilo of tomatoes?”How Lebanon got to this point seems less important to many than where it is inexorably heading. Throughout 77 years of nominal independence, the country’s regional political alliances have been even more central to its fate than its internal rivalries. That dynamic has become increasingly potent, with Lebanese officials having lost credibility among key backers, who would had delivered bailout dollars during earlier crises, but are in no mood to do so now.The 2016 election by MPs of the Maronite Christian and Iran ally Michel Aoun as president, allowing the Iran-backed Hezbollah to join the government – making the group the country’s strongest political presence – soured ties with Saudi Arabia, particularly with the then Lebanese prime minister, Saad Hariri.“The causes have added up,” said Michel Moawad, a prominent MP. “It was a big geopolitical position for the country to take to isolate itself and become part of the Iranian axis, while the economy is dollarised and our partners are the Arab world and the west. We lost our main investors and economic partners. The business model of the country was broken.”When anti-government demonstrations erupted last October, communal and confessional differences that had been often seen as faultlines in Lebanon were subsumed by a soaring patriotism.Suha Barakat, 26, a protester in central Beirut for the six weeks of demonstrations, said it was the most important time of her life. “I believed,” she said. “And I still want to believe. But I came back to Lebanon from Dubai for this, and now I’m stuck. I hope we’re not just tribal after all.”Last Saturday, at his palace in the Chouf mountains, Walid Jumblatt, the Druze leader and a civil war figure who remains a lynchpin of the ruling elite, was addressing Druze sheikhs about the crises facing the community and country.Jumblatt paused, then responded: “We’re at the end of world war one, a time of looming famine and dreadful Spanish flu. We were buying grain from Syria, and locusts were plaguing the land.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36e9a1c783069dc7eb6ff6cfd23e268fc7aca7e7/0_89_2880_1728/master/2880.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=841370a935927305d98688b7ccdf24b0","title":"nicola sturgeon statistics chief rebukes sturgeon claim covid 19 five times lower in scotland than england","story":"Claim not based on verifiable data and should not have been made, says Ed Humpherson Nicola Sturgeon has been censured by the UK’s chief statistician after using incomplete and unpublished data to claim the coronavirus was five times less prevalent in Scotland than in England.Ed Humpherson, the director general of the Office for Statistics Regulation, said the first minister’s claims earlier in July were not based on comparable or published data, and should not have been made. “The sources used to underpin this claim have been difficult to identify,” he told Sturgeon’s government.In an official letter to Roger Halliday, the Scottish government’s chief statistician, Humpherson said he did not believe the sources used by Sturgeon were robust enough, after an investigation into complaints about her statements.Sturgeon was pressed by Jackson Carlaw, the Scottish Conservative leader, to accept that this was a “damning verdict” by the UK’s chief statistician. Carlaw said it raised questions about the first minister’s warnings earlier this month that she may need to close the border with England.Humpherson’s criticisms proved that voters, the media and MSPs “were repeatedly misled on this fact, and she should apologise”, Carlaw told Holyrood.Sturgeon said she accepted Humpherson’s criticisms about using unpublished data, but deflected Carlaw’s attacks on her use of the data and its accuracy. She said it was clear the prevalence rate in Scotland was significantly lower than in England. There had been 2,000 deaths of people confirmed to have Covid-19 in England in the last month, compared with nine in Scotland.Sturgeon said earlier this month she was worried that Scotland could be put at risk because of “shambolic” policies on foreign travel and air bridges, which were being pushed by ministers in England.On 3 July, she said she would resist pressure to agree quickly to the UK government’s proposals for quarantine-free travel from other countries with low infection rates, because she wanted to ensure that Scotland’s steep decline in Covid-19 cases was protected.“When so much is at stake, as it is right now, we can’t allow ourselves to be dragged along in the wake of another government’s – to be quite frank about it – shambolic decision-making process,” she said then. “We assess that the prevalence of the virus in Scotland, right now, is five times lower than it is in England. Northern Ireland actually faces a similar issue.” The Covid-19 pandemic is currently unfolding in “one big wave” with no evidence that it follows seasonal variations common to influenza and other coronaviruses, such as the common cold, the\u0026nbspWorld Health Organization\u0026nbsphas warned.Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u0026nbsp1918 influenza pandemic\u0026nbspthat killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first.

The Scottish government had used Scottish modelling by its experts and compared it with unpublished modelling from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, which used a UK figure as a proxy for England. It then used other data from the Office for National Statistics, which was based on a different time period and estimates than the Scottish data.Humpherson said Sturgeon should have shared the sources and justification for her comparison because it used unpublished data. “There are lessons to be learned in this case, with different data sources being quoted to the media and to us. We expect that any figures used are appropriately sourced, explained and available in the public domain,” he said. In a further letter about the figures, David Norgrove, chair of the UK Statistics Authority, told Tory MSP Miles Briggs the sources given by the Scottish government to justify Sturgeon’s assertion “do not allow for a meaningful comparison to be made”.

Therefore, this change of advice from the CMOs, aimed to reduce coronavirus transmission, is particularly timely and welcome.”He warned, though, that families would need extra help if they would set to lose income or have difficulties shopping for food and essentials for longer.Dr Julian Tang, honorary associate professor in respiratory sciences at the University of Leicester, said: “The evidence for this 10-day rather than seven-day cut-off has been around for some months already – and more and more studies confirm this.“There have been concerns about the former seven-day isolation cut-off for sometime now – because it just didn’t tally with the evidence. Finally, now it does.”Prof Peter Openshaw from Imperial College London and the British Society for Immunology welcomed the extension to 10 days, “given some hints of resurgence”.It is clear people are most infectious just before and a couple of days after they show symptoms, he said, but recent work has shown they may have infectious virus up to nine days after the onset.“We are now in a critical stage of controlling the disease. Keeping infection rates low is vital and extending the period of isolation to 10 days brings us in line with some other European countries. It seems to be a sensible precaution to keep pressure on the virus while other measures to control the spread of Sars-CoV-2 are developed,” he said.In a statement, the four chief medical officers for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, said: “In symptomatic people Covid-19 is most infectious just before, and for the first few days after symptoms begin. It is very important people with symptoms self-isolate and get a test, which will allow contact tracing.“Evidence, although still limited, has strengthened and shows that people with Covid-19 who are mildly ill and are recovering have a low but real possibility of infectiousness between seven and nine days after illness onset.“We have considered how best to target interventions to reduce risk to the general population and consider that at this point in the epidemic, with widespread and rapid testing available and considering the relaxation of other measures, it is now the correct balance of risk to extend the self-isolation period from seven to 10 days for those in the community who have symptoms or a positive test result.“This will help provide additional protection to others in the community. This is particularly important to protect those who have been shielding and in advance of the autumn and winter when we may see increased community transmission.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/118eebefa76291893fc338aca184350b76cb7bec/0_0_4893_2937/master/4893.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8c48a609c8f984e984c088e16ed20e2","title":"scaled down hajj begins in coronavirus era in pictures","story":"Attendance limited to 10,000 people already residing in Saudi Arabia, rather than the usual 2 million including from abroad, amid Covid-19 restrictions"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8989d521b54181fce419554c0e6ec7c12ce45ce7/295_0_4783_2872/master/4783.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca9603fde7316c0db8e495295e9e243c","title":"uk coronavirus live news covid 19 latest updates isolation period","story":"Data comparing 29 European countries shows England had longest continuous period of excess mortality second wave ‘rolling across Europe’, says Hancock. That’s all from me for today.Our coronavirus coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. It’s here.The Ambassador Theatre Group (ATG), one of the biggest employers in British theatre, is to lay off more than 1,200 casual staff in September, with unions saying the delay in releasing the £1.57bn arts recovery package continues to put jobs at risk, my colleague Lanre Bakare reports.The headlines from the ONS report into excess deaths in Europe have focused on England, because the main report treats the UK as four separate countries. It justifies this by saying that “each of the four nations of the UK has its own health services and policies, and has made different decisions around responses to the pandemic, such as the date and extent of implementation of lockdown measures” and that “it is therefore meaningful to report on each of the nations of the UK separately”.But the ONS has also produced data for the UK and this shows that, although England’s record is worse than the UK’s as a whole, the UK’s was worse than any other country too in the relevant period.The figure for the UK in week 22 was 6.9. The figure for Spain, the country with the next highest total, was 6.65.Here is a chart from the ONS report showing all countries in order in week 19 (the week ending 8 May) and week 22. This shows that in week 19, Spain had the worst record (when it was ahead of both England and the UK), but that by week 22 England and the UK were both ahead of Spain.The data for week 24, which is in the tables but not highlighted in the main report, shows that by then England and the UK were in an even worse position in relation to other European countries. Spain was still in second place, with an rcASMR of 6, but England’s was 7.61, and the UK’s was 6.94 – both higher than two weeks earlier. (The rcASMR can go down as the year goes on if death rates in a country fall below the long-term average.) Jackson Carlaw has resigned suddenly as the Scottish Conservatives’ leader, claiming he is not the right person to lead his party into the forthcoming Holyrood elections.Hours after a combative session at first minister’s questions, Carlaw issued a statement saying he had reached “a simple if painful conclusion” over the last few weeks that the Scottish party needed a new and better leader.Carlaw only became leader in February, after a drawn-out campaign to replace his predecessor, Ruth Davidson, a pro-European who quit last year rather than work with Boris Johnson. In the last few weeks I have reached a simple if painful conclusion – that I am not, in the present circumstances, the person best placed to lead that case over these next vital months in Scottish politics prior to the Holyrood elections.Given the importance I attach to the job, I’ve therefore decided to stand down with immediate effect.According to a snap poll by YouGov, there is overwhelming public support for the decision today to tell people with coronavirus symptoms to self-isolate for 10 days, not seven days.Public Health England has published its latest weekly excess mortality report for England. It’s here.It says there have been 53,857 excess deaths in England since 20 March.This is a more accurate guide to the impact of coronavirus on England than the headline NHS England figure produced every afternoon, which only covers hospital deaths for people who have tested positive for coronavirus.

The valley is managed by conservation charity Woodland Trust Northern Ireland which uses transects to investigate changes in habitats rather than simply estimating the number of organisms within it. Pam Hardeman, a volunteer with the Trust, found the elusive butterfly and recorded the sighting. “I was over the moon to find a purple hairstreak. I was actually photographing a speckled wood that had landed close by when it flew in and landed on a bramble leaf,” she said. “It was quite a breezy but sunny afternoon so perhaps it was sheltering. I found it at the entrance to Killaloo woods right at end of my survey and I was so excited to find it.”The Woodland Trust aims to provide “havens for wildlife” and protect ancient and create new native woodlands. The charity said finding the purple hairstreak in the Faughan Valley reinforces “how vital it is to protect our green spaces so that bioersity continues to thrive”.Butterfly Conservation Northern Ireland are currently encouraging the public to record any sightings of butterflies during the annual Butterfly Count which runs from July 17th to August 9th. Bronagh Gallagher, site manager for the Faughan Valley said: “The Woodland Trust manages 50 sites across Northern Ireland so there are plenty of outdoor spaces to go and look for wildlife you can even look for butterflies in your own garden.”"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

File photograph: Alan BetsonA pet food factory employing hundreds of staff in Co Kildare has been shut down after a number of employees contracted Covid-19. Irish Dog Foods took the decision to close its plant in Naas last Friday after the outbreak was discovered. A spokesman for the company would not disclose how many workers have tested positive for the disease or exactly when it was discovered. However the State’s acting chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn said on Thursday there had been 30-40 cases at the plant.Those infected are in quarantine while the company is working with the Health Service Executive (HSE) to manage the outbreak. Some 200 workers are usually based at the plant, where the company said it had a raft of public health measures in place - including social distancing and temperature checks - to combat any spread of the virus. “Irish Dog Foods have been informed that a number of our employees in Naas have tested positive for CoronavirusCovid-19,” the company spokesman said. “The iniduals involved are now self isolating and we remain in contact with them to ensure they have the support they require.“We are working closely with the HSE and will continue to follow their advice at all times in how we manage this issue. “In consultation with the HSE, we have closed the facility in question to enable a deep cleaning to be carried out.”The spokesman said staff well-being and safety is paramount for the company and that it had “a full range of measures in place including appropriate PPE (personal protection equipment), enhanced cleaning and hygiene regimes, social distancing measures, temperature screening and regular staff health and hygiene training and communications to help combat the virus.”Irish Dog Foods is part of the Queally Group, which also owns Dawn Fresh Foods. Founded in the mid-1990s, the company produces pet foods and treats at five manufacturing facilities for the Irish and overseas markets.The outbreak comes as an infectious diseases expert warned that Ireland is in the midst of a “multitude of second ripples” of Covid-19 which will continue for some time.Professor Sam McConkey, head of the department of international health and tropical Medicine at the Royal College of Surgeons Ireland, suggested the “ripples” - rather than a second wave - could be contained with strict public health measures.“We are having little outbreaks in a building site here, in another workplace there... we are already seeing multiple second ripples, and we need in place really effective ways of getting testing, getting contact tracing done and maintaining the strict self isolation and then changes to the workplace and changes to people’s activity so people don’t spread it.”Mr McConkey said the ripples of infection “unfortunately will continue” for some time.His assessment follows remarks this week by Margaret Harris, spokeswoman for the World Health Organisation, that the pandemic is “going to be one big wave” rather than a series of waves.“It’s going to go up and down a bit. The best thing is to flatten it and turn it into just something lapping at your feet,” she said.Mr McConkey told RTÉ’s Today with Sarah McInerney on Wednesday if people in Ireland “keep on message and do what we have all been asked to do” then it may be possible “to have a good life, with schools and pubs and socialising going on, without a massive increase in the virus.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"While the \u0026lsquoR\u0026rsquo number remains below 1, Ireland is facing \u0026lsquoa rapidly evolving situation\u0026rsquo\u0026lsquoOne day we hope she wakes up and doesn\u0026rsquot remember,\u0026rsquo daughter tells the courtButterfly Conservation Northern Ireland encourages public to record sightingsSome 200 workers are usually based at the Irish Dog Foods plant in NaasTD voted against Residential Tenancies Bill but wants to remain in parliamentary partyLocal boat operators express disappointment at OPW decisionList of countries deemed safe to travel to will be reviewed next week, Government saysDigital exhibition launched to tell stories of survivors of mother and baby home in GalwayCourt rejects test cases by three children concerning the assessment processProjections show flooding could have far-reaching negative effects globally by 2100People with coronavirus in UK must now self-isolate for 10 rather than seven daysNumbers held for drink driving increase during lockdown despite sharp drop in trafficState argues sentence of Patrick Nevin, who attacked three women in 11 days, was too lenientPerseverance due to land at base of former lake from 3.5 billion years agoControversy surrounds gathering of information from people in relation to Pandemic Unemployment PaymentMajor clean-up in town after businesses in the centre left under waterSam McConkey: \u0026lsquoThat would be a national disaster.

The latest figures from the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) confirm the extent of sharp rises in infection rates in Gibraltar, Monaco and Malta since July 21st, based on cases per 100,000 people over 14 days. As of Wednesday, cases in Malta have increased to 6.9 per 100,000, compared to Ireland, which is currently at 5.3.Monaco has seen an 800 per cent increase to 27 per 100,000 while Gibraltar has increased from 2.9 to 17.8. Other countries on the green list, announced late on July 21st last, which have seen an increase include Cyprus from 3.9 to 5.1, Italy from 4.6 to 5.2, Lithuania from 3.8 to to 5.4 and Slovakia from 3.9 to 5.4. People arriving into the State from countries on the green list do not need to spend 14 days in self-isolation or to restrict their movements.Countries on the list which have seen an increase, but whose cases per 100,000 people are less than 3 include Finland, Greenland, Hungary and Norway. Estonia, Greece, Latvia and San Marino, which are also on the green list, have seen cases per 100,000 decrease since July 21st. It was confirmed on Wednesday that the Government is unlikely to review the countries on its green list in spite of some states experiencing big increases. The Government is to stick to a fortnightly review of countries considered safe to travel to. The list was drawn up at a Cabinet meeting on July 21st based on advice from the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet), and it will be August 4th at the earliest before it will re-examine the list. A Government spokesperson said the locations on the green list have a “similar or lower incidence of the virus to Ireland”. “A number of factors are taken into account - such as the number of new cases over the past 14 days per 100,000 of inhabitants, overall response to Covid-19 etc. “Data from the European Centre of Disease Control which benchmarks countries based on the number of positive tests per 100,000 in the last 14 days is being used,” the spokesperson said. Meanwhile, the latest data shows that cases in Spain stand at 51.1 per 100,000 cases, Portugal is at 32.7 France is at 17.1, while the UK is at 14. The United States of America’s cases per 100,000 currently stands at 279.7.

Photograph: Tolga AkmenAFPGettyConcerns that big British businesses such as Tesco will be deterred from trading in Northern Ireland after Brexit have been raised in the House of Lords.Lord Kerr, the architect of article 50 which enabled the UK to exit the EU, has warned that the special arrangements put in place to avoid a border on the island of Ireland may be a fatal trade barrier for some companies.Under the Northern Ireland protocol, all businesses sending goods to the region from Great Britain will have to make formal declarations for the first time, with food sellers such as supermarkets subject to separate checks on chilled and fresh food from January.“How confident are you that GB businesses are just not going to write off the Northern Ireland market?” he asked the Northern Ireland minister Robin Walker who was appearing before the Lords EU committee.Just three weeks ago the first details of the new trading conditions across the Irish Sea emerged, with businesses obliged to complete three rounds of customs, security and transit forms on all goods being transported to Northern Ireland.Mr Walker said the government intended the new system to be “light touch” and streamlined.However, he faced further questions about the government’s preparedness with Lord Teverson questioning whether the new IT system, the Goods Vehicle Movement System, would be tested in time.And the former Conservative chancellor Lord Lamont challenged Boris Johnson’s repeated assertion that Northern Ireland businesses would continue to enjoy “unfettered access” to Great British markets.Lord Lamont argued there was a clear conflict in the Brexit protocol between article 5, which demands Northern Ireland businesses complete exit summary declarations for all goods being transported to the rest of the UK, and article 6, which promises “unfettered access”.“That is a rather awkward thing,” he told Mr Walker as he defended the government position, saying it was within the UK’s gift to ensure unfettered access.Mr Walker conceded that some of the detail of the protocol had yet to be agreed by the joint committee chaired by Michael Gove and the vice-president of the European Commission, Maroš Šefcovic.He also said details on the Northern Ireland border operating model, expected yesterday, would be published in the “coming weeks”. - "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4317119.1596058117!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"second shock of brexit may be too much for ireland to cope with coveney told","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney  has been warned that Ireland is ‘facing into Brexit from a fundamentally different economic starting point than for a no-deal Brexit in 2019’. Photograph:  Niall CarsonPA Households and businesses may not have the capacity to withstand a second economic shock as a result of a hard Brexit at the end of the year, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has been warned, as the Government intensifies its planning for the UK’s departure from the EU.Given the economic damage already wrought by Covid-19, Mr Coveney has been warned that Ireland is “facing into Brexit from a fundamentally different economic starting point than for a no-deal Brexit in 2019”. In official briefing documents given to the Minister as he resumed office following the formation of Government, officials also told him that protecting the €85 billion trade link with Britain will be “vital to our overall economic recovery” and that Ireland needs to build a new relationship with the UK and with British cabinet ministers. Officials warned that “the capacity of households and businesses to manage a second economic shock will be more limited” in light of the pandemic. The Government is also hoping that a “landing zone” for major outstanding issues in Brexit talks can be found in September or October but, at present, the gap between the UK and the European Union remains “wide”. Contingency plansAll Government departments are intensifying Brexit contingency plans and a new Brexit Omnibus Bill will be brought to the Oireachtas after the summer recess. “The gap between the EU and UK positions remains wide, including on key issues such as the level playing field, fisheries, police and judicial co-operation and governance. “For progress to be achieved, it will be necessary for the UK position to move considerably in the direction of what they had agreed to under the political declaration. “The political declaration sets out the parameters for ‘an ambitious, broad, deep and flexible partnership’. However, in negotiations, the UK has adopted a significantly less ambitious approach,” the briefing says. The October European Council and discussions held in advance will be “crucial in identifying the landing zone for a possible agreement and on implementation of the protocol”. Officials have said that despite the continuing uncertainty on the future relationship between the UK and EU, the Irish Government should now work to develop a new relationship with the UK. “Driving a renewal of the relationship is a priority task, given its importance in terms of our joint stewardship of the Good Friday Agreement, our people-to-people relations, and the Ireland-Great Britain economic and trading relationship worth €85 billion per annum, the protection of which will be vital to our overall economic recovery.” It says, as part of that, “identifying how best to build relationships across the new British cabinet and wider political system will be important”. “In terms of immediate contacts, there has been good East-West communication on Covid responses, which could usefully continue. “Engagement to protect Irish interests will also continue to be necessary, as the final picture of the UK’s future relationship with the EU emerges.” Officials have recommended the establishment of a new consulate in the north of England.In terms of Ireland’s relationship with the US, officials said that “developing our bilateral relationship with the US will take place against the backdrop of difficult policy issues relating to immigration, trade and transatlantic relations”. It said EU Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan was “committed to progressing an EU-US trade deal and Ireland is well placed to play a role in this”. The Minister was also asked to focus on “close engagement with the Trump and Biden election campaigns in the lead-up to the November US presidential election”. On the relationship between Ireland and Canada, Mr Coveney was told that “ramping up the relationship with Canada will be a key component of our economic response to the disruption caused by the pandemic”.

This is evident in the US, where objectivity has become a matter of opinion. The plight of the federal government’s top infectious diseases expert Dr Anthony Fauci is the prime illustration of this. Photograph: Leah MillisReuters These are hard times for experts notably scientists and doctors who believe data (and their interpretation of it) should be allowed speak for itself and, where appropriate, prompt a response in the best interests of the human race or the world we live in. For those working on Covid-19 and climate change it can be particularly rough terrain.Global authorities in their field of endeavour should not be dismissed so easily, especially those with a record of fashioning effective responses to global crises such as AIDS, Ebola or an overheating planet – or who have added greatly to fundamental knowledge.Too often good science is countered by vitriol accusations of lack of independence and instant condemnation with “yes but...” from non-experts. This is evident in the US, where objectivity has become a matter of opinion. The plight of the federal government’s top infectious diseases expert Dr Anthony Fauci is the prime illustration of this.President Donald Trump, an exponent of anti-science, constantly adds to the cauldron of social media tyranny and displays little respect for those with greater knowledge than himself.His trade adviser Peter Navarro recently declared Fauci was “wrong about everything” – no doubt doing the bidding of his master a man who has never admitted a single mistake in office.The modern phenomenon goes beyond the US. The Irish environmentalist Prof Terry Hughes, an authority on decline of coral reef systems, highlighted on twitter a photograph of a protester whose placard read: “At the start of every disaster movie there is a scientist being ignored” – and added “I have a lot of friends who can relate to this.”This is everyday reality and complicating matters are pigheaded populist leaders, as illustrated this month when UK prime minister Boris Johnson indicated in parliament he had not read a Government-commissioned report warning of a second coronavirus wave next winter which could cost 120,000 lives. He then insisted unconvincingly he was aware of it.Fortunately science has a more prominent position within Irish society. There is widespread recognition of its merits while scientists engender a high level of trust. Strategic investment in a knowledge-based economy has helped. The response to the emerging pandemic, where the public heeded the recommendations of National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), is proof of this.Were it always so easy.“When you mix science and politics, you get politics,” according to John M Barry author of The Great Influenza: The Story of the Deadliest Pandemic in History. With the coronavirus, the US has proved politics hasn’t worked, he believes. So to “fully reopen both the economy and schools safely...we have to return to science”.The dynamic is different in Ireland though resolution is equally difficult to achieve, such is the deviousness of Covid-19. The politicians have to balance what the science is saying, economic consequences and wellbeing.Independent networkThis is typical of modern policy challenges facing governments characterised by a mixture of complexity, uncertainty and ambiguity. That is why there is a compelling case for an independent network of scientific advisers to advise government “on the formidable scientific challenges facing Ireland” as outlined by Royal Irish Academy president Dr Mary Canning.“Policymakers are increasingly confronted with highly complex policy issues requiring multiple forms of knowledge, including scientific insights, experiential knowledge and local perspectives,” she explained.This should be provided by a multi-disciplinary network of specialists in a similar way to NPHET but on a permanent basis. Just look what might be coming down the tracks: a flu pandemic a storm surge driven by a hurricane that heads for Ireland rather than the Caribbean, unprecedented sea level rise caused by melting Arctic ice sheets, and dramatic ageing of our population post 2050.The physicist and science communicator Brian Greene revealed the extent of his concern about the disconnect between specialists and the public when asked by the Financial Times, what is the greatest challenge of our time?He responded: “Many would focus on the most immediate: saving the planet from the devastation wrought by human activity. I’d like to add changing the mindset of the public to recognise that the tools of rational investigation, of science, are available to everyone – and have the capacity not only to radically transform the challenges we face, but also to realise enormous opportunities.

At Domino’s, we know there’s plenty of Australians named Karen that aren’t, well, ‘Karens’. Let us know if you\u0027re one of them by completing the form via the link below. We may send some pizza your way!”The form asked those named Karen to tell Domino\u0027s in 250 words how they were one of the “nice ones”.Domino’s head of marketing in the region, Allan Collins, said while introducing the offer that the name Karen “has become synonymous with anyone who is entitled, selfish and likes to complain.”“What used to be a light-hearted meme has become quite the insult to anyone actually named Karen… Well, today we\u0027re taking the name Karen back. At Domino\u0027s, we\u0027re all about bringing people together and we want to celebrate all the great Karens out there by shouting them a free pizza.”In New Zealand the offer was criticised as tone deaf, with some saying that ‘Karens’ do not face real oppression, and others noting that ‘Karens’ cause problems for retail and other service workers.Earlier this month, a Melbourne woman who threatened to sue hardware store Bunnings, after staff told her to wear a mask was dubbed “Bunnings Karen”.New Zealand Domino’s said their campaign “was one of inclusivity only”.“We want you to know that we are always listening and learning and when we get it wrong, we fix it.

The work it does is fundamental to this country’s heritage, he argued, and without it we’d all be the poorer – not just because there’d be fewer statelies to wander round, but because miles of our coastline and acres of our countryside would simply not be as beautiful as they are.Succumbing enjoyably to my middle-class destiny, I decided he was right. I duly signed up, forked out, and experienced both a pleasant frisson of nostalgia and a sense of finally having become a grown-up as I affixed the oak leaf sticker to the inside of the car window, before dragging my offspring off to complain their way around a country pile, then enjoy a reliably average cup of tea and piece of overpriced shortbread in a former stable.I thought of my friend at the weekend, when we used our family membership to go camping in the glorious grounds of Polesden Lacey, and again today, when I received an email from the Trust informing me that due to what its director general says is its “biggest crisis in living memory”, it is to shed 1,200 jobs to help plug a £200 million funding gap after having had to close all of its houses, gardens, car parks, shops and cafes thanks to Covid-19.There are no plans to mothball properties yet, although many remain shuttered: when we were there, the tall, elegant windows of Polesden Lacey remained darkened throughout there was no opportunity to briefly escape the elements (and the children) to wander through cool, beeswax-smelling interiors to be transported briefly back in time and marvel at the way people once lived.It’s pretty sobering stuff, even if you’re no fan of some of the more right-on moves of recent years. Strip away the beanbags and the political correctness and at its heart, what the National Trust does is irreplaceably important. My friend was right – we would all be the poorer without it.And yet, while the job losses are undoubtedly tragic, could this slimming down turn out to, in the end, be to the good? £40 million of the Trust’s savings are to be made in print marketing 160 shops and 10 cafes are to close. Do we really need to be showered with more leaflets when we visit a heritage property, or be forced to exit through the gift shop, held to ransom over a box of fudge? Perhaps if the National Trust must tighten its belt, we could see a stripping away of all the extraneous fripperies, so we can concentrate on what is really glorious about what it does. For that, I’ll keep paying my membership fee.Farewell to another constant in my life: the noisy, comforting, swaying buffet car on an LNER train journey north. On every regular trip to my homeland, part of the ritual was choosing when, exactly, to make the endless, undulating journey up the length of the train (to take my handbag, or leave it to the fate of the gods?), usually only to find I’d gone the wrong way and have to sway my way back again, all in pursuit of a bacon sandwich and a cuppa. The brief bit of core exercise broke up the monotony, but I’m quite taken by the idea of being able to order food directly to my seat – a small taste of how the other half live, without having to buy a first class ticket.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/07/30/12/nasa-launch.jpg","title":"california earthquake nasa space agency mars launch rocket 2020 today","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.The earthquake has not caused a delay to the launchNasa\u0027s facilities have been hit by an earthquake in California as it prepares for its mission to Mars.The earthquake, which took place only one mile from San Fernando in California, does not appear to have caused any delay to the launch, which is happening on the other coast of the US, in Florida.But facilities that will be key to the launch, including Nasa\u0027s Jet Propulsion Laboratory – which is based in California – were affected by the 4.5 magnitude earthquake.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt hit while reporters were interviewing engineer and project manager MiMi Aung about the helicopter that is set to be released by the Perseverance rover once it lands on Mars.The Martian atmosphere is 99 percent less dense than on Mars, and the gravity is 38 percent weaker, which makes flying a helicopter a particularly challenging task. Potential uses of the helicopter could include scouting ahead of human explorers and  investigating caves and craters. It could also be used to carry small payloads across the planet.Life could exist beneath the surface of Mars, study claimsBy the way, we just had an earthquake in this room, MiMi Aung said. Although objects were rattled, but there has been no significant effects on the launch of the rocket.On Nasa\u0027s livestream, Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine noted it was lucky that the rocket was not launching from Vandenberg Air Force Base, which is also in California and has seen Nasa launches before.Many viewers commented on Twitter that the earthquake was a benefit, as it woke them up in time to watch the Perseverance mission launch.Nasa can only go to Mars once every 26 months, so missing this launch window would mean a cost of half a billion dollars to maintain the rover before it could launch again.The trip to Mars had already been delayed twice before, because of contamination problems and issues with a crane at the pad.More news can be found on The Independent\u0027s liveblog of the launch.The Nasa mission will send the rover Perseverence to search for traces of potential alien life.The car-sized six-wheeled robotic rover, ]will launch atop an Atlas 5 rocket from the Boeing-Lockheed joint venture United Launch Alliance.Officials indicated that all systems appeared ready to go ahead of the launch, with weather forecasts from the Air Force\u0027s 45th Weather Squadron remaining at an 80 percent probability of launch and fuelling preparations underway for the rocket.Perseverance is due to land at the base of an 820-foot-deep (250 meters) crater called Jezero, a former lake from 3.5 billion years ago that scientists suspect could bear evidence of potential past microbial life on Mars. Scientists have long debated whether Mars - once a much more hospitable place than it is today - ever harboured life.Why Nasa\u0027s new Mars rover will be its best yetWater is considered a key ingredient for life, and the Martian surface billions of years ago had lots of it on the surface before the planet became a harsh and desolate outpost.However, scientists are unsure whether alien life could have survived in the water. Although the waters in Martian lakes appear to have a similar pH to that in Earth\u0027s oceans, other scientists have argued that it would be far too cold for life to survive.One of the most complex manoeuvres in Perseverance\u0027s journey will be what mission engineers call the “seven minutes of terror,” when the robot endures extreme heat and speeds during its descent through the Martian atmosphere, deploying a set of supersonic parachutes before igniting mini rocket engines to gently touch down on the planet\u0027s surface.It is the latest launch from Earth to Mars during a busy month of July, following probes sent by the United Arab Emirates and China.Aboard Perseverance is a four-pound (1.8 kg) autonomous helicopter named Ingenuity that is due to test powered flight on Mars for the first time.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In a joint statement, they said the change was needed because of the “low but real possibility of infectiousness” up to 10 days.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesExperts welcomed the increased self-isolation period and said the previous seven-day requirement was “too short”.“This change is important,” said Dr Shaun Fitzgerald, a visiting professor at the Royal Academy of Engineering at the University of Cambridge.“Given that there is now stronger evidence which shows a real possibility of infectiousness between seven and nine days after illness onset, 10 days isolation seems very sensible.”What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyThe move brings the UK in line with other countries such as Australia, South Africa and Switzerland.Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at UEA, said: “One of the big problems with determining how long people should self-isolate after developing symptoms that are consistent with Covid-19 is that PCR tests on nose and throat swabs can remain positive for several weeks after onset of symptoms.“However, this does not mean that people will remain infectious for that period. Indeed we know that in many cases where people are PCR positive it is not possible to culture the virus from those samples and so it is reasonable to assume they are not infectious.”He said one study which is yet to be peer reviewed found the median time someone was infectious was eight days after the onset of symptoms, with a probability of isolating infected iniduals was less than 5 per cent when symptoms lasted 12.2 days or more.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is very important people with symptoms self-isolate and get a test, which will allow contact tracing.“Evidence, although still limited, has strengthened and shows that people with Covid-19 who are mildly ill and are recovering have a low but real possibility of infectiousness between seven and nine days after illness onset.“We have considered how best to target interventions to reduce risk to the general population and consider that at this point in the epidemic, with widespread and rapid testing available and considering the relaxation of other measures, it is now the correct balance of risk to extend the self-isolation period from seven to 10 days for those in the community who have symptoms or a positive test result.“This will help provide additional protection to others in the community. This is particularly important to protect those who have been shielding and in advance of the autumn and winter when we may see increased community transmission.”Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Though that left engineers surprised – and prompted remarks about how, alongside the coronavirus outbreak, events seem to have made the rover\u0027s name especially apposite – the rocket took off right on time.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAfter some anxious minutes during which the rocket fired the spacecraft into space, and then onto a trajectory for Mars, as mission controllers waited for the spacecraft to power up with solar energy so that it could phone home, signals sent back from the spacecraft confirmed that it had safely launched and was on track for the Red Planet.It will now cruise to Mars until February, when it drops down onto the surface ready to look for evidence of alien life. Engineers said they were hoping that the journey would be quiet and boring, ahead of the stressful descent that will see the rover land on its surface.Nasa to launch mission to Mars –\u0026nbspfollow livePerseverance will travel 314 million miles over a period of nearly seven months attempting to land on a crater named Jezero. Only eight Nasa missions have successfully pulled off a descent to Mars, a feat that has been described as seven minutes of terror.The rover is Nasa\u0027s smartest and strongest yet, packed with a range of technologies intended to better understand the Martian landscape, and hunt for evidence of life. It is also packing a helicopter that will become the first ever craft sent by humans to fly across another planet.It is the third mission heading to the Red Planet this month after launches by the UAE and China.Satellite images suggest Jezero used to be a lake more than 3.5 billion years ago, when Mars was warmer and wetter.The crater houses rocks that contain clays and carbonates, which scientists believe may have the potential to preserve organic molecules that could provide evidence of past life.Along with several sophisticated instruments that will gather information about Mars\u0027 geology, atmosphere, environmental conditions and signs of life, the rover is also carrying a small 1.8kg helicopter.Called Ingenuity, the copter will fly short distances and marks the first attempt at powered, controlled flight on another planet.If successful, it could lead to more flying probes on other planets.Perseverance will also trial technologies to help astronauts make future expeditions to Mars.This includes testing a method for producing oxygen from the Martian atmosphere, and identifying other resources such as subsurface water.Meanwhile, scientists in the UK will help Perseverance select the Martian samples to be brought back to Earth.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas from fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Archaeologists have solved one of Stonehenge’s greatest mysteries — the precise source of the world-famous prehistoric temple’s largest stones.A new scientific breakthrough has, for the first time, allowed geologists to pinpoint almost exactly where Stonehenge’s giant stone uprights and lintels came from.Up until now, all that archaeologists knew with reasonable certainty was that the stones (a type of rock known as sarsen) had been brought in around 2500BC by the great temple’s Neolithic builders from the Marlborough Downs or immediately adjacent areas — a 75 sq miles area, 15-25 miles north of Stonehenge.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut now scientists from the University of Brighton have traced the stones to a small very specific two sq mile part of that range of hills — a patch of woodland just south of the village of Lockeridge, Wiltshire.In prehistoric and indeed later times, that area (now known as West Woods) seems to have been strewn with particularly large sarsen boulders, geochemically identical to those used to build Stonehenge.Humans reached Americas 11,000 years earlier than previously thoughtRecent detailed examination of the West Woods area by Reading University archaeologist, Katy Whitaker, suggests that the builders of Stonehenge probably chose it as their source of stone because of the exceptional sizes and relative flatness of many of its sarsen boulders.New archaeological research about the site has revealed that even 1200 years before Stonehenge was built, the West Woods area’s great sarsen slabs were used to construct a massive local prehistoric tomb.Now that the source of Stonehenge’s great stones has finally been identified, archaeological attention is likely to turn to discovering the precise route used by the monument’s prehistoric builders to move the giant 20-40tn stones from West Woods to Stonehenge (a distance of around 15 miles).There are two main options — an eastern route down the Wiltshire Avon Valley and a western route across Salisbury Plain.The western option would have involved a short segment where they would have had to haul the boulders up a 14 per cent gradient for around 300m.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailBut the eastern option would probably have involved hauling the giant stones (around 80 of them) for at least six miles along a river valley through relatively dense woodland and scrub. It would almost certainly not have been possible to use a raft on that river (the Wiltshire Avon) because the width of raft required to transport such large boulders would almost certainly have been much greater than the width of the river itself.On the balance of probabilities, it’s perhaps more likely that the builders of Stonehenge opted for the western route, despite the need to haul the stones up a hill.That route would have taken them south from West Woods across the southern part of the Marlborough Downs and down a very steep hill into the Vale of Pewsey. They would then have taken what was perhaps an already ancient trackway past (or indeed through) a huge prehistoric ritual and ceremonial complex (at Marden) across the river Avon and then up onto Salisbury Plain.It was that ascent onto Salisbury Plain, which involved the only moderately steep part of the journey (the 14 per cent gradient). Then they would have crossed the relatively flat and unforested plain to Stonehenge itself.If they did opt for this, on balance easier, western route, then the fact that they (and their massive stones) would have passed by or through the Marden ritual complex is potentially significant.In architectural terms, Stonehenge was destined to be the most impressive religious complex in Neolithic Britain — but Marden may well have been the biggest.Archaeological investigations over recent years (led by archaeologist, Dr Jim Leary, now of the University of York) have revealed that the Marden complex consisted of three great monuments — a vast 500m diameter banked enclosure north of the River Avon, a huge roughly 20m tall, 70m diameter ceremonial mound in the centre of that enclosure — and another banked enclosure, south of the river, surrounded by a 100m diameter circle of massive 1m diameter wooden “obelisks”.Having discovered the source of the giant stones of Stonehenge, archaeologists may soon be in in a position to make another potentially significant discovery about more than 100 fragments of sarsen stone found at Marden.In deploying the same scientific techniques used to pinpoint the source of the Stonehenge sarsens, scientists may ultimately be able to discover where the Marden fragments came from. Detailed preliminary examination of those enigmatic fragments will begin later this year.Those fragments appear to have been gathered together in the Marden ritual complex at around the same time that the Stonehenge sarsens may have been passing through that monument.So if it were ultimately to turn out that the Marden fragments came from West Woods, then it is conceivable that those fragments may have been removed from Stonehenge-bound sarsen boulders — potentially to shape them (and thus reduce their weight) prior to their ascent onto Salisbury Plain.Sarsen stone, the type of rock used to build Stonehenge and Avebury stone circle, may well have been regarded as profoundly mysterious by prehistoric people — because they normally only occur as loose or semi-buried boulders, completely unconnected to any bedrock. Indeed, the bedrock in the Marlborough Downs is chalk — so the presence (back in the Neolithic) of hundreds of thousands of often huge boulders composed of an obviously totally different type of stone (sometimes even arranged in straight lines across the landscape) would have been seen by prehistoric people as unusual.Worldwide, anomalous stones have often been regarded by many cultures as spiritually and physically interchangeable with humans — sometimes with a belief that particular stones contained the souls, spirits or even the transformed mortal remains of the dead. The belief was widespread, occurring on virtually every continent.It is likely therefore that the builders of Stonehenge, Avebury and other stone circles perceived sarsen in both practical construction terms and also in more spiritual ones.In geological terms, sarsen is just a very hard sandstone. It was formed around 50 million years ago when fresh groundwater gradually deposited additional silica while flowing through sand deposits. In some places, that silica then acted as a natural “glue” to bind trillions of sand grains together, thus forming solid rock.When later erosion subsequently removed the surrounding “unglued” (ie loose) sand, all that was left were the sarsen boulders.Because the chemicals in the original sand varied from locality to locality, modern scientists have now been able to develop a way of producing very accurate chemical fingerprints for sarsen stones from different locations. The system has been developed by University of Brighton geomorphologist and geographer, Professor David Nash. He has now used it to solve the mystery of where Stonehenge’s sarsens came from. It’s the first time that sarsen “fingerprinting” has been used to solve a major archaeological puzzle. The new British Academy funded research is being published today by the American on-line free-access journal Science Advances.“It has been really exciting to harness 21st-century science to understand the Neolithic past, and finally answer a question that archaeologists have been debating for centuries,” said Professor Nash.“We can now say, when sourcing the sarsens, the overriding objective was size,” said English Heritage senior properties historian Susan Greaney.‘Astonishing’ discovery of ancient monument next to Stonehenge“The builders of Stonehenge wanted the biggest, most substantial stones they could find,” she added.As well as the giant sarsen stones, Stonehenge also has a significant number of much smaller stones (the so-called bluestones). Over the years, scientists have succeeded in demonstrating that those smaller (2-3tn) standing stones were brought by Stonehenge’s builders from southwest Wales.Professor Nash was able to analyse the Stonehenge sarsens because a core extracted from one of the monuments giant stones during repair work in the 1950s (and taken to America by one of the engineers involved in that work) was returned to English Heritage last year.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Rasool’s lawyers reached out to Swift’s team to alert them to the similarities in both the name and logo design shared by her brand and the singer’s new album merchandise. The new promotional merchandise includes sweatshirts, t-shirts, and a cardigan with the same design as the one Swift wears in her music video for one of her latest tracks, “cardigan”.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“The main thing was having ‘The Folklore’ when the album was just called Folklore,” said Rasool.She commended Swift’s team, 13 Management, for taking immediate action to remove the “The” from all merchandise. She also said, “I think there’s a larger conversation that needs to be had. It’s not just damaging to one Black woman, it’s all the brands that we work with.”Oprah Winfrey gives up magazine cover for Breonna Taylor tributeTaylor Swift fans spot suspected Kanye West reference on new albumSwift has since replied to Rasool\u0027s Tweet commending Taylor\u0027s team for recognising the damage the merchandise caused to my company @TheFolklore\u0027s brand.The artist said, Amira, I admire the work you\u0027re doing and I\u0027m happy to make a contribution to your company and to support the Black in Fashion Council (launching on 83) with a donation. The Black in Fashion Council was founded to represent and secure the advancement of Black iniduals in the fashion and beauty industry.Swift\u0027s team has issued a statement confirming that “absolutely no merchandise using ‘the’ before the words ‘folklore album’ has been manufactured and sent out”. They added that anyone who has already ordered merchandise will be notified and receive their order with the design change.Rasool told WWD that Swift’s fans attacked her on social media for speaking out. She said some of “the Swifties” – a nickname used for the singer’s fans – called her “a bi*** and a liar”. She added, “I think there was a lot of damage to my brand for me speaking out.

This is by no means a downgrade – after all, international tourists marvel at the UK’s impressive array of country house hotels, seaside cottages, boutique hotels, traditional inns, pubs-with-rooms and campsites on offer. But for a holiday to remember, a spot of glamping is hard to beat.For those of us who’ve had our appreciation for nature reawakened by lockdown, a glamping stay at a British yurt, gypsy caravan, shepherd’s hut or barn delivers a change of scene, outdoorsy activities, locally-sourced food, charming surroundings, luxury and comfort. Here are some key things to think about before your book...A beginners\u0027 guide to glamping Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesGiven the wide range of accommodation on offer, there really is a British glampsite perfect for every traveller. Just make sure you ask yourself a few simple questions before you book.For example, is there phone signal or Wi-Fi? A forced digital detox could be stressful if you’d hoped to stay contactable, but some travellers will consider it a bonus to be out of reach.Also, is there a pub, cafe or shop within walking distance, or will you need to arrive fully self-sufficient? Strolling to a local farm shop for daily provisions adds to the charm of glamping, whereas driving 30 minutes to the nearest supermarket is less of a joy.Equally importantly, what are your rainy options? This might be anything from a Scrabble marathon with a bottle of Merlot, or an underground caving adventure.Stay safe and have fun with this important travel guidance:Only travel in a car with members of your household andor support bubbleAlways wear a face covering or mask on public transportWash your hands before putting on your face covering and after you’ve taken it offWash your face covering dailyWhere possible, leave the car behind and reach your destination by walking or cyclingThe joy of glamping is that you can be packed in under half an hour – there’s no need to spend hours decanting instant coffee into tiny containers, searching for your head torch in the loft, and spending the drive wondering if you forgot the tent pegs. Bad weather is less of a concern too: a week under canvas isn’t much of a holiday, but cosying up in a gypsy caravan or yurt during a storm can be downright romantic.It\u0027s this convenience, comfort and peace of mind that you’re paying for when you book a glampsite, so don’t overthink the trip or stress about your packing list. Leave that to the camping crew.Whether you\u0027re an extrovert adventurer or a laid-back stargazer, there\u0027s a glamping holiday in the UK for you. Here are great staycation selections to inspire you...Go back to your rootsThe Faraway Treehouse in Cumbria is straight out of a fairy tale, with plush velvet curtains, a roll top bath and a balcony to spot deer from during the day. The treehouse is bound to be a hit with families, but it’s a ridiculously romantic getaway for couples too.Faraway Treehouse sleeps two (with space for two children at no additional charge), from £165 per night.Get away from it allTo really get away from it all, take the ferry to the Isle of Skye and bunker down in a beautifully decorated yurt from Skye Yurts. Be sure to stay for at least five nights to hike this gorgeous island, kayak the coves, dine at the Michelin-starred Kinloch Lodge and generally feel a world away from reality.Base rate is £80 per night for two people.Step back in time – with modern comfortsLawnsgate Camping in the North York Moors offers glamping options including a yurt, gypsy caravan (pictured above) and cabin, as well as conventional tent pitchesThis is a working farm that has been in the family for generations, so it’s the real deal, and the picturesque nearby villages and on-site llama-trekking means there’s plenty to do.The Yurt is from £90 per night The Gypsy Caravan is £55 per night and The Game Larder is £60 per night. Watch the starsThe popular glampsite Finn Lough in Enniskillen offers superb stargazing opportunities through the transparent walls of the camping ‘bubbles’.Kayaking, hiking, wakeboarding and other outdoor activities are available nearby, and this scenic corner of Northern Ireland is also well worth exploring by bike or car.Prices start at £265 per night for domes or £145 for suites.Talk with the animalsYou don’t need to splurge on an African safari to spend the night surrounded by lions, tigers and bears.Glamping prices start from £350 per night.How Gilcombe Farm got ready to welcome glampers When events had to be postponed, Amelia Griffin and husband Simon Gerrard, pictured above, sought a new venture to add to their Crescent Moon events company.The solution? A glamping site on 300-acre Gilcombe Farm just outside Bruton in Somerset, near where they live. “It’s lovely countryside,” Griffin says. “There’s loads of gorgeous walks, and people can come just to enjoy the great outdoors.”The site hosts 10 Lotus Belle tents with comfortable Moroccan-style interiors, each eight metres apart with their own designated toilet and mini kitchen. “We could have put more tents in, but didn’t want to because of the present situation,” Griffin explains.Four-day bookings from Thursday to Monday enable the tents to be cleaned and left empty for a few days, and hand sanitiser is widely available on the site.The farm shop offers local produce and delivers to the tents. The couple have also added yoga classes, and outdoor film screenings when all 10 tents are booked.Your staycation checklist: know before you goMany locations across the UK are reopening but are restricting visitor numbers and offering pre-booked time slots. Keep these four points in mind when preparing for your next staycation…CHECK THE GUIDELINES: England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland all have different rules in place check their respective tourism sites before you travelBOOK IN ADVANCE: If you’re visiting an attraction, book slots in advance where possibleGO OFF THE BEATEN TRACK: Try to visit less popular places and to avoid overcrowded areasPACK YOUR BAGS: Bring a card for contactless payments and always keep hand sanitiser on youTo help plan your trip visit Know Before You GoPlease keep in mind that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently have different guidelines, advice and timelines for reopening tourism.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I literally got the message at his memorial so it was a double crappy day\u0027\u0026nbsp“I have lost five kilos in the last three or four weeks because of stress and because work has been so hostile,” Lottie Pope tells The Independent. “I feel like it is bullying. I go to bed at 11pm and wake up at 3am and can’t go back to sleep because my brain is frantic. It is exploding with stress.”Ms Pope, a former social media manager for an insurance firm, was recently laid off from her job during the public health emergency and believes she was discriminated against for being a mother.A spate of recent studies have suggested the coronavirus crisis is exacerbating gender inequality - with a report by the University of Exeter finding women are almost twice as likely as men to have lost their job during the pandemic. Researchers found seven per cent of women have been made redundant during the lockdown in comparison to four per cent of men.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhile a report by PwC, published in May, found 78 per cent of those who had already lost their jobs as a result of the Covid-19 emergency were women.“At the beginning of the lockdown, we were asked to take a 20 per cent pay cut,” Ms Pope, who lives in Tunbridge Wells, says. “I said: \u0027I can’t afford that because I’ve got childcare to pay for\u0027. And then they said: \u0027You have a choice to be put on furlough or be made redundant\u0027. It was a punishment. I also asked them if could I reduce my hours by 20 per cent because I was homeschooling but they expected me to still be full-time.”The women facing lockdown burnout as they juggle jobs with childcareThe 30-year-old, who is a single parent, said hours earlier she had been told she was “critical” to the company and would be working throughout the crisis. But her bosses attitude changed dramatically when she did not agree to take the pay cut, she added.“Social media is a critical, vital thing which can definitely be done from home,“ the mother-of-one adds. ”I had a junior person below me and they kept the junior person. She doesn’t have kids. I feel like it was a case of them discriminating against me because I have a child. I was homeschooling and working full time from home at the beginning of the lockdown. It was so stressful. Now I’m not sleeping at all. I feel really highly strung and I’m very worried about money. I’ve filed a grievance. I can’t take them to an employment tribunal because I worked there for under two years.”A recent London School of Economics study found women are more likely than men to lose their jobs in the forthcoming recession because a greater proportion work in sectors that are forecast to be most badly affected. More women work in hospitality, leisure, tourism and the arts — industries where thousands of workers have already been furloughed or made redundant.Jamie Bird, who lives in West London and previously worked in the education sector, was furloughed in March before being laid off in June.  “I was laid off on the anniversary of my best friend\u0027s death,” the 38-year-old adds. I literally got the message at his memorial so it was a double crappy day. I\u0027ve been feeling pretty down since losing the job. I don\u0027t have any kids but it\u0027s affected my mental health a lot. I\u0027ve lost a job and a relationship so it\u0027s been hard dealing with both. I don\u0027t sleep as well because obviously I\u0027m worried about finding another job and how I\u0027m going to pay for bills and other expenses.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe gender bias revealed by coronavirus needs fixingMs Bird said the current job market is “awful” and she fears she is being discriminated against due to her age - adding that it feels like employers are taking on apprentices due to them being cheaper than someone who has more experience.“I applied for universal credit but was denied any for reasons they haven\u0027t explained so I\u0027m out of a job with no income and no help and that\u0027s tough,” she adds. “I think that it\u0027s atrocious that women are more likely to lose their job in the pandemic than men, we work equally as hard and sometimes even harder and yet we still don\u0027t seem to have bridged that gap between being treated as equally in the workplace environment.” Gemma Hirst, who lives in Newcastle, has been forced to start claiming universal credit since losing her job in retail during the coronavirus crisis.“I worked for the clothes company for five years and got promoted,” the 25-year-old says. “During lockdown, I got furloughed. A couple of months down the line, the shop I was at was closing down but they said I could be moved to another store. But they cut my hours and demoted me so I was no longer a supervisor. I didn’t want that so they made me redundant”.Ms Hirst said she had never lost a job before or been without work but she lucky enough to live with her parents - adding that if she was living alone, the universal credit would not be enough to live on.“It would be a tough existence,” she says. “It is scary because there are hardly any jobs out there. When I apply for jobs I get emails saying that the application is on pause due to the pandemic. I have no idea what would happen if I didn\u0027t have family. It doesn’t bear thinking about. I think I would be homeless. I have good days and bad days. There are some days where I think ‘what am I going to do?’ and I am anxious about the future and worried about what is to come.”She said her best friend, who has three children, had been catapulted into a state of panic since being laid off from her job in a care home for the elderly.  “She was struggling to get childcare and her employer said we don’t want you,” Ms Hirst adds. “She was crying. She is a wreck because she has three children to look after on her own.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Former IMF chief Christine Lagarde has praised female leaders around the world for their “stunning” response to the coronavirus pandemic, especially when compared to their male counterparts.Ms Lagarde, who now heads the European Central Bank, said the policies adopted by female heads of state were proactive and their communication style was clear.“I would say that for myself I’ve learned that women tend to do a better job,” she said. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe added: “This is my woman’s bias and I indulge in ceding to this bias.”The top 10 worst affected countries are all led by men, both in terms of total number of cases and cases per million people.It is difficult to make a like-for-like comparison without considering factors like health expenditure, tourism and population density. There are also far fewer women in positions of power, with only around 10 per cent of countries having a female leader.A recently released study attempted to factor in these variables, finding that on every metric female-led countries performed better than male-led countries.When comparing countries with similar population sizes, such as Ireland and New Zealand, the researchers found that countries with women in charge experienced far fewer cases.The paper, written by economists Supriya Garikipati and Uma Kambhampati, hypothesised that female-led countries fared better due to qualities shared by female leaders.Previous studies have found that women are more risk averse and favour a style of leadership that is empathetic and science-based.The researchers suggested that these traits meant women leaders are risk averse with regard to lives, but prepared to take significant risks with their economies by locking down early.Prioritising economic outcomes has been one of the reasons for the US not imposing a nationwide lockdown, which has contributed to surging case numbers.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Teenagers, it turns out, are a bit of an ordeal.Studies show that mums and dads of teens are  per cent more stressed than  years ago.There’s not just the financial pressures from teens, the constant keepie-uppie with phones, computers and fashion, but the added pleasure of social media.Then throw into the mix hormones, curfews, risky behaviours, smoking, drinking and sex and you have a ­wonderful pottage of purgatory.When your children reach their teens they need to question your authority in order to find the impetus to break away and become independent adults. And they don’t do this lightly. No, they make sure they also judge and question your parenting and basically suck the le out of you.For most of us women it also often coincides with the menopause and ­possibly mid-le crises. I mean, could there be a more perfect storm  Unsurprisingly, girls are more antagonistic towards the female parent. And research shows the task of setting limits for their teenagers falls more to mothers than it does to fathers.I have four childrenand they are all very dferent. One no longer lives at home. He’s  and is my Goldenballs, as his teenage years really lulled me into a  sense of security, being largely painless.I also have two girls, aged  and , plus a boy of . So far . . . and I do love you, girls, BUT . . . the boys are proving simpler, less complicated. Unconscious bias, possibly.Lockdown with these hoodlums forced me to question my sanity, made me feel like I was in freefall and wonder what the hell I had been thinking all those times in the past when my ­Fallopian tubes would jump for joy as soon as I saw a man.I’m a liberal parent. I haven’t sought to make my children my “friends” but I ­certainly wasn’t prepared for the ­contempt, defiance, audacity and ­confrontation that has arrived. About everything, from changing the toilet rollto rudeness , politenessand lack of empathy . I’m not allowed to utter the words, “Well, when I was a teenager”, because allegedly I’ve never been one.I can’t offer advice because I “don’t understand”. I’m not allowed to discipline because that’s “damaging”.I’ve been reprimanded for calling one of the Ungratefuls “lazy”. In modern times, this is “injurious and prejudicial”, I was told. Yes, she used those words. I did once try to explain that she’s intelligent and could go far. “Intelligent” is also detrimental to her mental wellbeing, I was informed.Give me strength.At the beginning of lockdown, I would cry out loud and scream from time to time — just to let off steam because I felt utterly trapped.And because I was parenting on my own, I guess there is no need for orce or separation or marriage breakdown now.But I felt utterly blindsided by the scale of the task because teens nowadays are savvy buggers who are well versed in conversations about ious “conditions” everyone seems to be struggling with — mental health, eating disorders, anxiety.Which is great. But not so great when you’re trying to run through a minefield to get to the other side before they ­criticise your parenting abilities and make you feel like a complete sham.Things have improved slightly. It was that or murder. But it has sapped me of all my energy and made me question what I was thinking when I thought that having kids was a great idea.I joke, of course. They can bring me enormous pleasure when they actually do change the toilet roll. Butyou think weaning and sleep-training is tough, wait until you join the Bewildered Mum Of Teens Club.A very close friend of mine always used to say: “Small children, small problems. Big children, big problems.” So enjoy your little eight-pounder while you can.I exaggerate not when I say I’m sometimes scared to open my mouth at home because one of the Ungratefuls has been a ­passionate advocate of social justice since she first strung a sentence together. Often, I am jokingly and harmlessly inappropriate and un-PC, only succeeding in pushing my middle-age boundaries in a woke world of righteous fundamentalists. But it was when my -year-old Ungrateful sat at the table with a look of absolute panic on his face that I realised things have gone too far. All he had asked his ­sister was: “Can you pass the black pepper  Or is that racist ”I WAS disturbed to learn that the puppy Katie Price bought for her -year-old daughter Princess died in an accident at home. There’s more than one lesson there for a young girl, I would have thought.I was equally disturbed to learn there has been an increase in people buying puppies during lockdown – because apparently, what  is there to do  Except puppies require a lot of work and attention, demand constant ­surveillance and are sentient beings with needs that require a long-term emotional and financial commitment.I worry about how many of these pets will be surrendered or neglected once “normal le” resumes.And why people won’t consider ­adopting rescue dogs when shelters and rescue centres are brimming with ownerless animals.A dog is for le. Not just for lockdown.LOVELY newsreader George Alagiah said that when he first came to England from Ghana at the age of  and headed to boarding school, he made damn sure he had a cut-glass English accent in order to avoid racist and classist bullies.As a foreigner who arrived from Sweden at the same age, I had the same ambition – I wanted to sound like the locals and did not want to stand out.I became all the more determined after slipping up when getting “soup” and “soap” confused, mistaking a sofa “suite” for a sofa “suit” and always referring to spiders’ “cod webs”.It burned like hell to be laughed at because you couldn’t speak properly.Now, I’m pleased to say, my grammar and English is often better than my peers’ because I had to learn everything from scratch and I didn’t want to attract attention.Until I decided on a job in TV, that is.HANDSOME Viking eye-candy Dolph Lundgren has just got engaged.

And that means theres a responsibility, a responsibility we cannot avoid or dismiss, for us to reshape this industry in a way that benefits everyone and everything for decades to come.Harry launched Travalyst last autumn, co-founding it with leading brands Booking, Skyscanner, Tripadvisor, Trip and Visa, and it now operates as an independent non-profit organisation based in the UK.Speaking on video-link, the duke went on to say: Before the pandemic unfolded we witnessed more and more young people expressing an interest in authentic travel experiences and an ability to partake in trips that are greener, that allow them to support local communities, uphold heritage and protect destinations and cultures.This is the future of travel, and a future that Travalyst is here to support and catalyse.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Preventing a new wave of the virus is essentialwe want to save lives, protect the economy and avoid a winter crisis in the NHS. This requires everyone to follow the guidance on social distancing and face coverings. But there is also a responsibility on the Government to protect the public. The key to successfully easing the lockdown without risking a second wave is to have a ing test and trace system. We know from South Korea, Germany and Singapore that effective testing is crucialwe want to contain levels of infections. That way we can get people back to work, children back to school and society back to near normal as soon as possible. Despite Boris Johnson’s claim to have a world-beating system, NHS Test and Trace is still not fully operational. Test results take too long and the number of people reached has fallen since launch. The mobile app promised by Matt Hancock seems to have disappeared completely. Lives and livelihoods depend on fixing these failures. The Prime Minister should ditch his groundless boasting and focus on delivering a test and trace system that actually works. Wild at heart  Britain’s rich and ied wildle is a blessing to our country.

Lead author Prof Gill Livingston, of University College London, said there are opportunities to make an impact “at each stage of a person’s le.” She said: “Our report shows it is within the power of policy-makers and iniduals to prevent and delay a signicant proportion of dementia.” Hearing loss in mid-lewas followed by leaving school earlyand smoking .Then came loneliness and depression , high blood pressure and physical inactivityand obesity and diabetes .It estimated that % of cases were linked to exposure to pollution in our twilight years and % to downing more than  units of alcohol a week in middle age.

Presley Dowdall was born on May  at .pm, weighing lb oz. He was immediately rushed to the newborn intensive care unit , as he was unable to breathe. His mother Roxanne Dowdall was unable to see her son for over five hours after his birth. The -year-old did not get to hold him for the first time until four days later.  And she and husband Sam, , were left reeling when they got a call from the hospital two days after Presley was born - to let them know that the newborn had tested positive for coronavirus.Mum-of-two Roxanne, from Basildon, Essex, said: I couldnapost believe what I was hearing. It was such a shock. They phoned me up on the Wednesday evening, two days after Presley was born, and askedmy husband and I had had our Covid test results back yet.  Then they said, aposYou both tested negative, but Presley has tested positive. Weaposll see you tomorrowapos. It was just like that. I felt angry and guilty that I couldnapost protect my son, that I couldnapost even hold him. I also remember feeling embarrassed, like people would look at us dferently when I told them. I donapost think we will ever know how he could have got it. I had nothing that I could put my finger on to suggest that I could have passed it on to him.  I had so many questions about how he could test positive - but I think I just have to accept that we will never know. Thankfully, little Presley made a full recovery from the virus and is now happy and healthy at almost  weeks old. Roxanne, who is also mum to two-year-old Dixie, said that his birth was extremely dficult. She did not believe Presley was going to make it through his first night. Roxanne, who had to be induced in Basildon Hospital in Essex at  weeks, said: When theyaposre born, you wait for that first big cry - but I didnapost hear anything. He couldnapost breathe at all. The midwe that delivered him buzzed down to NICU straight away, and the doctors from NICU came up with the wires and the tubes and took him away.  The NICU ward was actually Covid-free until Presley was taken down there. He was born at .pm - but I didnapost get to see him until about .pm that night. It was very surreal, seeing him there with all the tubes, and the doctors doing all the stuff I should have been doing. It was like watching a movie. I knew he was mine, but it didnapost feel like he was mine. We hadnapost had a chance to get that bond. But just to know he was breathing was a good thing. Roxanne added that none of the staff that were on hand to deliver Presley were wearing masks or gloves.  She was told he was unlikely to have contracted it from them. Roxanne and Sam ed home without Presley the day after he was born. The mum had to deal with dficult questions from two-year-old Dixie about where her brother was. Thankfully, it was not too long before the parents could bring Presley home on Friday, May , four days after he was born. Roxanne said: I didnapost hold him for the first time until that day I brought him home. I went in to the ICU and he was still all intubated, and I didnapost even know how to pick him up. It was like he had the plague. The nurse asked meeverything was okay - she didnapost realise I hadnapost even held him yet.  She added: It was such a mix of emotions bringing him home. I so wanted him to come home with us, but I also had my daughter to think of - I didnapost want her to catch anything off him. But what with all the poorly babies in the NICU, it was actually safer to bring him home to quarantine there with us, than to leave him in the hospital. The first few days after bringing him home were really hard. I felt like I needed to be checking on him constantly - but then I felt really guilty for neglecting Dixie.

Working for the benefit of others and showing that by us all coming together, everybody benefits. It’s what we do in Scouts, in good times as well as bad. And it has been fantastic to see how many people, young and not-so young, have been doing the same. We’ve all been finding new ways to come together and do our best to make sure nobody is left isolated or alone. Just to give one example, Scouts have been teaming up with the British Red Cross in “Care for Care Homes”, carrying out more than , acts of kindness. Initiatives such as this have been vital because they go to show that it is community that makes us – and every single person matters. The question we must face now is how we bottle that amazing spirit of togetherness so it can be something that keeps us going into the future, with all the uncertainties confronting us. I’m asking everyone, including all those involved in Scouts, to have their say in this important new survey launched today. We’ll be there playing our part, but what a great idea it is to ask as many people as possible what they think are the best ways we can all continue to support each other. So please, take a few minutes to complete the survey at  together.org.uk survey.

Scientists say the effect of lockdown is waning as hotspots of coronavirus infection hit many northern towns. It comes after the Government ordered anyone arriving from countries deemed high-risk to quarantine to stop them triggering new outbreaks. Oldham, Greater Manchester, has overtaken Leicester as the area with the second highest infection rate in England. The town had . cases for every , people in the seven days to July . Leicester’s has dropped to . and the Government is today expected to review its guidance on the lockdown imposed in late June.Blackburn with Darwen, Lancs, now has the highest infection rate in England, at . cases per ,. Restrictions have been imposed in Rochdale and Stockport, both in Gtr Manchester, and Wrexham, North Wales, due to new spikes. Wrexham currently has % of all Welsh infections the Army has been brought in to run Covid- testing centres. Prof Jose Vazquez-Boland, chair of infectious diseases at Edinburgh University, said: “We are facing a comeback of community transmission after removing the lockdown measures. The efficacy of lockdowns is only temporary. There will be a resurgence of new cases every time social restriction measures are lted as long as the virus remains in circulation.” Cambridge University’s MRC Biostatistics Unit estimates there are around , new infections a day in the UK. It put the R reproductive rate at near  in most regions. One expert saidinfection rates are not lowered we could face a second wave. Prof James Naismith. director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute in Oxford. said: “I fearwe fail to check this flare-up, we will head into winter with a high level of ­circulating virus. “With normal winter illnesses such as flu, we could see ato exponential growth in cases that overwhelms the NHS and requires complete lockdown. We have only a short time to get our systems ready to prevent this.” New NHS Test and Trace data will be released today but so far the system has only been reaching around a third of symptomatic cases. Confirmed cases are still low but increases were recorded each day last week for the first time since April.  Local authorities complain they are not getting detailed enough testing data in time to take action. Experts warn that a series of new spikes is likely till a vaccine is rolled out or regular, widespread testing is in place. Officials in Oldham have pleaded with people to follow new restrictions. Justin Brierley, , runs a shoe shop in the town’s market. He said: “Business is poor as it is, so it’s very worrying that cases are rising again. We’ve done everything we can to abide by the social distancing measures. I’m not confident I can rebuild my business for a second time.” Experts are calling for better sick pay and laws preventing staff being penalised for taking time off. Delayed test results also mean many contacts of those who test positive are not being told to self-isolate fast enough. Prof Naismith added: “The Government intervention that will make the most dference in keeping the lid on this flare-up is the isolation of positive cases. Not enough effort has been put into measures [like] financial support.” One in  Brits, or .% of the population, has been infected with Covid-, a study shows. UK Biobank tested more than , people for antibodies, which indicate past infection. Blackburn Darwen  In Blackburn and Darwen residents have been told to limit the number of people from the same household visiting another household to just two. The council also wants masks to be worn in enclosed public spaces, including shops, workplaces, libraries, museums, health centres, hair and beauty salons. And it said handshakes should be replaced with bumping elbows. Oldham  In Oldham , residents have been told to keep visitors away from their homes. And they are also being urged to maintain a strict two metre social distance when they leave the house. Care homes are not allowing visitors and those people who are “shielding” will also be asked to continue to do so for another two weeks from Friday. Leicester In Leicester in late June non-essential shops were asked to close, just two weeks after they had re-opened. Bars and restaurants did not open on July  as planned and the government advised against all but essential travel. Restrictions have been eased in some areas and the government is expected to announce a review of its advice on Thursday. Rochdale  Rochdale council told residents to wear masks a week before the government’s own guidance. It also advised people to use them in all public places, not just shops. The council said no more than two people should be allowed to visit private homes and it advised against any physical contact with people outside the household. Stockport  Stockport council has issued a reminder of the ‘key steps’ to stop the spread of the virus. These include keeping two metres apart from people outside the home and having a test as soon as people suffer symptoms, no matter how mild.

The interactive map shows how the UKaposs death rates have compared to countries and major cities throughout the course of the pandemic. Statisticians found England recorded the worst aposexcess deathapos rates compared to anywhere in Europe by the end of May, at the peak of the Covid- crisis.The map, which can be found here, shows the UKaposs skyrocketing death rates- with the Brent the worst-hit area in the UK during the pandemic so far.The north London borough recorded an excess death rate of .% in the week ending April . While parts of Italy and Spain recorded the highest peaks at points of the pandemic between February and June - England sustained the worst continuous death rates over that period, according to the analysis. Brentaposs excess deaths peak in the week ending  April was the worst rates in the UK during the crisis, the new Office for National Statisticsfigures out today show. The ONS calculated the figures by comparing the number of aposexcessapos deaths week by week, comparing them with year averages before the pandemic. The data also showed Birmingham was the city with the highest peak excess mortality overall at . per cent in one week, followed by Londonand Manchester . The map made available today allow people in England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland to check the mortality rates in their area over times. The visualisation allows the public to see how statisticians have compared UK death rates in local authority area, city and country levels, to those in other countries in Europe during the period. The ONS found the highest peak excess mortality was recorded in Madrid in Spain, at .% in the week ending April .  And of the four nations that make up the UK, England had the highest peak excess mortality  - at one point recording a high of .%. The ONS found England saw the second highest national peak of excess mortality during the week ending February  to week ending June , compared with  European countries. Only Spain saw a higher peak at the equivalent of local authority level. Areas of central Spain and northern Italy saw the highest peaks of excess mortality which surpassed any area of the UK.  The figures showed England had the highest peak of the four nations of .% during week  - the week ending April . This was followed by Scotland with a peak of .% during Week   - week ending April . Wales recorded its peak of .% during Week  - the week ending April . And Northern Ireland experienced the lowest peak, with .% during Week  - the week ending April . London, Birmingham and Manchester were the worst-hit in the UK. Edinburgh, Glasgow, Cardf and Belfast, the other major UK cities that the statisticians analysed, were not as hard hit, but still recorded excess deaths, peaking at %, .%, .% and .%, respectively. Epidemiologists say excess mortality - deaths from all causes that exceed the five-year average for the time of year - is the best way of gauging deaths from a disease outbreak because it is internationally comparable. The ONS analysis confirmed Britainaposs place as one of the countries worst hit by a pandemic that has killed more than , people worldwide. It says , more people than usual have died from all causes across the UK so far this year, the highest total in Europe.  Todayaposs figures showed the UK also had Europeaposs highest excess death rate when adjusted for the size and age of its population. The ONS explained the excess deaths were spread throughout the UK, in contrast to many European countries where they were concentrated in particular regions. Even so, England had a noticeably higher death rate than Scotland, which in turn had higher death rates than Wales and Northern Ireland. Spain recorded a higher peak of excess deaths but the slower decline of deaths in Britain following its own coronavirus peak made for a worse picture overall, the report - based on age-standardised data - showed.

It’s not just in the UK that ­disparities exist – it’s worldwide. Action is needed to correct this so people from ethnic minorities are included in national and local health planning. Catherine Dodds of Bristol ­University and Ibidun Fakoya from King’s College, London suggest the way forward in an editorial in the BMJ. To keep the R number below one, governments are relying on ­nationwide testing and contact tracing until we have a vaccination programme in place. But while we wait, inequalities mean BAME Covid- infections and deaths keep rising.As Dodds and Fakoya point out we already know uptake of medical testing and screening is uneven across cancer risk assessment, antenatal screening, and HIV testing. The NHS is aiming to expand testing with self-administered swab kits – but this strategy may serve minority groups badly, bearing in mind a  UK study found uptake of HIV self-sampling kits among them was low compared with other groups. Most admitted they would probably not use the kits. Behind this reluctance were privacy issues and kits with complicated instructions that were inappropriately worded for people whose first language wasn’t English. Dodds and Fakoya emphasise until these faults are corrected it’s dficult to see how trust can be built up among our ethnic communities. Isn’t it time we looked at these ­disparities from the BAME point of view, and started framing instructions in a form that’s understandable, acceptable and useful for ethnic minorities instead of imposing a “one-size-fits-all” approach  Given the disproportionate and devastating impact this pandemic has already had among our ethnic minority communities, testing equality needs to be addressed in Covid- screening.

Health chiefs asked people who had been working or drinking at the Crown  Anchor in Stone, North Staffordshire, on July , , and  to get tested, after  positive cases were linked to the premises. The Crown and Anchor was closed last weekend to allow a risk assessment to be reviewed after an “overwhelming” number of visitors on Saturday, July . Now four more venues in the town have announced they will be closed for the next few days to keep customers and staff safe, Stoke on Trent Live reports. The pubs made informed punters on social media and said they would be closed despite not having coronavirus cases linked to their premises. Around  people attended a mobile testing unit set up in the council-run Crown Street car park yesterday to get checked – and an appointment-only service is running at the site from today until Sunday. A Facebook post by The Swan in Stafford Street on Wednesday said “management and staff have taken the pragmatic decision not to open the pub this week” – despite there being no confirmed Covid- cases linked to the pub. The closure has been followed by announcements from The Red Lion and The Lounge, both in Stone High Street and The Talbot Inn on Station Road. A post on The Red Lion’s Facebook page said: “We’ve taken the tough decision to temporarily close our pub, this is a voluntary decision and we have no reported Covid cases at the pub. “We are in dialogue with local health authorities and we want to do our part in keeping the local community safe, we look forward to welcoming customers back once it is safe to do so and will be in touch with more news soon.”  The Talbot Inn’s post said: “In light of the current Covid- outbreak in Stone we at the Talbot have taken the decision to close the pub for the next few days to ensure the health and safety of our staff and customers. “We will be keeping abreast of the current situation with test results and positive cases. We will be reviewing the closure again on Friday for the weekend. “Thanks all and stay safe.” The Lounge had been due to re-open on Saturday, but this has now been pushed back.

The crumbling former home is barely visible from the public footpath it sits alongside. But inside it has been left exactly as it was when the owner died approximately  years ago. Clothes still hang where they were drying over a wood-burning stove, opened food cans and jars are still rotting and family photos have remained still on display. Other items include a piano and a bed that was moved into the kitchen while teddy bears are sat on the dust-ridden chairs and he former occupantaposs glasses still sit on the bedside table. Richard Walden, , of Woolacombe, Devon, came across the cottage while walking with a friend on a public footpath in a rural location near Exeter on Tuesday evening. He said: I just stumbled across it and we were both like wow and we thought letaposs go and explore. One of the boards had been removed and the kitchen window was wide open so we took some photos inside. It was incredible. The house was literally untouched for about  years.It had clearly been lived in by an older person, probably a woman. There was still a tin of pilchards that hadnapost been emptied and the rotten remains of fish. There were lots of jars of food, marmite, and a woodburning stove. There was still wood in a bucket and hanging above was clothes that she had drying over the heat. The bed had been moved into the kitchen so it looks like in her final days she had been sleeping there. There were teddy bears placed in chairs, a couple of family member photos, and lots of books. You could see she was interested in art the countryside and birds.  But it was terribly sad. The cottage is so overgrown you could walk right past it and not notice anything. It is clearly a snapshot of someoneaposs le nearly  years ago. Presumably she sadly passed away and the house has been left since. It is a real time capsule. There is a clock, personal items lying around and her glasses still sit on the table next to the bed.

He dug stones out of a cellar under the allotment house and created a mound in his garden. This comes as police found a secret cellar at an allotment in Hanover,  miles from where this new site in Braunschweig is now in the spotlight. The lady now living in the allotment house told how she had been having nightmares that a body was hidden under the home where Christian Brueckner used to stay. Sabine Sellig, who bought the plot from Brueckner, has asked police to search and put her mind at rest.  A neighbour today claimed that Brueckner dug out a cellar at the bottom of the garden house near Braunschweig. Manfred Richter, , said: Brueckner excavated the floor of the house. He took out the rocks and the earth. He dug a big hole.  It was  metres deep and  m wide. He carried out the rocks and earth by hand and dumped it out by the front of the house. He put put planks of wood over the top of the hole. It took him two months to complete.  He started in the morning and worked until evening. Doing this work got him in trouble with the authorities in charge the gardens. Brueckner owned a house on the allotment from August  to April , while he ran a kiosk in the city,  miles from Hanover.  His first allotment in Hanover was excavated this week. Buildings on the site were demolished in late  or  but the cellar remained hidden. Neighbours told how he set up camp there in  - the year Madeleine disappeared. Neighbours in Braunschweig now believed this site will also be probed by police.  The woman who now owns the plot fears she could be sleeping above a body. Another owner of an adjoining garden in Braunschweig told reporters how Brueckner never seemed to do any gardening, but instead would work in his shed and spend time with his young girlfriend, Nakscije Mtari. This was before he suddenly disappeared. They referred to him as a strange man and would occasionally have a beer with him.  The allotment in Braunschweig is run by the local council and rented out to people. A small wooden house now stands at its entrance. Plot owners are allowed to construct small houses and stay overnight, but only sometimes. The plot is now covered over with grass, fruit trees, flowers and other plants while tools, a lawnmower and old bikes are littered about. The Mirror previously reported how the new owner of the land in Hanover fears he may have buried the body of a missing child known as the German Maddie there.  Brueckner was quizzed but never charged after Inga Gehricke, five, vanished in  near where he lived in Braunschweig. Today’s owner, a -year-old woman, said her fear stems from the allotment’s isolated location plus the fact that Brueckner was the tenant when tragic Inga went missing. And one of Brueckner’s old friends even suggested the possibility to her. The woman, a tour guide, told the Sunday People: “I am worried he may have buried a body here. I want the police to dig the ground and check.”  The woman added: “I don’t feel comfortable in the house now. I don’t knowI will stay living here.” A former Brueckner pal, who knows the woman, said: “There was a hole in the floor inside the allotment house and one day he told me he wanted to put a see-through perspex glass over it. “I said to him, ‘What the hell for  Just so you can look down into a dirty old cellar ’  “In retrospect I think he wanted to build a Fritzl cellar like the guy in Austria who put his daughter down there.” Madeleine McCann investigators have refused to say what they found in the secret cellar they discovered on Wednesday. Mini-diggers and forensic specialists with snfer dogs were seen in the garden and authorities were using large earth-moving machinery to dig up the entire backyard, according to local news reports. Several items were found in the Hanover cellar, under a shed which was demolished long ago.  They included plant pots, corrugated iron and a tree trunk, along with other items you might typically find at an allotment. Police have bagged up all the items and taken them away for inspection. Crime profiler and intelligence analyst Mark T. Hofmann has said police may not be solely focused on searching for a body. He said the police are likely looking for any form of data carrier - such as USB sticks, external hard drives or mobile phones. Nakscije Mtari, , is believed to have had an -month relationship with Brueckner when she was a teenager.  In June we reported how she was under police protection in a safehouse in Braunschweig. Police were watching her because she is a key witness in the case against her violent ex. Officers feared she could flee the country or may be attacked by one of Brueckner’s accomplices. Nakscije’s sister, mum-of-four Azra, said: “My sister is scaredChristian comes out now he could do her and us all harm... Christian always used to come over so nice to me.  “All of a sudden he changed and became very stressed. He and Nakscije went on vacation in ... When they came back she said ‘he hit me all the time’.” Brueckner is in jail for drug offences but has dropped his bid to be freed early, it was reported on Tuesday. He has also been sentenced to seven years for the rape of a woman on the Algarve in .  He is not serving that sentence at the moment because he is in the process of an appeal against the conviction, claiming his extradition was unlawful. A court hearing was told Brueckner is receiving “counselling” to deal with the media coverage and is now in solitary confinement to protect him from fellow prisoners. Brueckner regularly travelled between Portugal and Germany in his campervan, which could have easily been used to transport children without attracting attention.

Libby disappeared from a bench in Hull on a bitterly cold February night in  - and was never seen alive again. Having been turned away from a local nightclub, she headed towards her home but never arrived. Tragically, on March , Libbyaposs body was recovered from the Humber Estuary, close to Spurn Point. Pawel Relowicz has been charged with her rape and murder. Minister Anne Dannerolle, of Hull Community Church, spoke to Lisa Squire on a video call this week. In that interview, Lisa explained how the family are coping. She said: “We are doing OK actually. It took a while to understand we would do this in our own way. “I am very much a crier, I cry at everything as my children will tell you, so I have obviously cried a lot.  “The children flitted in and out and did their own thing. My grief counsellor told me it is like when they are jumping in puddles, they just jump in and out. “That is what they do and with the age dference they act dferently. “We are getting through slowly. Some days are good and some days are bad. “But the five of us are really close. We stick together but we are still a unit of six but obviously just one is not here at the moment but we are plodding on slowly.”  When Libby disappeared there was huge support in Hull for her family and the police as they desperately searched for her. When her body was eventually found, there was an outpouring of grief across the city. That support and solidarity helped Libby’s family cope, Lisa explained. “We would just like to thank everyone for their love and support,” she said. “It really has helped. “When Libby was missing to know everyone was behind us and behind the police trying to find her was amazing. That really has helped to see strangers reaching out to you.  “I always feel really guilty because I didn’t actually get round to thanking everybody inidually but that was an enormous task and I’ve never been able to do it. “I am really grateful to everybody for their continued love and support.” Although  months has passed, Lisa says Libby remains a huge part of the family. “Libby is still very much part of our family,” she said, “and she never fails to put a smile on our faces when we think about her or remember her and her funny ways or some funny story one of the children tells. “Not many weeks back we were all sat in the garden and one of the children was saying remember when Libby did this, this or this. “The five of us were sat round the table laughing. It was like she was still here.  “We keep her as a very constant person in our family. Any cards, whether birthday or Christmas, gets signed from Libby as well because she is still part of our family and always will be. “We love her as much, maybe more than I did beforehand. We all miss her and that gets harder and harder every day. “But we know she is safe and that she is at peace. She is still a big presence. It was the same when she was here. She would say aposI’m number one, Mumapos and she still is. She is still my big girl. Mrs Dannerolle will say a few words at the small ceremony for the bench unveiling at .pm on Friday while the Lord Mayor Councillor Steve Wilson and ward councillors will also attend. The existing bench will be removed on Thursday.  Cllr Wilson said: “The tragic death of Libby affected the whole city and we hope this bench acts as a fitting tribute and somewhere people can come to remember her.” Lisa is delighted with the bench which will ensure Libby is never forgotten in Hull. “Thank you to turning that space into a lovely tribute to Libby,” she said. “I have only seen the photos and I’ve not been up to see it yet but it does look beautul. We are really grateful for that. “We are just really grateful for everything that everyone has done and I will come up to Hull and see the bench.” "},{"url":null,"title":"office workers think employers could","story":"NewsOffice workers think their employers could do more to address climate changeA study of , UK professionals, preparing to make their way back in to work, found  per cent get frustrated by a lack of consideration for the environment in the officeShareCommentsByAstrid Hall:,  JUL NewsOffice professionals believe there is room for improvement \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

A study of , UK professionals, preparing to make their way back in to work, found  per cent get frustrated by a lack of consideration for the environment in the office. And four in  say this is a result of no one person having responsibility for driving green initiatives in the workplace. The research, by Go Ultra Low, revealed that despite these frustrations among professionals, three quarters of offices have recycling bins in a bid to be greener. Half have also removed single-use plastics from their workplaces, and  per cent have introduced energy-saving lightbulbs. But nearly a third of employees who drive want the option of an electric vehicleas a company car. Despite these measures, and more than half of office workers claiming to take care to recycle and save energy, a third admitted they are better at being green at home rather than at work. Poppy Welch, head of Go Ultra Low, said: Everyone is trying to be that little bit eco-friendlier at the moment, but it can be tricky when itaposs out of your hands. Employers have already made positive changes in the workplace to be more environmentally friendly, such as increasing access to recycling and energy saving measures, but itaposs evident that their employees are keen for more. There are a number of further changes businesses can make to be sustainable, including offering EV charging or switching company cars to EV models.  These can have multiple benefits, by helping the planet, giving employees a more positive outlook on the company and accessing cost savings due to lower running and maintenance costs for EVs. The study also found nearly a third of those polled would like the company they work for to install EV charging points. And  per cent would like to see EV carpooling or company cars introduced - given workplaces can access a subsidised scheme to have these installed. But  per cent believe budget constraints are holding back their employer from introducing greener initiatives, although recent changes by the government to Benefit-in-Kindtax could remove this barrier for EVs.  The changes to BIK tax means that EVs incur a  per cent tax rate, down from  per cent, enabling companies to provide an environmentally friendly company car, while saving money for both themselves and their employees. Just a quarter of professionals who drive a car knew of these changes, but once made aware nearly half were more likely to consider choosing an EV as a company car. Nearly three quarters agreed changes to BIK are a good idea to encourage people to switch to an EV, which are kinder to the planet and improves local air quality as they produce no tailpipe emissions. And  per cent thought employers should consider EV company cars as a result, with nearly two-thirds of respondents saying theyaposd like to drive an EV. The lower running costs - as low as p per mile -and environmental benefitswere cited as the primary factors that encourage them to drive an EV - according to the OnePoll data. Poppy Welch added: Thereaposs so much employers could do to make their businesses more sustainable, but it can be dficult to know where to start - especially when a number of measures require an upfront cost to implement. However, some are easier than others and with changes to Benefit-in-Kind taxes, employers and employees can make a financial saving while enhancing their companyaposs green credentials.

The engagement, which was done via video link, comes just days after a number of shocking claims were made in Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durandaposs new book Finding Freedom. It claims to reveal details of the fallout between Meghan and Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, suggests the Queen didnapost approve of their decision to quit and says Prince Charles gave them a aposwarningapos. It also gives details of their first date and suggests the couple actually got engaged two months before they said they did. Harry did not mention the new book, which has hit headlines around the world this week, during his speech, focusing solely on the travel and tourism project. He said: Many of you joining us today rely on visitors for your livelihoods. Businesses are hurting signicantly, and Iaposve heard from some of you who are currently struggling to put food on your familyaposs tables and make ends meet because there are no tourists and therefore no income.  We need to build back - but we need to build back better. And that means thereaposs a responsibility, a responsibility we cannot avoid or dismiss, for us to reshape this industry in a way that benefits everyone and everything for decades to come. Before the pandemic unfolded we witnessed more and more young people expressing an interest in authentic travel experiences and an ability to partake in trips that are greener, that allow them to support local communities, uphold heritage and protect destinations and cultures. This is the future of travel, and a future that Travalyst is here to support and catalyse. Harry founded the Travalyst coalition, which is working to help tourists find more eco-friendly ways to travel. Heaposs often been accused of being hypocritical as he took a number of private jets last year.

They say it wasnapost a falling out as such, more that they were never close as they were very dferent. Harry introduced his then girlfriend Meghan to his brother and Kate at Kensington Palace a few months into their relationship. However the book says that Kate is an extremely guarded person who keeps a very tight group of friends. But Kateaposs daughter Charlotte helped to ease the tension between the women due to Meghanaposs adoration of the little Princess. During the early days of their relationship, Meghan lived with Harry at his Kensington Palace home Nottingham Cottage. The small two-bed was just around the corner from the Cambridges, which meant they were extremely close and spent a lot of time with Charlotte and her brothers George and Louis.  Meghan also bought her sister-in-law a soft leather Smythson notebook which brought them together. Speaking about the details in the book, Scobie told People: A lot of damage has been done. He also claims that Kate barely acknowledged Meghan during their final engagement as a four before the Sussexes quit the royal family.  He told the Times : Although Meghan tried to make eye contact with Kate, the duchess barely acknowledged her.To purposefully snub your sister-in-law... I donapost think it left a great taste in the coupleaposs mouths. The book also focuses on tensions between Harry and William, saying the younger brother was upset and angered by some of the Duke of Cambridgeaposs comments about Meghan.

For most families, lockdown has meant extra hours at home and the chance to discover new things to do together. But factor in home schooling and keeping children entertained every day, and there’s been added pressure too. A survey conducted by Very showed that, while there have been plusses in bringing everyone together, filling so much time has been a big task. Almost half of mums and dads with children aged - who took part in the Very Big Le Survey described the past few months as “stressful”, while  per cent admitted it had also given them the chance to do more as a family. With so much uncertainty going on around them, families have rediscovered the joy of escaping into the pages of a good book. One in three parents said they’ve started reading more with their kids, and  per cent of those with teens managed to share reading time. A fabulous story lets us take a break from the real world and disappear into our imaginations. Whether it’s board books read aloud to little ones, teen novels or the latest fiction bestseller, books offer something for all ages. Very believes in the power of reading and, in partnership with national reading charity Coram Beanstalk it wants to encourage as many children, parents and carers as possible to read at home.  Coram Beanstalk provides fun one-to-one reading sessions in primary schools and early years settings , and delivers training for parents and school communities too, taking the pressure off reading and making it an enjoyable experience for all. Very has created a series of  Storytime sessions available on its YouTube channel. It features volunteer reading helpers and famous faces sharing wonderful children’s stories so all children can enjoy listening and reading along.

Ex-military climbing instructor Sarah Hassall, , put up a fierce struggle but was overpowered by -stone Brian Manship who she had known for just six hours.She was found naked with  stab wounds and Manship had tried to cut her head off with a kitchen kne.The drug-fuelled attacker fled and was captured by armed police in woodland  hours later. The court heard Sarah had struggled to adapt to civilian le after a distinguished military career and she had turned to alcohol to cope. Sarah met Manship, , in a pub at Pontypridd, South Wales, in the early hours of the morning and agreed to go back to his flat for sex and cocaine. Prosecutor Michael Jones QC said: At .am the next morning neighbour Philip Iveson heard banging and a woman screaming: Get off me, get off me. The noises were assomeone was being chased around. Mr Iveson heard her shout: aposI will have sex with you again. I wonapost tell anyone, just let me go.apos  The court heard Mr Iveson went outside and saw Sarahaposs anguished face in the living room window of Manshipaposs flat. Mr Jones said: Her hair was all over the place asshe had been dragged about - she was banging on the window and repeating the words: Help me. Mr Iveson said it was haunting because she was too terried to speak the words. He then heard a manaposs voice saying: Get the f*** back in here. Neighbour Nicky Durant heard horrible, sinister screaming on the morning of October last year which the prosecution said was silenced by Manship murdering his vulnerable victim.  Police arrived and found Sarah naked except for her socks on the floor of the blood covered flat. Manship jumped through a bedroom window to escape. Mr Jones told Swansea Crown Court: Sarah had been subjected to a savage, sustained and sadistic attack. She had been stabbed  times, slashed seven times and a major artery was severed. It was a prolonged, vicious and ultimately fatal attack. Paramedic Lee Morgan told police: It looked like her neck had been hacked in an attempt to decapitate her. It was one of the worst things Iaposve ever seen. Father-of-one Manship hid two bloodied kitchen knives under a mattress and had tried to cover Sarahaposs body with a curtain before fleeing. The court heard there was consensual sex between them after they had drunk vodka and taken cocaine in Graig Y Wion Court, Pontypridd.  Manship launched the kne attack after accusing Sarah of trying to steal from him. Sarahaposs soldier husband Graham, , told Manship in a victim impact statement: Not only did you exploit a vulnerable person half your size you went on to kne her in a protracted manner. There were bruises and scratches on her tiny face which live with me with each photograph or reminder but are a mere fraction of the numerous kne wounds you inflicted, each one an opportunity to stop as she pleaded for you to let her go. I live with this thought and the vision of her fear every single day. I have no doubt that Sarahaposs last thought was for her two tiny children she left behind who now sob at her thought.  Sarah, originally from Chelmsford, Essex, who was estranged from her husband, was due to visit her two sons Owain, , and Evan, eight, on the day she was murdered. After Manship was arrested he said: Iaposm quite pleased the police caught me, I can get a good nightaposs sleep now. Manship, who had a previous history of controlling behaviour and violence towards women, wrote a letter to the court saying he was sorry and remorseful. Peter Rouch, defending. said: He thought she was trying to steal from him when he was fuelled by a cocktail of drink and drugs.He over-reacted and assaulted her but has no recollection of using the knives.Manship, who sat slumped in a grey sweatshirt on a video link from Long Lartin Prison, admitted murder and was jailed for le with a minimum sentence of  years.Judge Keith Thomas told Manship: Sarah Hassall was a much-loved mother. sister and we - this was a tragic and senseless loss of le. Mrs Hassall found it dficult to adapt to civilian le when she left the Army to bring up her two sons and turned to alcohol as her le spiralled downwards. She was getting her le back on track when she met you. A neighbour saw Mrs Hassall at the window saying: Help me, help me.  You berated, belittled and attacked Mrs Hassall who was a much smaller person in stature and no match for you in any physical attack. By . that morning Mrs Hassall was fatally injured and you had left by a window. Soldier Mr Hassall, who lives near Monmouth, South Wales, wept as the judge sentenced his weaposs killer. Adventurous Sarah was a member of RAF Kinloss Mountain Rescue team in Moray, Scotland in the early years of her military career. Chief Inspector Mark OaposShea, of the South Wales Police Major Crime Team, said after the case: Sarah Hassall was a young mother to two small children. She is deeply missed by them. She was a military veteran who took huge pride in her service to this country. She was a much loved we, daughter and sister, as well as a friend to many people. I have spoken with those that knew her and the grief they feel is palpable and powerful. This is indicative of the huge loss felt by the many people who loved her.

President of the Bradford Council for Mosques, Zulfi Karim, said the community had done well to adapt to the new way of le. He knows first-hand how much Covid- can wreak havoc. He caught the virus in March and his symptoms developed rapidly, leaving him fearing he might die. He ended up in hospital and, several months on, he still experiences breathlessness when undertaking simple tasks and has lost his sense of taste and smell. He also caught pneumonia as a result of having Covid-. “It’s a very unpleasant illness and I still have the repercussions of it,” he said.  As representative of more than  mosques and madrassas in Bradford, Mr Karim also had to act quickly on the government’s advice to close all places of worship. Now the second Eid is here and faith centres have re-opened up with strict measures in place to enable worshippers to pray safely. Mr Karim said: “We are going to have hourly sessions with a limited number of people allowed in, they will bring their own prayer mats, wear masks and be placed a safe distance apart. “Covid- is still a threat to all sections of the community. I don’t want anyone to go through what I have been through.”  Usually Imam Alyas Karmani would be welcoming well over , worshippers for Eid prayers- especially as it falls on a Friday, the holiest day of the week, but not this year. Mr Karmani, who leads prayers at the Masjid Muhammadi on Lumb Lane, Bradford, said: “Rather than one prayer we will have three prayer times. I will be performing the khutbafrom behind a screen and all worshippers will sign in, wear masks and come with their own prayers mats. We have markers on the floor so people know where they can stand. We have signs and issued statements telling people they cannot hug or shake hands with each other.”  He said that anyone who had symptoms of coronavirus such as a cough or fever was not permitted in the mosque and elders and young children were also advised not to attend. “We are taking this very seriously. Faith centres have opened up but we need to be mindful we could well have a second wave so we want to ensure we keep people as safe as possible. “Some of us live in multi-generational homes and we want to be especially careful that we don’t increase the risk of passing on anything to our vulnerable elders.

The man accused of the womenaposs murders is alleged to have kept one of the womenaposs bodies in the freezer for as long as three years. Hungarian national Henriett Szucs, , vanished after moving in with accused murderer Zahid Younis, , and was last seen alive in the summer of . Her body was found in a small chest freezer in the Canning Town flat along with the remains of -year-old Mihrican Mustafa, who was last seen alive in May . The womenaposs corpses were discovered together during a police search on April , . Southwark Crown Court heard the women had both suffered appalling injuries including multiple broken ribs and Mihricanaposs sternum and larynx were also fractured. Henriett had been in the UK for several years and was last seen in Younisapos company in the summer of , jurors were told.  Mihrican, also known as MJ and Jan, struggled with drug addiction and homelessness and had also been spending time with Younis before she vanished in May , the court was told. The alleged double-murderer purchased the freezer with cash using a fake name for the sole purpose of hiding Henriettaposs body after she was killed on or before November , , the prosecution said. The court heard yesterday detectives discovered Henriettaposs diaries at the flat, and some of the entries allegedly detailed abuse at Younisapos hands. The remains of pyjamas were found on her body when it was recovered from the freezer - indicating she had been sleeping at the address when the killing took place, the court heard. She had moved in with Younis after leaving an abusive relationship and he had soon cut her off from her friends and family, the court heard. The prosecutor told jurors that there was little to no evidence that people in London who knew Henriett had seen her at all in , which the prosecutor told the jury suggested the defendant was skilled at separating women from their support networks.  Prosecutor Duncan Penny QC, said the last evidence of a sighting of Henriett was on August , , when both she and Younis were stopped together by police. Her face was covered, and diary entries attributed to Henriett suggest that she was alive and living with the defendant in late September that year. The same diary entries suggest that the defendant was violent towards her, and was controlling her, he told the jury. The court was told handwritten messages that had been torn up and left around the property were found by police after the womenaposs bodies were discivered. One of the notes appeared to refer to household rules banning Henriett from entering the kitchen and denying her food, jurors were told yesterday. She allegedly wrote of wanting to help and make herself useful around the house. The messages read: Every day go out get food and what I can bring to the house which is useful. Not allowed in the kitchen anymore. Boxer not gone give me food or anything from heaposs what is costing him extra money. Need to fix myself up to be normal.  Be straight, honest. No bulls***. Seat in one spot in heaposs house. Another of the notes said: When I admitted my sins, you judged and expelled me from the inner circle and planted poison in my broken heart that was anyway stone-cold by then. This poison has been tormenting and burning me. Iaposm afraid of dying and I donapost want to hate you!!! Itaposs hard to say goodbye, but itaposs no longer possible for me to remain and suffer, tolerating the hatred you display towards me. Henriettaposs blood was present on the carpets of the defendantaposs flat, the prosecution said. My Penny said of the diaries: Documents in the form of handwritten notes found at the defendantaposs address almost three years later seem to provide a clear picture of the existence of a controlling and abusive relationship involving Henriett and the defendant prior to her death. Most certainly, it would appear that Henriett felt dependent upon the defendant at that time and was keen to please him. The court also heard yesterday the accused killer told a WhatsApp group he wanted to get rid of a woman in his home before allegedly hiding Mihricanaposs body in the freezer.

Talking of the property Den said: My family and I had sold our house, it fell through due to the pandemic and now we need to move but can’t sell. We have another baby on the way and thought we would try this. For our own protection, we have not put the properties exact location as myself and my family are still living in the property.

Andyou think that sounds crowded, Picklesaposs best mate - French bulldog Dill - sleeps with them as well. The couple rescued Pickles in February  after he was displaced by flash floods  miles away. The new addition to the family has completely changed Maddie and Stephenaposs lives, turning them into anti-pork eating campaigners, and thankfully he gets on very well with their dog Dill. Video content creator Maddie, , said: I take them to the beach and Pickles will be playing in the tide while Dill nervously looks on. Pickles will run circles around Dill until he finally caves and goes for a paddle. It works the other way around, too, with Dill looking out for Pickles. If another dog comes over and challenges Pickles, Dill gets between them and stands his ground. Pickles is like his big bro andyou want to hang out with him, you have to accept his brother. You can almost hear him saying, aposItaposs cool, itaposs cool. Pickles is one of us - heaposs a dog.apos Itaposs so sweet. Maddie was astonished when Stephen agreed to her request to adopt Pickles, when she saw an appeal for people to give homes to displaced farm animals.  And he immediately proved to be the ideal house pig, as he instinctively only did his business in their yard. She said: I grew up in the country and always loved the idea of having my own pig. I knew from farm visits as a child how clever they were and how much personality they have.One night I was scrolling through Facebook when I saw an appeal from a farm hit by flash flooding and they didnapost have the money to rebuild after all the damage.They had about a dozen farm animals that needed re-homing and by the time I called they had one piglet left. I turned to Stephen and said, aposLook, thereaposs one pig left - should we go get it apos He told me to grab my coat and that was that, we were off to save a pig!  During the  mile round trip to the farm in Sacramento, Maddie made sure her husband knew they would not be adopting a so-called micro pig. She said: The problem with a lot of people who adopt pigs as pets is they think theyaposre going to stay piglet-sized forever - and they donapost. Micro pigs are never micro. They can weigh up to lb when fully grown  and still be classed as micro. Stephen is definitely what youaposd call a city boy and I didnapost want him to think we were adopting a pig the size of a Chihuahua. But Pickles won Stephenaposs heart and the couple were soon loading their car  boot with a weekaposs supply of pig feed. Naming him Pickles as a tribute to a neighbouraposs pig from her childhood, Maddie said: We didnapost have to do too much to pig proof the house at all.  The main thing was making sure he couldnapost get into any kitchen cupboards with cleaning products in - that sort of thing. He was quite nervous at first. He would stay in his own bed and not venture off very far. But by the end of the week he was less piglet and more puppy - running all over the place, asking for belly scratches and snuggles on the sofa. Within a month he was sleeping in our bed! Soon, Pickles had fully embraced his role as pig-dog, exploring all that Calornia - Americaaposs Golden State - has to offer. Since he was one-month-old we started taking Pickles out and about, Maddie explained. First it would be for five or -minute walks around the block on a collar and lead, but before long we were heading to the coast or exploring the forest.  Weaposve had so many adventures. He might not have the speed of a dog but he certainly has the stamina. And, six months after adopting Pickles, they decided it was time find him a playmate. Pigs are herd animals and it felt wrong for Pickles not to have his own buddy to play with, Maddie added. Initially, hoping to adopt another piglet, it soon became clear that Pickles had his heart set on another species entirely. Our neighbour has the sweetest French bulldog and when Pickles met her he went absolutely wild, Maddie explained. After that, whenever heaposd see a Frenchie heaposd squeal with glee and run in circles. So, the couple bought a French bulldog puppy from a local breeder in July .  They got on straight away, Maddie laughed. Theyaposre like two peas in a pod. Theyaposre the same size, make the same grunting noises and have the same total lack of shame. Dill definitely sees Pickles as his big brother and as a puppy heaposd try and do whatever he did. Heaposd graze on carrots and kale - looking really confused - but heaposd refuse to give up because thataposs what Pickles did. I guess he was quite timid at the beginning, which is hard to imagine now, as Pickles really pulled him out of his shell. Soon, Pickles had a partner in crime to accompany him on his daily walks. Maddie added: As you can imagine, we get a lot of double takes. Always looking at ways to keep her four-legged friends entertained, last summer she signed the duo up to agility classes. And, it just so happens, Pickles was their first pupil with trotters. Heaposs definitely top hog, Maddie laughed. We go every month. At first, other dog owners were shocked when Pickles turned up, but now heaposs part of the furniture. Pickles definitely learns things much faster than he did at first, but heaposs still a lot slower than Dill. Dill will charge right into something, without really knowing what heaposs doing. They run through tunnels, go over jumps, weave - do everything youaposd expect from doggy agility.After people were charmed by her quirky pet, Maddie started sharing photos of the pair on Instagram.She said: People are always stopping to take a photo or ask more about their backstory.  I started documenting their le and found that people were loving it. I think they love the friendship and the big personalities that come through. If they do anything together people go wild, whether itaposs a trip to the beach or eating some carrots.” And, with over , followers, Maddie hopes her social media reach will encourage people to rethink their attitude towards animals as more than just food. Maddie said: Since adopting Pickles and Dill Iaposve provided foster care to several animals - including puppies, piglets and even a goat - but Pickles and Dill remain a staple of our household. People are always very charmed and that makes me happy because then they start to see how loving, bright and sociable pigs can be.

The site, on the outskirts of Hanover, Germany, is four miles from Brueckneraposs former addresses in the Linden area of the city and backs onto a canal. Mini-diggers and forensic specialists with snfer dogs were seen in the garden and authorities were using large earth-moving machinery to dig up the entire backyard, according to local news reports. Crime profiler and intelligence analyst Mark T. Hofmann has said police may not be solely focused on searching for a body. He said the police are likely looking for any form of aposdata carrierapos - such as USB sticks, external hard drives or mobile phones.  Mr Hofmann told Bild : There are drugs, explosives, even cash detection dogs and detection dogs that are trained to snf out electronics, i.e. data carriers such as USB sticks, external hard drives or cell phones. So far, the prosecution has only confirmed that they are looking for something there that is related to the investigation into the Maddie McCann murder case. But they did not say that they are specically looking for a body there so it is quite possible that they are looking for data carriers or other evidence.On Wednesday morning police arrived at the site with ground penetrating radar equipment and what appeared to be a metal detector.Wolfgang Kossak, who lives in a neighbouring property, said the search was “ominous”. He said many of the plots were sub-let and he recalled a stranger who “caused a lot of trouble” visiting the site around  and . Speaking to MailOnline, Mr Kossak said: Christian Brueckner had the garden next to mine. He arrived in  and left within a year. He told me that he living off the grid, that he had not registered with the authorities – no one knew he was there.  The building was not really a house, you might call it a shed. But it had a cellar and underneath there would be foundations. Asked by Bild about Brueckneraposs connection to the allotment, the suspectaposs lawyer Friedrich Fuelscher said he could not comment on the police operation. Pressed on why the allotment was being searched, Fuelscher told the newspaper that I think weaposll find out the reason soon. One local claimed the German ­paedophile lived at the ­allotment site for a short while.

Wayne William Downing, , was looking after little Noah at a home in Perth, Australia, in May . Downing told police he had been asleep on the couch when Noah woke up in his room and began crying.Frustrated and tired, he said he gave the baby just a little shake, the Daily Star reports. A judge said Downing shook Noah in the irrational hope that aposdoing so would make him fall asleepapos. Downing shook Noah for between four and six seconds, causing traumatic injuries to his brain and spine. He reportedly said at the time that he could see the babyaposs head moving from side to side and backwards and forwards. As soon as I put him down I realised what Iaposd done... I was just trying to go off to sleep and to get some sleep. But Downing did not attempt to seek medical help after realising Noah was injured. When Noahaposs mum ed, she tragically found her babyaposs body cold and blue, it is reported. Downing only admitted to shaking the baby on his second interview with police, the Supreme Court of Western Australia heard. He was excessively tired and suffering from severe depression and anxiety at the time, the court was told. Justice Anthony Derrick accepted Downing loved Noah and had not intended to hurt or kill him. You shook Noah out of frustration, and in the irrational and forlorn hope that doing so would make him be quiet and fall asleep, he said.

I was lucky enough to play under Ivanin  but I’d lost three before we’d managed to get one.“Jim was manager for a few before then as well so that was probably big thing for him, not being able to do the clean sweep of Scottish football.“Aberdeen were the benchmark, with the New Firm at the time, the two of us were competing against one another.“Them having won European titles probably was sore for him, especially having gone so close.“You look at Roma and then Gothenburg it was, obviously, a big thing for him.”Bowman, who would go on to make  appearances for the club, checked in at Tannadice in  and was part of United’s efforts to make the Uefa Cup showpiece that season.They, arguably, could go down in history as the club’s greatest-ever side.However, the former Hearts man was quick to hail McLean’s title-winning side of  as the best of all.“I would still say when they won the league in  was their best team, what an achievement that was for the club,” he added.“But he kept on evolving the team by bringing myself, Jim McInally and Iain Ferguson to the club in .“When I look back at my time, the players I played with were absolutely brilliant.“They were top professionals as well with the way they conducted themselves off the park. That’s probably why they got so much success.“The likes of Heggie , Davey , Eamonn , Luggy , Holtyand Maurice , they were all great.“For Jimmy Mac, Fergie and I to come into that, playing with them week-in, week-out, it certainly makes your football a lot easier to do.”Bowman looks back on their European adventures with great fondness, hailing the Arabs as some of the best supporters on the continent.“When you look back at the  Uefa Cup run and we were playing Lens in the first round, there wasn’t loads of press and fans but the hype grew as we went on,” he continued.“As we went through the rounds you could see it building.“The fans were brilliant. They’d travel everywhere – the crowds for Barcelona, Monchengladbach and Gothenburg in the final were exceptional.“People even came to Romania to see us play Craiova, it was an Iron Curtain country at the time so that was dficult for their visas and getting there.“It just shows you exactly what United fans were and are still about.”LEE WILKIE: Coronavirus effect for Dundee United may be survival this season, then kick on in the next campaign\" title\"#LEE WILKIE: Coronavirus effect for Dundee United may be survival this season, then kick on in the next campaign# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp lee-wilkie-dundee-united-fc-micky-mellon embed # secretKqynNAaff\" data-secret\"KqynNAaff\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

I was only there for two years but we have stayed in touch ever since.“The more that I worked with him, you could see he thinks about the game a lot.“Sometimes when you play, you do your own thing and go home. You don’t really think about the game.“But I think he studied it a wee bit more and I saw that the longer I was with him,# added the Tannadice number two.“His accent is still broader than mine and he has been down there for years.“Seriously, coming here is a great opportunity for me and I am delighted he gave me the call.“I actually spoke to Micky a lot and I met him just before lockdown, paying him a visit at Tranmere.“I knew his ideas and thoughts on the game and I was up here last week speaking to him as well.“I am getting to know what he wants. At times our ideas might dfer but his are the ideas that matter so it is up to me along with the rest of the guys to get that message onto the players as best we can.”LEE WILKIE: Coronavirus effect for Dundee United may be survival this season, then kick on in the next campaign\" title\"#LEE WILKIE: Coronavirus effect for Dundee United may be survival this season, then kick on in the next campaign# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp lee-wilkie-dundee-united-fc-micky-mellon embed # secretzkvLKPr\" data-secret\"zkvLKPr\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

In fact, you can say that about the whole summer.Thankfully, this weekend we’re back to talking about controversy on the pitch instead – for the top flight clubs anyway.I’m delighted Dundee United fans will get to see their team in the Premiership this weekend, evenonly virtually.For Dundee fans, I feel your pain – the Championship kick off still feels a long way away.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

This isn’t just a football problem, it’s a pandemic right across the world.“For our players to take a wage cut it has helped the club out and we are very appreciative to them for doing that. To a man, they have done their bit to help the football club going forward.“I think we’ll see a greater togetherness in terms of the fans as well as they will appreciate it. Everybody here that entered the process took the cut so the fans will be behind us from day one knowing that. If they can get back in the ground, I think the place will be bouncing anyway as they have missed football but I think this adds to it as well.“Of course we have still got to perform because what the fans want the most is to see a successful team. The sacrices the players and staff members made has helped the football club.“I think now there is a buy in to Dundee Football Club, as they have accepted it, you just get that feeling.”The Dens gaffer revealed his players, despite still being on furlough, have been putting in the hard hours on their own over the shutdown.He added: “They are just desperate to get back to being out on the pitch. We had a good end to the season, prematurely unfortunately but we’ll remember that.“They are on furlough so have an optional programme, they put their times up and we can see they are working very hard.”On joining the  Foundation, the former Dens skipper said: “I think it’s a great idea and wanted to be a part of it.“The response from the fans has been fantastic in these dficult times.“Signing up to the foundation and buying season tickets will really help the club as a whole and our fans’ response so far has been excellent and I’m sure it will continue to be.”The scheme has already topped the  mark with members able to sign up for monthly payments of £, £, £ or £ with all money going directly to the club.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAvril Lockhart from Cairnbaan sent us this week#s photograph.Taken at Bellanoch, the photo shows the bike that Avril, as a key worker, has been lent by Alec Ohnstad of the Ardrishaig Bothy.

However, there are still numerous restrictions in place, including no operation of locks and bridges, limited services and limited staff available on the ground.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future. It has taken a national emergency to get the government to acknowledge that it needs our compliance and, for that, must give us the information we need.Suddenly the choices we make are seen as vitally important, and we have a part to play in achieving success for ourselves and our community. Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary. In this pandemic Nicola Sturgeon has said that we have behaved in a way that saved lives and protected the NHS.When this is over we could be at the beginning of another le-altering journey.It will demand a huge sht in expectations. There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible. Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy. Teaching children the beauty of the outdoors and how to care for it can bring a lelong love for natureyou love something you usually wish to protect it.And learning never stops for any of us. Sometimes it is the basics that are needed before we move on to the complexities of natural navigation or learning our stars.So for this month here is one tip : learn how to go to the toilet in the outdoors!Doing this responsibly and teaching your children makes for a lelong enjoyment of walking and exploring without the bane of wondering where the next toilet is.

It is now one of the most beautul drives in the place, and as a drive it would be destroyed.#The line from Glasgow to Oban took  years to build and finally opened in , proving extremely popular with holidaymakers for many years. The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view. A plan from  shows a proposed tunnel to carry the line through the duke’s policies near to the castle. This proposal, like many others, was defeated in the House of Lords.Instead, provision was made at Dalmally for a waiting room, the #Duke’s Room#, at Dalmally Station where visitors arriving by train could await the arrival of a carriage in comfort.This is just one of innumerable fascinating stories stored within the Argyll Papers, the family and estate archive of the Campbell family, dukes of Argyll.The Friends of the Argyll Papers was established to support the development of the archive and to promote its use and enjoyment by a wide audience.It has been described as one of the most important private archives in Britain, offering a rich resource for Scottish and British history from the th to the st centuries.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry.

Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

Instead, they were directed at some national policies and how they impacted on rural development.Argyll and Bute Council had been #more than helpful# to local businesses in the recovery from lockdown, the company added.Mr MacLeod also suggested Scottish Water should be encouraged to allow small developments to be served by inidual septic tanks or bio-discs.In addition, the provision of water and electricity to remote rural locations should be subsidised by the Scottish Government, he added, which would help make projects more affordable.Furthermore, the cost of #impact studies# should not fall on the developer, he said.Another issue was the requirement of registered social landlords that housing is built to extremely high specications, he said.Mr MacLeod said: #That high standard does, of course, ensure the houses are well insulated and easily maintained. The standard, however, drives costs up dramatically and can make small, rural developments unaffordable.Careful planning of the specication could reduce building costs but still produce warm, highly insulated and comfortable homes.#While there is Scottish Government funding for affordable housing and funding through the Highlands and Islands Enterprise Agency for workshop units, there is no funding for #combined# units which incorporate a home and a workspace.This would allow young entrepreneurs to acquire a starter home or a home worker to relocate.Argyll and Bute Council has one of the highest approval rates for new planning applications in Scotland.It said: #Masterplans are rarely implemented in Argyll and Bute but they are used occasionally to enable the partial development of larger areas of land.#Infrastructure costs make up a signicant proportion of the cost of new build housing particularly in smaller scale developments.#"},{"url":null,"title":"a welcome awaits at kilmartin church","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsServices are scheduled to re-start at Glassary, Kilmartin and Ford Parish Church early next month.Trustees hope to open the modern and welcoming church building at Barr Mhor, Kilmartin, for worship from Sunday August , starting at am.Social distancing will allow for up to  people to attend and everyone is expected to wear a face covering.

Taking a holiday in the United Kingdom offers people the chance to uncover some stunning scenery, wonderful attractions and superb accommodation without having to jump on a plane. Here, we take a look at the type of places you can stay, the rules you need to follow and how to enjoy a great staycation.Scotland’s colourful countryside, breathtaking beaches and glorious gardens are ready to welcome visitors this summer.Many locations are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and pre-booked time slots, so we recommend looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go.The national tourist organisations of Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland have launched a UK-wide industry standard and ‘We’re Good to Go’ mark. The mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective government and public health guidance, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence.Do remember that our four nations have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for reopening tourism. Please respect government guidance on social distancing and also any regional lockdown measures that are provided by the respective nation.Summer is here and Britain is beginning to reopen, providing everyone with the opportunity to start dreaming about a holiday. And this year a staycation could give you some much needed rest and recuperation, while also helping get the holiday industry back up and running. Hotels, campsites, bed and breakfast accommodation and other places to stay are now openingthey can follow the guidelines relevant to their locality to ensure that their guests will be safe to stay and spend days wandering our award-winning coastlines, exploring our green spaces and getting inspired in our cities. Each accommodation provider is unique and those that have reopened have had to adapt depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of accommodation.But these changes mean it is safe for visitors to come and enjoy a change of scenery. But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines.Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months.“They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry.“All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe.“But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.”Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us. To make sure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, just follow a few simple steps.When planning your trip, check that important facilities like toilets and car parks are open before you travel.  If you have an attraction in mind, check online to seeyou need to pre-book.Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem.Stay socially distanced apart from anyone outside your household while walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing.  Wear your face covering at all times when on public transport.  Make sure you have a bank card many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments. Take hand sanitiser with you. Leave the car behind where possible and visit nearby attractions by walking, cycling or public transport.Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened their self-catering property on the shores of Loch Lomond and their family-run passenger cruise business, Cruise Loch Lomond.The -person rental property is set in self-contained grounds on the shore of the lake, and the Cordners hope guests will contribute to the local economy while being respectful.They have implemented virus prevention measures in both the property and on the boats, including increased cleaning and social distancing procedures.They have also invested in additional cleaning equipment and training for cleaning staff.Passengers are asked to wear face coverings and book in advance, and capacity has been reduced to allow for social distancing.“We live in a small community but we’re fortunate that there’s a lot of space and our main business is an outdoor activity,” said Mr Cordner.Cool Camping is a curated website of small, independently-run camping and glamping sites across Wales and beyond.  Marketing manager James Warner Smith said: “Having campfires, spreading yourself out, being able to chat with the owner of the business who’ll be able to recommend a local pub – they’re all big parts of the appeal of camping.“You’re much more likely to be pitching your tent among shrubs and long grass with a lot of space between you and your neighbours.” The company has been working closely with campsites in Wales to ensure safety guidelines are met. At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked.  They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place.  Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular.·         Wales is open for camping from  July.Northumberland’s oldest castle hotel, Langley Castle near Hexham, has reopened to visitors, with all the appropriate “defences” in place. The castle, which has survived attacks by Border Reivers and a fire that left it as a ruin for centuries, has again been buzzing with guests who have been impressed by the sanitary and social distancing measures that Langley has already put in place. The management team makes many arrangements upfront, such as menu choices and payments, as part of the social distancing procedures that are required. Other changes affect check-in and check-out times, to enable the housekeeping team to carry out deep cleans. Executive general manager Margaret Livingstone-Evans said: “We have stayed upbeat and optimistic and have managed to generate enquiries throughout lockdown, by being creative about the ways in which we can make things happen, in a safe way.” More details at langleycastleFor more information on staying safe, please go to visitscotland"},{"url":null,"title":"borders-athlete-sammi-kinghorn-appears-bbcs-one-show","story":"SAMMI Kinghorn appeared in a BBC television programme this week.The wheelchair racer, from the Borders, featured in anepisode of The One Showwhich aired on July .Kinghorn, who was expecting to be competing in the Tokyo  Paralympics, told viewers how she felt when she learned the prestigious event was being postponed due to coronavirus.She said: ldquoWhen I first heard Tokyo was going to be delayed, it was quite heartbreaking because I felt really strong and I felt really fast.ldquoBut now I feel quite positive about knowing that Irsquove got another year to get stronger.Asked about her goals, she said: ldquoIrsquom aiming for gold because therersquos no point being therethatrsquos not what Irsquom aiming for.The -year-oldrsquos achievements include winning gold medals for m and m at the London  world championships, and reaching three finals at the  Paralympics in Rio .She is one of the fastest British wheelchair athletes ever.Her entry into the world of elite sports came following an injury on her familyrsquos farm in .The One Showepisode, hosted by Alex Jones and Rylan Clark Neal, featured guests including journalist and author Caitlin Moran and chef Monica Galetti."},{"url":null,"title":"borders-beauty-salons-reopen---i-cried-relief","story":"BEAUTY therapists get back to work todayas studios reopen after  weeks.Salon owners had an anxious wait as the Scottish Government considered what new safety guidelines ought to be introduced to minimise the risk of spreading coronavirus.But industry figures were delighted to learn that ndash unlike their counterparts over the border ndash they will be able to offer treatments on the face, so long as therapists stand to the side or back of the clientrsquos head.\"I was so relieved, I actually cried, said Alana Grant, owner of Borders Beauty Studio in Galashiels, adding: ldquoOver  per cent of our treatments are on the face.The business, which during lockdown relocated from Bank Street to Market Street, was concerned that similar restrictions to England would be imposed.Miss Grant said: \"A number of our treatments are on the face, so we probably couldnt opennot allowed to provide these treatments.\"Every day I was checking the guidelines and speaking with other shop owners in the Borders and in Edinburgh.Masks, visors, aprons, gloves and perspex iders will be used at Borders Beauty Studio, with stations being deep-cleaned after use.And over and above the requested measures, Miss Grant and her team will be testing the temperatures of customers on arrival, using a contactless thermometer.Customers will be encouraged to use hand-washing and sanitising stations when entering and exiting the shop.Miss Grant told the Border she was pleased to have been able to furlough all her staff, meaning all have been retained ndash therapists and reception staff alike ndash as the studio reopens.Reflecting on her journey over recent months, Miss Grant said: \"It was a very worrying time.

You think Harry Potters magic  Just look around you.\"That curiosity is our biggest asset because thats how we learn to adapt, thats how we learn to survive, thats how we learn to cope with the world around us as it changes.\"Lloyd, who previously worked as a Sunday Timesjournalist, was inspired to begin a career as a childrens author after seeing the joy his children experienced when they learnt new things during their years in home-schooling.Particularly that of one of his daughters who was astonished to learn all about Antarctica ndash home of her then favourite animal, the penguin.\"I believe fundamentally, especially now having done thousands of talks in schools and festivals over the last  years, that humans generally reach peak curiosity at the age of nine or ,\" Lloyd said.\"Then things start to get in the way, like puberty and your friendship groups change and going from primary to secondary school.\"But at the age of nine or  youve got that purity of curiosity where youre old enough to know that you have an identity and youre curious enough to want to know where you fit in.\"Theres nothing you cant talk to a nine or -year-old about ndash provided you dont patronise them, provided you dont have an expectation of them that they cant meet.\"If you can meet them as fellow kindred spirits on this rock travelling around the sun, in this incredible galaxy, and here we are, face to face, learning about it and discovering things together, then there is nothing more inspiring than engaging with a nine or -year-old.\"Chris Lloyds Humanimalbook event will be

In this monthly column, she shares her wildle diary ndash and pictures!DURING lockdown, I was trying to make the most of my free time ndash going on daily walks, working on my website, editing photos from before lockdown, designing my first book and completing A LOT of jigsaws .After the lockdown restrictions started to ease, I was able to spend even more time outdoors than I would normally do. I dedicated June to visiting dferent local sites to watch the kingfisher ndash which you may remember from my previous article ndash a family of wrens and the brown hares.One evening, as I was uploading my photographs on to social media and searching through the pages, I came across a few images of a bird that every birder wanted to see since its influx to the UK was published. It was a rosy starling!The beautul rosy starlinglooks nothing like the starlings we know. It strongly resembles a magpiewith a much shorter tail.This species is unmistakable in its adult plumage. The male has a pale pink body with a black head, wings, and tail. Additionally, during the breeding season the male develops a wispy crest and the black colour becomes glossier with a purplish green or blue sheen.The female is less vibrant than the male. Both sexes appear much duller outside of their breeding season.Furthermore, the rosy starling does not mimic other species, unlike its well-known cousin.What the two species have in common is murmuration ndash an astonishing and mesmerising aerial spectacle large flocks of these birds gather and perform a real show as they swoop, e and swirl across the sky in beautul shape-shting clouds. It is a phenomenon that pleases the eye of every observer.The rosy starlingrsquos breeding area stretches from the Balkans and Turkey to Central Asia and north-west China. It spends winters in India and south-east Arabia. As a strongly migratory species, it can travel outside of its normal breeding range. As a result, there are signicant periodic summer and autumn influxes in western Europe. The causes of such irruptions are not yet fully understood however, it appears to be related to changes in the population of locusts on which the birds feed.Imagine my amazement when I read that one of those birds had landed and made its temporary home in someonersquos garden in Port Seton!The cherry on the cake was that the night when I saw the first images of the rosy starling in East Lothian, I also received an email from Stuart Payne ndash the lucky host of the rosy starling. Stuart invited me to his garden.The next morning, my fianceacute Chris and I rushed to Port Seton. As we were walking towards Stuartrsquos house, we saw another birder looking around hoping to spot the rosy starling. As soon as we arrived at Stuartrsquos house, I saw this magnicent pink bird flying past the house and landing on the bird feeder to start its feast.Stuart and his we Gillian welcomed us in their garden, where I spent half an hour photographing the gorgeous rosy starling and chatting to Stuart and Gillian. I also took some time to admire their beautul dogs Hugo and Hobbes. These dogs were just wonderful, not every day you see dogs as well behaved as these two!My first and, I hope, not last experience with the rosy starling was unforgettable!

Nobody knew what to expect.ldquoGala day itself was amazing, from the glorious weather to the great response we got from the locals as we travelled around in convoy tooting and waving, visiting many streets of the town which the normal gala parade doesnrsquot visit. The people of Prestonpans certainly came out to show their support and for that we are truly grateful.ldquoWe would like to take this opportunity to thank the future Queen Lily [Bennion] and her royal court, as well as their families for their patience and understanding.

initiative to provide additional space for physical distancing to protect public health, work has started on a temporary cycle route between Prestonpans and Cockenzie and Port Seton which will run parallel to the main B Edinburgh Road.The three-metre wide path will be created by laying hard surfacing down on the grass verge on the north side of the carriageway between the two communities.The path will run alongside the footpath between the boatyard access at Prestonpans to just past the old power station with a white line separating the cyclepath and walkway.This is the councilrsquos latest project to improvesocial distancing in the wake of the Covid- crisis.The local authority received pound.million from the Scottish Governmentrsquos Spaces for People fund to introduce ious countywide measures to make it easier to social distance in town centres and improve cycle and pedestrian paths.As well as the roadside cycle route, the speed limit on Edinburgh Road, which is normally mph, will be reduced to mph and speed limits in the twocommunities reduced to just mph.The plan for the cycle path has seen dozens of painted stones created by local schoolchildren, which line the footpath, move across to the other side of the road.The stones are a symbol of hope and unity during the Covid- crisis, and many similar displays have been created throughout East Lothian and the whole country.Councillor Norman Hampshire, environment spokesperson at East Lothian Council, said: ldquoWe received many comments in the public consultation around Spaces for People on the need to provide suitable space for people cycling.ldquoMany people are currently cycling this route and we need to cater for the current increase in cyclists during the pandemic period.ldquoIn common with other Spaces for People measures, this route is for temporary use as we gradually move out of restrictions and will also provide a viable alternative to the use of the private car and or public transport for shorter-distanced essential or leisure trips in the area.The works also include the introduction of temporary crossings of Edinburgh Road at either end of the route through the use of lsquobuildoutsrsquo and bolt-down bollards.In addition, the proposals also include traffic calming measures on Edinburgh Road to slow down traffic with a temporary reduction in the speed limit to mph between the two communities, in tandem with the introduction of mph limits within the communities themselves.MrHampshire added: ldquoWe were aware of a collection of painted stones that have been carefully laid by local schoolchildren alongside the existing footway along Edinburgh Road and recognise that these are important to the local community.ldquoThe community council arranged for these to be carefully collected prior to the start of the works and they have been relocated on the other side of the road."},{"url":null,"title":"column-job-figures-worrying","story":"Furloughing has

There was cloud cover, no wind and a sticky humidity. I was almost eaten alive.Scotlands walks are never complete without the dreaded midgeBelieve me, I have tried everything to keep the midges at bay. Among the long list of suggestions that Ive given a whirl are eating Marmite sandwiches, spraying a fine mist of Listerine and taking garlic tablets .Smoke can act as a deterrent, which has seen me huddling next to barbecues and bonfires like they are two-bar electric fires on cold winter mornings.Ive donned midge nets that give me the forlorn air of a beekeeper who has lost her hive, or a grieving Victorian widow.

Credit: Jevelin Getty ImagesAnything that rubs against your face for hours on end is bound to cause some irritationmdashand face masks are no dferent. lsquoWhen it comes to cloth or surgical masks, we are primarily seeing mild skin irritation, mild comedones , and reactions to the fabric itselfrsquo, Allie McAllister, BSN, FNP-C, DCNP, explains. lsquoWhile just wearing a mask can cause friction which can be irritating to the skin, the types of materials, dyes, and detergents in the mask can also cause irritation and rashesrsquo.Besides rashes and chafing, face masks can also lead to breakouts. It makes sense when you think about itmdashyour mask is creating a moist, warm environment against your skin, which is perfect for bacteria to thrive. lsquoBreakouts can occur from sweat, dirt, and moisture being trapped under the maskrsquo, McAllister says.How to protect your skin from your face maskAlways start with a clean face. Credit: Getty ImagesFor starters, McAllister says you should always thoroughly wash your face before you put on your mask and after you take it off Cerave Hydrating Facial Cleanser in particular because its gentle and non-irritating. Then, McAllister recommends, lsquoIf you know yoursquoll be wearing your mask for a long period of time I would suggest applying a thin layer of Aquaphor Healing Ointment to the areas that will come in direct contact with the mask.rsquoYou can also try an anti-chafing balm, like Body Glide which is is a favourite of Reviewed staffers who run. Apply it on areas where your mask typically rubs against your skin, like the nose, cheeks, chin, or ears.Keep in mind, too you should wash your face mask regularly in the laundrymdashand McAllister agrees. She suggests using a detergent specically for sensitive skin thats free of any dyes or perfumes.Bonus: If you have the luxury of picking and choosing your mask , McAllister says the type of fabric can make a big dference in your masks comfort. She recommends a soft cotton fabric thats more breathable than other alternatives.McAllister says once again to start with Aquaphoryou notice any irritation or discomfort. However, she advises that you speak to a dermatologistthe irritation is more severe or does not resolve with Aquaphor.And as for breakouts, our lestyle writer and beauty guru Jessica Kasparian has a few products she swears by. lsquoIf a blemish pops up, I love the Mario Badescu Drying Lotion, which uses isopropyl alcohol to dry up pimples and calamine lotion to soothersquo, she says, adding, lsquoI also love hydrocolloid patches like the CosRX Acne Pimple Master Patch set. Theyre clear dots that extract impurities while also creating a protective layer over the pimple so nothing  can irritate itrsquo.

We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus. Uncertainty permeates through every part of our lives now, and we must find ways to live with and even embrace thiswe are to make it through the tough months ahead.

Those that belong to the pea and bean familyfor example, in summer, can store nitrogen in their roots,that can be ploughed back into the earth.Which crops make good green manures At this time of year they include mustard, fodder radish, fenugreek, buckwheat and phacelia, which can be slotted in in six to eight week gaps when the ground is cleared between crops. Some sown in early autumn, including winter beans, grazing rye and winter tares, will last through the winter and can be dug into the soil when it warms up in spring.How long do they take to grow Some, such as mustard, are fast-germinating. Two weeks after sowing youll find the ground covered with small seedlings, and after six weeks, these can be chopped and folded into the soil to add nutrients.Fenugreek is another nitrogen-fixer for summer, really fast growing and its bushy plants are great for suppressing weeds. It can be planted in late spring or summer and grown for up to three months.When do I cut them down Chop the fast-growing ones when you need the ground back. Just dig them up, chopping up the leaves and stems as you go to speed up decomposition. Leave them a few days to wilt and then dig them into the soil.Longer term crops such as alfalfa, red clover and trefoil can be left in the ground for a year and clipped from time to time to stop them from going woody. They are ideal for soil thats been overused and needs to rest.What benefits do they provide Clover, fenugreek, winter beans and alfalfa are good nitrogen-fixers, storing nitrogen in their roots, while clover and phacelia flowers are a magnet for beneficial insects, which can help pollinate crops, so leave some to flower. Italian ryegrass and buckwheat have root systems that will help break up heavy ground.When can I plant crops in the space again A few weeks after youve dug in your green manure, you can sow late crops such as onion and garlic.WhatI want to wait If you have no crops to fill the space, cover the green manure-treated bed with cardboard or landscape fabric to keep the nutrients from the green manure in, which will give you a great seedbed to sow seeds in come spring.What  can I grow to help my crops Try growing comfrey, which absorbs nutrients and minerals and can be made into a liquid feed. Just cut it down to the ground, fill a bucket with the leaves and stems of the plant, packing them in tightly and then filling the bucket with water.Set it aside for three weeks , then strain off the liquid into a container with a tight lid. When you want to feed your plants, dilute the liquid with water at a ratio of around : and feed your plants weekly into autumn."},{"url":null,"title":"gardening-10-best-gardens-visit-summer","story":"Still short of things to do during summer holidays  Why not visit some of our most glorious gardens, which have reopened to the public.They all detail the Covid- safety measures theyve put in place on their websites.

Therersquos a general acceptance that, rather than sharing culpability with previous generations, we are the ones at whose door it can be laid. Obviously there is a lot of truth in that, as we continue to consume oceans of gas and oil, and despoil the seas with plastic. Yet the culprits for harming nature and tipping it out of kilter can be found in centuries past as well as in the international departure lounges of our airports. We should not shoulder all the blame.Irsquom thinking, as one example in my own backyard, of James V. For all his qualities as a leader he was never as impressive as his father James IV, or even his daughter Mary Queen of Scots. Quite apart from his military deficiencies at the Battle of Solway Moss, James V is the man who introduced , sheep into the Ettrick Valley, to raise money for his ambitious plans. In so doing, he destroyed the ancient Ettrick Forest, in which he and other royals had hunted and killed stags by the barrowload. The kingrsquos flocks arrived a some point after , and it did not take them long to strip the valley of its trees. By our own times, all that was left of this magnicent haven for wildle was a handful of thorn trees and birches. The rest is empty scrubland.I learned about this vandalous act in a newly published collection of essays called A Journey in Landscape Restoration: Carrran Wildwood and Beyond, edited by the biologists Philip and Myrtle Ashmole. Unlike most of the books I read this is not about the past, but about the future. There are almost as many photos as words, but the ones that most vividly illustrate the tale are those taken of the Carrran Valley, in the hills near Moffat.At the end of last century, this was a bleak expanse of severely depleted upland, grazed almost to extinction. A winter photo from  shows it as a dreary unrelieved desert: think of a chocolate brownie and yoursquod be close, though dusted with snow rather than icing sugar. Now, after  years of dedicated work by volunteers, it is growing lush once more. Swathes of native woodland clothe the hillsides, and its increasingly rich undergrowth is attracting an abundance of birds, insects, flowers, fungi and amphibians. The range of moths alone is heart-warming. As before and after images go, the dference could hardly be more striking.Previously you would have been lucky to hear much more than a grouse cackling, or watch a buzzard circling overhead now it is like the RSNO, as a sorts of birdle, from meadow pippits to willow warblers, wrens and winchats, strike up from the branches of native trees: birch, aspen, ash, oak, willow, rowan, hazel, Scots pine and juniper.In a series of pithy pieces,  of those who helped bring about this transformation describe how they went about it. Philip Ashmole originally had the idea to recreate an area of woodland in the Borders that replicated how it would have been before humans arrived. Out of this notion the Wildwood Group was established, which later formed itself into the Borders Forest Trust. On Millennium Day, the trust took ownership of the Carrran Valley, and set to work on creating a wildwood.In subsequent years, other ecological restoration schemes were also begun, at Corehead and Devilrsquos Beef Tub, and Talla and Gameshope. Together these groundbreaking ventures began to restore an area they have named The Wild Heart of Southern Scotland. Inspired by their example, others are now following their lead across the country.Living as I do in one of the great medieval sheep rearing districts of the Borders, in the vicinity of Melrose Abbey, itrsquos not hard to see the effect  and more years of grazing have had on the landscape. As one of the contributors to this book writes, sheep are engrained in our economy and culture, and they are the main reason, along with other herbivores such as voles, deer, goats and rabbits, why native woodland planting is rare: ldquoItrsquos no mystery: sheep eat trees. As flocks expanded, their predators ndash wolves and lynx ndash were killed, so that today other grazers, and especially deer, roam and breed without any natural check.The Borders Forest Trustrsquos vision was aided by bodies like the Forestry Commission and Scottish Natural Heritage, but its core remained a motivated army of volunteers.

The film has been more-or-less finished for almost a year, but like many films such as the latest Bond, it has been pushed back due to the coronavirus pandemic. Originally scheduled for July , the film has been delayed three times and even briefly taken off the roster entirely, triggering worried chatter from film fans.But now itrsquos finally coming out The filmrsquos producersrsquo Warner Bros. have announced Tenet will be releasing in  countries, a list that notably includes South Korea, Germany and the UK, but not the United States. The odds are in favour of the film debuting in Scotlandrsquos cinemas on August  as the producers have likely already lost signicant sums due to repeated postponements.Whatrsquos it all about Under Nolanrsquos all-seeing-eye, the cast and crew have taken a vow of silence on the inner workings of the film. Piecing together clues from trailers and marketing packages, the basic outline of the film appears to centre around the protagonist, played by John David Washington , who works for a shady organisation called Tenet. Washington is tasked with preventing global catastrophe by securing a device that seems able to reverse the flow of time: for example, the trailer features a car crash occurring in reverse, and a building littered in bullet holes from a shoot-out that hasnrsquot yet occurred. For those familiar with Nolanrsquos work, time-meddling will come as no surprise.Time-meddling  Can you be more specic Nolan is famous for fiddling with the flow of time in unconventional ways in many of his movies. Interstellar uses Einsteinrsquos theory of Relativity to show Matthew McConaugheyrsquos character, aboard a super-fast spaceship, experience a slower rate of time than his family back home on Earth, as McConaughey is tragically forced to watch decades pass for his family within the space of a few hours.Inception is infamously indecipherable due to its complicated concept of lsquodreams within dreamsrsquo, where the flow of time slows throughout each new lsquolayerrsquo of dreams. His early work, Memento, throws the concept of watchability almost out the window with the scenes arranged lsquoback-to-frontrsquo and the plot occurring in reverse.So itrsquos going to be totally incomprehensible then Probably not. Most of Nolanrsquos blockbusters are very accessible such as his last big release, Dunkirk, or his acclaimed Dark Knight Batman trilogy. Though his films sometimes contain confusing concepts, they are still an enjoyable experience, especially in the distraction-free cinema environment.Is it worth going to see then If you enjoy Nolanrsquos previous work or the action or thriller genres, itrsquos the film for you. And of course, the film features the biggest and best of Hollywoodrsquos blockbuster glitz, glamour, soundtrack and special effects. Remember to come prepared with sweets and drinks for a two-and-a-half-hour runtime.FINLAY SCOTT"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-responds-accusations-politicised-covid-briefings","story":"The First Minister said the broadcasts, which reach , viewers across twoBBC channels, were too important to stop at a crucial stage in the pandemic.She said: ldquoThe ability to stand and look down this camera and give people the advice that we all need to follow to keep this pandemic under control, I think is really important.ldquoAnd it continues to be important because we are not out of this.

It is not yet clear how often that sampling will be conducted.Mr Swinney has said the enhanced testing regime would be run in conjunction with the current test-and-protect system, which covers the entire population and was launched in May.Scotlandrsquos health secretary, Jeane Freeman announced on May  that all , care home staff would be offered weekly tests to help cut infections in homes, the site of around half of Scotlandrsquos Covid deaths. But the Scottish Government have since been beset with problems in addressing that.Ross Greer, the Scottish Greens education spokesman raised concerns about the direction for schools saying that what is planned is not regular testingand will not be offered to every teacher and older pupil ans believes teachers should get the same protection as footballers.ldquoRegular testing has proven to signicantly reduce transmission of the virus, precisely because it involves testing those who are not symptomatic. We now know enough about this virus to say that many infectious people show no symptoms, but containing the spread is dependent on identying and directing them to self-isolate,\" he said.ldquoTeachers and support staff are anxious about ing to crowded schools where pupils are not required to socially distance. The Scottish Greens proposed regular testing a month ago to offer them some reassurance. If footballers can be tested regularly, teachers deserve the right level of protection as well.A survey by the NASUWT teachers union Teachersrsquo Union published earlier this month revealed that nearly half of teachers who responded did not feel prepared toto their school or college in August and just % said they feel safe or very safe as a result of the provisions their employer was putting in place to mitigate the risks of Covid-.Ross Greer.The survey, which examined the experiences of over  teachers in Scotland during the lockdown and in preparing for wider reopening from the start of the new academic year in August, found concerns about a lack of PPE and adequate safety measures to protect staff and pupils in schools and colleges.Larry Flanagan, general secretary of Scotlands largest teaching union, the Educational Institute of Scotland , said: ldquoMany teachers will be concerned about their personal safetyschools reopen in August with a full pupil . One of the reassurances which the EIS has sought from the Scottish Government is a comprehensive approach to testing which proactively monitors schools and facilitates swt intervention where risks arise. That is what we expect to be delivered.:Coronavirus - Swinney sets out plan for full-time schools in colossal U turnMr Swinney told MSPs earlier this week that the testing that will be provided will \"ensure we are properly and fully monitoring any changes in patterns that may emerge as a consequence of the re-opening of schools.\"He has referred to the plan as a \"layer of surveillance testing that will be available within our schools to enable us to have a reassurance that there is an effective approach being undertaken to identied any changing pattern of Covid and enable us to take action accordingly should that arise\".He added: \"If there are positive cases identied within schools, there will have to be the wider contact tracing work that is undertaken and follow-up action as a consequence. And schools will be required to be in touch with public health authorities should such circumstances arise.\"It has also been revealed that the guidance for schools makes clear that two confirmed positive cases in a school within a -day period would be defined as an official incident.Mr Swinney talked of arrangements ontesting and positive cases in schools after being quizzed about details descirbed by one MSP asstill vague and addinganxiety in school communities.Shetland Islands MSP Beatrice Wishart MSP raisedprotocols in New Zealand, where a school or early learning service that has one confirmed or probable case of Covid- must close for  hours to allow contact tracing and then, potentially, for a further  days.He said: \"The answer to that question has to be set within the general context of what is becoming increasingly obvious, which is that the test and protect approach in Scotland is very effective, as we have seen vividly in a couple of examples in Dumfries and Galloway and, more recently, in Lanarkshire, where inidual positive cases have been identied and the test and protect arrangements have come into play.\"Contact tracing is undertaken and iniduals are required to isolate. In those examples, we have seen clear evidence that the tracing system is working effectively to follow up contacts. That would be no dferent in an educational setting from what it would be in any other setting in our society.\"He said that on a daily basis, when information arises about positive cases, health protection teams around the country seek information about connections between those cases in order that they can identy possible clustering of activity.In response the Scottish Government produced a statement saying: ldquoGuidance agreed by the Education Recovery Group on the health mitigations and precautions that will be in place when schools re-open will be published [on Thursday]. Testing will be a vital part of those mitigations and, as always, we will be guided by the best and most up to date scientic evidence.The test-and-protect programme asks those with coronavirus symptoms to provide details of ldquoall recent close contacts to a team of NHS contact tracers.

The disruption it has caused is almost unimaginable, and it is far from over yet. We are a long way from knowing the final cost, both in human and economic terms.Yet ndash in one sense at least - it could have been far worse. The global economy has suffered a massive shock, but not total meltdown. That is because technology did its job. Networks and the internet proved resilient enough to cope. The task was huge, but they proved up to it.This robustness was due to the vision of technology companies such as BT Scotland. Its digital rollout has continued at pace in recent years, keeping it ahead of the curve and able to meet demand when most needed.As we move forward into the new normal, it aims to continue being ahead of the curve. Alan Lees, who is BT Scotlandrsquos Director, is charged with meeting the needs not just of the present, but of the future.He points to BTrsquos signicant recent investment: through its mobile arm EE, for example, G now covers more than  per cent of the countryrsquos landmass, double what it was just two years ago.When Covid- struck, he says, the company was able to respond quickly. ldquoThe first thing we did was to make sure we looked after our people and were providing a safe environment for them.ldquoWe also ensured our critical national infrastructure customers were taken care of. We let them know we were there to help them. It was vital for keeping the country going.BT Scotland was able to continue with its programme of investment during the crisis and to make plans for the post-Covid future, including the expansion and refurbishment of its Glasgow office.There is, he says, going to be more of a focus on the green economy and the environment going forward and the company will be reacting to that.ldquoWe need to look at how to use networks to develop new technologies and create new jobs and opportunities. Therersquos a lot there for us to work with, both in terms of the public and private sector.ldquoFor instance, wersquore looking at G rollout in social care and health and assessing the environmental agenda. We are also investing pound billion at a group level in digital fibre.ldquoIn the private sector, our customers are having to ersy and innovate to stay viable and we want to be involved in that. We are well-equipped to be at the forefront ofall this.Lees believes one outcome of the current crisis for BT will be an even stronger investment in people, bringing them together in one place and collaborating to generate new ideas and innovation.ldquoIf you look at the number of employees we have ndash more than  in Scotland - and the impact we have on the economy, that will hopefully also disseminate itself out into the country.BT now sees itself as a solutions and technology company, Lees adds. ldquoThe network is there, but we want to make sure that we innovate to take it to the next level. We also see big opportunities in G and areas such as remote health diagnosis, including from ambulances.He believes G will be genuinely transformative, helping in areas such as public service efficiency. ldquoIt brings the ability to obtain real time data and know when things are happening. That means you are armed with the knowledge to make the right interventions at the right time.Another big area of digital opportunity is education. The companyrsquos Skills for Tomorrow programme is an ambitious plan to enable  million people to have the digital skills they need by .Another BT digital venture, Barefoot Computing, is aimed at encouraging primary school age children to learn and thrive in a digital world. It has reached  per cent of Scottish schools, the highest level in the UK.ldquoItrsquos all about fostering real outcomes. Teaching people the skills they need at a young age is going to be really vital. Itrsquos a great starting point.ldquoWe also have a responsibility as a society to ensure that we present opportunities to our younger people for them to develop themselves and ensure that those skills arenrsquot wasted or lost to the country.ldquoIn terms of organisations, I think a lot of them havenrsquot realised yet that they are lagging behind in areas such as cyber security.ldquoItrsquos for BT to wake them up to this and to partner with them to make sure they have the right skills ndash and the country has the right skills - to take advantage of opportunities.One big effect of Covid-, Lees adds, is that it has completely changed perceptions of timeframes. In areas such as online conferencing, for example, anticipated take-up over perhaps  to  months happened in weeks instead.ldquoWersquove realised what the art of the possible actually is when everyone pulls together with the right partnerships and the right type of collaboration.ldquoThe normal we had before is torn up now. With support, companies were able to quickly move  people from a call centre to working at home. I think that will change the way they see themselves.In the longer term, Lees sees BT Scotland as being at the centre of the continuing digital revolution.Covid- has created a growing awareness of the importance of crisis response, and the companyrsquos experience in connecting organisations such as NHS Scotland, the Ministry of Defence, Police Scotland and the  service will prove invaluable in offering new solutions.ldquoIf you think back to March, everything just happened so quickly, but we realised that supporting the network infrastructure was the most important thing. It was absolutely crucial even in saving lives.ldquoWe were able to offer comfort and support to patients and their families. It was just the rightthing to do."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11455725.jpg?type=article-full","title":"nicola-sturgeon-ranked-fifth-list-worlds-eloquent-leaders","story":"Experts who drew up the listby

It will take place on October .Nomination forms are now available and these can be lodged with the council from August  and by August .Interim chief executive with the council John Mundell said: “If you have considered standing for election in the past, or feel that you could contribute now to local government in Orkney, this is a great opportunity to serve the community and gain some experience as a councillor until the next local government elections take place again in May .“I would encourage everyone who feels they may be able to contribute to the local democratic process to consider standing as a candidate in this by-election.”The North Isles ward is served by three councillors. Along with councillor Woodbridge, councillor Graham Sinclair and councillor Stephen Clackson were elected at the last council election.Councillor Sinclair said: “Being a north isles councillor is a challenging yet rewarding and very ied post to hold. I find it very satisfying when you can help a ward member with their problems, making the necessary connections to the services they require, or raising an issue that an isles community is facing.“I live on the mainland and I don’t feel this has been a disadvantage to me, as I have lived in the isles for many years previously.

They are also being reminded that there is local support available to them should they find themselves to be the victims of the issue.NFU Scotland Orkney#s regional policy advisor Kerry Omand said: “If anyone finds themselves to be in this unfortunate position there are key steps that they need to take and responsibilities that livestock owners have. I believe that the public are very aware of their rights and responsibilities as dog owners, and our members need to have the same knowledge and confidence in dealing with these situations.”The legislation relating to this is the DogsAct  and #worrying# is defined as attacking livestock, chasing livestock in such a way as may reasonably be expected to cause injury or suffering to the livestock or abortion as well as being at large, not otherwise under close control or on a lead, in a field or enclosure where there are livestock.Kerry highlighted: “There is often an assumption that an attack or incident must be physical for it to be taken seriously, and that is simply not the case as signicant harm can be caused to animals without any direct contact occurring.”If farmers come across an incident of livestock worrying they should contact the police on the incident is ongoing, or dial  to report the incident, try to contain the dogpossible and gather their livestock for treatment and or retain any dead livestock as evidence. Finally, a dog must only be shot as a last resortthey cannot be contained and this should be reported to the police within  hours.Kerry added: “I completely empathise with members who find themselves in this situation, having been the victim of livestock worrying myself. This was a few years ago now, but from that experience I would encourage farmers to gather evidencethey can, in the form of photos or videos of the incident occurring. That may seem like an unnatural thing to do when you are wanting to put an end to the incident as quickly as possible, but it also crucial to have this evidence to hand.”Mark Evans, animal welfare officer with Orkney Islands Council wants to remind dog owners to ensure that their dogs are always under control and avoid going into fields where livestock are grazing.He said“If a dog worries livestock on any agricultural land then the owner and or the person in charge of the dog, is guilty of a criminal offence.”Mark reiterates “Farmers should make every effort to catch the dogit is worrying livestock and it is only as a last resort to shoot the dogit is not able to be caught. This needs to be reported to the Police and to the Councils Trading Standards Service.”Orkney preventions and interventions officer with Police Scotland, Constable Simon Hay said: “The worrying of livestock can have devastating consequences for farm animals and has an obvious financial and emotional impact on farmers and their businesses.“The advice to dog owners or anyone walking and exercising their dogs in the countryside is to ensure they are under control at all times and avoid going into fields where livestock is grazing. The Scottish Outdoor Access Code says dogs should not be taken into fields where there are lambs or other young farm animals.#Police Scotland will enforce the existing legislation robustly, ensuring all reported cases of sheep worrying are thoroughly investigated and offenders reported to the Procurator Fiscal. Farmers and those who use the countryside are urged to report all incidents of livestock worrying to police on  or  in an emergency.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

If a contact is in a high risk category, a decision may be taken to immediately test them for coronavirus.#If you do not receive a call from our contact tracing team, then basically you#ve not been in signicant contact with this inidual,# the interim chief executive said.It is not knownthis case will be included in NHS Orkney’s positive COVID cases as the original lab is not an NHS facility.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.I’d we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3221834.jpg--.jpg?1594293881000\n","title":"patricia ready to steer inner wheel","story":"BALLYMENA’S Patricia Perry, has been appointed as all Ireland Chairman of the Inner Wheel Organisation.

Colourful flower beds and neatly mown grass has been the focus of their attention - until now.  Following permission from the Mid and East Antrim Council, the park has just acquired a beautully sculpted horse made entirely from horse shoes. This is a unique piece of art which has given the village something to appreciate and be proud of. The creator of this horse is Bertie McNeilly, who is a leading member of the village Bloom team. He is a self taught sculptor who created this le size sculpture using nothing but recycled horseshoes. The shoes were supplied by a local farrier.

They are all made by people living in and around the Cullybackey area and each have their unique style.  This display can be seen in the Maine Business Centre window . The idea came from local lady Barbara Montgomery who assisted CCP Margaret Murphy to put together this amazing display.Margaret said as well as taking the opportunity to recognise the NHS and all support workers, she would like to thank the Cullybackey people who have taken time to knit or crochet hundreds of flowers to enable them to “put on this amazing display.”CCP have continued throughout this lockdown period to enhance the village with numerous floral displays which has resulted in the village looking amazing!

But it#s not the same as seeing them in the flesh. However, I am determined to keep pressing ahead with my efforts to get Liz and her mum over here.Liz was born in Vietnam in November last year and I set about planning to bring her and her mum here.However, the global pandemic is playing havoc with his dream.He added: Not only were there the health concerns about coronavirus and travelling, but there#s now also a backlog everywhere you turn, whether it be for visas or passports.There#s a lot of red tape but the authorities in Dublin have assured me they are going to do everything they can.I was hoping my partner and my daughter could be here by Christmas.But, realistically, I don#t think it#s going to happen before .It#s really frustrating. I am watching Liz grow up on Skype but I know I#m missing out on seeing her getting bigger every day. It was in April  that Vance was evacuated as part of Operation Babylt from Saigon and he came to live in Northern Ireland, where he was adopted by Cyril and Liz McElhinney, who raised him along with their two other sons David and Stephen.In  they supported histo the country of his birth in a bid to find his biological parents and a BBC NI documentary team followed him. Although he discovered the orphanage where he had lived, he was unable to trace his family.However, after he came back he started to receive messages on social media from people who claimed they were his relations and knew his widowed mother.I was worried that it might all be a hoax, said Vance.But when he went back to Vietnam on a scheduled trip he was introduced to a woman called Le Thi Anh, who insisted she was his mother.I was gobsmacked, and DNA testing later established that I was indeed her son, he added.Around the same time he met and fell in love with a woman called Le Hang.He said: I met Le through a charity that I set up to help disabled and orphaned children in Vietnam. She came on a visit to see the work that we were doing for the youngsters and we hit it off quickly.Though I couldn#t speak Vietnamese we communicated through French and we also used a translation site on the internet.I#ve been back to Vietnam and we realised we wanted to be together. We got engaged in  and in November last year Le had our baby. We#re now planning to get married in Northern Ireland as soon as possible.Vance and his partner called the baby Liz after his adoptive mother, who was a well-known cleric in Lurgan and who died nearly three years ago from motor neurone disease.Vance is still coming to terms with another familial shock after he found out he has a half-sister in Australia who he knew nothing about. A few months ago I got a call from a woman Down Under who said she was my half-sister and DNA tests have borne out her claims. But it#s been a real surprise to cope with, though we#ve been in contact a few times, said resourceful Vance, who has recently been celebrating the success of an invention aimed at dog lovers.His dog dock, which allows pet owners to secure their animals safely outside shops, has been bought by around  businesses, particularly around Lurgan, where it can be found attached to exterior walls at service stations and cafes.He explained: I#ve been working on the dog dock for four years now. I always thought it was a hassle that I couldn#t find somewhere to tie up my late Staffordshire bull terrier Keltic when I went into shops and my brother David suggested that I should come up with a device to get round the problem.I drew up plans for a fairly crude first prototype and got it made up in a factory in Vietnam. Invest NI gave him a development grant of £, and a design engineer at a college in Portadown came up with a more sophisticated model for the dog dock, which was then manufactured in a local engineering factory.The first dog dock, which costs £, went up outside a supermarket in Waringstown. Although he#s happy that the feedback from businesses and even caravan owners has been positive, he says the pandemic has restricted his ability to market his invention properly.I#ve now applied to the TV show Dragons# Den to seeI can get a slot on the programme and find an investor there, Vance added.

Operators able to demonstrate excellent equipment and resources would score five out of five.Northstone was ranked first in one of the eight contracts it tendered for, coming second or third in all the rest.Another firm who bid for seven contacts obtained top ranking in six.The court heard that company was awarded five out of five responses despite identical submissions and duplicating personnel and plant for each competition.This apparently meant it could provide site engineers for four contracts at most.A meeting involving departmental officials to discuss multiple awards was held in September , but no minutes were provided.Mr Justice Horner said he had dficulty understanding why no record of any discussion about the issue of duplication in the six contracts was available.This is a telling omission, he said.If minutes had been taken and lost I would have expected to be told this in no uncertain terms.The other alternative explanations are that there are minutes but that as these undermine DRD#s defence they have not been disclosed.Alternatively, the decision to keep no minutes was a deliberate one because DRD was fearful of creating a hostage to fortune.Neither of these explanations reflect well on DRD.The court was told the Department - and the Northern Ireland Civil Service in Northern Ireland - had no policy for when meetings should be recorded.If correct, the judge stressed, plans need to be drawn up.The DRD should be accountable to the tax payer and its decision should be transparent and lawful, he said.The records of its meetings, especially where they relate to the award of contracts worth millions of pounds, should be accurately minuted as a matter of course.In this instance I was offered no explanation other than it was informal meeting. I do not accept that this an adequate or acceptable explanation.Ultimately, the firm which achieved top-ranking for six of the contracts withdrew from two of them.According to the judge it never intended to be successful in all tenders, and was probably as surprised as the Department at the outcome of the competitions.That company#s actions spared the DRD its blushes, allowing the resurfacing awards to be announced.Northstone is seeking damagesit can prove the Department acted unlawfully in the awards to other contractors.But at this stage Mr Justice Horner was only dealing with any flaws in the marking process, and an alleged breach of equal treatment in resolving concerns about a capacity to perform multiple contracts.He ruled that the Department should have been alert to the rival firm#s inability to perform more than four contracts.Competition rules were found to be opaque, imprecise, equivocal and lacking in detail.A company won six out out of the seven contracts bid for with identical tenders, the judge pointed out, but only had the resources for four.There was a manest error made by the DRD in giving... a mark of excellence in two answers in three contracts, the judge held.The department then permitted it to withdraw from two of them before the awards were made.The treatment of the unsuccessful runners-up was unequal and discriminatory, he added.With the firm able to select which contracts it would carry out, Mr Justice Horner said the treatment of unsuccessful runners-up had been discriminatory.He concluded: There was a lack of transparency, unequal treatment and breach of the principle of non-discrimination.

I call on Tui and other employers to engage with our union so we can jointly lobby Government for this to happen.”PAMost ReadSacking of Dunnes manager #who ate food worth £ was justied#Widow of surgeon Kyle McDonald recalls #phenomenal husband and father# in moving tribute Revealed: The NI restaurants offering discounts under Covid- support schemeBelfast woman Christine Connor found guilty of attempting to murder police officerChristine Connor: Tale of a lone wolf terrorist who stole identity of Swedish model to entrap men in murderous plot like something from a Hollywood blockbuster,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Parish priest Fr Eamon Graham was delighted to see the community coming together. “Weve just come to end of a very extraordinary week in our parish and community,” he said. “Ive certainly been overwhelmed - I think we all have - by the level of generosity, but I think something even more important was that so many aspects of our community pulled together. googletag.cmd.push “You know, we enjoyed it, enjoyed it very much.

Conor McGintys latest single Home To The Heartland recently topped the iTunes World Music Chart and has won praise from some of the citys most famous sons and daughters. After being sent a preview of the song footballer James McClean described it as brilliant, while Sinn Fein MLA Martina Anderson said it was a soulful and heartfelt tribute to Derry.This is without doubt the proudest I have been about any song I have ever released or recorded and to make it even more special I wrote the song myself, said Conor.I penned this song as a modern day Derry anthem along with the exquisite musical skills of Eamonn Karran.It has a Celtic pop twist to it and people seem to really like it.“Home To The Heartland” is written from the perspective of a Derry emigrant ing home and mentions many local landmarks such as Shipquay Street and Ebrington.Conor had been due to marry his fiancee Aisling this year, but the wedding has now been cancelled twice due to lockdown.Writing this song is probably the only good thing to come out of lockdown for me, said Conor.Ashaving to cancel your wedding once wasn’t hard enough to take, having to do it for a second time two months later was even worse.I think this year will be remembered by so many as an absolute kick in the teeth for so many dferent reasons.Conor says entertainers are struggling to find work due to the current government restrictions. googletag.cmd.push Something needs to be done to prevent the arts and entertainment sector falling through itself in the next few months, he said.It provides work to so much more than just the singer or musician. We all have bills, we all need to find ways to make an income and there is only so much adaptation you can do. We are applying for jobs but when you have been a self employed musician for years it is hard to get your foot in the door anywhere that isn’t in the entertainment sector.Id like Stormount to please try and think outside the box - It has become desperate times for many. googletag.cmd.push We will look forward to our wedding next year in September but in the meantime it would be great to be able to go back to work and provide.Put a screen up in front of me while I sing for all I care!‘Home to the Heartland’ is currently available on iTunes, Spoty and Amazon.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ballerin have been paired in the other section with Doire Colmcille, Ardmore and Sean Dolans who have struggled to find any kind of form in recent seasons. Craigbane v MagilliganFriday– BanagherRef: Emmet McShane James McGrath s as Craigbane boss, but points to a lack of action in what he describes as a trying season for the players. googletag.cmd.push They learnt a tough lesson against Tyrone side Naomh Eoghan, an amalgamation of Dregish and Newtownstewart. It was their first game since February . Lee Moore ed from Australia but transferred to Dublin club Thomas Davis to train. He is back with his native Craigbane but is on the injured list. He is joined by Bliain Gormley, who made had initially made it back from a gruelling injury. John Kerlin has ed from Australia, but like the rest of the squad is lacking game time. Craigbane have brought through underage talent in recent seasons. Fergal Mortimer in attack is an important player and will be joined this year by Jude Oacuteg Moore and Jude McLaughlin, who has been their main man in attack. googletag.cmd.push Brian Rainey remains as as experienced player, who has coached many of the players coming up through the ranks. In defence Naoise Oacute Mianaacutein, Oisin McCloskey and Conor McLaughlin have made it though and will line out in front of goalkeeper Conor McGuinness. They face Magilligan this weekend, who have former Derry underage player Shane Kealey from Faughanvale in charge, with another Vale man Kevin Morrow and Eamon McLaughlin. Kealey hails the quality of the , while he lamented how small it is. It looks like they will be without Colly Mullan who ended up on crutches after an injury at training. A knee injury has also kept Ciaran OHare out this season. After a good preseason, Kealey has struggled to get challenge games and the latest lockdown after the recent Covid- cases in the local Limavady area hampered their progress further. The Joe Brolly Cup wont be won or lost on Friday night, but the loser will be on the back foot as one team from the group will drop out the race. There shouldnt be much in it, but Craigbane should come through. VERDICT: Craigbane Desertmartin v MoneymoreFriday– LoupRef: Cathal Doherty There is a local derby on Friday night, with Desertmartin and Moneymore crossing paths. Both clubs have new managers. Cookstowns Jason Quinn is at the helm in Moneymore, with clubmate Daire Cummings along with him. They were dealt a blow with goalkeeper Liam Macinnes sustaining a broken leg in training, leaving Derry Chairman Stephen Barker and Padraig Donaghy vying for the number one jersey. Rory Young hasnt committed this season and while Paudie ONeill is back out helping with training, its uncertainhe willto the action on the pitch. Quinn reckons their team this weekend could have  or  players under the age of . Oisin ONeill, Cian ONeill and Abban McCloy have broken into the team in recent years. This season Deaglan Mallon and Lee Colville have joined the . Desertmartin brought in Slaughtneil duo Kevin ONeill and Chrissy McKaigue as their managers, who are assisted by Danny Murray and Ciaran Higgins. The Saffrons have dropped down from the intermediate grade and outside of Ronan McGuckins serious ankle injury sustained early in the season, ONeill report a clean bill of health including Enda McGuckin who has had injury problems. Gavin Donnelly and Eunan McElhennon made their debut last season, with Callum Ormsby coming into the fold this year. In a group where one team will drop out of the championship, there will be a certain bite to all the games. Desertmartin should come through this one.

Craigbane v MagilliganFriday– BanagherRef: Emmet McShane James McGrath s as Craigbane boss, but points to a lack of action in what he describes as a trying season for the players. googletag.cmd.push They learnt a tough lesson against Tyrone side Naomh Eoghan, an amalgamation of Dregish and Newtownstewart. It was their first game since February . Lee Moore ed from Australia but transferred to Dublin club Thomas Davis to train. He is back with his native Craigbane but is on the injured list. He is joined by Bliain Gormley, who made had initially made it back from a gruelling injury. John Kerlin has ed from Australia, but like the rest of the squad is lacking game time. Craigbane have brought through underage talent in recent seasons. Fergal Mortimer in attack is an important player and will be joined this year by Jude Oacuteg Moore and Jude McLaughlin, who has been their main man in attack. googletag.cmd.push Brian Rainey remains as as experienced player, who has coached many of the players coming up through the ranks. In defence Naoise Oacute Mianaacutein, Oisin McCloskey and Conor McLaughlin have made it though and will line out in front of goalkeeper Conor McGuinness. They face Magilligan this weekend, who have former Derry underage player Shane Kealey from Faughanvale in charge, with another Vale man Kevin Morrow and Eamon McLaughlin. Kealey hails the quality of the , while he lamented how small it is. It looks like they will be without Colly Mullan who ended up on crutches after an injury at training. A knee injury has also kept Ciaran OHare out this season. After a good preseason, Kealey has struggled to get challenge games and the latest lockdown after the recent Covid- cases in the local Limavady area hampered their progress further. The Joe Brolly Cup wont be won or lost on Friday night, but the loser will be on the back foot as one team from the group will drop out the race. There shouldnt be much in it, but Craigbane should come through. VERDICT: Craigbane Desertmartin v MoneymoreFriday– LoupRef: Cathal Doherty There is a local derby on Friday night, with Desertmartin and Moneymore crossing paths. Both clubs have new managers. Cookstowns Jason Quinn is at the helm in Moneymore, with clubmate Daire Cummings along with him. They were dealt a blow with goalkeeper Liam Macinnes sustaining a broken leg in training, leaving Derry Chairman Stephen Barker and Padraig Donaghy vying for the number one jersey. Rory Young hasnt committed this season and while Paudie ONeill is back out helping with training, its uncertainhe willto the action on the pitch. Quinn reckons their team this weekend could have  or  players under the age of . Oisin ONeill, Cian ONeill and Abban McCloy have broken into the team in recent years. This season Deaglan Mallon and Lee Colville have joined the . Desertmartin brought in Slaughtneil duo Kevin ONeill and Chrissy McKaigue as their managers, who are assisted by Danny Murray and Ciaran Higgins. The Saffrons have dropped down from the intermediate grade and outside of Ronan McGuckins serious ankle injury sustained early in the season, ONeill report a clean bill of health including Enda McGuckin who has had injury problems. Gavin Donnelly and Eunan McElhennon made their debut last season, with Callum Ormsby coming into the fold this year. In a group where one team will drop out of the championship, there will be a certain bite to all the games. Desertmartin should come through this one.

Getting active is good for your body and mind, and there are lots of easy ways to get active. Taking a brisk walk every day will help shed the pounds, but there is nothing better than heading out into the great outdoors to take in some of the wonderful countryside and coastal sites close to home. There are fabulous woodlands, beaches and picnic spots everywhere. And you don’t have to just go walking. Cycling has become ever more popular during lockdown and swimming in rivers and lakes is another wonderful way to get the blood pumping and improve your health. A survey taken at the start of lockdown revealed that one in four of us admitted that we were more active than before lockdown.  THE GREAT OUTDOORS: Walking helps you to stay fit and healthy This increased to one in three as lockdown continued, with combatting lockdown weight gain and helping mental health given as the top reasons many people are turning to some form of physical exercise. There is so much to choose from to keep you active from dusk to dawn. From aerial assault courses to horse riding treks, there is a massive range of outdoor family activities and endless possibilities for days out packed with family-friendly outdoor activities. No matter where you are, lakes and waterways make for not only incredibly scenic views but also cover a whole range of activities. The United Kingdom’s  National Parks also contain some of the nation’s most beautul and inspiring landscapes. You’ll find some of the best walking, cycling and horse riding locations and a whole host of other adventure activities in the spectacular parks. Add nearly  Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and you’ll find you’re spoilt for choice when it comes to exploring our famous countryside and keeping fit. NOTE: Please keep in mind that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently have dferent guidelines, advice and timelines for reopening tourism. So do please make sure you check the respective official sources for information before you travel. CHECK OUT WHAT YOU NEED TO STAY SAFE Whether you are heading for the hills, planning a coastal stroll or fancy splashing about in the sea or a lake, make sure you take time to check out what you need to do to stay safe. Visit www.discovernorthernirelandto learn more about heading outdoors safely. All you need to have a great time is a pair of shoes and a spirit of adventure Northern Ireland is a place made for walkers – whether you’re a take-it-easy rambler or a hardcore trekker. All you need is a good pair of shoes and a spirit of adventure and you’re set to go. With stunning views, rugged clfs and wide-open spaces, there’s always something to inspire you around the corner, across that river or up the next hill. The Mourne Mountains are a spectacular sight to behold, while the breath-taking Causeway Coastal Route and the Glens of Antrim feature three Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Walkers in Belfast get the best of both worlds. Colourful parks and peaceful towpaths show you a side of the city you can only fully experience on foot.  STUNNING SCENERY: Sketrick Island in Strangford Loch  The impressive Belfast Hills and Lagan Valley Regional Park delight with river paths and panoramic views. Elsewhere, the Sperrins, stretching from Strabane in County Tyrone to the shores of Lough Neagh, are one of Northern Ireland’s largest upland areas. Wild, untouched and exceptionally beautul, it is also an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. If you’re a serious walker, you’ll love the adventure of discovering moorland summits using routes such as Robbers Table and the Craignamaddy Circuit. And there are many more places to discover such as the mostly flat walks on the banks of Strangford Lough and in the Fermanagh Lakelands. Getting physical every day Adults should aim to be physically active every day. They should attempt to do strengthening activities that work all the major muscles in the legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders and arms on at least two days a week. It is also recommended that people do at least  minutes of moderately intense activity every week, or  minutes of vigorously intense activity a week. However, people need to make sure the type and intensity of activity is appropriate for their level of fitness, and take medical advicenecessary.  KEEPING FIT: Jogging, cycling and swimming are good for your health and are enjoyable too Moderate activity such as brisk walking, riding a bike and hiking will raise your heart rate, and make you breathe faster and feel warmer. One way to tellyou’re working at a moderate intensity level isyou can still talk, but not sing. Vigorous-intensity activity makes you breathe hard and fast. If you’re working at this level, you will not be able to say more than a few words without pausing for breath. In general,  minutes of vigorous-intensity activity can give similar health benefits to  minutes of moderate-intensity activity. Examples of vigorous activities include jogging or running, swimming fast, or riding a bike fast or on hills.

One Big Field Party is being held this Sunday on a large green area beside Creggans Linsfort Drive. The event is free to attend, but donations will be collected for local musicians who have performed for free throughout lockdown to raise money for local charities and people in need. Local charity fundraisers Gavin Gallagher and Steven Gallagher have organised virtual gigs and street parties throughout lockdown with the help of local entertainers which have raised pound, for local good causes. googletag.cmd.push We always wanted to do something like this to say thank you to the local acts who have done so much during lockdown, but we had to wait until the rules had relaxed a bit, explained Gavin Gallagher. Some people have said to us that there have been a few reported cases of coronavirus recently andthat spike continues we will cancel the event. But at the minute we are taking every precaution to make sure everyone is safe, including using  security staff and a team of litter pickers, Mr Gallagher asked those attending the concert to observe social distancing rules. googletag.cmd.push We want people to come and to have a good time but we would ask that they abide by the rules. We are only here to entertain. If everyone does as the security people ask then everyone can have a good time. Lockdown has proved very challenging for Derrys entertainment community, with many losing all their income overnight. I would say about % of the musicians I know do it as their full time job and they lost everything, said Mr Gallagher. Many of those that were eligible for government support got so little that it was hardly worth their while. Despite this, they continued to gig online to keep peoples spirits up and raise money for charity. We hosted street parties across the city that made a really big dference to people in those areas. There was one wee woman of  who stood at her window crying and waving out because she was so happy and then she sent her son out with a donation of pound. Another time we heard about a woman who was turning  and we had singers up performing at her doorstep for an hour.One Big Field Party will take place on Sunday from pm to pm at Linsfort Drive.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Former Foyle College pupil Katie Smith landed her dream job at innovative Belgravia eaterie Wild by Tart last year at just -years-old. But after seven months in her new position, the restaurant had to shut for lockdown and Katie had to to leave her glamorous London le behind and move back in with her parents on the Limavady Road. Katie always had ambitions to work in the food industry and went to study at the prestigious Ballymaloe private cookery school in Cork straight after leaving school at . googletag.cmd.push My parents were really supportive of my decision, but my twin sister Abbie took a dferent route and went to Edinburgh University to study French and Spanish so in a way I can see the le I might have had, she explained. Having a trained pastry chef in the house definitely has its advantages. Im the resident chef in the house and Im doing most of the lunches and dinners, but thankfully not the breakfasts, laughed Katie. Coming from a high pressure job to being temporarily out of work was a big change of pace for Katie and she decided to launch a cookery e-book to fill her time. googletag.cmd.push I loved my job and I was learning so much from the people I was working with and then all of a sudden Boris told people not to go to restaurants and the bookings just dried up, she recalled. I remember on the Wednesday we had to close and on the Thursday I came home. I didnt expect to be home as long as this to be honest, and I like to keep busy so I decided to do something dferent. I was doing recipe testing so I decided to make a recipe ebook with my sister and donate % of the profits to a social enterprise charity Luminary Bakery for disadvantaged women in London. After the success of the ebook Katie decided to launch a pop up bakery from her parents kitchen offering brownies, cookies and pastries for pick up or delivery. As much as I love being at home Im looking forward to when things go back to normal and I can progress my career, she added. Katies recipe ebook is available at www.brilliantbake To order from her pop up bakery email katie@gmail or visit her Brilliant Bake page on Facebook.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

An Air Corps maritime patrol aircraft was dispatched and two Irish naval ships placed on standby after the skipper of the Killybegs-based fishing vessel, the Marliona, reported that a UK frigate ordered him to leave the area where he was fishing  miles off the Irish coast. It is understood that HMS Lancaster hailed the fishing vessel on Tuesday morning, informing the skipper they were commencing a joint operation with a submarine which would continue over the next three days. A maritime aircraft was sent to monitor the area where the UK warship was operating and two Irish naval vessels were redeployed. googletag.cmd.push The Marliona has since resumed fishing in the area which is west off Tory Island. Sinn Feacutein spokesperson on Foreign Affairs and Defence John Brady accused the British Navy of arrogance of the highest order and of once again endangering Irish fishing vessels. Deputy Brady said: “On one level, we have the outrageous scenario of a foreign power ordering an Irish vessel out of Irish waters. On the other, we have a situation where a British warship was engaged in a joint operation with a British submarine. The disregard for Irish sovereignty is arrogance of the highest order. But, alongside this we have the endangerment of Irish fishing vessels and their crews by a British submarine. googletag.cmd.push I thought that we had left this carry-on behind with the Cold War. For decades, British submarines have infringed on Irish sovereign waters, leading to tragedy and loss of le when submarines have got caught up in fishing nets and pulled trawlers under. It is staggering and unacceptable that this flagrant disregard for the safety of Irish fishing crews is continuing. This cannot be allowed to stand. I will ensure that this incident will not be allowed to be swept under the carpet.We need answers as to why this has been allowed to happen. I understand that the Department of Foreign Affairs has launched an investigation into the incident, and I will be in contact with the Minister to ensure that the governments response reflects the seriousness of the matter.  I also want to commend the response of the Irish Navy, which ordered Irish vessels to the area to ensure the safety of the fishing vessel in question. This incident underlines theneed to end the running down of the country’s defence forces and naval service by government.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Moville resident Enda Craig has urged local representatives to wake up and finally end all confusion over the Lough. Mr Craig made the comments following a motion at last weeks monthly meeting of Donegal County Council, where the issue of unregulated oyster fishing was raised. At the meeting in Letterkenny, local councillor Terry Crossan highlighted the environmental and visual impact an estimated , oyster trestles is having on the Lough. The Muff-based councillor asked council officials to contact the Marine Minister to engage with his British counterparts to seek to resolve the jurisdictional issues. googletag.cmd.push However Mr Craig stated that there are no jurisdictional issues between Britain and Ireland as the Crown Estate owns the seabed of Lough Foyle. The lough has been a disputed area between Britain and Ireland since the formation of the Irish Free State in . “You cant claim jurisdiction over something you dont own, its that simple,” he told the Inish Times. The Crown Estate is a collection of lands and holdings within the UK belonging to the British monarch as a corporation. Mr Craig said that the issue of jurisdiction has been settled and that local representatives should recognise that fact. googletag.cmd.push “I know that local representatives deal with numerous issues on a daily basis so they may not understand fully that Ireland has no jurisdiction over the lough at all, but it is time that they waken up and stop claiming jurisdiction over something that they dont own.” He also highlighted the feeling of unequal treatment that traditional oyster fishermen have received over the ongoing unregulated farms dotted along the Lough Foyle coast. “The traditional wild oyster fishermen look on as oysters are being harvested in large numbers on trestles on the shoreline of Lough Foyle by fishermen who are not burdened with a licence fee.” He added: “Any attempt to resolve the issue of licensing on the sea-bed of Lough Foyle without firstly taking into account its ownership by the Crown Estates is putting the cart before the horse and is doomed to failure.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Pam’s recent survey was met with much excitement in the Woodland Trust Northern Ireland team as she found the elusive butterfly, the purple hairstreak, and was able to record its sighting. Pam, who found the rare butterfly right at the end of her weekly survey, said: “I was over the moon to find a purple hairstreak. googletag.cmd.push I was actually photographing a speckled wood that had landed close by when it flew in and landed on a bramble leaf.

Last weekend, Devines  European Rally Championship campaign got off to a frustrating start with an early retirement from Rally di Roma Capitale. Devine and co-driver Brian Hoy had shown promise early on with eighth fastest time in Friday qualying as well as being the quickest Hyundai i R, outpacing works Hyundai driver Craig Breen and fellow Hyundai Motorsport Customer Racing Junior Driver Greacutegoire Munster. On Saturday morning, Devine was running on the fringes of the top  and despite not being fully committed to his pacenotes, was outpacing Hyundai Rally Team Italia driver, and former Italian Champion, Umberto Scandola. googletag.cmd.push “We were slightly disappointed with our start and knew we had much more in us”, said Callum after the event. “We were just starting to get into a flow on stage three and building up speed. To try and be on the pace on these events you have to cut where you can and carry as much speed as possible. There was a fast corner through a dip which we cut and there was a bang as we went over some stones. We didn’t think much of it as it’s not unusual to hear noises like that while cutting a corner. But slowly the engine began to lose oil and then the oil pressure light came on  metres from the finish of the stage, he added. googletag.cmd.push We stopped the engine and coasted over the finish but that was game over. It turned out that in the compression a stone punched through the sumpguard and holed the sump, causing the engine to lose all its oil. I could probably take that corner  times and it would never happen again, it was just a freak thing but when you’re trying that card is always in the deck I suppose. I’m really disappointed for the whole team after all the effort that went into the weekend, I know we would have been in contention for a decent result.” His next European Rally Championship event in Latvia in mid-August and Devine has another chance to show his speed on Italian tarmac this weekend at Rally di Alba, where he joins Kilreas Josh McErlean, the current Young Irish Driver of the Year. Rally di Alba will take place on Sunday, August  with the crews taking on three stages repeated three times with the total competitive mileage of the event coming in at just over km. Following the event Callum and Brian willhome to prepare for Rally Liepāja, the second round of the ERC. “Latvia is a loose surface event andthe year had gone to plan, I would have liked a little more loose surface experience in the Hyundai before this stage of the year but it is what it is”, added Devine. “After a non-score in Rome and the championship having less rounds this year, we’ll need to take points away from Latvia.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

But slowly the engine began to lose oil and then the oil pressure light came on  metres from the finish of the stage, he added. googletag.cmd.push We stopped the engine and coasted over the finish but that was game over. It turned out that in the compression a stone punched through the sumpguard and holed the sump, causing the engine to lose all its oil. I could probably take that corner  times and it would never happen again, it was just a freak thing but when you’re trying that card is always in the deck I suppose. I’m really disappointed for the whole team after all the effort that went into the weekend, I know we would have been in contention for a decent result.” His next European Rally Championship event in Latvia in mid-August and Devine has another chance to show his speed on Italian tarmac this weekend at Rally di Alba, where he joins Kilreas Josh McErlean, the current Young Irish Driver of the Year. Rally di Alba will take place on Sunday, August  with the crews taking on three stages repeated three times with the total competitive mileage of the event coming in at just over km. Following the event Callum and Brian willhome to prepare for Rally Liepāja, the second round of the ERC. “Latvia is a loose surface event andthe year had gone to plan, I would have liked a little more loose surface experience in the Hyundai before this stage of the year but it is what it is”, added Devine. “After a non-score in Rome and the championship having less rounds this year, we’ll need to take points away from Latvia.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Just nine days after this birthday, McErlean travelled to Italy last weekend for the European Championships to support Callum Devine, who will also race in Sundays event, and get his bearings ahead of this weekends action. Last year McErlean won the British Championship and picked up the Billy Coleman award for Irish Young Driver of the Year “This years British Championship was cancelled in June, so our plans were dashed and we had to come up with a plan B,” Josh told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push In stepped Hyundai and the Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy to give him the opportunity in an event with a signicant Hyundai over it. “There are  other Hyundai R cars going, so there is a lot of competition, but it is great to get it,” add McErlean, who will be driving the same car used by Callum Devine in Rally Rome at the weekend. “It is great for the both of us winning the Billy Coleman award, from the same area and it shows you how far you can go with the backing of the Academy.” McErlean will again have the support of co-driver Keaton Williams and Junior British Rally Champion will take on one of the biggest challenges of his career so far, across nine stages on the roads of South West Italy. googletag.cmd.push Rally di Alba begins on Saturday with pre-event reconnaissance and a short shakedown stage near San Martino. The following day, nine stages lie ahead, three repeated, totalling just over  kilometres of special stage action before ing to Alba for the finish ceremony. “It will be a big step up from what I am used to,” Josh admits of this weekends Italian date. “It is something I am not that familiar with and it will be great to see what it is all about. “Callum is a good benchmark, he is from here but he has a few more years experience than me...it will be good to judge my pace off. If I can get close to his times, but we will have to build our pace throughout the rally and see how it goes.” McErlean was only able to complete one round of the series, thanks to the outbreak of the Covid- pandemic which halted motorsport across the UK and Ireland. “It gave me the opportunity to look at things in more detail and see what I would improve on, so maybe it was a good thing,” Josh pointed out. In Decemberraced in Italy, but in a dferent discipline at the Monza Rally Show. “There is some dference in racing around a track and going up a mountain road, but at least it gave me the experience of travelling the country,” McErlean pointed out. This time it is going to dferent. As well as Devine, World Rally Championship stars Ott Taumlnak and Thierry Neuville will be tough nuts to crack. “Im delighted to be able to get back to rallying again and this is such an amazing opportunity for me to be heading to Italy in the Hyundai i R” he added. Tuesday is a day of testing, before a day or recce on Friday to suss out the course for Saturdays shakedown. “Then we have the rally on Sunday, so it is a good format,” Josh feels. “A podium place would be a dream,” he adds, but is realistic. “There is a big entry list, there are three World Rally Drivers doing it so it is nearly a World Championship level event. “Monza aside, I have limited asphalt experience of the Hyundai, so I really need to be realistic about my expectations on a result. The focus is to get back into the groove again, six months out of the car is certainly not ideal but it will be pretty much the same for everyone. “I realise that gaining European experience is unbelievably valuable so we will have a clear goal on the pace we want to be at and try to stick at it throughout the day. It is a real honour to be competing out there and Im very thankful for the amazing support around us”. Andrew Johns, Hyundai Motorsport Customer Racing Operations Leader, is hopeful for McErlean. “The opportunity for Josh to run at the Rally di Alba gives him a chance to compete against some of the best drivers in Europe, while continuing to develop his career and gain crucial mileage on tarmac stages,” John stated. “He will able to call on support from our customer support engineers at the rally, and hopefully come away with a good result and some valuable experience.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The figure was outlined in a detailed consultants report commissioned to undertake an in-depth feasibility study to look at potential developments for the local harbour.While the key issue the consultants focused on was deepening the harbour to facilitate larger vessels, they also examined improving harbour conditions, berthing pontoons for smaller vessels and increased berthing facilities.The consultants also undertook a comprehensive review of possible harbour layouts, historic document research, topographic and bathymetric harbour surveys, quay wall inspection above and below the waterline and computer modelling.Ardglass has the only all-weather harbour between Howth and Bangor and has three primary areas, including the fish dock within the southpier. In August last year, ious concept layouts produced by consultants were reviewed by members of the Ardglass Harbour Developments group set up to oversee the regeneration of the port.Cllr Curran says there are plans to deepen the outer harbour by nine metres and the area adjacent to Cochranersquos building at the inner harbour by two metres to facilitate crab vessels.He said consideration is also being given to creating a pontoon with finger berths adjacent to the quay wall and gangway access for crab vessels. No leisure craft would be permitted at this part of the harbour.ldquoNew investment in Ardglass harbour can help sustain existing jobs and create new employment opportunities, said Cllr Curran. ldquoThe port plays a key part in the local economy and is at the heart of village le..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Couple who met at school enjoy 50th wedding anniversary  ","story":"A LOCAL couple who met at school and whose love grew at a church youth group have recently celebrated th years of marriage.Jim and Angela Wilson marked their golden anniversary with a family party with their three sons and their wives and nine grandchildren.The Saintfield couple, who now live in Comber, married on July ,  at Saintfield Parish Church and honeymooned, like many others of their generation, at home.Angela was just  and Jim  when they got married but despite their tender years starting off married le, the happy couple wouldnrsquot turn the clock back.Retired motor mechanic Jim said: ldquoWe met at Saintfield High School and used to go the local youth club, I was in the BB and Angela was in the GB.

Wersquore very lucky to have it and should make every effort to keep it going.Another resident described confirmation that the facility will not reopen this summer as ldquosuch a shame.She added: ldquoAs the only al open air sea pool left in Northern Ireland the Rock Pool ought to be celebrated and included in Discover Northern Irelandrsquos tourism landmark buildings and locations information.

I was either three or four. My brother Garrett is a year younger than me. We moved from Strangford to Downpatrick when I was four-and-a-half and it was before that.My father had taken the two of us to watch a football match. Other than my mother, perhaps his five favourite things in le were reading, the crossword, conversation, a cup of tea and watching a game.What he wasnrsquot always great at was keeping a close eye on children in his charge. Between watching his old club play and chatting to a couple of the other men on the sideline, he didnrsquot notice Garrett and I making a sprint on to the pitch, looking for a go with the ball.It could well be that memory through the efflux of time has us causing greater disruption that night than actually was the case. In some ways I hope that our presence wasnrsquot even noticed by the players. It would be awful were that to have been the biggest influence that I ever had on a football match, although there is every chance that my high point was that warm evening in Kilclief.Unfortunately my enthusiasm for sport was not matched by aptitude. On one visit to his cousins in Listowel I was being encouraged to eat up my black pudding with the Kerry exhortation that I wouldnrsquot play football for Down without a good diet of black pudding.If only it had been that easy. The biggest problem was an unreliability and inconsistency in a ballrsquos direction of flight after it had been propelled by my foot, hand or implement. Allied to being short-sighted before my teens and having a slight frame, the portents werenrsquot good.Football was the game in the Red High and there were plenty of good footballers about. Kevan Owens, Ciaran McCabe and Patrick Kielty were in my year. Brian Burns the year behind. John Kielty the year ahead with Conor Deegan, Barry Breen, Mark McCartan and John Kelly a few years ahead.The recently-deceased Bro Charles was teaching in the school until my fourth year and every day hersquod put out a tea chest of hurleys for a lunchtime puck-about, which I often took advantage of. Bro Charles also coached a Downpatrick team and under his patient tutelage, and presumably need for numbers, I reached my sporting apogee with an East Down U-frac medal.What I did get from my father was the love of watching sport and going to matches. He brought me to Croke Park for the first time when I was six. It was the  football final. I was mesmerised by the colour and the noise. I know that Dublin beat Armagh that day but I honestly donrsquot remember that.What I do remember is that, for my only time, our seats were in the Ard Comhairle box. And they were soft seats. And I remember Down winning the minor match and them being given a big silver cup and I remember Daddy holding me up in his arms so that I could see it and it being so close that I tried to reach out and touch it.But it wasnrsquot all glamour. I still have yet to feel as baltic as I did one winter Sunday standing on a grass bank in the Marshes at about the age of eight or nine with the cold spreading from the frozen turf through the soles of my shoes and up my legs and Daddy talking and talking and talking as I futilely tried to will him back to the car and the warmth of home.Happier times included a spring and summer of going to watch club hurling matches. He was a member, along with Paddy OrsquoDonoghue I think, of a commission on the future of hurling in Down for the County Board and there were many trips to games, particularly to the Ards.As much as he loved football, in truth hurling was his real passion. Due maybe to a Waterford father. As a young man he had hurled for Kilclief and the county. Nothing better than a good game of hurling, hersquod say. Particularly one played in fair conditions on a firm pitch. He never got to the Munster final as often as he would have liked, but that was considered one of the great highlights of any sporting year.What we did get to and what from a young age what I was lucky enough to have as a highlight were the September trips to Croke Park for the hurling and football finals. Particularly the football finals. I got to see the great Kerry-Dublin battles, Kerryrsquos four-in-a-row, Kerryrsquos three-in-a-row.With a Kerry grandmother I felt some affinity to that great team. The Spillanes, Jack OrsquoShea, Paacuteidiacute Oacute Seacute, Mikey Sheehy, Bomber Liston, Ogie Moran, Charlie Nelligan. Great men. As magnicent as the modern Croke Park is, part of me will always miss the old wooden benches of the Hogan Stand.But there were green shoots beginning to appear with Downrsquos Minor All-Ireland in  followed by a narrow loss to Meath, my county of residence these last  years and more, in the  National League final. Preludes of course to theof the good old days and Downrsquos second era of greatness.I have never been at a more momentous sporting occasion than the  final.  comes close obviously, but doesnrsquot match it for the sheer joy, relief and euphoria.That match in Celtic Park is another contender. I suspect that had I been in Istanbul in  it might also have come close. I was in Cardf when Leinster came back from the dead with  unanswered second half points to win their second Heineken Cup. That too was an extraordinary day. But rsquo was in a league of its own.Those men of Kerry were heroes. But heroes in the same way as Kenny Dalglish, Alan Hansen and John Barnes were heroes. Itrsquos a very dferent thing when the heroes are your own people. The excitement building for weeks before. My father calling in favours from all over the country to secure extra tickets. He could nearly have opened a ticket agency.My seat that day was near the back of the Upper Cusack, two seats along from Paddy Doherty. Afterwards we made our way across the pitch and out on to Jonesrsquos Road to meet up with everyone  for the chat. At some ungodly hour on the Monday night the bus finally arrived into Downpatrick and the great Pete McGrath said that we beat the team that couldnrsquot be beaten.The last time that I went to Croke Park with my father was his last visit, three-and-a-half months before he died. It was the hurling final between his fatherrsquos county of Waterford and Galway.He had been there in  and  when they had won their two All-Irelands. He had spent childhood holidays with cousins near Dungarvan, which is where he had learnt to speak Irish. In  he had a lt by horse and cart into Tramore for the train to Dublin to watch the match.His lungs werenrsquot great at that point and I think he had greater clarity than the rest of us about how long was left. He had said to me one evening in France the month before, ldquoYou know that this is going to do for me. I knew it was, but I thought there was still a good bit leftto go.It was  years since he had brought me that first time to Croke Park when we saw Down win an All-Ireland. It would have been nice symmetry had Waterford won on his last visit but it wasnrsquot to be. The day still finished with him standing chatting to friends on Jonesrsquos Road for as long as he was able. I was happy to have been with him on that last trip.At some point in the lsquos my father stopped driving. He was probably happier with the greater opportunity for the crossword or the newspaper. My mother drove him about, but often therersquod be a lt to a match, usually with Joe Leonard. I think he went to more matches with Joe in his last couple of decades than with everyone  combined.We had started going on holidays to France in the lsquos and by the mid lsquos, by which time he had retired as Ombudsman , he and my mother were spending most of the summer there. They loved itbut,there was one downside, he missed a lot of football and hurling.Initially he relied on match reports by telephone from any of us still in Ireland. The urgency of the reports eased as his access to the internet grew but he still appreciated a call at some point to be told how the match had actually gone.The real salvation though was when their great friends, the McQuaids from Dungannon, started to come on holidays to the next town. That in itself was a good thing, but the real boon was Jimrsquos technical wizardry and ability to use a satellite dish to get RTEacute. Thereafter Jim and Maurice spent many Saturday evenings and Sunday afternoons watching Jimrsquos television.I donrsquot know when I first knew of the great feats of the lsquos. I donrsquot ever remember not knowing. Whether it was the flag that my mother kept in the house with ldquoUp Down stitched across it that she had made for one of her brothers in  that my brothers and I loved to take out and wave in the garden.Or my fatherrsquos watch that had been given to him by Brian McCartan and Charlie Carr, which was engraved ldquoTo Maurice Hayes, Secretary of the Down All Ireland Football Team . From B. and C., which fascinated us as children. A watch he wore for the rest of his le and which I am wearing now as I write this.That watch made it clear that this had been something of very great import. I often think of James McCartanrsquos story of meeting his father on Jonesrsquos Road after the  final. His father was in floods of tears and said to him, ldquoYou kept your promise.The names were as familiar as our own. The McCartans and the OrsquoNeills. Paddy Doherty, Joe Lennon, Kevin Mussen, Jarlath Carey, Leo Murphy, Eddie McKay, Tony Hadden, George Lavery, Breen Morgan, Pat Rice, Patsy OrsquoHagan, PJ McElroy, John Smith and Kieran Denvir along with names like John Murphy, Peter Rooney, Larry Powell, Danny Kelly, Ray McConville, Jim Milligan and the great Colm McAlarney from later in the decade.As a boy, when people heard that I was a Hayes, Irsquod at times be askedI was Mauricersquos son and then told that Down wouldnrsquot have won an All-Ireland but for him. And when Irsquod ask him about it hersquod say that Down wouldnrsquot have won an All-Ireland without the players, that hersquod never kicked a ball.He spent the best part of six decades holding those men in the highest esteem, as footballers, as people, and as friends. His view was that every one of them had lived constructive lives in which they had contributed to their families, their communities and to society.And for all their achievements, they were modest men. Paddy Doherty recently selected his best Down team of all time for the Down Recorder. He didnrsquot pick himself. Paddy lsquoMorsquo is the only person in the entire country that wouldnrsquot have Paddy lsquoMorsquo on that team.Above all, he loved their company. He loved meeting up with them over the years at matches and ious s. Usually wearing his Club Down tie. Part of the pleasure of going to a match was the half-time cup of tea and the chat with friends afterwards, whether on Jonesrsquos Road, in Newry or whatever ground the match was in.There are two photographs from the GAA Congress in Newcastle ten years ago that show it well. One is a formal photograph with President McAleese and ious dignitaries. Hersquos sitting at the bottom left deep in conversation with Kevin Mussen.In the other, therersquos a group standing on a set of steps. Hersquos at the back having a chat with James McCartan. I think that Bobbie Hanvey was one of the only people that could get him to look into a camera.A third photograph from that Congress showed him standing in front of the huge poster of the  team calling them ldquoThe History Makers. That photograph was used on his memorial card. When it came to his funeral, he was buried in his Club Down tie. Nothing  would have been appropriate.His last visitor before he died was Dr Walsh, who held his hand and chatted to him. Their last words together were, ldquoWe had good times. They certainly did.This article was originally published on the Club Down website..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11477958.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Please try again later.Submitting...During last week’s Assembly debate about the introduction of a Climate Change Act, Mr Poots rejected the terms “emergency” or “crisis” when it came to the climate change issue.In a pre-prepared statement, Mr McMahon said on Thursday: “I want to start with an apology based on the letter that I sent to the minister on July .“In preparing for Assembly debate on climate legalisation, officials had submitted a briefing for the minister which included a closing statement. The briefing was comprehensive and clear but we had included a line which stated that we should not be using language such as emergency or crisis.“This line was included without any additional explanation or caveat and the minister assumed it was the position of officials.“Officials had included the line believing it was consistent with the minister’s policy position in previous statements.”He told the committee it is “normal and appropriate” practice for department officials to frame statements and lines in press releases in words that “reflect the minister’s position”.He added: “We did not make clear the line was included on that basis and therefore did not state that the line had not been meant to constitute official advice.“This was an error and I apologise to the minister and for any embarrassment it had caused. I am also apologising to the committee.”He also told the committee he has asked for an independent review to be carried out into guidance provided to the minister on climate change.“Basically we got it wrong,” he added.Mr McMahon told the committee Mr Poots has made it clear “we have to follow the scientic evidence”.He said the Department and Government have to act now to stop and reverse the climate change process as they represent a “fundamental threat”.He added: “We have received the support of the minister in prioritising climate change and working with other departments to reduce carbon emissions.”He said that work has intensied, adding: “While there is clearly political debate about language, none of us are in any doubt about the science, about what it tells us and the need for a response to that science that reflects the urgency required.”Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan said the minister’s comments caused “great consternation”.He added: “Those comments were believed to be the minister’s position, so we have an environment minister who doesn’t believe we have a climate emergency or climate crisis.”Mr McGuigan also accused Mr Poots of resisting scientic evidence and “ignoring the will” of the Assembly to implement climate change legislation.However, department official David Small said the minister has never resisted advice during their meetings.Mr Small added: “When we put advice forward the advice is properly considered and is generally accepted.“You say that he is ignoring our advice, again I couldn’t honestly agree with that.”Green Party MLA Clare Bailey said: “It’s really hard to believe we are sitting here in  having this conversation.“I would much rather see actions on climate crisis than debating this today.”\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

He is a fellow of the Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce, and a member of the NI Chamber of CommerceImagine a simple road bridge connecting to Scotland. Add to that a train. No, that doesn’t remotely get me up and awake in the morning.Now consider the strategic challenges we face here and across Europe: real, frequent and aggressive water shortages energy dependence on Russian gas or oil the climate challenges we’re facing now how about an impact of Covid on transit and transport  Think of the technology coming online: autonomousvehicles the smart cities through amazing stuff like IoTand wanting to have freer, connected European economy The ‘bridge to Scotland’ can be so much more than an extension of the A. And it must be. Far too long, the west of the Bann and the east has been uninvested. North and south connections are pro-car yet high speed rail is batted back.We can maximise the benefits to using Northern Ireland’s rather Belfast-centric motorways — beyond Dungannon linking to M and A N routes across to the west — and ersying the arterial network that upgrades to the Londonderry-Dublin road that have been called for for years. Picture the island as a big number  — a northern circle and a southern equivalent, meeting at a middle band: it challenges the very Dublin m-way focus of sprigs out. Same in Northern Ireland. A super-infra project connecting Scotland feeds our need to invest in whole-island rather than what connects Belfast or what connects into Dublin. But I don’t want you to think about simple transport benefits. Think about our strategic challenges into the s — water and energy, automation and connectivity. The feasibility must have its core: tidal lagoon energy marine habitat and marine farming desalination and connections of the Irish and British waterways — yes canals are in this considered as an extension to coastal harbours of both Scotland and here. This is a necessity to any connectivity bridge — we owe that to this island and to the funders: the bridge must generate true strategic value and revenue, along with many of its associated beneficial connections.Yes, I am saying it must be a whole project, not simply a rail road bridge from Larne to Scotland. That is the main complaint from the detractors that it’s a vanity project.The feasibility of the bridge project must not be framed on simple logistics terms — it is a massive potential benefit across these islands. Connectivity from Cork to Berlin, via the bridge using autonomous vehicles, travelling by high speed rail, by bicycle, perhaps even by a canal or waterway. The bridge could provide huge fresh water in a testing future by desalination. It could deliver on the trials of the Swansea Bay tidal lagoon – clean, green, secure energy. We cannot limit this feasibility study’s scope.The population of Ireland and Britain is growing. We will need across these islands to find homes and space for a population the size of Belfast every year for the foreseeable future. Water, energy and jobs matter — the bridge could be part of the solution. It needs support for a full and wide feasibility: but not just as a ‘unionist umbilical’ project, but as a massive, strategic investment that willsecurity to us on energy, connectivity, water and jobs. • Robert Park advises businesses——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

In other words, the advantages of a relatively big internal or single market of  million people as opposed to Northern Irelandtrying to rely much of the time on a market of only . million people. As the document outlines, the gains from such an IM include better consumer choice, lower prices given lower business costs. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Dr Esmond Birnie is senior economist at Ulster University Business SchoolThe UK government indicates that its forthcoming IM bill will ensure protections and checks against the three devolvedadministrations using their competenciesto regulate in such a way that frictions to the IM are produced.The UK’s IM might seem like a very dry or arcane subject. Certainly, not something as topical as NI and Brexit or the economic impact of Covid-. However, even though it may be under-appreciated, maintenance of the UK IM could play a major role in ensuring future prosperity and well-being.History suggests the worth of the IM. Its creation through the Acts of Union of  and  was part and parcel of industrial revolution process in Britain and Ireland.Imagine the dficulties which might be faced by, say, a food processing firm in NI in it found that to sell into Scotland it was legally obliged to use dferent packaging and labelling that which was required in England or NI. The government document applies a bit of economic modellingto indicate that “moderate” frictions between Scotland and the rest ofthe UK could produce a ‘hit’ to Scottish economic output of about £.bn. A similar sort of scale of effect here in NI would represent about £m .A sort of elephant in the room relating to the UK IM is what the implications might be of the NI Protocol to the UK Withdrawal Agreement with the EU . In the White Paper the UK government re-iterates that NI will continue to be a full member of the UK IM and will enjoy unfettered access to the GB market. It remains to be seen how the negotiations between the UK government and EU will land. To what extent will NI firms be able to avoid exit declaration forms relating to sales to GB  To what extent will there be a tarf dference between the EU and UK and how far will the EU allow a light touch approach to applying customs duties on goods coming into NI from GB The subjects covered by this consultation are very important. There has already been a political response especially from the SNP that what the UK government is proposing is power grab against the Devolved Administrations . In fact, the UK government seems to be trying to defend some of the advantages of the status quo, a status quo which might be threatenedthe three DAs or, indeed, the London governmentwent off and did its own thing regardless of common interests across the UK. Economic theory suggests that decentralised forms of government require a delicate balance between the centre and the devolved layers of government. An interesting example is provided by industrial policy. The White Paper speaks of a single, fair subsidy control regime. This is not saying that Belfast, Edinburgh or Cardf cannot have their own special incentive packages for inward investment or existing businesses. It does imply, rightly in terms of the danger of bidding or subsidy wars, that there may have to be a cap on the maximum level of assistance which any particular UK administration might provide.

If theyrsquore going to do it, theyrsquove got to get on with it. These ugly barriers are so frustrating, and thousands of people see it.ldquoThey did some excavations and just left the spoil heap. Itrsquos a vast improvement now, but even cleaned up itrsquos still a mess.Jean Webber, who lives nearby on Llwyn Derwen, said she has witnessed a lot of fly-tippers dumping rubbish at the bridge, like fridges, freezers and buildersrsquo rubbish. She said: ldquoI think this end of Dinas has been forgotten. [The council] seems to concentrate on the other end.ldquoI walk past here every day. It wouldnrsquot be so badthey just walled it off. I never complain, but this is just appalling.The council has now promised work will begin to remove the bridge next month, and blamed coronavirus for the most recent delay. The new timetable is to finish the job by this October.A Vale of Glamorgan council spokesperson said: ldquoUnfortunately, the contractor originally appointed to remove the bridge withdrew from the project after agreement couldnrsquot be reached on a claim for additional costs due to the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoThat meant a new contractor had to be found, a process that added to the delay caused by the pandemic itself, which for a period prevented work of this type being carried out.ldquoThe council has now successfully appointed a new contractor and received an indication that work is expected to start in mid-August. It is anticipated the work will be completed by the end of October.But both Cllr Franks and Ms Webber raised doubts about the new timetable. Cllr Franks said: ldquoWe are always told it will start in six to eight weeks. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Box Two is to recycle foil paper and boxes, food and drinks cans, aerosols and cartons such as milk containers and plastics also. Box Three is for cardboard, glass bottles and jars.Bryson Recycling saysadopted it could mean a jobs boost for the area as well as making recycling easier. The firm already has a link with the council, collecting recycling from homes in the Armagh area.Eric Randall, Director at Bryson Recycling says: “We are delighted that the Council is considering the Wheelie Box option. Collected weekly, the latest Wheelie Box model will offer % more capacity than a standard green recycling bin.This is an image of what can be put in the Wheelie Boxes.“Wheelie Boxes are a very much enhanced version of the kerbside boxes which are already in use in the Armagh area. The boxes have a lockable hinged lid and are integrated onto a trolley with wheels, which makes them secure and very easy to use and move.“As well as providing more space for recycling, Wheelie Boxes will also mean good news for local jobs because % of what we collect using this approach is recycled in Northern Ireland. This compares to typically around % using green bins.”Wheelie Boxes are not new, , households in Northern Ireland already use them.Bryson Recycling also pointed out that two firms based in the borough, Huhtamaki and Cherry Pipes, used recyclable materials.A number of dferent systems are currently in operation across the Borough and the consultation aims to introduce a single, streamlined recycling system from next year.Eric adds: “The Wheelie Box option means local households can increase the amount they recycle every week instead of fortnightly, protect local jobs, boost the economy and play an important role in creating a local, sustainable environment for all.”To voice your opinion, check out the link on the ABC Council website here https:www.armaghbanbridgecraigavon.gov.uk green-bin-or-wheelie-box-choose-which-to-use "}]
