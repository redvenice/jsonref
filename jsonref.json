[{"url":null,"title":"Humbling Petras playboy","story":"    Stunning views: The block of flats overlooking the Thames in Chelsea Harbour          Luxury home: The cottage in Belgravia that was on the market in 2016 for £11.8mBut Stunt’s bid to gag the Press has backfired, after the Mail challenged the gagging order in court yesterday. It was overturned, meaning the Proceeds of Crime Act proceedings against the multi-millionaire can be revealed for the first time. The Act was introduced in 2002 to allow money or assets to be seized by the State if they were obtained through unlawful conduct. In Stunt’s case, he has not been charged with any offence, and it is not clear why the order has been made. His assets have not been seized, but their use has been restricted and he must not dispose of, deal with or diminish the value of them.It is understood that, since August, the restraint order has been subject to minor revisions on three occasions, to take account of Stunt’s business interests.In the original order, Judge Munro QC slapped a £1,000-a-week limit on him, saying: ‘This order does not prohibit the Alleged Offender from spending up to £1,000 a week towards his ordinary living expenses.’          Listed by the court: One of two Rolls-Royce Phantoms. Stunt recently bragged of owning 200 cars and boasted that losing £5million in a casino meant nothing to him.          Stunt is being forced to live considerably more frugally these days – on the orders of a judge (pictured: His favourite supercar, the Lamborghini Aventador)It is a far cry from his days of splashing the cash. His costly and acrimonious orce from Miss Ecclestone in 2017 did not dent his penchant for shopping trips to Harrods in a cavalcade of supercars. In March last year, he declared to Tatler magazine that he is ‘as rich as ever’.He said he had once had a £5million credit line at ‘every casino’ in London, Monaco, Las Vegas and Macao but had recently cut his wagers to ‘just’ £20,000 a night, explaining: ‘Me fooling around with £20,000, I’m not trying to sound as if I don’t know the value of money, but it’s a huge improvement on losing £5million a night. You have to bet enough to hurt you, but I definitely had a gambling problem. I was losing millions every time.’Interviewed at home by the high-society magazine, while wearing a £60,000 Audemars Piguet gold wristwatch, he showed off some of his paintings including a Van Gogh, a Constable, a Picasso and several Van Dycks.These are likely to be among the list of artworks that Stunt has been ordered to draw up by the court. The judge demanded he itemise all of his ‘paintings, furniture, watches, jewellery and objets d’art’, along with their estimated value, photographs and locations where they are held.          Audemars Piguet gold watch: Stunt has one worth £60,000 in his collection          The gold bullion magnate is the ex-husband of Formula One heiress Petra Ecclestone, with whom he has three children (pictured: His Bentley Mulsanne)          Rolls-Royce Phantom: The other in Stunt’s collection. Stunt has also spent millions on artworksStunt has spent millions on artworks. His bodyguards have been spotted carrying bubble-wrapped masterpieces from Sotheby’s and Christie’s to Rolls-Royces parked on yellow lines outside.He has lent paintings by Monet, Dali, Picasso and Constable to galleries around the world. Even Prince Charles accepted paintings on loan for the restoration of his Scottish stately home Dumfries House, and Stunt has several royal letters of gratitude on display at his Mayfair office.Two months ago, in line with good journalistic practice, the Mail gave Stunt a chance to comment before publication. A security guard answering the door of his stucco-fronted Belgravia cottage said he was unavailable, but accepted a letter to him offering an opportunity to comment. Instead of doing so, Stunt went straight to a judge.Later that day, Old Bailey Judge Mark Dennis QC granted an order to ‘prohibit publication of all information’ relating to the assets freezing order. Yesterday, Judge Dennis threw out the gagging order, and suggested Stunt had been trying to protect his ‘personal, reputational or personal business interests’, none of which was relevant to the Proceeds of Crime proceedings. The CPS has declined to comment.          Used by his security team: One of two Range Rovers. He told Tattler he liked to travel in ‘an armada of cars’ on shopping trips round London          Bentley Flying Spur: Stunt claims to own 200 carsStunt has repeatedly stoked controversy. During his £5billion orce, he was claimed to have rubbed cocaine on his gums during a court hearing. On the same day in June 2017, it is also claimed he barged into his father-in-law, the ex-Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone, and made a gun gesture towards him in court. He later made an obscene gesture at photographers as he left the hearing. Stunt has ‘categorically denied’ all these allegations, calling them ‘completely ridiculous’.Around that time, Stunt was photographed sitting in the back of a Rolls-Royce with Terry Adams, the ‘Godfather’ of Britain’s most notorious crime family which has been linked to 25 murders, money laundering, racketeering and extortion.Adams is also Stunt’s godfather. Stunt has spoken of his pride at being his godson. There is no suggestion he is involved in any of Adams’s affairs.          Wine collection: A bottle of Chateau PetrusThe assets which have been frozen by the court offer a fascinating glimpse into Stunt’s wealth. Among other things, the Proceeds of Crime order lists his cars and their personalised number plates – all variations on his surname.Supercars Stunt is banned from selling the following cars: Bentley Flying Spur, registration S4UNT Range Rover S2UNT Lamborghini Countach 157UNT Rolls-Royce Phantom 57UNT, Lamborghini Aventador S7UNT, Range Rover S1UNT, Rolls-Royce Phantom S3UNT, Lamborghini Aventador S1VNT, Bentley Mulsanne S6UNT.He has bragged that he owns more than 200 high-performance cars, mainly stored in hangars in California and the UK.He told Tattler he liked to travel in ‘an armada of cars’ on shopping trips round London, typically in a Lamborghini sandwiched by two Rolls-Royces and two Range Rovers as, he claims, it would embarrass him to have his 25-strong security team trail him in Ford Fiestas.Stunt once boasted to Bernie Ecclestone that his £600,000 Rolls-Royce Mansory Conquistador was the only one in the world.Apartments The court order imposes a freeze on two entire floors of a luxury apartment block next to the Thames. Stunt paid £3.3million for the first flat, in 2012, and a further £3.4million for the apartment directly beneath it, in 2015.Deeds for the two properties, publicly available via the Land Registry, have been recently amended to show that a court order prevents any sale without the permission of ‘the CPS Proceeds of Crime Central Pre-Enforcement Unit’. They also show that a bankruptcy notice was filed at the High Court in October this year.£11m cottage Stunt’s stucco-fronted four-storey Belgravia cottage has four double-bedroom suites, wine cellar, roof terrace, cinema, gym and steam room. Bought via one of his companies for £2.7million in 2011 – he boasted he paid cash – it was put back on the market in 2016 for £11.8million but did not sell.          The court order also demanded that Stunt draw up a list of all his art. Pictured is one of his entourage on an art-buying spree in July 2015 Land Two small plots in Stunt’s name close to Dartmouth Castle in Devon are identified in the order. Bizarrely, the plots in a patch of woodland are tiny – each less than eight inches by eight inches.MoneyThe order freezes no fewer than 14 bank accounts in the names of James Stunt or Stunt \u0026amp Co Ltd. They comprise nine accounts at Barclays, four at Lloyds and one at a Mayfair wealth management firm.WineStunt is banned from selling his Corney \u0026amp Barrow fine wine collection. The 230-year-old London-based firm is one of the oldest independent wine merchants in the UK. It is currently selling a case of 12 bottles of Petrus 1982 for £51,000.Art The court order also demanded that Stunt draw up a list of all his ‘paintings, furniture, watches, jewellery and objets d’art’ and itemise their estimated value and locations where they are held."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/23/17/4C90373400000578-0-image-m-15_1527092989479.jpg","title":"Prince Harry Meghan vow grieving mother help servicemen women overcome PTSD","story":"    Danny Johnston, 35, (pictured) was found hanged last May after suffering with PTSD since he was discharged from the armyPrince Harry and Meghan have made a vow to a grieving mother to  help servicemen and women who are struggling with PTSD. Viv Johnston, 62, saw the destructive effects PTSD can have first hand when her son, Danny Johnston, 35, killed himself last year. The royal couple invited Viv, from Bognor Regis, West Sussex, to meet them before the military Endeavour Awards in London last week. Danny had been struggling to cope with PTSD and spiralled into a depression after he was discharged from the army when police found him carrying Valium tablets. Viv said he was self-medicating with them because he feared he would be discharged if the army thought he had mental health issues. Prince Harry, 34, who is himself an army veteran, had previously written to mother-of-three Viv  when Danny was found hanged last May. Scroll down for video.           Viv Johnston, 62, was invited to speak to Prince Harry and Meghan before the Endeavour Awards last week after Harry wrote to her when her son, Danny, killed himself last year          Prince Harry (pictured at the Endeavour Awards) had previously written to Viv last year when Danny\u0027s hanged body was foundMissing Afghanistan war hero, 35, is found dead in woodland...Five British Army heroes die in a week as MoD launches probe...Share this article    The royal couple stayed talking with Viv for so long that the awards ceremony had to be delayed Viv said, \u0027Harry was very sympathetic to what is currently going on with veterans and the problems of suicide,\u0027 in an interview with the Mirror.  The royal couple and Viv stayed chatting for so long that the Endeavour Awards ceremony ended up being delayed. She said: \u0027Three very panicked blokes came in at one stage and said Sir, we have to go, people are waiting and he said well, I’m talking.\u0027           Since leaving the Army in 2015, the Prince has focused his work on the creation of the Invictus Games and Heads Together - a campaign which seeks to challenge the stigma of mental health problems Harry and Meghan also spoke to Viv about a new mental health support charity for veterans that was set up after Danny died. All Call Signs is a support network that sends out emergency beacon alerts when servicemen or women go missing. Viv said: \u0027I asked if they would like an All Call Signs wrist band.

The musical remake of her 1980s film that she leaves behind is proficient, but soulless. The set blinks like a pinball machine, it churns out good smutty puns, but it’s oh so thin on plot, monotone on performance and even the newly penned songs by Dolly are blandly forgettable.Two Parton classics appear though, one warning us ‘too much make-up, too much hair, don’t be fooled by thinkin’ that the goods are not all there’.Reader, the goods are not all there.Its attempt at a message is ‘#MeToo the musical’ but with bottom slapping. The central trio of secretaries (originally Parton, Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda on screen) start the fight within their firm for equal rights and recognition.Worthy causes, but they’re quickly forgotten as cleavages are ogled, unattractive women are balked at, secretary Bonnie Langford kicks her height in suspenders and boss Brian Conley is dangled from the ceiling in a gimp suit.

Davies is far better than her Love Island career start would have you expect, Sheen is solid West End standard, but McQueen as Doralee (unmistakably the rootin’-tootin’ Dolly Parton role) is the closest thing to stardust with fine Tennessee-twang vocal cords and a Barbara Windsor slapstick quality.

The report indicated radiation levels were at 800 millirems per hour on contact with the ore           The canyon is viewed at sunrise from the South Rim on February 8. The allegations center around containers with uranium stored in the national park\u0027s museum collection Stephenson added that one of the buckets was so full that it was brimming with uranium and its lid would not close.  In a separate email to David Bernhardt, acting interior secretary and Deputy Inspector General Mary Kendall, Stephenson said he had asked National Park executives on a number of occasions to inform the public, only to get \u0027stonewalled.\u0027\u0027Respectfully, it was not only immoral not to let Our People know,\u0027 he added, \u0027but I could not longer risk my (health and safety) certification by letting this go any longer,\u0027 he wrote.   In an interview with USA Today, Stephenson said he was assisting with a safety audit when employees told him about the uranium.He then contacted a National Parks specialist in Colorado.          Stephenson said the containers were near a taxidermy exhibit where children on tours sometimes stopped for presentations, sitting near to them for 30 minutes or moreTechnicians traveled to the Grand Canyon several days after his call, on June 18, last year. The technicians came to the park with a Ludlum meter, which is similar to a Geiger counter and also measures radiation output. They didn\u0027t have protective clothing so they used dish-washing and gardening gloves and a broken mop handle to lift the uranium buckets into a truck, Stephenson said. Stephenson\u0027s account appears to be corroborated by photographs in a 45-page slideshow intended to document the alleged cover-up. Stephenson said the technicians didn\u0027t tell him what the radiation readings were and dumped the ore into Orphan Mine, an old uranium dig, a few miles away from the Grand Canyon village.            The technicians who traveled to the Canyon after Stephenson\u0027s call to a National Parks specialist in Colorado did not have protective clothing and used a broken mop handle (pictured above) to lift the contaminated buckets into a truck Stephenson said he filed a report with OSHA, which sent inspectors to the museum building in yellow protective suits.He said he could hear the inspectors \u0027meters going off\u0027 and that they detected a low-level site within the building, tracing it to three buckets, which Park Service technicians had returned to the building after dumping their contents. A spokesman for OSHA confirmed an investigation is underway, but didn\u0027t provide any other information.   According to USA Today Stephenson obtained a report submitted by the Park Service\u0027s regional safety manager.The report indicated radiation levels at 13.9 millirems per hour where the containers were stored, and 800 per hour on contact with the ore. However, five feet away from the buckets, there was a zero reading.According to Nuclear Regulatory Commission, a maximum safe dosage for the public, beyond natural radiation, is no more than 2 millirems per hour, or 100 per year.          The report also indicated radiation levels of 800 per hour on contact with the ore, a maximum safe dosage for the public, beyond natural radiation, is no more than 2 millirems per hour The report suggested guidelines for storing geology samples in the future but did not call for the public to be notified.     Emily Davis, a public affairs specialist at the Grand Canyon, said an investigation is underway coordinated by the Park Service, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Arizona Department of Health Services.Davis stressed that a recent review of the building in question uncovered only background radiation, which is natural in the area and is safe.\u0027There is no current risk to the park employees or public,\u0027 Davis said, adding a recent review of the building only uncovered safe background radiation.\u0027The building is open. … The information I have is that the rocks were removed, and there\u0027s no danger,\u0027 she added.Davis wouldn\u0027t comment on Stephenson\u0027s assertion that thousands of people may have been exposed to dangerous levels of radiation, or his allegations that the Park Service violated the law by not issuing a public warning.           Emily Davis, a public affairs specialist at the Grand Canyon, said an investigation is underway and \u0027the rocks were removed and there\u0027s no danger\u0027 or \u0027current risk\u0027 to employees or the publicEXCLUSIVE: Jussie Smollett appeared in a play about a...Share this articleStephenson, who is African-American said the uranium exposure saga at the park developed while he was pursuing a racial-discrimination complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity office. This is not the first time Stephenson, who is a military veteran and certified as an occupational safety and health technician, has had a brush with controversy at work.According to court records, while in the navy, he called for action to prevent falls after a series of accidents in 2016. He was fired.

A hard Brexit would be a particular blow to us, but not life threatening. While it may put pressure on future decisions, we are fully committed to the UK.\u0027Our Brexit planning is in place.

But we have a safety valve just in case.\u0027           Mr Hallmark was speaking to the MailOnline in Marbella, SpainThis includes: :: quadrupling the amount of stock it holds (soon to rise to five-fold) to prevent being hit by shortages of key parts :: shipping cars and parts via Immingham instead of Dover :: remaining flexible over potential shut-down periods. There are no plans yet to extend the planned Easter holiday shut-down, but Friday working could be curtailed if necessary to give some flex. Mr Hallmark said Brexit was only one of a number of factors currently affecting the wider motor industry and forcing uncomfortable change. Others include the demise of diesel, the drive towards electrification, and sales slowdowns in China and the USA. He said that as a luxury manufacturer Bentley was better placed than most volume car producers where tariffs bite harder because trade is more price sensitive. If a \u0027hard Brexit\u0027 meant tariffs of around 10 per cent were imposed, Bentley would take a decision whether to add them onto the price or to absorb them, hitting profits. Mr Hallmark said: \u0027A hard Brexit could lead to a lift in prices in Europe, or we could live with them ourselves by taking the hit and reducing our base price accordingly to compensate for the extra tariff. That\u0027s harder for volume manufacturers.\u0027 He stressed: \u0027When times get tough, those who are weakest struggle most \u0027Brexit hasn\u0027t happened yet. I don\u0027t think anyone can blame current performance on Brexit. There\u0027s the diesel issue, for example. That\u0027s nothing to do with Brexit.\u0027          Mr Hallmark, who this week celebrates his first full year at the helm said: \u0027All our Brexit planning is in place. We have been here for 100 years and we will be here for the next 100 years.\u0027Mr Hallmark said only 20 per cent of Bentley\u0027s sales are to Continental Europe so it has a more balanced spread of sales. Some 21 per cent is to the USA, 19 per cent to China, 14 per cent remains in the UK and the remaining 16 per cent is exported to the result of the world. \u0027The outlook for luxury cars is still positive,\u0027 he added.Volkswagen Group has given Bentley two years to drive back to profitability. Members of the powerful Porsche family dynasty which dominate VW shareholdings have given the firm the deadline after it made losses of £122million in the first nine months of 2018 compared to £27.5m profit in 2017.                                                       Honda\u0027s decision to shut down its Swindon plant shows the whole car industry has stalled, writes RUTH SUTHERLAND - and No Deal fears aren\u0027t helpingBy RUTH SUTHERLAND FOR THE DAILY MAIL Honda\u0027s decision to shut down its plant in Swindon after 30 years as a major local employer may not be directly motivated by Brexit but by wider problems in global car manufacturing.However, yesterday\u0027s move by the Japanese carmaker could hardly have come at a worse time.No one in the industry doubts that uncertainty over Brexit is having a chilling effect on production. Fears surrounding our departure helped to halve fresh investment in the sector last year, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.            Nissan has also scaled back UK production by cancelling construction of its new X-Trail SUV at its Sunderland factoryOverseas investors such as Honda have, in the past three decades, rebuilt the British car industry after it was driven to the brink of annihilation in the 1970s by rabid trade union activity. Now they are in flight.Nissan is cancelling plans to build its new X-Trail SUV at its Sunderland factory. US giant Ford, which employs 13,000 workers in Britain, describes the potential consequences of No Deal as \u0027catastrophic\u0027, while the boss of Jaguar Land Rover, which is cutting UK jobs, has issued a string of dire warnings.Brexiteers will, of course, accuse these firms of crying wolf. Maybe – but that doesn\u0027t mean there are no wolves out there. And it is a tragedy that the very companies which helped to bring about a remarkable renaissance in the British car industry have become the collateral damage in the chaos of our impending departure from the EU.            Jaguar Land Rover, which is cutting UK jobs, has also issued warnings about a no deal BrexitIt is yet one more problem to contend with in a troubled industry that faces plummeting demand for diesel cars, a slump in the vast Chinese market, and fears that Donald Trump may impose punishing tariffs on vehicles imported into the US.In Germany, a country synonymous with the production of sleek, super-reliable driving machines sold worldwide, the decline in the auto industry is actually stalling the economy.The industry is also dealing with the lifestyle choices of the Uber generation: city-dwelling, environmentally-conscious young people who are less fixated on car ownership than their parents were.So a state of emergency would prevail even without Brexit, and the threat of No Deal makes us an even less attractive place to invest in troubled times.Workers blame Brexit for demise of Honda\u0027s Swindon plant | Business | The Guardian"},{"url":null,"title":"Radio host Nicky Campbell tells sense rejection felt foster children","story":"    Broadcaster Nicky Campbell, pictured centre, with his adoptive parents Frank and Shelia and his half-sister Fiona, right          Nicky Campbell\u0027s biological mother is Dublin nurse Stella Lackey, pictured.

His mother had been pregnant to two Catholics within an 18-month period. His half-sister had also been placed up for adoption. He said: \u0027It was a surreal moment for me. I met my birth mother in Dublin in 1990 and, for the first time, I saw a face that looked like mine. But I felt no emotional connection with her, no spiritual connection even.           Broadcaster Nicky Campbell, pictured, said he still considers himself a \u0027proud Scot\u0027 despite his strong biological connections to Dublin\u0027There was nothing. If anything, I felt quite sorry for her. She’d had two children within 18 months, by two different men she led a complicated, rather tragic life. But I’m so thankful to have met her and felt honoured to help carry her coffin when she died in 2008.\u0027 He also managed to track down his biological father Joseph. Campbell has spent more time looking into his history for a new show, Long Lost Family on ITV. The new research found that his paternal grandfather was a member of the IRA and may have fought alongside Michael Collins during the Irish War of Independence. The broadcaster told The Mirror: \u0027I understand, no matter how happy your adoption is, that nagging sense of rejection that many adopted people get. It\u0027s important to bring those feelings to it and it\u0027s not a conscious decision to bring them or not, I think it just happens. \u0027It\u0027s really difficult because we get wrapped up in the emotions you get to know somebody and you kind of go with them on it. I\u0027ve had my moments.\u0027           Campbell, pictured, said he felt sorry for his biological mother, pictured, because she had a difficult lifeCampbell said he was incredibly grateful to his adoptive parents who \u0027selflessly providing a loving and stable family home\u0027. After finding about his Irish natural parents, Campbell insists he is still a \u0027proud Scot\u0027. He added: \u0027With my adoption, I had some scant details and my parents were very forthcoming and said, if I ever wanted to know more, they\u0027d tell me as much as they could and would help me in any tracing process.\u0027 As a result of his history, Campbell is an ambassador for Adoption UK.   He now works with foundings - people who are abandoned as babies - in an effort to trace their families. He said: \u0027It’s an extremely emotional and incredibly important programme because with adopted people and the stories that we usually deal with on Long Lost Family, people live with an emptiness but it\u0027s an emptiness with hope. \u0027There is always hope that somehow someday the big questions about their lives and where they came from can be answered. But with foundlings, there\u0027s been no hope, so it has been a complete wasteland, an utter void.           Nicky Campbell is appearing on the new series of Long Lost Family on ITV next Monday, February 25 at 9pm          The first episode, with Campbell, left, and Davina McCall, right, features foundlings - people who were abandoned as children - as they try and track down their biological families\u0027There was no reason for thinking that they would ever find answers until now with DNA technology. With adopted people and the stories we deal with on Long Lost Family, people feel rejection. \u0027That’s one of the common themes about being adopted, no matter how wonderful your adopted mum and dad are and the family into which you are adopted. But with these stories of people who were left, that sense of rejection is like a million times more. What it must be like for people who were left on a doorstep as a newborn baby, I just cannot imagine.\u0027 Long Lost Family will broadcast on ITV at 9pm on Monday, February 25. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/02/19/10/2615BA4B00000578-0-image-m-37_1550573302659.jpg","title":"Chelsea house Bob Marley lived recorded 1977 album commemorated blue plaque","story":"Installed on buildings around London by English Heritage, the blue plaques celebrate the link between famous and influential figures and the places where they lived or worked in LondonJack the Ripper\u0027s victims were NOT prostitutes but homeless...MPs call for 1p tax per item of \u0027fast fashion\u0027 from...UK jobs boom continues fuelled by more Britons finding work...Share this articleBob MarleyBob Marley remains one of the most popular musicians to have ever lived and the Jamaican is often described as the first superstar to have emerged from the developing world, blazing a trail for other artists.This year, the blue plaque scheme will commemorate the Chelsea house where Marley lived in 1977 while he and the Wailers finished recording their album Exodus. During his time at the house, Marley  and his bandmates often played football at the pitches in nearby Battersea Park. Marley left Jamaica at the end of 1976, eventually spending two years in England and completing  Exodus as well as follow-up album Kaya.

This image shows an artist painting the new brand design            A steam train is pictured emblazoned with the Cadbury logo as it hauls ingredients to and from the firm\u0027s plant in Bournville, four miles from Birmingham. A new book by Diane Wordsworth tells the story of the much-loved chocolate brand           After founder John Cadbury got fed up of his small shop in the 1800 slums of Birmingham he moved the company to a huge greenfield site four miles away. It had plenty of room for staff to live and ended up with sports pitches and swimming pools as well. Staff days out were common and this group of workers are pictured arriving back on the train from one in Derby From pinball to peep shows: Black and white photographs...Share this articleInto the twentieth century Cadbury\u0027s became a global player and with the birth of the Dairy Milk 1905 it was soon making millions and hurtling towards being Britain\u0027s favourite sweet treat.Despite a hostile takeover by American food company Kraft in 2010 and customer fears the much-loved recipe of Dairy Milk would change, the Cadbury\u0027s brand is still stronger than ever and has survived for nearly 200 years.   Rarely seen photographs in a book by Diane Wordsworth depict the men who made Cadbury\u0027s first mass produced drinking chocolate in the confectionary maker\u0027s first warehouse, a group of skilled women decorating delicious Easter eggs in the late 19th century, and a designer crafting one of Cadbury\u0027s instantly recognisable chocolate box covers.Other images show workers enjoying the plush surroundings of the Bournville - a clean-cut \u0027factory in a garden\u0027 created by Cadbury\u0027s for the benefit of their staff. A happy workforce can be seen participating in a Swedish exercise class, the women\u0027s team lining up for a game of football and nervous youngsters preparing to learn to swim.          Happy staff are pictured crafting some of Cadbury\u0027s best loved chocolates in the factory in Bournville, near Birmingham           All present and correct! A female factory worker at Bournville is pictured weighing a Cadbury\u0027s Milk Tray to ensure everything is in orderMs Wordsworth said: \u0027The Cadburys as a family did much for social welfare and reform,\u0027 explained Wordsworth. Cadbury\u0027s as a firm did the same for their workers.\u0027Some may think the business was too patriarchal - and in today\u0027s climate they would probably be correct - but what this company did for workers\u0027 welfare in the middle of the nineteenth century and beyond should be held up as a model.\u0027The company and the family believed that a happy healthy workforce meant a happy healthy business. The fact that the firm is still here today, almost 200 years later, speaks for itself.\u0027In 1824, John Cadbury bought the shop in Bull Street with money given to him by his father, who owned the shop next door.Alongside tea and coffee, John also sold cocoa beans which he turned into drinking chocolate. He saw the drink as a healthy alternative to alcohol - something John, being a Quaker, was keen to encourage.His clientele agreed and the company grew exponentially in the 19th century under the stewardship of his sons, constantly expanding their range of drinking chocolates, the size of their business premises, and producing their first chocolate bar and Easter eggs in the 1870s.          Easter eggs were first produced in the UK in 1875. Here a group of factory workers are pictured putting the finishing touches to beautifully-crafted chocolate eggs complete with edible spring flowers on the top \u0027By 1879, the factory in Bridge Street was deemed unsuitable, and not just because of its small size,\u0027 explained Ms Wordsworth.\u0027The location of the factory also caused the brothers some discomfort. As committed Quakers and members of the Society of Friends, they believed in providing a workplace in pleasant surroundings away from the dirt, grime and overcrowding of what had now become a small city.\u0027Enter the new premises at Bournville - a town that didn\u0027t even exist until the Cadburys moved their chocolate factory there.\u0027And it wasn\u0027t just a factory - it became a way of life, with green fields, habitable housing and good working conditions.\u0027Very good working conditions that any company today would be proud of.\u0027          A Bournville Cocoa cart pulled by two horses is pictured riding through the streets of Birmingham in 1915           Happy 100 years: The sheer number of staff employed at the Bournville Cadbury\u0027s plant is made clear in this picture from 1931. The congregation was organised to celebrate 100 years since the opening of the factory Alongside semi-detached cottages with gardens for the workers, there was a field next to the factory where men and could play cricket and football a garden and playground for the girls and proper welfare provisions.Over the years, sports facilities grew to include hockey, tennis, squash and bowling facilities.Eventually, swimming pools were built with everyone in Bournville taught how to swim.Staff days out were common, and for workers living outside of Bournville, Cadbury\u0027s negotiated reduced train fares with the local railway company. Education was made available for everyone and the company actively encouraged vocations outside of their business interest.A place of virtuous living, no pub was allowed in Bournville, a rule which still applies today.          The Cadbury family worked tirelessly to ensure slavery was abolished and that their workers farming cocoa abroad were paid. Here a group of cocoa farmers are pictured showing off their haul before it was shipped to the UK by boat Nowadays, Bournville is made up of 7,800 homes on 1,000 acres of land with 10 per cent of the space dedicated to parks and open spaces. It remains a popular residential area of Birmingham.In 2009, the American food company Kraft Foods launched a hostile takeover bid that was initially resisted by the board at Cadbury\u0027s.Despite protestations, the American company won their bid. Although initially promising that British factories would be kept open, Kraft closed the Somerdale factory in Bristol (formerly owned by Fry\u0027s) in 2011.Following its successful takeover Kraft named the spin-off company Mondelz International in 2012. In 2016, Mondelz came under fire for not keeping its promise to continue making chocolate at Bournville. Instead, it moved some of its manufacturing to Poland.But following a £75 million investment in the Birmingham plant, it looks as though they have made a new promise to return Cadbury\u0027s Dairy Milk to the UK.In 2018, Cadbury Dairy Milk was crowned as Britain\u0027s favourite chocolate bar, proving the confectionery\u0027s lasting appeal.            The man behind the chocolate: John Cadbury who founded Cadbury\u0027s in 1824 is pictured in a black and white portrait.

The move follows a petition that called it “outrageous and blasphemous”.The Second Coming series, from DC imprint Vertigo, was due to launch on 6 March. Written by Mark Russell and illustrated by Richard Pace, its story followed Jesus’s return to Earth. “Shocked to discover what has become of his gospel,” he teams up with a superhero, Sun-Man, who is more widely worshipped than him.But the comics publisher has now told retailers that the series has been cancelled. The decision follows a 200,000-signature petition from anti-abortion, anti-LGBT conservative campaign site CitizenGo calling on DC to pull the comic. “Would DC Comics publish similar content about other religious leaders, such as Muhammad or Buddha?” said the petition. “This content is inappropriate and blasphemous.”Russell told Syfy Wire that he and Pace had requested that rights for the comic be returned to them after they were warned that requests for more significant changes would probably be on the way.“So I decided I would rather keep the story intact,” he said. “Nobody really wants a watered-down, one-size-fits-none version of this story, so they graciously agreed to let me have it back … We also want a publisher who can get it to fans in the near future, so we hope to be able to announce a new home as soon as possible.”CitizenGo claimed the decision as a victory, telling Syfy Wire that Second Coming “portrays a false view” of Jesus, who is “not a failure”. It added: “Most children grow up reading about iconic DC superheroes like Batman, Superman, or Wonder Woman. It would be a shame to market this false view of Jesus as an equal read to these figures.”Russell was undeterred. “I first heard of CitizenGo … when they ran this silly campaign to get the buses in Portland to drop ads featuring lesbians. They would be completely ridiculous if not for the fact that social media’s anger-made-easy platforms give them access to cranks from all over the world. But it’s OK. Some enemies are worth having,” he told Syfy Wire. “I think the religious fundamentalists and critics who are trying to stop Second Coming aren’t interested in protecting Christ so much as their ability to control his narrative … They probably (correctly) suspect that it’s not Christ who’s being parodied, but themselves and how they’ve twisted his teachings of mercy for the powerless into a self-serving tool of the powerful.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72971993de3b55399ee2eeeadf150fb2ae6c3119/0_288_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33e1321e6209a2853269f9785b934024","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of them Welcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.Let’s start with some positivity: BirdsAreGood has been rereading Angela Carter’s Wise Children:And what a book it is chock full of joie de vivre, which makes it extremely poignant when you consider what happened to the author next. A splendid, sometimes surreal, romp devoid of anything even resembling anger or bitterness, it’s one of my very favourite novels. Dora Chance is, also, one of the finest narrative voices in fiction. She (and her twin sis) would almost certainly be the first name(s) on my literary dinner party list. What a joy it is to dance and sing. Thank you, Angela.I’m 100 pages into and head over heels for Middlemarch.James Baldwin has worked similar magic on Veufveuve:For now I’m just going to gush: I think If Beale Street Could Talk might be just about the most perfect novel ever. I don’t think he puts a foot wrong once.I know I am about 50 years late to the party but good lord is One Hundred Years of Solitude good. Underline half the pages, stay in bath until toes have shrivelled up, surviving on minimal hours sleep today good. The scene with Arcadio’s execution was astounding.Meanwhile, lonelybloomer has just finished Don DeLillo’s White Noise:It would be great to casually find more books like that. The humorous detail every now and then, existential musings, an apocalypse flavour and University setting on top of it - turns out, it’s my jam! I didn’t expect it to be so fun and accessible, too, because once earlier I’ve picked up his another book on JFK murder (the title escapes me) and couldn’t finish because I barely knew what was going on in it.Oh well, you can’t win them all, all the time. (That JFK book is called Libra.)RobertHowardNG9 has been rereading Birthday by Alan Sillitoe and “loving it as much as the first time”:Like Stoner by John Williams it is one those rare books I actually feel a participant in, rather than observer. Chapter 8 with Arthur Seaton in conversation with his wife Avril makes me wonder how Sillitoe overheard me and my wife?“Spurred by the sad death of Albert Finney”, beckythatcher has also been reading Sillitoe – this time Saturday Night and Sunday Morning:It’s a forgotten masterpiece. The characters all ring true. The description of factory work and pub nights is as good as (better than) a documentary. The post-war boom in earnings and full employment gave working people plenty of spare cash, and the family scenes are marvellous. Adultery, abortion, street fights and nosy neighbours - it’s all there. There’s a little, regrettable, sub-DH Lawrence stuff about countryside, but that’s more than forgivable.BristolHatter has been enjoying The Dawn Watch by Maya Jasonoff:I have read a number of books about Joseph Conrad over the years but this is shaping up to be one of the best so far. It is basically a biography with a concentration on the relevance of four of his novels to the experience of modern day life. Highly recommended for anyone with an interest in Conrad and his work.LLCoolJ_ recommends Late In The Day by Tessa Hadley:It’s the third of hers I’ve read, and she has yet to disappoint. I’ll take these words from NYT review:Hadley is adept at fluid omniscience, at storytelling that skims through the years as easily as it weaves through various points of view......and add that she is also adept at developing fully-realized characters, male and female, young and middle-aged. I almost forgot that I was reading about fictional characters. I liked it very muchFinally, SydneyH declares that Men at Arms, the first of Evelyn Waugh’s Sword of Honour series, “is a charming book”:Guy Crouchback, a middle-class, orced misfit, signs up with the Halberdiers regiment in the second world war. To the admiration of his peers, he grows a thick moustache, curls it with a hot iron, and procures a monocle for shooting. Waugh introduces a few brilliant characters, notably Crouchback’s fellow soldier, Apthorpe, but also his Cyclopean Brigadier Ritchie-Hook, and his man-hopping ex-wife. Much of the humour comes from the fiasco of administrating a rapidly-changing war campaign, with eccentric officers – some of whom are promoted just to be gotten rid of – complicating matters.Those who have read Sword Of Honour will also know about the “thunderbox”, and its responsibility for what must be one of the greatest moments in literary history… But to say more would ruin a wonderful surprise.

Greggs made a pre-tax profit of £81.8m in 2017.The January upgrade was the result of bumper sales of its festive bake and mince pies, as well as its hot drinks and breakfast range. It was not affected by the sales of the vegan snack, which had only just been launched.Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “The new vegan sausage roll has helped bring home the bacon for Greggs, prompting a spike in sales at the start of this year.“It’s unclear how much of the boom can be attributed to sales of actual vegan rolls rather than simply the publicity associated with the launch. However, catering for vegan diets is now rising up the priority list for many food retailers, with M\u0026ampS recently launching its new vegan range, Plant Kitchen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ead1d6402c2c9a2f09172b58fdcb7e44dce780a/0_291_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2310d79c97a4ee229f98f394324b22bd","title":"did you work for a uk high street chain that has closed","story":"For an upcoming project, we would like to hear from former workers of chain shops that shut about how it affected their livesWith thousands of high street shops closing over the last decade, communities have been rightly concerned about the decline and what the future holds.If you worked for a high street chain that shut down, we’d like to hear from you.

Leaving without a deal would threaten companies which export to more distant markets, he said. Some trade deals which the EU currently has with nations such as Japan and South Korea will not be applied to the UK before Brexit.Clark has been one of the most prominent voices in Prime Minister Theresa May’s cabinet in favour of the withdrawal agreement the government reached with the EU.However, the deal still faces significant opposition from a majority in Parliament, led by backbench Conservatives who want a no-deal Brexit to remain part of the government’s negotiating strategy.The business secretary, Greg Clark, has said that Honda’s decision to close its Swindon plant shows how much is at stake for British industry ahead of Brexit.While Honda insisted that Brexit was not to blame for the closure, Clark made it clear that he regards a no-deal Brexit as unacceptable for UK firms.Manufacturers’ warnings on customs delays and tariffs are “Project Reality”, Clark said – a reference to the “Project Fear” moniker used by Brexit-backing politicians to describe predictions of chaos if there is no deal.Clark was speaking in London at the conference of Make UK – the manufacturing lobby group which today ditched its previous name, the EEF.Michael Gove, the environment secretary, has today revealed that the UK will apply tariffs on food imports, in a concession to farmers who had feared their industry could be overwhelmed by cheap food from abroad.There had been reports at the weekend of zero tariff rates on food – a policy being pushed by some of the economists who backed leaving the EU. However, Gove said these were “not accurate”, in a speech at the National Farmers’ Union conference in Birmingham.Read more from the ’s Lisa O’Carroll on the politics live blog here.Howard Archer, chief economic advisor at EY ITEM Club, said the lack of a bounceback from a “marked relapse in the third quarter” was “pretty disappointing news”.Part of the UK’s recent poor labour productivity performance has undoubtedly been that low wage growth has increased the attractiveness of employment for companies.It is also highly probable that several companies have preferred to take on labour rather than commit to costly investment, given a highly uncertain economic and political outlook, magnified by Brexit since mid-2016. The low cost of labour relative to capital has certainly supported employment over investment.Alpesh Paleja, a principal economist at the Confederation of British Industry, said continued weak productivity growth poses a “risk to the sustainability of the recovery in pay going forward”.Some reaction to the labour market numbers earlier this morning, which showed that unemployment remains low, and wage growth continued:The figures may represent a peak for the British labour market, according to Andrew Wishart, a UK economist at Capital Economics – although he still believes the Bank of England will raise interest rates faster than markets currently expect. He said:While reassuring, the large rise in employment in the fourth quarter probably marks a peak in employment growth given the deterioration in surveys of hiring in January. And pay growth plateaued.Tom Hadley, director of policy at the Recruitment \u0026amp Employment Confederation, said the figures show “the resilience of the UK jobs market, with record vacancies and numbers of people in work”.However, he also noted the significant downturn in businesses confidence in the UK economy which is impacting on future hiring intentions in surveys. There is a real fear, as we are seeing in the UK manufacturing industry, that we will see lower growth and fewer opportunities in the future.Having confirmed that its Swindon plant is to close, Honda now appears to be saying that the number of job losses could reach 7,000, double what was expected, report the ’s Rob Davies and Julia Kollewe.That’s because it is consulting with subsidiaries and partners in the supply chain serving the Swindon plant, meaning a further 3,500 jobs could go.Meanwhile, the company is insisting that its decision is not down to Brexit, but automotive analysts aren’t buying it. There may be other important factors, they say, but it’s impossible to remove Brexit from the equation.“They’re probably trying to be polite publicly,” said Professor David Bailey of Aston University.The Labour party’s shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long Bailey, blamed the government’s austerity programme for Honda’s decision.She said it was “devastating news, first and foremost for Honda employees and their families, but also for the jobs across the supply chain and the impact on the local economy in Swindon”This government has failed to create an environment of business confidence. The Tories’ austerity programme has failed workers and businesses, and they continue to show a total lack of vision or plans for investment in our future.With Honda saying Brexit was not a factor, this Tory government shoulders yet more responsibility for failing to create an environment of business confidence. Businesses have lost faith in the government’s austerity programme and total lack of vision or investment for our future.The car industry’s lobby group reacts to the “devastating” Honda announcement.While the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders has not commented directly on Honda’s reasoning, it’s clear that Brexit is still on the industry’s mind.Mike Hawes, SMMT Chief Executive: “Today’s announcement is a huge blow to UK automotive manufacturing, and for the Honda plant’s highly skilled and productive workforce. Whilst production will continue in Swindon until 2021, giving government and industry time to help affected employees and the local supply chain, which supports a further 10,000 jobs, this is, nevertheless, devastating news.The challenges facing Honda are not unique. The global automotive industry is facing fundamental changes: technological, commercial and environmental, as well as escalating trade tensions, and all manufacturers are facing difficult decisions.The UK should be at the forefront of these changes, championing its competitiveness and innovation, rather than having to focus resources on the need to avoid a catastrophic ‘no-deal’ Brexit. In mid-morning trading the FTSE 100 has slightly extended its losses, with HSBC and Standard Chartered still the biggest fallers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1adcc92c76b30b54958309025ea4de8188e37238/0_190_2992_1795/master/2992.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c9acbe7e6047a5ea118b3fd084ba118","title":"how britains post industrial cities got hooked on booze","story":"With heavy industry mostly gone, cities such as Newcastle, Leeds and Liverpool have become worryingly dependent on the alcohol-driven night-time economyThe night’s first visitor to the Safe Haven – a Peugeot ambulance with twin sick bays, parked in the shadow of the St Nicholas cathedral – is carried in by friends around 10.30pm. He is unable to walk, although at regular intervals he is able to throw up some of the bottle of rum he has just drunk.The St John Ambulance team here in Newcastle see dozens of these men and women every night: a head laceration on a rough sleeper, a student who thinks she broke a tooth when a friend accidentally closed a door on her, a German couple concerned about a man tottering precariously close to the edge of the High Level Bridge.The common denominator? Alcohol, and in due course the patients are walked 20 yards to a second van nearby that has been converted to take eight seats, and has sick bowls and wet wipes. Under the supervision of two police officers the patients are given time to sober up, charge their phones, contact friends or family, and get taxis home.One of the officers has worked the city centre beat for 16 years. “Babysitting drunk kids didn’t used to be our job,” he says. “But the focus these days is on people’s safety.”Some surveys suggest a recent trend towards more moderate drinking among younger people, but on tonight’s evidence, there are still plenty who enjoy a drink. The crew will assess and treat more than 50 people by sunrise.“There are drinkers who know they’ve had enough, those who don’t, and those who do but carry on,” says Daryen Lemmon, clinical operations manager of the North East Ambulance Service, which runs the Safe Haven in partnership with St John and the Northumbria police and crime commissioner.“They’re the dangerous ones, and the challenge is to make them understand that they are vulnerable.”The Safe Haven is designed to help tackle that challenge, relieving pressure on Newcastle’s stretched police and hospital resources. Five years ago, before it was introduced, A\u0026ampE waiting rooms and police station receptions were stuffed on weekend nights. Similar safe havens are in operation in Bristol and Cardiff. In December, NHS England made £300,000 available for other cities to set up similar facilities over the festive period.But along the so-called Diamond Strip of Newcastle nightclubs, there is still plenty to keep police patrol cars, ambulances and street pastors busy as they rub shoulders with pushy promoters promising three trebles – three triple-shots of spirits, such as vodka or rum, with a mixer like Red Bull or orange – for little more than a fiver.Post-industrial cities such as Newcastle, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester and Nottingham dominate the latest Which? University rankings of best cities for nightlife. They have some of the highest densities of pubs and bars per sq km, and the most recent Public Health England figures suggest those densities are increasing every year – and much faster than the national average.Serving a regional population of around 2 million, Newcastle’s compact city centre offers a rowdy but representative sample on a Saturday night: all ages, men and women, but skewed heavily in favour of the 50,000 students who study here. These younger revellers seek entry between the red velvet ropes erected by pre-bars and clubs with exotic names like Tup Tup Palace, Florita’s and Bijoux. A more affluent set of locals head for the gin bars and microbreweries of Grey Street and High Bridge. Older drinkers settle in for the night in the traditional pubs of the Bigg Market.These pubs, bars and nightclubs are the engine of the night-time economy, on which Britain’s struggling post-industrial cities and towns are becoming ever more dependent. In many ways it is itself a hangover from the past: the great industrial cities of 19th-century Britain were saturated with beer houses, gin palaces and pubs, and in Newcastle drinking patterns formed around the working lives of shipbuilders and coal miners who finished their last shifts at 1pm on a Saturday, then went to the pub and drank away their wages until closing time.Now, with heavy industry gone, these cities are left with their reputation as party towns. Newcastle city council estimates its night-time economy accounts for 7,000 jobs, £500m of revenue and 17 million visitors a year – more than a few of them on stag or hen parties. “As proud Geordies, we sure know how to party in style,” boasts the local bar crawl organiser Last Night of Freedom. “If you’re visiting the city and you’re looking for a canny night out – slap on your false tan, prepare to tash on and get propa mortal.”Protecting this reputation comes at a high price. You hardly need a Lancet subscription to know the links between alcohol and a slew of health and social problems: heart disease, liver disease, brain damage, cancer, mental health problems, accidents, injuries, assaults, domestic violence and sexual offences, to name a few.The alcohol-related mortality rate in Newcastle has risen in the last five years from 48 to 61 per 100,000 people. The English average is 46. Rachael Hope, the city’s community safety specialist for drugs and alcohol, says she knows of 4,066 dependent drinkers in Newcastle, including 180 she describes as having multiple issues of substance abuse or mental health. “They’re the ‘frequent flyers’ who come in and out of various different services,” she says, “but you don’t necessarily see alcohol problems present themselves in the same way as you would see a drug issue – until possibly it’s too late.”Newcastle has done more than most to constrain what economists would call these “externalities”: side effects of a product that have a negative impact on society as a whole but aren’t reflected in its price.Now keen to shed the image it gained as a stag and hen party destination of alcoholic excess – amplified to the world through the MTV reality show Geordie Shore – the city introduced a new licensing strategy last year that seeks to prove its night-time economy is about more than just alcohol. In neighbourhoods with the most licensed premises, the council is encouraging operators to move towards a more mixed offer: more restaurants, more bars with seating, more family-oriented attractions.Bars along the city’s Georgian Grey Street have accepted a voluntary minimum unit pricing of 50p. Newcastle is one of just eight cities and local authorities to introduce a late-night levy: 243 licensed premises pay into a fund that pays for the extra policing, taxi marshals and after-hours cleaning incurred by the night-time economy.On the top floor of the Newcastle Civic Centre, a half-hour walk from the Diamond Strip, Ed Foster heads up the city’s public safety and regulation team. “We want to support business and growth in the city, but we want to shape what goes where,” he says. “By having the right planning and licensing policies, we can help business fit in with what our vision is of the future of the city.”Police, meanwhile, have been working with bar and club staff, training them to take better care of drunk and vulnerable people following a series of tragic incidents: in 2012, a drunk 17-year-old schoolgirl was raped by at least two men after being thrown out of Digital nightclub in 2016, the death of an 18-year-old student at Hoults Yard revealed a shortage of qualified first-aiders on the premises.That same year, a 20-year-old Newcastle University student died from excessive alcohol during an Agric Society initiation ceremony. The school and other universities in the city have since intervened, encouraging freshers’ week organisers to plan as many “grub crawls” as pub crawls. Meanwhile, a drugs bust and forced closure of three adjoining late-night bars on the Diamond Strip in 2017 has led to clampdowns on club-night promoters, who could soon become licensed and regulated in the same way as bouncers and door staff.“Police budgets have shrunk, so I’ve got to work differently,” says Ch Insp Dave Pickett, who is responsible for Newcastle city centre. “One of my sons is 13 now, so in the not-too-distant future he’ll be wanting to go out with his friends and I want to know he’ll be looked after, not left abandoned on a night out.”The city of Liverpool reckons its economic cost from misuse of alcohol at around £750m a year. In January this year it opened a Centre for Alcohol Research, but it faces the same dilemma as Newcastle and others seeking to reduce harm from alcohol: how to regenerate city centres without it? Central government funding to Newcastle will have fallen by £282m in the 10 years to 2020. Licensed premises are some of the city’s most successful remaining businesses.The rules are skewed towards the interests of Big Alcohol, says Colin Shevills, director of the north-east campaign group Balance.Indeed, more than nine out of 10 applications for licences – many of them for high-volume “vertical-drinking” bars – are being approved, even in “cumulative impact zones”, areas that cities have already identified as saturated. In Newcastle the number of licensed premises continues to rise, not fall, from 1,165 in 2013 to 1,197 now. Each pays as much as £1,000 for a licence. To a cash-strapped city, alcohol is a much-needed source of revenue.The extended drinking hours introduced by the Licensing Act were aimed at bringing  “continental”-style café culture to England: according to a slogan of the time, “Bologna in Birmingham, Madrid in Manchester, why not?”A decade later, the government devolved responsibility for drugs and alcohol treatment services to local authorities, leaving cities to pick up the bill. Subsequent austerity cuts meant places like Newcastle could no longer afford to pay for dedicated alcohol services, which are now merged with drugs treatment services. At least 41 English hospitals do not currently have an alcohol care team.The government’s toothless approach to alcohol contrasts with its aggressive targeting of Big Tobacco, which has seen it restrict the sales of cigarettes and all but banish advertising. That would be tricky to do with booze. Much of the night-time economy is run by the alcohol industry. Night-time mayors typically have backgrounds in nightclubs or licensed premises: in London, for example, the current chair of the Night Time Commission, Kate Nicholls, is also the CEO of UK Hospitality her vice chair is a director of the Drinkaware Trust, which is funded largely by donations from UK alcohol producers, retailers and supermarkets.Restricting advertising is another option. In the US, several cities already ban alcohol ads on public transport, including New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco. “History has shown us is that when restrictions and bans were placed on tobacco sponsorship, other companies come in and fill the advertising void,” says Shevills.But the alcohol industry, like Big Tobacco before it, is resilient and resourceful, and unlikely to give up control of cities without a fight. Lobbying in Chicago, Charlotte and Washington DC, for example, has recently overturned bans on alcohol advertising on public transit.Likewise, in another Newcastle – the one in New South Wales, Australia – “lockout” laws that have halved alcohol-related assaults are under constant attack. Local activist Tony Brown says the city centre used to be a no-go zone at night, held hostage by the “three Vs: violence, vandalism and vomit”.And yet New South Wales’s Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority is under sustained lobbying to roll back the changes, in spite of evidence of what can happen when licensing hours are relaxed.“We had this whole narrative going on, which is common internationally, that the blame was all about the young people themselves. It really pissed me off from a social equity view,” says Brown. “No one was ever talking about political responsibility or the industry’s responsibility. This is a dominant mono-narrative about blaming young people.“Our cities must disentangle themselves from the industry and escape from the notion that the unfettered availability and supply of alcohol is a prerequisite for the development and sustainability of the night-time economy. Our city has proven otherwise.”For the rest, as any addict knows, the first step to recovery is admitting they have a problem.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70b2e2a2104bb64280a96e51966e85400c8d3643/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab584341fd1727be2db5f0eda5c048bf","title":"labour schism sdp brexit seven mps","story":"During a national crisis over Brexit, the breakaway of seven MPs with no policy programme is a dangerous distractionThe great Brexit crisis slices through both parties, iding families, friends, neighbours and colleagues. It may yet break apart the moribund political system. But that seismic rupture didn’t happen today when seven MPs walked out of the Labour party.Seven is a pitifully small number. The timing is monstrously badly judged and the reasons the MPs give are oddly scattergun, lacking political punch and focus. To be sure, they are not alone in thinking Jeremy Corbyn a weak leader with many failings: his poll ratings show most of the country agrees, as did the 172 Labour MPs who voted no confidence in him two and half years ago, as his “kinder gentler politics” turned poisonous.But whether born of despair or vanity, this walkout is a damaging distraction, because right here, right now, there is only one cause that matters – Brexit. That’s not one issue among many, it is the great question that has the nation’s future hanging by a thread. It is the debate that contains within it all the other arguments about Britain’s ideals, identities, ideologies and insanities.Those other MPs who tried to oust Corbyn still think much the same of him now as they did then. But they have not quit, not at this catastrophically inappropriate juncture, erting attention from the supreme task of this generation of politicians. The best of them, such as Peter Kyle and Yvette Cooper, are stuck deep into battle to rescue us from calamity: Labour will again back Cooper’s amendment next week to prevent a no-deal crash-out and delay withdrawal. Some of those 35 Labour MPs who failed to back it last time are being brought round, giving it a good chance of success.It does of course madden many Labour MPs that foot-dragging Corbyn has been almost absent from the fight against this Tory Brexit disaster. With him surrounded, if not held captive, by a cabal of Len McCluskey’s people, you only had to listen to the Unite leader’s infuriating pro-Brexit views on the Peston show last week to suspect he spoke the Labour leader’s mind too. Their views are deep-frozen in the 1970s. But what matters is less what Corbyn privately thinks than what he does when it comes to crunch Brexit votes – and so far, there has been no misstep.Labour MPs walking away at this point only give succour to those Labour pro-Brexiters,such as Caroline Flint, who caricature those in favour of reversing Brexit as members of “metropolitan elites”. Paradoxically, their defection hardened the resolve of scores of Labour MPs to stay, those who in the past considered splitting. They are the ones most angry at the defectors, accusing them of failing to work hard enough in their constituencies, failing to build around themselves loyal teams to fight off marauders. The one who has their sympathy is Luciana Berger, bombarded with antisemitic abuse and forced to fight off deselection when about to give birth.This walkout comes as a head of steam is building up within Labour at Corbyn appearing to dodge his party’s conference policy to back a referendum. Corbyn’s own Momentum movement has been expressing its frustration at their leader’s reluctance to get behind a people’s vote. Labour has been haemorrhaging members, old and new, over Brexit. Wherever I go, Labour people tell me they are struggling to persuade members not to tear up their cards. “Don’t do it!” they say. “Stay and fight for Labour to take the right stand on Brexit. Corbyn won’t be there much longer: stay to select the next leader, don’t abandon us.”Does this feel at all like 1981 and the creation of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), which broke away from Michael Foot’s Labour? Not a jot. I was there and there is no comparison. These seven lack anyone of the stature, public recognition or intellectual heft of the SDP leaders. The Gang of Four between them had all held serious government office – between them they had occupied the roles of chancellor, home secretary, foreign secretary, education and transport secretary. This grouplet does not have that kind of weight and it lacks ideological substance and ideas. Corbyn’s failure to stamp out antisemitism is a just cause, but why not stay to fight it? Remember, the SDP defectors left not out of irritation with an inadequate leader, but because they could not and would not stand on Foot’s manifesto that pledged to leave the EU and Nato.Compare that to Corbyn and John McDonnell’s last manifesto, which was widely popular, with no ideological deal-breakers for a broad church party. Some might query costings or priorities – why billions for middle-class students, not for needy toddlers in Sure Starts? Some might niggle at the practicalities of utility renationalisation – but these were popular policies. Nothing there felt like an updated version of the notorious 1981 manifesto, dubbed the “longest suicide note in history”. These seven defectors were vague on reasons for jumping ship, beyond wishing for a better leader.Philip Collins , a former speechwriter for Tony Blair, has written a good manifesto for a putative new social democratic party, entitled Start Again. But since almost any Labour MP would back almost all of it, that suggests less need for a new party than for one better led. Brexit could still destroy Labour. The 2017 manifesto got away with promising “the benefits of the single market and the customs union”. Since then, Keir Starmer has deftly led the party to vote the right way on every Brexit ision. So far so good.But now Corbyn needs to back the Peter KylePhil Wilson clever compromise. Their plan is for MPs to agree to pass Theresa May’s bad deal, but only on condition it is put to the voters for a final decision. People on both sides of the ide are gathering round this option as the best chance of resolving Brexit, once and for all, whenever May finally holds her meaningful vote. The plan lets MPs in Brexit-voting seats obey their electorate by voting for May’s Brexit – but frees them to campaign to remain in a referendum. The good signs are that McDonnell and Starmer are warming to the plan. This will be Corbyn’s vital test: in the end he will have no choice but to do the right thing.If the Labour leader ends up in any way enabling Brexit if as a modern-day Ramsay MacDonald he makes Labour complicit in this historic Tory catastrophe, then expect all hell to break loose in the party. If he goes against the will of his party, the great majority of his voters and his MPs, the party will break apart – and so it should. But that hasn’t happened. These seven are jumping a gun that may never be fired. They will find it cold out there. I know that from experience. So deep was the SDPLabour split that sitting in the  canteen, Labourites picked up their plates and walked away from us SDP-ites. Schism is bitter and personal. And in this particular case, needless."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/226cce70224830a5b011f0261f3e7622f93786e4/0_72_5183_3109/master/5183.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29b519401984241df34bc953fa487b9f","title":"angela smith left labour funny tinge mp racism","story":"On Monday, seven Labour MPs resigned the whip to sit as the Independent Group in the House of Commons, and the slide of British politics into the surreal continued apace. Immediately after citing the antisemitism crisis as one of her reasons for quitting the Labour party, Angela Smith joined me in the BBC Politics Live studio and when sharing her thoughts on the nature of racism said “it’s not just about being black or a funny tinge … you know, different - B, err from the BME community”. Whoever had “new splinter group embroiled in racist scandal after three hours of existence” in the parliamentary sweepstakes, please collect your tenner from reception.Neither of these things excuse Smith’s comments. Offering a politician’s non-apology that accepts everything but responsibility isn’t the same as accountability. Framing the comment as having “misspoken” treats racism like it’s some involuntary reflex. Someone speaking light-heartedly about their loved one, based on years of shared experience and affection, is not the same as an MP referring to BME people as having a “funny tinge” while gesturing at the only person of colour on a current affairs panel. The latter, besides being buttock-clenchingly gauche, positions people of colour as being inherently abnormal. It suggests that melanin is somehow a stain or an aberration. And if you want to make that joke, at least have the decency to marry my mum first.It seems that prompting racist brain glitches in British elected representatives is my superpower: it was only a fortnight ago that Nadine Dorries, the Conservative MP for Mid Bedfordshire, mixed me up with another brown woman with infinitely better bone structure. After Dorries apologised to, err, Newsbeat for “any offence” she may have caused, the story was promptly forgotten. While it takes a lot more to offend me on a personal level (I went to an all-girls school, the banter was brutal), both these incidents demonstrate a deep problem with how the political establishment, and the media culture at large, react to the mere existence of people of tinge.On Newsnight, one of the Splinter Seven, Chris Leslie, quickly brushed over his colleague’s comments when asked about them by Kirsty Wark. Despite the clip of Smith’s flub having garnered over a million views on Twitter, it wasn’t featured on Channel 4 News, BBC News at 10 or this morning’s Today programme. It would be utterly unthinkable that a Labour member, let alone an MP, would have been forgiven so quickly for a similar statement at the height of the summer’s antisemitism crisis. The Independent Group, justifiably, have excoriated their former party for the pace and ineffectiveness of its disciplinary procedures. But as they’ve not officially launched a party of their own, they’ve managed to skilfully evade any such criticism of their own internal workings. How would I make a complaint about Angela Smith’s comments? What kind of disciplinary procedure would she face? Have these MPs signed up to a working definition of racism? And when will the establishment media confront the Independent Group over its institutional racism problem?Angela Smith’s Politics Live appearance exposed a lot more than her own personal squeamishness when it comes to issues of race: it revealed the double standard in political media when it comes to identifying racism on the left, and accountability elsewhere. This isn’t the new politics that the Independent Group promised at their launch – but the same old cycle of racism, rinse, repeat that people of tinge have had to deal with for decades.• Ash Sarkar is a senior editor at Novara Media, and lectures in political theory at the Sandberg Instituut"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6b47777022f53cdee126d4f0f00a5aab9b03a99/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29d2395f531ea301deb0723b18f8f8b2","title":"bernie sanders repeat success 2020","story":"Despite losing in 2016, he triumphed in other ways. Ironically, his success four years ago may impede his second candidacyIt’s easy to forget the condescension and amusement that greeted himwhen he announced his first campaign for president, on May 26, 2015.How, it was asked, could a rumpled, 73-year-old, self-described Democratic Socialist – a junior senator from tiny Vermont, who was born in Brooklyn, Jewish, hadn’t even been a Democrat for most of his political career, and eschewed money from super PACs – possibly triumph against Hillary Clinton?In the end, he didn’t. But he triumphed in other ways.Most importantly, he showed Democrats they could run successfully on policies like Medicare for all, free public higher education, and higher taxes on the wealthy – instead of the cautious “New Democrat” centrism of Bill Clinton, Al Gore, John Kerry and Barack Obama.Bernie Sanders put “progressive” back into the Democratic party of Franklin D Roosevelt.Now, ironically, his success four years ago may impede his second candidacy. Not only is he four years older, Bernie is no longer the only progressive in town.Senators Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown are pushing many of the same themes and drawing enthusiasm from many of the same quarters.And partly because of his success at mobilizing and energizing Democrats in the 2016 primaries, a slew of other presidential hopefuls are approaching the 2020 primary campaign the same way – foregoing big money, talking up the importance of reviving democracy, using social media, and advancing ideas that would once have been considered too radical.The conventional view is Bernie helped move the Democratic party to the “left.”Wrong. Even before his primary campaign, American politics was moving away from the old right-left ide between “small-government” conservatives from “big-government” liberals.Bernie helped reveal a new and deeper political ide in America – between oligarchy and democracy.Rather than the size of government, he raised the more central question of who government is for.Donald Trump rode a similar wave of populist anger at a political elite too cozy with big business and too concerned about its own survival to pay attention to average working people. But, as has become clear, Trump was a Trojan horse for the same oligarchy he condemned.The American oligarchy is real. According to a study published in 2014 by Princeton Professor Martin Gilens and Northwestern Professor Benjamin Page, although Americans enjoy many features of democratic governance, American policymaking has become dominated by powerful business organizations and a small number of affluent Americans. The typical American has no influence at all.The only advanced country Zucman found with similarly high levels of wealth concentration is Russia, whose oligarchy is notorious. America has had an oligarchy once before – in the first Gilded Age, which ran from the 1880s until the first decades of the twentieth century. Teddy Roosevelt called those oligarchs the “malefactors of great wealth,” and fought them by breaking up their monopolies and instituting a progressive federal income tax.His fifth cousin, Franklin D Roosevelt, reduced their power further by strictly regulating Wall Street and encouraging the growth of labor unions. “Government by organized money is just as dangerous as Government by organized mob,” FDR. thundered in 1936. “Never before in all our history have these forces been so united against one candidate as they stand today. They are unanimous in their hate for me — and I welcome their hatred.” Bernie Sanders effectively repeated these words 80 years later.By the end of World War II, the American oligarchy had dissipated – its wealth lost during the Great Depression, its power countervailed by government and unions.But in recent years, the American oligarchy has returned. Bernie has done more than any other politician in modern America to sound the alarm, and mobilize the public to reclaim our democracy and economy. For that alone, we are in his enduring debt."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4deffd78c9dd3e919bfb3ae651a44a12e96ce77/0_337_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc140b089059e60154638e4e6cf422e5","title":"new behaviour code schools guide headteachers","story":"A guide for headteachers in England aims to help them deal ethically with thorny issues like exclusions - and to confront colleagues who do notOne of the most enduring images of recent decades has been that of the superhead: the heroic, league-table topping, entrepreneurial lone-ranger figure, once compared by the former chief inspector of schools, Sir Michael Wilshaw, to a Clint Eastwood figure “fighting for righteousness”.But might the model of the next few decades be different – a less combative leader, driven as much by a vision of a good society as by competitive advantage?That is the profound wish of Carolyn Roberts, a longstanding headteacher and one of the architects of the Ethical Leadership Commission. The influential body, founded by headteachers, has been working for two years to come up with a common set of values to help school leaders navigate what they describe as an education “moral maze”, in which behaviour can be driven by a preoccupation with results.But why do we need to recalibrate school leadership to be more ethical? In many ways this is a troubling question to be asking on a damp February morning in the successful south London comprehensive Roberts has led for the past six years.Does the fact that we need to reinvigorate the moral purpose of education suggest that something has gone wrong with school leadership? Is it now unethical?Roberts, headteacher of Thomas Tallis school, a huge erse comprehensive sandwiched between Blackheath and Kidbrooke in the London borough of Greenwich, chooses her words carefully. “We now have so many different types of schools and we need to be certain there is enough that binds us together.”While Roberts is careful not to criticise fellow heads, the elephants in the room are hard to ignore: regular reports about some schools “off-rolling” – getting rid of challenging students cheating in exams “gaming” the curriculum by channelling students into easier subjects. And then there’s exorbitant headteacher pay, and even financial scams that verge on the criminal.Roberts knows headteachers are under intense pressure to keep improving results. She admits that in the past – she was head of two schools in the north-east before moving to London – she has faced “personal dilemmas” over issues such as the use of GCSE-equivalent qualifications that were promoted intensively to boost some schools’ league table positions.“It is really hard for people who are under pressure all the time,” she says. “Too many headteachers have found themselves compromised. The accountability measures say they have to achieve one thing and the local authority or academy trust says you have to do it quickly, therefore decision-making becomes harder and people take what they may view as shortcuts.“It is perfectly reasonable to make sure that a child gets a good set of examination results. But we can’t get away from the fact that schools are communities that ought to model what we value about society. What we are hearing is that headteachers want a language they can use to support them in that long-term nuanced work.”In an age where “robust” leadership and easily measured outcomes are highly valued, the commission could be accused of promoting a more “wishy-washy” definition of education.Michael Gove, the former education secretary, whose reforms still shape the lives of many schools, pioneered the idea of a slimmed-down inspection framework devoid of what he described as “peripherals” such as pupil wellbeing and community cohesion. His colleague Nick Gibb, who once described the idea of social and emotional learning as “ghastly”, remains as schools minister.But the Ethical Leadership Commission has high-level support from the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), which helped to set it up, the National Association of Head Teachers, the Church of England Education Office, the Headmasters and Headmistresses’ Conference, the Chartered College of Teaching and the National Governors’ Association. At the publication of its final report last month, it received a warm welcome from the interim National Schools Commissioner, Dominic Herrington.Geoff Barton, general secretary of ASCL and a former headteacher, is adamant that the current system is not unethical. “The vast majority of practice upholds the values articulated in this framework,” he says. “Our members felt it was time to identify and articulate the principles and values that are immutable in education leadership, and provide a supportive framework upon which school leaders can draw in making difficult decisions under great pressure.”A hundred schools are now trialling the framework and an ethics forum will meet several times a year to consider the sort of dilemmas leaders face, in the context of the Nolan principles – seven principles of public life: selflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty and leadership – to which the commission has added the personal characteristics of trust, wisdom, kindness, justice, service, courage and optimism.The chief inspector of schools, Amanda Spielman, is a member of the commission and Roberts believes proposed changes to the Ofsted framework – away from focusing on results and towards a broader definition of “quality of education” – reinforce the idea that change is coming.Far from being abstract, she argues, the commission’s “virtues and values” are intricately bound up in real-life dilemmas faced by heads, and marshalling them into a framework can give colleagues confidence and courage. “For example, it is about going down the road and looking a colleague in the eye and saying: ‘the way you do admissions or exclusions affects my school, and can we talk about this?’ That is quite a difficult thing to do, so courage is very important.“It is about heads feeling they can be honest with parents if there is a disappointing set of GCSE results. It is about ensuring that children see adults treating each other in a just, wise and kind way, modelling the sort of behaviour we would want to see in society,” says Roberts.She adds: “It is about supporting heads who want to take time to see both sides of the argument before making a reasoned judgment, or those who would prefer to support and be kind to a teacher who is under pressure in the hope of helping them through a difficult patch, rather than feeling that they are compromised because people expect them to be instant judges and zero-tolerant of failure.”Even the current debate about mobile phone use in school has an ethical dimension, she says, and should be seen in the broader context of how society and adults use electronic devices.Most urgently, though, she argues that the framework is needed because England is facing a chronic teacher recruitment and retention crisis and headteachers in their 50s are leaving the profession in record numbers, partly because of competitive pressures and leadership styles that were valued in the past. Wilshaw notoriously suggested that heads would know they were doing their job properly if “staff morale was at an all-time low”.“This had led to intolerable workload issues and it has made it harder for teachers to see themselves doing the job for 40 years,” says Roberts. “We are losing experience and wisdom from the system. But every interaction in school ought to build up a stable and happy community in which all children are valued and adults want to work. We need a clear idea of what schools are for and we need to take seriously our responsibility to the sorts of citizens we want for the future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cd00a43eef45ce122a3f95ed41204280aaa30fa/0_128_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea6b6a2a3c33e7570007fd42f7cad380","title":"london fashion week shafts of light to the heavy weight of history","story":"Contrasting shows from Roksanda and Erdem have immediate appealOrange is not traditionally worn with raspberry, nor caramel with tangerine, but they make perfect sense to designer Roksanda Ilinčić. “We live in a world of crazy contrast,” she said with a shrug backstage after her London fashion week show on Monday morning. “We all feel that, I think, and it creates a lot of anxiety.”Ilinčić, who begins each collection by sifting through her “precious box of colours – swatches of fabrics, images from books, postcards”, has a gift for finding beauty in the crazy contrasts. “I like putting together colours that are not supposed to go together,” she said.Burnt orange trousers teamed with a toffee taffeta tunic, finished with a coral pussy-bow flourish opened the show for her brand, Roksanda. A pumpkin trouser suit was matched with a fuchsia blouse. In between the jewel-box combinations came serenely beautiful palette cleansers in chic neutrals, like an oyster-grey soft wool boilersuit. The effect Ilinčić was aiming for was “a rainbow in a cloud”. She commissioned the London-based art trio Troika, whose Borrowed Light installation is on display at the BarbicanCentre, London, on a set where shafts of coloured light fell across a catwalk thickly carpeted with sand (or what appeared to be sand, but was actually salt) like sunset on a beach.Meanwhile at the National Portrait Gallery, Dame Joan Collins in the front row set the tone of old-school glamour for the Erdem show. On a trip to Rome, the designer Erdem Moralıoğlu visited the 1,000-room Palazzo Doria Pamphilj and became “obsessed” with the story of Princess Orietta Doria Pamphilj, who lived there until she died 19 years ago. A descendent of Pope Innocent X and heir to one of the world’s largest art collections, Orietta had been expected to become a nun but instead returned from a trip to London in the early 1960s with an adopted son.“What I liked about this story was the sense of the heavy weight of history, and how it plays out in this woman’s clothes. You can really feel this weight, in her home in Rome. There’s this moment when she has been in London at a time of huge social upheaval and returns to Rome, where she becomes obsessed with the idea of protecting her inheritance.” Photographs of her from this time show the influence of swinging London – shorter hemlines, piled-up beehives, feather trims – but “at the same time, she is sewing jewels into the lining of her coat, to carry them across borders”, said the designer backstage after his show, in between posing for photos with Collins.The backstory was a little heavy going, but the clothes were immediately appealing. The eccentric aristocrat is probably the oldest trope in fashion, but Erdem succeeded in making it fresh. There were grand-dame ball skirts and working-girl pencil skirts. Neat brooch-pinned cardigans were layered over beatnik black polo necks. Some models wore party-girl winged eyeliner, some black netted veils, and some both. Everyone wore fabulous earrings, and took the catwalk at a clip, in kitten heeled pumps."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e8607fbbc65f8451e1c3b82013217bccf1d229a/0_80_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c93b950a524786b84e897bcdd45028d","title":"dont feed monster the people who have stopped buying new clothes","story":"A growing movement eschews fast fashion in favour of secondhand clothing. Is this the biggest personal change that can be made for the environment?Lauren Cowdery is flicking through the rails of the Cancer Research charity shop in Goole, east Yorkshire. “Too bobbly!” she tuts at a ribbed top. “This skirt is big but it would be easy to take in … ” Cowdery appears to be shopping, but she is merely browsing. She is on a mission not to buy any new clothes, even ones that have recently belonged to someone else. “I think you have to pull back and ask: ‘Do I need this?’” she says.So how hard is it to make the transition to a more sustainable way of shopping? In the UK, clothing has the fourth largest environmental impact after housing, transport and food. More than half of fast-fashion items are thrown away in less than a year, according to McKinsey’s State of Fashion report last year. But is buying secondhand really an antidote to fast fashion?In Goole, where Cowdery works as a marketing officer for the Junction Theatre, there are ample local distractions for a lunch break: Dorothy Perkins, New Look, Peacocks. Cowdery used to buy things “because they were there”. In the evenings, she went on Asos. “I’d think: ‘Oh brilliant, a discount code! Free shipping! I’ll order stuff! Hmm … It doesn’t fit very well, but I can’t be bothered to send it back … I’ll keep it.’”Each month, Cowdery bought two or three things. “At £20 a time, that starts to build up. There’s a wardrobe of stuff. Things with the tags still on … I took a look at myself and thought: ‘What are you doing?’”Curious about a post she saw on Facebook, one weekend Cowdery dropped into the Leeds Community Clothes Exchange, a local swap shop. Four years on, she is one of its three directors, helping to oversee the 2,000 items – “designer stuff, vintage stuff, handmade things, wedding dresses” – that pass through the doors of the Woodhouse community centre each month.Cowdery and I meet in one of those lunch hours that used to be spent shopping. Her skirt, top and cardigan are all from the Clothes Exchange her boots are from the Autism Plus shop in Goole. “At the exchange, it’s one for one on everything,” she explains. There are no value judgments. A garment is saleable if all its buttons are present and there are no stains. Some prom dresses return again and again. “People take them, wear them, bring them back.” Regulars set aside pieces for each other. The fitting room is a place of encouragement.As her involvement in the clothes exchange grew, Cowdery’s visits to Peacocks dwindled. Now, its shop floor struck her as “an explosion in a jumble sale”. She began to delete unopened emails from Asos and Topshop. She swore off buying new clothes for a year. “I thought I’d reach the end and think: ‘I’ve done that. I’ll move on,’” she says. Instead, “It changed how I thought about clothes.”Cowdery still loves clothes – especially anything velvet – but she has found a safe way to consume them. The clothes exchange enables her to refresh her wardrobe without adding to it. She can be acquisitive, as long as she relinquishes in equal measure. Where she once bought three pieces a month, she now swaps 10 to 15 – mostly things she picked up at the previous exchange.Clothes come and go at the Basingstoke home of Sarah Fewell, too. In fact, so many parcels come and go that she knows her postman by his first name (Jay). Fewell has always loved cutting up old clothes, sticking on studs, even at 14 when most of her friends were into Hollister. But now she has turned her passion for preloved clothes into a sustainable version of fast fashion.Fewell runs a shop called Identity Party on the website Depop, which since being established in 2011 has offered its 10 million users a blend of eBay-style trading with Instagram-style posting. Her brand is “a lot of 80s, 90s, quite bohemian, grungy”. She especially loves “selling things with animals on, a good old ugly jumper and anything by St Michael.”Two years ago, in the second year of a politics degree at Goldsmiths, University of London, Fewell was browsing the charity shops when she saw “a really nice dress that wasn’t for me”. She already had a Depop profile, having sold some unwanted clothes, so she bought the dress, listed it as “‘very Phoebe from Friends” and it promptly sold.She bought and sold relentlessly during her third year. “When I left university, I thought, I don’t want a real job.”Now with Identity Party, Fewell has professionalised her love of vintage.We are sitting in a cafe in a shopping mall in Basingstoke. Fewell, who is wearing an Identity Party top and jeans and an eBay jacket, runs through her working week: Monday, she posts Tuesday, she photographs Wednesday she uploads. A fourth day is spent scouring the charity shops of Basingstoke, Newberry and Reading. A fifth and a sixth on further photography and posting.Fewell’s days are long. But all the hours spent cutting out shoulder pads and removing used handkerchiefs from pockets have made her one of Depop’s top sellers. Since that first dress, she has sold more than 3,000 items, and her customer base includes her own friends, who no longer find secondhand shopping “a bit niche”.In 2017, when she posted that first dress, Fewell “wasn’t very conscious” of the sustainability benefits of secondhand clothing. “I wasn’t really thinking: ‘I could push this message.’” After a couple of months, “it got added in there”. Now she trades her “handpicked vintage gems” as sustainable fashion. Facts about clothing waste are printed on the reverse of her business cards. When a piece of clothing doesn’t suit a customer, she urges them to sell it on, to close the loop.But does Fewell ever look at the floor of her parents’ spare room – now her stock room – at the sea of pink plastic packages waiting to be driven to the post office, and think that buying and selling secondhand clothing may not be the height of sustainability? In some ways, Depop mirrors fast fashion: consumers buy cheaply and often. Fewell points out that the bags are made of recycled plastic she would like to afford biodegradable ones. “The downside, environmentally, is postage and packing,” she admits. “But people are always going to want to buy clothes. Buying secondhand is probably the best way they can do it.”The key, says Stephanie Campbell from Wrap’s Love Your Clothes campaign, is “to keep clothing out of landfill”. Each year 430,000 tonnes of clothing are disposed of and not recycled in the UK. Meanwhile, the number of new clothes sold is rising: 1.13m tonnes in 2016, an increase of 200,000 tonnes on 2012.“It’s a slow, gradual mindset change,” says Zoe Edwards, a sewing teacher and blogger who 11 years ago pledged never to buy new clothes. “It’s not like a switch goes on and all of a sudden, it’s: ‘Right, this is how I shop now.’”Edwards was working for “a very fast-fashion, low-end clothing supplier” in London. Her job was to order the trims: labels, hanging loops, buttons, zips. The quantity of delivered fabric always varied, so she had to order a surfeit of trims, a routine waste that made her uncomfortable. She had always loved sewing, selling her handmade clothes on market stalls and Etsy. Now, her two ways of living jarred.“I didn’t want to be part of fast fashion any more,” she says. She quit her job, sewed clothes, sold the clothes, taught sewing and blogged about it. In the past 11 years, Edwards has bought only “one or two things”. Her bras are new, and she thinks she may have purchased a top from Zara in about 2010. Even her knickers are what she calls “me-made”.So how difficult is it to stop buying clothes? Tania Arrayales, a self-described “fashion disruptor”, has founded an organisation in New York called Fashion of Tomorrow to advocate a more sustainable approach to the clothing industry. Arrayales was a founding member of Style Lend, a peer-to-peer clothing rental site, and swore off all clothing purchases for a year, inspired by the documentary True Cost. But weren’t there times when she was desperate to break her self-imposed rule?“The challenge was feeling a little bit … I wasn’t as trendy as I used to be. I couldn’t make an impact when I went to an event,” she says. “I didn’t have anything new and shiny. But I wanted to restructure the way my brain saw shopping.”In her second year, she allowed herself to buy vintage clothes. The year after that, she bought the odd piece of new clothing from sustainable brands. Any time she felt her style “lack a little”, she rented what she needed from Style Lend (there are lending sites in the UK, too, but this is not yet a flourishing market). “I started seeing pieces in a new light. I discovered styling,” Arrayales says.Cowdery has noticed a similar sense of exploration and play at the Clothes Exchange. “I’ve been more experimental, more free, with clothes. I don’t keep things for best. I wear them. And I don’t worry about the size on the label,” she says.The fluidity around sizing is one of the pleasures of secondhand shopping. Depop sellers such as Fewell list clothes as fitting size eight to 14. Shoppers are encouraged to view their size as variable. “That’s the great thing about swapping,” Cowdery says. No one gets depressed because something their size won’t zip up. “You just look by eye, and ask yourself: ‘Will that fit?’”Edwards has faced a similar confrontation with her personal taste. Sewing requires a lot of decision-making: the colour and weight of fabric, length of dress, shape of sleeves. She buys vintage fabric and refashions charity shop finds, but even so, she doesn’t think “sewing is necessarily the most sustainable way to dress yourself”. There is still the acquisition of fabric and materials. And a tendency to prize the making over the wearing, so that a lot of making goes on that never gets worn. “There is a big slow fashion movement within the sewing community,” Edwards says. “People are using their stash rather than buying new stuff.”The volume of clothing of all kinds – new, secondhand and handmade – is challenging. And selling on secondhand clothes has its limits. To avoid swamping the secondhand market, or passing the problem on to others, including developing countries where many used clothes are sold in bulk, other technologies, such as fibre-to-fibre recycling, need to be encouraged.“Clothing is a way to show who I am, what I feel, what I believe,” Edwards says. “It’s a way to communicate with the world. It’s got real social value, but it has got to be done mindfully.”As Cowdery says: “Clothes have a story. If you wear something once then throw it in the bin, it hasn’t had a story. You want to know there’s life in these things.” This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

But the play’s depiction of the central character is utterly flaccidIt’s the car scene that gets you in All About Eve, Joseph L Mankiewicz’s radical 1950 film about an obsessed fan, Eve Harrington, who tries to muscle in and steal the life of her favourite Broadway star.Bette Davis plays that star, cinema’s great feminist heroine Margo Channing. She has it all: fame, talent, wealth, beauty, a devoted partner, loyal friends. But she is 40, childless and tired of playing characters who are in their 20s (“Be a playwright with guts,” she tells the most successful writer in America. “Write me one about a nice normal woman who just shoots her husband”). She should be on stage but she is stuck, in the cold and dark, in a car that has run out of petrol, acidulously contemplating what it is – and what has to be sacrificed – to be a successful woman.“It’s a funny business, a woman’s career,” she says. “The things you drop on your way up the ladder so you can move faster – you forget you need them again when you get back to being a woman. It’s one career all females have in common whether we like it or not – being a woman. Sooner or later we’ve got to work at it, no matter how many other careers we’ve had or wanted.”It is a monologue so painfully fresh it could have been written yesterday. That is perhaps why this barbed tale of female ambition that is so deft in its depiction of the inner lives and complexities of women continues to fascinate audiences and artists. It is the basis for Oscar-tipped film The Favourite, in which Emma Stone plays a young upstart, Abigail, who is deviously trying to replace Rachel Weisz as the favourite handmaid of Queen Anne (Olivia Colman). And it is currently being revived, albeit limply, in the West End, with Gillian Anderson as Channing and Lily James as Eve.“It’s an astonishment every time you see All About Eve,” says Deborah Davis, screenwriter of The Favourite. “The story of this young ingenue creeping into an older woman’s life and taking over is absolutely fascinating to me. I went to an all-girls school where this was going on all the time. We were all busy nicking each other’s friends and making each other’s lives a misery.”“It was definitely a model for The Favourite,” she says, particularly the character of Eve, on whom she modelled Abigail in the absence of any real historical details. “For me, Abigail is a sociopath and so is Eve Harrington. Neither of them have any conscience. Eve goes in, she lies about her background, she ingratiates herself into Margo Channing’s life and then we gradually see her ambition unfolding. There is a fantastic scene where she’s standing in front of the mirror with Margo’s dress held up against her. You know what’s going on. It’s just a question of how she’s going to get to wear that dress herself, and when.”That is not to say the other women in the cast are pushovers – far from it. Channing’s longstanding maid, Birdie, realises exactly what Eve is from the very first scene. “She’s studying you,” she warns. When Margo’s best friend Karen Richards catches on, her playwright husband accuses her of being a cynic. “That cynicism you refer to is something I acquired the day I realised I was different from little boys,” she hisses back.“All the wittiest lines in the film belong to the women,” says film critic Molly Haskell. “These women are never just pathetic. Mankiewicz is so fascinated by women and sympathetic towards them: he gives them importance, he gives them idiosyncrasy, he gives them their personalities.”This is not just reserved for the lead characters. As Haskell points out, in Karen’s sharpness against her husband, “Mankiewicz sees the plight of the wife and how she’s finally getting her own back for all the things she does but doesn’t get credit for.”So many films from that era don’t hold up, but All About Eve still feels radical. It takes the theme of women being silenced, forced to listen to men and learn from them regardless of their own talents, and turns men into the butt of the joke. When Margo throws a birthday party for her partner, the director Bill Sampson, the poison-penned theatre critic Addison DeWitt turns up with a young blonde on his arm, a Miss Caswell (played by the then little-known Marilyn Monroe). Channing suggests Eve and DeWitt should talk about their shared love of the theatre. “I’m afraid Mr DeWitt might find me boring after too long,” says Eve, saccharinely coy. “Oh you won’t bore him, honey,” says Miss Caswell. “You won’t even get the chance to talk.”It is an extraordinary scene, says Haskell, “especially when you consider that Monroe’s character is not meant to have lines. She’s meant to be just a bimbo. Yet out of this bimbo come these words of wisdom. Everyone has dignity and authority in their own way in the movie.”None more so than Margo Channing. There is a brittleness and defiance about her that never falters. She has worked out exactly what Eve is doing as Bill arrives for his party and spends the first 20 minutes locked in conversation with her. Margo confronts him he calls her paranoid, insecure, says she should be ashamed of herself. She remains poised. Is her tantrum over, Karen asks? Absolutely not. “Fasten your seatbelts,” she says. “It’s going to be a bumpy night.”There are so many traps that All About Eve could have fallen into: Eve could have been the victim, or the underdog we cheer for Margo could have been a gargoyle or a caricature (like Gloria Swanson in Sunset Boulevard or, indeed, so many other films with older women). And yet it is clear that while Eve may get what she wants professionally, it is Margo who gets what really matters in the end: loyalty, love, friendship and recognition. Eve ends the film as she begins it: entirely alone, and dangling.Theatre director Ivo van Hove’s resurrection of the stage play falls into these traps and more. His reincarnation of Margo (played brilliantly by Gillian Anderson) is not only flaccid but insulting. We see Margo so drunk that she vomits into a toilet bowl, slurring her “buckle up” line, and collapsing into bed alone. She howls into the mirror as an animation shows her face morphing into an elderly woman’s. Of course Margo complains about ageing in the film – she has a younger boyfriend, after all – but it doesn’t destabilise her in the way it’s put forward here. Her concern about ageing is not, as van Hove would have it, about what she looks like. It is about the obvious truth that men have more freedom than women as they grow older. With Eve, he tries to garner sympathy: she weeps when Margo calls her out and men reject her. This is not Eve Harrington as we know and loathe her.It says something about a male director that he would take one of cinema’s greatest scripts, one that puts complex, difficult, powerful and ambitious women at its centre, and reduce the main characters to wailing, reckless as who cry about a few crow’s feet under the eyes or beg their husbands not to leave them.“What possible thing does it add to it?” says theatre critic Natasha Tripney, who has been critical of Van Hove’s depictions of female leads before. “It undermines the possession and control Margo Channing has over her life and shows her instead as a sad drunk in her bathroom.”Margo’s life is under threat, but she manages to negotiate that threat in the film in a way that is absent from this stage adaptation. “It’s a reduction of both of these fantastic characters” not to honour that, says Tripney. At the end of it all, Margo stays in control of her life, while Eve is at the behest of others, or at least her ability to manipulate others.All About Eve will continue to enthral. It has done so for almost 70 years and it will do so for many more. “It is all those things - vanity, envy, jealousy – that are quite fascinating to explore in the dramatic form,” says Davis, who is up for an Oscar for The Favourite’s screenplay. And it thrills us because it makes us, as women, feel seen in all our grit and glory. It is complicated, confusing, spiteful, fiercely intelligent and, at the end of it all, entirely real."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e15cb8adcfec70dde2c0ce814d34bebd528ae665/0_126_1798_1080/master/1798.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b98836b0a2db465aefce8c4dc9cc7f5","title":"office space mike judge 20 film","story":"In the cult 1999 film about corporate malaise, the story of an everyman rallying against his sedate life found itself a loyal followingMaybe it was Y2K anxiety. Maybe something was in the Hollywood water. Whatever the reason, 1999 yielded a bumper crop of movies about angry, ordinary men throwing off society’s shackles and finding something extraordinary in themselves.Fight Club and The Matrix purported to see past the blinders keeping everyone in line, and revolted against the sinister forces (capitalism and parasitic brain-vat robots respectively) exerting their invisible control. In American Beauty, a henpecked husband gave himself a new lease on life by rejecting suburbia for a simpler existence of weightlifting, pot-smoking, and skirt-chasing. But the most revealing film of that time, about the stifling influence of work and the evolving mores of masculinity, has to be Office Space.As profoundly unmotivated systems programmer Peter Gibbons, Ron Livingston and his don’t-give-a-shit shrug provided a generation with a hero. Writer-director Mike Judge has spent his entire career jabbing at the indignities of having a job, and in Peter he found the ideal vessel for his contempt. He punches the clock at the oppressively grey headquarters of Initech, a company whose ill-defined mission might as well be breaking the souls of its employees. It’s the most banal vision of hell: lethal doses of tedium, an unceasingly chirpy customer relations rep one cubicle over, an ineffective flow of management so dense with bureaucracy even Kafka would have banged his head against his desk. Other irritants have more of a personal sting, such as the smug pleasure boss Bill Lumbergh (Gary Cole, doing a bargain-rack Gordon Gekko) takes in by informing his underlings that, yeah, they’re gonna need to come in on Saturday.Peter and his colleagues’ ill-conceived scheme to get rich skimming fractions of pennies from the corporate kitty gives the loose, shaggy plot a semblance of direction, but Office Space would be more accurately clocked as a character study about a man who refuses to take any more. The aggressive regular-guy-ness of Livingston empowers anyone sharing his middle-income lot – not well-off enough to enjoy being rich not poor enough to have the hardship to account for his misery – to access him as a surrogate, making his strike against the coffee-slurping overlords into a slacker wish-fulfillment fantasy.His version of getting unplugged from the matrix comes when a hypnotherapist drops dead in the middle of their session, which leaves Peter in a state of new enlightenment. It means all he must do to change direction is simply decide to do so. He starts coming to work in flannel shirts and jeans, ignoring the memos telling him things he already knows, and eventually skipping out entirely to embrace absenteeism as a philosophy. His willingness to think past the conformity of the zombies pacing the corridors catches the attention of his supervisors and lands him a promotion – perhaps Judge remembered the feeling when he realized the loathing of authority that made him unemployable could mean success in entertainment.While this critic is relieved to confirm that two solid decades of incessant “I believe you have my stapler” stammerings from unfunny men at bars have done nothing to detract from this film’s hilarity, certain aspects have aged.Early on, during a late-night gripe session with Peter, one of his pals suggests that the stability and consistency of their work may have its merit, and gets summarily dismissed. That Peter and the film itself consider a reliable paycheck a fate worse than death may baffle an 18-year-old today, reared in a world of few jobs for young people, inhumane conditions at the world’s biggest corporations, and millennial burnout. A new generation is leaning in favor of socialism to stop widespread poverty and viciously exploitative business practices. Peter’s idea of suffering is being bored – did we ever have it so good? Take a step back, and a viewer can see people growing more desperate, aware, and politicized in their rebellion.The other element binding this film to its era are the distinctly male overtones to Peter’s metamorphosis into his best self. He finds happiness by getting back in touch with the physical instincts from which eight hours under fluorescents can estrange a man. He finally ditches his unfaithful girlfriend and shacks up with a local waiter played by Jennifer Aniston, an epitome of cool to Peter for sharing in his apathy. He eventually ends up getting a new gig on a construction crew, which Judge makes out to be good, honest work. At the risk of putting too fine a point on it, Judge even splices in a few shots of Peter catching a fish. The film imagines his transformation not as an evolution, but a devolution in the direction of our primal hunter-gatherer origins.Though he’s defined by his lack of extraordinary qualities, Peter’s as much of a chosen one as his contemporary Neo. He takes it upon himself to carry the mantle of his fellow men, left flabby and neutered by the creature comforts of mild prosperity. His crusade against the tyranny of the 9-5 would refine its social component to shed the hangups about manliness, and the economic stakes would rise considerably over the following decades. But Peter remains an everyman for his particular moment, an embodiment of the Gen-X ideal, a genuine soul standing tall against sellout-ism – the dream of the 1990s."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae59cfffb1da1e7c42a967ccb4d658a19e1054c8/0_372_3450_2071/master/3450.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61f84a714f2a9feb98fd75583f4f875d","title":"the nine greatest oscar moments ceremony","story":"Nine decades of Oscars have brought many unexpected highlights, from flubbed announcements to streakersWhat one of the first recorded Oscar blunders – the ceremony was first held 90 years ago this May – teaches us is always, always say the surname. Or at least wait for yours to be called. Frank Capra learned this the excruciating way when presenter Will Rogers announced best director with the words: ““I’ve watched this young man for a long time. Saw him come up from the bottom. It couldn’t have happened to a nicer guy. Come up and get it, Frank!” Capra, nominated for Lady for a Day, had almost walked to the stage when he noticed the spotlight was in fact on Frank Lloyd, director of Cavalcade. He had to slink back through the crowd – with VIPs shouting at him for ruining their view – and later wrote in his autobiography: “I wish I could have crawled under the rug like a miserable worm.” He collapsed back into his chair while his table of friends wept. Hopefully, the Oscars he subsequently won in 1935, 1937 and 1939 made up for what he called “the longest, saddest, most shattering walk in my life”.Not only was Hattie McDaniel the first African American Oscar winner, for her performance as Mammy in Gone With the Wind, she was the first even to be nominated, after she placed a stack of rave reviews, including the Los Angeles Times writeup of her performance as “worthy of Academy supporting awards”, on the desk of the film’s producer, David O Selznick, who put her name forward to the Academy. The venue, the Cocoanut Grove at the Ambassador hotel, was still segregated and Selznick had to petition for McDaniel to attend. She was seated away from the Gone With the Wind table, at the back of the room. “I sincerely hope I shall always be a credit to my race and to the motion picture industry,” she said in her acceptance speech.Long before the Oscars became a platform for political causes, Marlon Brando declined to accept his Academy Award for best actor in Francis Ford Coppola’s The Godfather. After his name was called out, a woman in traditional Apache dress rose from a seat, walked to the stage and raised one hand in silent refusal as Roger Moore attempted to hand her the statuette. She was Sacheen Littlefeather, president of the National Native American Affirmative Image Committee. “He very regretfully cannot accept this very generous award. And the reasons for this is the treatment of American Indians today by the film industry,” she said, to a mixed chorus of boos and applause from the audience.“And now to ulge the contents of this year’s important envelope,” began David Niven, in what was intended to be an introduction to presenter Elizabeth Taylor, but actually served to introduce the streaker who appeared behind Niven, throwing a peace sign, willy waving in the wind. Ever the consummate professional, Niven barely missed a beat before pondering: “Isn’t it fascinating to think that probably the only laugh that man will ever get in his life is by stripping off and showing his shortcomings?” The streaker was artist and gay rights activist Robert Opel, who had managed to get backstage by putting on a jumpsuit and pretending to be an entertainment journalist.Sally Field delivered the most misquoted and possibly most relatable speech ever when she was named best actress for Places in the Heart, her second Oscar win. Flushed of cheek, she said breathlessly: “I wanted more than anything to have your respect. The first time I didn’t feel it. But this time I feel it. And I can’t deny the fact that you like me. Right now… you like me!” to laughs and cheers from the audience, who were shocked and presumably relieved to have the gaping void of need inside them briefly exposed to the light.Yes, she’s a hugely talented, multifaceted woman of some skill, but has there even been an actor, a human, as endearing as Jennifer Lawrence? As rip-your-arm-off-and-hit-yourself-in-the-face-with-it adorable? The only thing more adorable than Normal Everyday Jennifer is Awards Jennifer, who talks about eating chips on the red carpet and loses her mind at the mere sight of another A-lister. But that’s nothing compared to 2013 when, after winning best actress for Silver Linings Playbook she tripped – oh so giddily, and oh so gracefully – up the stairs. Who falls up the stairs? Awards Jennifer, that’s who. She followed up by flipping the bird in the press room. See! Adorable.There’s a variation on the dream where the entire world sees you naked, which is the entire world watching you realise you can’t say someone’s name and having to plough on anyway because it’s live TV and, actually, it’s the Oscars and you’re John Travolta. After being introduced as the “wickedly talented, one and only Adele Dazeem” in 2014, Idina Menzel (seriously, Adele?!) got her sweet, sweet revenge a year later when she welcomed her “very dear friend, Glom Gazingo” – AKA Travolta – to the stage. Whereupon he joined her on stage and, um, held her face.No Oscar acceptance speech should include the words: “I’m sorry, no, there’s been a mistake.” Yet these were the words uttered by Jordan Horowitz, producer of La La Land, on stage after he’d accepted the best picture statuette only to then be quietly handed the correct envelope, showing Moonlight had triumphed. Presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway had been given a duplicate of the best actress envelope, which had indeed gone to Emma Stone for La La Land. The world realised it had no true understanding of what a bad day at the office meant.There is no actor quite like Frances McDormand and we were never going to get a speech quite like any other when she collected the best actress Oscar for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri in 2018. “So, I’m hyperventilating a little bit, if I fall over, pick me up…” she began lightly, before facing down the lens, jaw set: “… cos I’ve got some things to say.” McDormand asked all female nominees in all categories to stand up with her (saying, quite rightly, “Meryl, if you do it, everybody else will”) and reminded those with power and budgets in the audience that these women had stories to tell. She then uttered the words that could change representation in film forever: “inclusion rider”.Terri White is editor-in-chief of Empire magazine"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d104cd6e668cdb1775d0373591eeacbaeb1af29/0_227_3504_2103/master/3504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=694910174e19423cbef745575462c5d9","title":"why a star is born should win the best picture oscar","story":"Once the clear frontrunner, Bradley Cooper’s musical romance now seems doomed. A victim of its own shortcomings or the environment it now finds itself in?• The Favourite, Black Panther, Roma and more: read the rest of our best picture Oscar hustingsFor most contenders, the road to the Oscar is strewn with speedbumps and potholes. The graph vacillates wildly, peaking after good reviews or buzzy publicity, troughing as sex scandals come to light or a key Tweeter clocks some questionable politics in the plot.The path of A Star is Born has been striking for the consistency of its gradient: downhill all the way. After premiering to swoons at Venice last August, it’s gone from bet-your-granny lock to total no-hoper, without so much of a cameo as underdog.How? There have been no blips along the way. None of Bradley Cooper or Lady Gaga’s feet have gone amiss. Rather, both stars have spent six months love-bombing each other with on-brand precision. Cooper still seems shocked by the quality of Gaga’s pipes, just like his character in the film. Gaga - 27m albums sold, and 146m singles - remains so in thrall to her grizzly movie mentor she sat at his feet in supplication when he joined her for a singsong at her sellout Vegas residency.A Star is Born’s undoing is what would, until recently, have been its deal-sealer: its main subject is showbiz. Hollywood used to like nothing better than a film which prizes entertainment industry talent above all else (plus, as a fourth remake, its very existence is part of folklore).But today, disengagement with the world around is fatal. Awards voters are under pressure to prove their cultural sensitivity - and A Star is Born is the only movie on the list which cannot easily tether itself to a social bandwagon.Conceived pre-Trump, shot two years ago, A Star is Born exists in a political vacuum and fills it with feels. It stands as a relic to an age when a soapy wallow was sufficient. But these are tougher times, and you can’t bring a box of tissues to a knife fight.Which is a shame, because A Star is Born – for all its whopping budget and superstar newbies – does capture something fresh about falling in love. That initial hit of connection when Jackson meets Ally’s gaze in the drag bar is a great, popping moment their first date, stumbling around a car park and a supermarket, seems authentically sweaty and nauseous.Likewise, Ally’s first appearance on stage is such a rush it would bring goosebumps out on a corpse. The entire first half of the film, in fact, has all the giddy sickness – and flashes of genius – of Shallow.The film falters along with Ally and Jackson’s relationship, gets tedious and trite – with the exception of the incontinence – and sometimes enormously boring. I loathed the last scene, as Ally caterwauls at the crowd face-on. There’s endemic niggles, too: Cooper’s vanity feels front and centre of the whole production (show me an alcoholic who looks that good and I’ll up my gin intake immediately).Yet it has stayed with me, like a deep-burrowing earworm you just can’t shake. That can’t be said for all this year’s more obviously worthy contenders. Perhaps self-involvement isn’t the greatest crime in cinema, after all. It can be hard keeping things so hardcore."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000.

The former Bayern Munich midfielder was referring to Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Uli Hoeness, the chief executive and the president of the Bundesliga club respectively, and went on to suggest the club were going stale under their leadership.“They have made grave errors when it comes to the planning of the squad,” he said. “They have to look at the characters in the squad and get rid of five or six players. Maybe it is time for some new impulses from the outside.”Effenberg has a lot to say, as most pundits do, but he may have a point here. There is something strange about Bayern, who face Liverpool in the first leg of the Champions League last-16 tie at Anfield on Tuesday, at the moment. They are keeping the pressure on Borussia Dortmund at the top of the Bundesliga, having twice come from behind against Augsburg on Friday to win 3-2, but the mere fact they are not first in the table is instructive.Bayern have won the past six league titles but have looked sluggish and unconvincing for most of the season. It appears, as Effenberg suggested, that the squad have lost their shape, that they have got too old. Arjen Robben has been there for 10 years, Franck Ribéry for 12. Manuel Neuer, Jérôme Boateng (ruled out of the game at Anfield by illness) and Mats Hummels are more than 30 years old. Thomas Müller is a shadow of the player he once was. Robert Lewandowski, also 30, is still scoring goals, just not as frequently.There are extremely talented players at the club and Leon Goretzka, Kingsley Coman and Joshua Kimmich are under 25 and will continue to improve. Perhaps the problem is that there are not enough of the players who are at the peak of their powers. Those you expect to be there, such as Thiago Alcântara, David Alaba and James Rodríguez, are unlikely to reach the level needed to form the backbone of a Champions League-winning side. It is telling that Bayern’s transfer record is still the £36.5m they paid for Corentin Tolisso in 2017.Their form is not terrible. They have won five of their six games since the Christmas break, though defence is a problem. During that run, they conceded three times against Leverkusen and twice each against Hertha Berlin and Augsburg. They won two of them 3-2 but the manager, Niko Kovac, said after the game at Augsburg, in which Bayern conceded after 12 seconds, “that maybe some players were already thinking about Liverpool”.He added: “In Europe we have to concede less. It is going to be very difficult if we have to score three or four goals every time to win.”It will be fascinating to see how Bayern fare. There is already friction between the fans and the board, with supporters unfolding a banner of Hoeness and Rummenigge with their faces covered with euro signs for last month’s game against Stuttgart. The were unhappy Bayern had gone to Qatar for their mid-season break and made their feelings clear.The most surreal moment of a hitherto disappointing season came in October, when Bayern called an impromptu press conference. There were suspicions Kovac would be sacked but instead Rummenigge, Hoeness and the sporting director, Hasan Salihamidzic, started laying into the press.Flabbergasted journalists listened as the trio lambasted the “disrespectful” reporting. “It’s about time the biggest club in Germany takes a clear stance on this issue,” Hoeness said. “We will no longer accept this recent kind of media coverage,” added Rummenigge, who threatened legal action should the criticism continue. The response to the 33-minute tirade was justifiably scornful. NDR spoke of “arrogance, thin skins and double standards” while Bayerischer Rundfunk said the “bosses at the Bavarian club have crossed a clear line with their attack on the media. The attack on free speech and reporting was wrong and completely unnecessary.”Paul Breitner, a World Cup winner in 1974, said he had never seen Bayern show “such weakness” in his 48-year-association with the club. Of Hoeness, he added: “With Uli it is always about the Bayern family. And now the children have to say that they are ashamed of the dad.” The comments did not go down too well and, according to Bild, Breitner was soon banned from the VIP section of the Allianz Arena.Out of time and out of sync? If Bayern win against Liverpool and go far in the Champions League the criticism will die down. If they do not it may be the start of a long farewell, not only for some players but for some influential people at the top."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60ca724c469ef1f439acaa770731e1077cb7adf7/687_325_950_570/master/950.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0650ff751d1e418888407d5a26166ad2","title":"chelsea fans maurizio sarri blame","story":"Maurizio Sarri is serving up predictable, sterile football and some choices are hard to fathom but Chelsea share the blame for this messChelsea fans don’t often turn on their manager. They don’t usually have time. But there, distinct in the cool February air, just six days before they play in a cup final, it was: “Fuck Sarriball! Fuck Sarriball! Fuck Sarriball!” Add in the booing at the final whistle and the chants for Callum Hudson-Odoi throughout the second half and it’s fair to say the Matthew Harding Stand has made its mind up about Maurizio Sarri.Fans are not always right, of course, as a notorious Old Trafford bedsheet of the late eighties makes clear, and boards must make their own decisions, but this nonetheless felt a decisive moment. Stamford Bridge turned on André Villas-Boas and it didn’t like Rafa Benítez from the start, but outright revolt against a manager is unusual.And that is particularly significant because of the circumstances. Sarri, it was widely accepted, would take time to impose his methods. It might take two years – or four windows, as the jargon of the transfer-obsessed Premier League has it in these final weeks of its decadence before the probable Brexit-ignited collapse. Time means longer than the seven months Sarri has had the job but a project of that nature requires faith – and that seems in increasingly short supply.If you’re going to build a club on a philosophy, you have to be sure of its merits. And you have fully to commit. Whatever questions there may be about Sarri and his methods, Chelsea have not done that. When Manchester City decided to found their guardiolista republic, they appointed Ferran Soriano and Txiki Begiristain, two people Pep Guardiola knew and trusted and had worked with before, to be CEO and director of football. They prepared the ground, constructed a new training base, signed players to fit the Guardiola model. Chelsea’s planning for sarrismo was so half-baked they hadn’t even got round to getting rid of Antonio Conte, his predecessor, by the time pre-season training started.Adding Jorginho and, in January, Gonzalo Higuaín is not sufficient.Chelsea’s squad is the equivalent of a cut-n-shut car: parts of entirely different vehicles welded together with little thought for the roadworthiness of the whole. Perhaps Jorginho would have struggled in the Premier League anyway but fielding him in such a hodge-podge of a midfield is no way to judge, his every flaw highlighted by the fact that his inclusion means N’Golo Kanté, arguably Chelsea’s best player over the past two seasons, being forced into a position in which he is clearly uncomfortable.Kanté has scored three goals this season, making it his most productive ever in front of goal. Jorginho has one, a penalty.Mateo Kovacic, in his ninth season as a professional, has only ever managed 12 league goals, the last one coming 25 months ago. It’s slightly too simplistic to say that the biggest difference between Chelsea and United on Monday was goals from midfield, but only slightly – in the past three weeks Paul Pogba has scored as many goals as Chelsea’s entire midfield has from open play all season.But perhaps what has been most galling to Chelsea fans is the sense of familiarity. It would be much easier to accept that there is a future being built towards if youth were being given its head. Hudson-Odoi may or may not be worth the £40m Bayern Munich have reportedly offered for him, but it’s hard to understand why Sarri is so reluctant to risk him, even at 2-0 down with half an hour to go.What, then, was there to lose? Did he really think Willian, diligent as he is, was going to transform the game?It’s all very well for Sarri to say that what he is witnessing is not Sarri-ball but it’s also largely irrelevant: nobody thinks that this is what he is aiming at. Nor, realistically, can anybody think he has been given the ideal resources with which or the ideal circumstances in which to try to impose his football.

This was the 14th time Willian has come on for Pedro or been taken off for Pedro this season. It was the 20th time one of Ross Barkley and Kovacic has replaced the other. It is all very familiar and adds to the sense of Chelsea as a deeply predictable side. They had twice as much possession as United on Monday and yet managed just two shots on target – a Willian free-kick and Pedro’s follow-up after Sergio Romero had saved.There was a lot of sideways passing and a lot of waiting for Eden Hazard to do something brilliant. His fine form of the autumn carried Chelsea but nobody can be expected to drag a side single-handedly through a season.

Except now, with a fully professional top ision and more televised coverage than ever, there are a lot more eyes peering through that microscope.Criticism that refereeing has failed to keep pace with the development of the game is fair, says the Football Association’s head of women’s refereeing, Jo Stimpson. “We’ll never sit here and say we’ve done well enough in the past. We haven’t moved quickly enough.”That will involve a number of things, including having women’s football embedded in every bit of development and education that referees receive the elite group, which operates in the Women’s Super League, having two camps a year of bespoke training around the women’s game and, because there is a bottleneck of female referees who struggle with the fitness tests to move past levels four and five and into the Football League in the men’s game, the creation of a pathway for female referees into the women’s game with fitness tests specific to it.That doesn’t mean female referees won’t be encouraged to progress in the men’s game. The biggest barrier to passing fitness tests rests on the lack of full-time professionalism. With that option some time away, a fast-tracked pathway to the top of the women’s game ensures women don’t get trapped by fitness requirements that don’t need to be as stringent.“The sooner we can have a full-time group of referees in the Women’s Super League the better.”The Professional Game Strategy being worked on by Kelly Simmons, the FA’s director of the professional women’s game, will run until 2025 and Stimpson is hopeful that professional referees will be part of that plan. “I’d like to see it as soon as possible but we want to make sure we do it right,” she says. “The Select Group in the men’s game is funded by three sources: the FA, the EFL and the Premier League. So if we’re looking at professional referees in the women’s game we have to look at where the funding will come from.”They may not be full-time but professional standards have increased. “We get all our footage from the games and have the opportunity to watch that back,” says Welch. “I’ve got access to a coach, specifically for the women’s game.”For the first time, the FA is analysing what makes refereeing in women’s football different. “Every WSL referee has a match observer that analyses every decision,” Stimpson says. “We look for trends, persistent problems and we devise our training around that.”But change takes time. “When you have reckless challenge in the men’s game you’ve got 10 guys all over you telling you that was reckless,” she says. “In the women’s game the girls get the ball down, get on and play they’re not appealing for it.“Where in our education to referees for so many years we’ve said: ‘Think of your trigger points, think of the things you’re going to use in that identification process,’ one of those is player reaction. “We’re asking referees to change their thought processes game to game, men’s to women’s, and that can be really hard and can take time.”Especially if you are part-time. Welch has cut her hours at work to help cope. “There are different sessions: high-intensity sessions, sprint sessions, strength sessions. Over seven days a week you’ve got to do six different sessions, so unless you double up you’ve got to work out every day to maintain the fitness levels.”Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsGetting that balance is the biggest challenge. “We have four referees in the women’s game who only do women’s football all the others do the men’s game too,” Stimpson says. “Most have jobs, most have families.”Showing the realities faced by amateur or part-time referees helps sow understanding, but Stimpson is mindful of dwelling on their status too much: “There’s a perception of them not being good enough. We don’t want to shout and scream about the fact that they’re part-time because perception in refereeing is so big. The reality is that we’ve got very good referees.”For Welch, an understanding of how much wrong decisions affect them is more important. “When I get something wrong it hurts me just as much as it hurts the manager and the players. Criticism of decisions, as long as it’s done in the right way, I’m a big fan of. Imagine no reaction. Football wouldn’t be the same.“But you’ve got to put your shoulders back, look confident and not show it’s getting to you because, effectively, you’re on your own out there.”• Phil Neville has named a strong, experienced squad for the She Believes Cup in the US. Significant omissions include Chioma Ubogagu, Mel Lawley and Fara Williams. Jade Moore is also omitted but Neville says that is to work on her fitness following injury.

Yet those who packed into the tiny room above Westminster Bridge as seven MPs announced they were quitting the Labour party were left in no doubt that this was the beginning of a new political party.“The crucial word is yet,” one of the MPs said afterwards. “We are not a new party – yet.”As of Monday, the group are independents with no special status in the House of Commons. They hope to be something much more concrete, depending on their success in persuading other MPs to join them.In the short term the group has one central task – to convince 29 more disgruntled MPs from any party colour to join their group. That would give them official third party status – overtaking the SNP and access not just to more “Short money” but also a prized guaranteed slot for the group’s leader at every PMQs, replacing the SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford.Those MPs involved in the new group’s organisation stress that they hope this week will be dominated by several news cycles’ worth of new developments, including an expectation of more defections. If they do not materialise, the group will find it hard to maintain momentum.Two names mentioned as the most likely Conservative targets are the Tory MPs Heidi Allen and Sarah Wollaston, both independent-minded and supporters of the People’s Vote campaign.The most crucial name on the list of seven is Luciana Berger, the MP for Liverpool Wavertree who has faced a slew of antisemitic abuse including death threats that have seen more than one abuser put behind bars.Berger, who is nine months pregnant, had not often been talked about in the same breath as MPs like Chuka Umunna and Chris Leslie who have been on the brink of quitting for many months over the party’s Brexit policy. Yet it was she who strode into the room first and chaired the event, looking the most like the group’s leader.The group will meet later this week to decide how to structure their group – which could involve a process for selecting a leader. Much of the future will depend how many more MPs join them.Labour MPs have been grappling with how to respond – particularly with the departure of Berger over antisemitism. One MP close to Berger suggested last week that they would find it hard not to follow her out the door.“If we have said time and again we have standing in solidarity with her over antisemitism, what does it count for if she leaves and we stay?” the MP said.Another senior Labour MP said there were several more MPs on the brink of resigning – and that 12 had originally been committed to joining the group. He said Corbyn’s reaction had basically been “a declaration of war rather than conciliatory, with no acknowledgement at all that there is a problem in the culture of the Labour party”.For now, the Labour leadership is not outwardly concerned by the resignations. Those close to Corbyn feel that the MPs quitting are hardly household names – unlike the former cabinet ministers who left to join the SDP in 1981.There is also scepticism that the policy positioning of those leaving the party will appeal to an electorate that they believe has rejected “centrist, Blairite” values.Multiple MPs said their response would be governed by Corbyn’s own reaction, including his response to deselection attempts and attacks on social media. A hardline response would prompt more to depart, many MPs said.Yet others are cautious about the effect of more resignations on the success of the People’s Vote campaign – mostly because the “People’s Vote” campaign would become closely associated with a group opposed to Labour.Pro-EU MPs are concerned at the loss of their colleagues for the organisation of the anti-Brexit movement pushing for a second referendum in Labour. The internal party WhatsApp groups have already been reorganised, cutting out Leslie, Umunna and the others who have been instrumental in shaping pro-EU arguments and parliamentary tactics.The official People’s Vote campaign moved at lightning speed to distance themselves from the new movement – despite being associated with all of its MPs. One of the MPs involved said they had not discussed their departures in official People’s Vote campaign meetings, for fear of hostile leaking.Privately, some organisers are furious and say that the splitters could irreparably damage their relationship with left-wing groups and the Labour leadership.Questions are also likely to be asked about other Labour MPs currently sitting as independents, as well as fierce Corbynsceptics who are deeply opposed to a second referendum.MPs at the launch dodged the prospect of others like John Woodcock and Ivan Lewis joining the grouping – both Corbyn critics who quit the party after being suspended over sexual harassment allegations.Frank Field, who also quit the party in disgust at antisemitism allegations and a no confidence vote by his constituents, is a determined Brexiter who has backed the government’s exit deal.At the moment, all members of the new grouping are supporters of a second referendum. Yet sources suggested this would not necessarily be a prerequisite forever. Members of the group would hardly admit it in public, but there may come a point in the next few months when it becomes apparent that that campaign has failed and the group’s aims for the next phase of Brexit become more flexible.MPs in the group are adamant they have no link to other efforts to create a new movement in the centre ground, such as the former Labour leader Tony Blair, or one under construction by some ex-Blair advisers including his former speechwriter Jonathan Powell. “If you’re going to build a new politics it’s got to be the people who are currently on the field,” one of the MPs said. “This has to be a project for current politicians and activists and people who want to build a new politics.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e752c4cba36bff6c3efe82cfd10f2bdf275d5712/14_0_3471_2083/master/3471.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90304f6d0ed19d10bc23b565d00cd036","title":"now wasnt the time readers on the labour mps split","story":"You have been reacting to seven Labour MPs leaving the party and discussing what might be next for BrexitIt’s not 1981 and these MPs aren’t the gang of four. I suspect this will prove to be a bad miscalculation by Umunna et al. The ‘future of British politics’ will be one without them - which is a shame because I’d much prefer we united all of our efforts into getting rid of the vile government. Mike BarkerThe only thing that would be useful - to the country, if not the leadership of the two main parties - about Umunna et al going would be that they take a few Tories with them, and thus remove May’s majority. Theoretically at least, this could really change the direction of British politics and force a second referendum, or the abandonment of no-deal or of Brexit altogether. But if they can’t do that, this is just a waste of time and column inches. And I can’t help wondering exactly what it is that Chris Leslie sees in the company he’s keeping ... unless it can tempt away half a dozen Tories to go with them. wightpaintFinally! A centrist party that remain voters can get behind! So sick of Tory and Labour spearheading Brexit meaning no effective opposition. Let’s get real proportional representation and sort this country out in coalitions representing this ided country’s views - the only way we’re going forward together as a country is in compromise and the two-party system prevents this. Tallisker2Pretty damning. These seven will get a lot of stick rightfully so I believe, but still pretty damning for Corbyn and most sickening of all, the Tories will get a pass on the Brexit mess because of disunity like this. Not sure how these seven don’t see that, or maybe they don’t care? There probably is space for a new centrist party, but we’re facing the biggest issue in generations which needs addressing. Now wasn’t the time for this, and for timing alone these seven should be case into the wilderness of British Politics for ever. Rob BrackstoneThe “New” Labour people have no real perspective on how history will view their actions. The timing of the 172 MPs who voted to out Corbyn just after the referendum and probably cost Labour the 2017 GE and now, it looks like they are jumping ship just when we need as much effort as possible behind a people’s vote. TynebobI don’t even support Labour but this is a sorry state of affairs. Breaking away from the party offers no strategic gain. It doesn’t make remain any more likely, if anything it diminishes it. Reform only happens from within - wasn’t that the central argument of remainers in the first place? AmouxThe comparisons with the gang of four of 1981 are wrong. Yes both are a splintering caused by a hard left turn in the Labour Party. Yes, the Labour party is currently unelectable like in 1981. The more so because its handling of Brexit will lose it millions of younger votes including e.g. the seat of Canterbury.Most obviously though 2019 is different because there was in 1981 no defining political cause of the day on which to gain political energy. Brexit affords that to this new group and allows them to rehome potentially millions of voters (which the Lib Dems have singularly failed to do under an ailing leadership). Campaigning for a second vote will drive energy and electoral power to this new group, which is the calculation they have made on timing - now and not in six weeks.The second point is the age of these MPs. This is a newish generation of MPs (but with credibility from some experience). The gang of four were all past their political peak - and career trajectory matters in politics. Political change against the populists like May and Corbyn is coming from the new generation, ground up - May and Corbyn are either side of 70 and don’t recognise the need for inter-generational change. Neither are radical practical thinkers and are both in different ways intolerant of change. Any reform agenda they have is going nowhere right now - since they have both have been hobbled by their extremist wings.In this Brexit mess the political change happening now under our feet is as radical as the social change of the 1960’s, and the centrist MP’s see that. They do have a good chance. sussexplanThe Labour Party hasn’t changed since the last General Election when these MPs stood under the Labour banner. It is they who have deserted the Labour voters. They should resign as MPs and fight by-elections as Independents, but they won’t because basically they are gutless. DADAspeakThe left of the party withstood all kinds of pressure to leave throughout the 90s and beyond. Most of us stayed if we weren’t kicked out. These saps have no fortitude. I’ve been a member of the party for 22 years and have never voted any other way. There is exactly the same amount of antisemitism as there has always been in Labour, not very much. As for the hard left machine politics stuff, there was nothing more machine like than the Blair years. And if they think a broadly Wilsonian stance is hard left then maybe they are in the wrong party. Well, Good luck to them. At least they’ll have a job till the next election. But if they let a Tory in may the dead of their constituencies rise up and eat them. DrWhatsonThis is sad, very sad. Labour is supposed to be a broad church, MPs getting hounded out is not a sign of a government in waiting. And the rebels are right on antisemitism, the response from the leadership was too slow and inadequate. One gets the impression Corbyn preferred to soft-peddle when criticising old comrades. That said, this was always going to happen with Brexit. We will see a similar split with the Tories, it’s only a matter of time. Finite187Pity about the number of cynics on here. Surely this is just a symptom of how polarised politics has become and a result of loss of faith in weak leadership, that reasonable people are trying to find moderate ground. I’m all for centrism personally. You can sneer all you like of course but I don’t see much inspiration coming from elsewhere. 89798840The Tories will be loving this and what awful timing. You have to ask: ‘Why now?’. Well they should stand for re-election immediately then, but doubt they’ll do so. They would rather keep the Tories in than see a real, socialist Labour party.

Sir Mark Lyall Grant, UK ambassador to the UN in 2009-15, told the inquiry the foreign aid commitment demonstrated “evidence of real intent to be a global power”.David Hannay, a cross-bench peer and ambassador to the UN in 1990-95, concurred that without this continued commitment the UK’s reputation “would be in sort of freefall territory”.A third former ambassador to the UN, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, said of Brexit: “Most other people – almost without exception – think we’ve shot ourselves in the foot.”One New York diplomat told the inquiry: “There is a perception that the UK is doing less and championing fewer and less difficult agendas. Most of the difficult diplomacy in 2018 on Syria and Yemen at the UN security council was handled by Sweden and the Netherlands.”Sir Simon Fraser, the former foreign office permanent secretary, said: “Fundamentally and structurally, I think our position, and our leverage in international institutions, will be weaker once we have left the European Union”.When asked whether Brexit had impacted the UK’s capacity for influence, a senior source from a non-EU state said: “Yes, I can feel the UK’s weight in the council is dwindling, you can feel it. Definitely when Brexit happens things will change.”An EU source at the UN said: “One of the risky things about Brexit is the inconsistency of the mood, and you know to be effective in the security council is this sort of mixture of being confident, consistent, reliable.”Non-UK diplomats told the inquiry that Britain “was less willing to criticise China now, in recognition of how important China will be to the UK after Brexit. These problems for the UK are self-reinforcing because if they tread more gingerly, they appear to other members as if they are less powerful and less able to take a leadership role. This poses risks for the UK as they attempt to navigate their position in the world post-Brexit.”The authors suggest the UK should adopt a more collaborative stance at the UN, for instance by sharing the so-called pen-holding role on key files with members of the general assembly.Last year the UK was the penholder on 12 files including Libya, Myanmar and Yemen, and, although admired, Britain has been sometimes accused of not acting as an honest broker in that role, but instead using its influence to prevent difficult issues being aired.The authors suggest the UK could gain notice by being more willing to respond to the call by the UN secretary general, António Guterres, for “a quantum leap” in collective action on peace operations. Such an offer would fit with Hunt’s promise to do more within the Foreign Office budget to prevent atrocities.The report also says the Foreign Office will need to identify gaps in its diplomatic capacity at the general assembly since the UK will no longer able to rely on EU for burden-sharing and support in New York.France will become the sole member of the EU on the security council, raising questions about whether it feels under pressure to represent the views, not just of France but those of Europe.The lead author of the report, Dr Jess Gifkins from the University of Manchester, said: The research showed the impacts of Brexit go beyond the UK and the EU to the UN, where the UK’s reputation is tarnished and its capacity for influence is weakened.”Prof Jason Ralph, from the University of Leeds, who led the research project, identified “widespread confusion about what Global Britain means, and doubts about the UK’s capacity to deliver the resources to back up its diplomatic leadership”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edef545c5c9a26c8d4974d19a867db51c83cc6d9/0_0_4887_2932/master/4887.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f77eff7ce4f915d604ea5c22eedb2076","title":"brexit labour jeremy hunt eu","story":"Foreign secretary says deal can only be saved by addressing Tory and DUP concernsJeremy Hunt has seized on Labour’s split, claiming to European foreign ministers it proved that only concessions to win round Conservative rightwingers will get the Brexit deal through the Commons.During a frenetic day of lobbying in Brussels, the foreign secretary privately counselled his EU counterparts that the opposition could not be relied upon, even if the government pivoted to backing a customs union.The peeling away of seven MPs from the Labour party was said by Hunt on Monday to illustrate that the Brexit deal would only be saved by addressing Tory and DUP concerns about the “indefinite” nature of the Irish backstop, which could keep the UK in a customs union to avoid a hard Irish border.Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, and the attorney-general, Geoffrey Cox, are expected to return to Brussels on Wednesday, after Monday’s two hours of talks over the backstop with the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier.It is understood that Cox laid out what he would need to revise his legal opinion. The two sides are exploring the possible legal means to reconcile the gap between the Irish protocol’s description of the backstop as “temporary” and its “indefinite” legal effect.But while Downing Street is banking on a change in Cox’s legal opinion persuading Brexiters to back the deal, there appears to be little hope of the withdrawal agreement itself being reopened as promised by the prime minister in January in response to the historic defeat of her deal with the EU by 230 votes.On Tuesday, the French EU affairs minister, Nathalie Loiseau, reiterated the refusal of the 27 member states to renegotiate, and expressed those doubts voiced in many capitals about the government’s strategy.She also warned that Brussels would not simply delay Brexit to avoid a no deal, urging the prime minister to think again about the future relationship so as to garner cross-party votes.“We are waiting for Mrs May to come with some precise proposals because she said that she had some things to tell us,” Loiseau said. “Now time is pressing. We are about a month away from the UK’s exit, an exit which will take place on March 29 because she hasn’t given any signals that there will be a delay.”“If we have to talk about a reformulation of our future relationship it’s entirely possible to do that. If it’s about reopening the withdrawal agreement we have all already said that this point is not negotiable”Michael Roth, Germany’s minister for Europe, echoed those comments, adding that the UK had not come forward with any new thinking in recent days.“An extension would only make sense if we have new substantial ideas on the table. Otherwise there’s no point. And of course we would look at such a suggestion closely should the British in fact decide to ask for an extension,” he said.“But this is solely the responsibility of the British, we can’t make such a suggestion. And then we have to unanimously vote on it. In the end the deadlines are very clear: if there is a substantial extension, for example past the 1 July, then of course there will also have to be elections in Great Britain, but I don’t want to speculate about this.”The mooted extension to the transition period is a new idea being put forward by the EU to help Theresa May square the circle created by the written agreement last December and the draft withdrawal agreement in March.\u0026nbspThat committed the UK and the EU to ensuring there was no ergence between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\u0026nbspBut it also, after an intervention by the Democratic Unionist party, committed the UK (not the EU) not to have any trading differences between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.\u0026nbspThe problem is that these are two irreconcilable agreements. They also impinge on the legally binding Good Friday agreement, which brought peace to Northern Ireland and in some senses pooled sovereignty of Northern Ireland giving people a birthright to be Irish or British or both.\u0026nbspIf the UK leaves the EU along with the customs union and the single market then the border in Ireland becomes the only land border between the UK and the EU forcing customs, tax and regulatory controls.\u0026nbspThe backstop is one of three options agreed by the EU and the UK in December and would only come into play if option A (overall agreement) or option B (a tailor-made solution) cannot be agreed by the end of transition. The Irish have likened it to an insurance policy.\u0026nbspThe new EU idea is to extend the transition period to allow time to get to option A or B.\u0026nbspBut an extension is problematic for Brexiters and leave voters, who want the UK to get out of the EU as soon as possible.\u0026nbspThe Irish and the EU will also still need the backstop in the withdrawal agreement, which must be signed before the business of the trade deal can get under way. Otherwise it is\u0026nbsp a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbspExtending the transition into 2021 would mean another year of paying into the EU budget. Britain would have to negotiate this but it has been estimated at anywhere between £10bn and £17bn.\u0026nbspStaying in the EU for another year would also mean continued freedom of movement and being under the\u0026nbspEuropean court of justice, which Brexiters would oppose.\u0026nbspOf the British calls for a renegotiation, Roth said there was “no point in abstractly demanding changes or to make demands, which are completely unacceptable for us”.He said: “There can be no limit to the backstop, there can’t be an automatic expiration of the backstop. Therefore we will continue to be open to dialogues, after all we want to find a sensible solution, we want to prevent a hard Brexit.“It would be the worst, both for Great Britain as well as for the EU27. But right now I do not see the necessary willingness to budge on the part of the British and this doesn’t make things easier because time is running out.”A spokesman for the commission said the prime minister would be meeting with the European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker on Wednesday evening. “We cannot accept a time limit to the backstop or a unilateral exit clause and further talks will be held this week to see whether a way through can be found that could gain the broadest possible support in the UK parliament and respect the guidelines agreed by the European council”, the spokesman said.In an interview with Politico, Hunt nevertheless claimed to expect a significant breakthrough in the next few days, insisting it would be “definitely more than a clarification” while falling short of a rewriting of the withdrawal agreement.The prime minister has until now been demanding a time limit on the backstop, a unilateral exit mechanism or its replacement with alternative arrangements.The considerable gap between British expectations and the stance of the EU has many worried in Brussels.Hunt, who met seven EU foreign ministers on Monday and the prime minister of Flanders, nevertheless said a swift resolution was necessary “for the sake of sanity of the population of Britain and indeed of Europe”, adding that the end was in sight. The Commons is set to hear from the prime minister on the progress of her negotiations next Wednesday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4d42ba4a5aa3f9ed4f2cb3f8e0215681a52ff15/0_308_4854_2911/master/4854.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9835b5f996778274482958ef95d923ea","title":"labour split jeremy corbyn brexit politics live","story":"Rolling updates as Jeremy Corbyn is warned that more MPs could leave party to join new groupRumours that senior Labour MPs are working behind the scenes to build a new ‘centrist’ political party have been fuelled by a series of recent donations to Chuka Umunna, reports Total Politics.The former prime minister, Tony Blair, is said to be actively looking for donors to fund a new centrist party and a handful of senior Labour MPs are also rumoured to be working behind the scenes to build a new movement, according to a diary piece in TP. It adds:Moderate MPs are reportedly speaking to donors in a bid to build up a war chest to fund the breakaway from supporters of the current leader.Many frustrated Labour MPs believe that Umunna is best-placed to be leader of the new party – and the latest Register of Member’s Interests suggests that a few big Labour donors might agree.Uncertainty over Britain’s exit from the European Union must be ended so that businesses can have clarity about the future, business minister Greg Clark has said.Speaking hours after Honda said it would close its car plant in Britain, Clark told the EEF employers’ group manufacturing conference: “Decisions like Honda’s this morning demonstrate starkly how much is at stake.”“This news comes on top of months of uncertainty that you as manufacturers have had to endure about Brexit, about our future relationship with the EU,” said Clark.“A situation in which our manufacturers do not have the certainty they need about the terms under which two thirds of our trade will be conducted in 40 days time is unacceptable - it needs to be brought to conclusion and without further delay.” He added: “We will go on making sure that the argument that manufacturers put for a deal to be concluded swiftly is something that is heard loud and clear,” he said. The number of EU workers in the UK fell by 61,000 at a time when the employment rate for British and non-EU workers has soared, according to new official figures which have been seized on by figures from opposing sides of the Brexit ide.There was an estimated 2.33 million workers from the European Union between October to December in 2017, but that figure dropped to 2.27 million a year later. A notable drop in workers from eight eastern European countries that joined the EU in 2004 had largely accounted for the decrease.This contrasted with an increase in the number of non-EU workers in the UK, jumping from 1.16 million to 1.29 million in the same time period. This was an increase of 130,000 compared with the equivalent period 12 months earlier, and the highest number the highest number since records started in 1997.Rosie Duffield, Labour MP and a leading supporter of People’s Vote, said: “The uncertainty over Brexit means it is sadly no surprise that tens of thousands of EU nationals have left Britain over the past year, and that fewer people want to come here to contribute to our society and our economy. Brexit is already damaging our NHS, our universities and industry and means less money for public services.Overall, The number of people in work in the UK reached a record 32.6 million.Emma Barr, Head of Communications at the right-leaning Centre for Policy Studies said: “These figures are extremely reassuring. Even as we prepare to leave the EU, the British economy - and British business - is still creating jobs at an enviable rate, with record levels of people in work thanks to our flexible labour market.”The health secretary Matt Hancock has been urged to stop private companies from securing NHS contracts, after Labour research found Dozens of new NHS contracts worth £128m are currently out to tender.Research commissioned by the Labour Party found a total of 26 health service contracts worth more than £128m are currently out to tender, including one worth more than £90 million, reports Aisha Zahid for the .Last month in front of the Health and Social Care Select Committee, Matt Hancock MP stated there would be: “no privatisation of the NHS on my watch.”But Labour is demanding that the health secretary delivers on this statement by ensuring these new NHS contracts are kept in public hands.The House of Commons Library for Labour identified that the 26 contracts include a new £91m contract for a NHS 111Clinical Assessment Service in the South East.Jonathan Ashworth MP, Labour’s Shadow Health and Social Care Secretary, said: “This health secretary’s privatisation credentials become clearer by the day - whether it’s promoting GP at Hand to endorsing private dentistry to now allowing millions of pounds worth of health services contracts to be privatised.A warning has been sounded that condition are potentially now favourable for a more formalised Far Right movement to emerge from what is, for now, “a shapeless and leaderless mass of angry people”Joe Mulhall, a senior researcher at anti-racism organisation, Hope not Hate, suggests that the anti-Muslim activist Robinson (real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon) could yet take on the leadership of such a movement or even do so within Ukip, which has embraced the far right under Gerard Batten.With trust in politicians and our political system at a low point, there is a ready pool of people who could be attracted to this type of messaging.Whatever happens with Brexit there is bound to be a narrative of betrayal being advanced by the far right that will likely speak to large numbers of people in the UK and reinforce existing disillusionment.Regardless, we cannot wait for a traditional, united, far-right umbrella organisation to emerge before we act. We need to start connecting the dots now and to realise that what we’ve seen over the last year is various incarnations of the same threat.Chris Leslie of the Independent Group has made a first intervention for the new political entity during House of Commons health and social care questions, shoehorning in one of the catchphrases from yesterday’s press conference.Delays around plans for the long-term funding of adult social care “typify the broken politics in this country,” said Leslie, who was flanked on either side by colleagues Mike Gapes and Angela Smith.Earlier, Health Secretary Matt Hancock sought to make hay out of Labour’s split (splintering?), telling fellow MPs that his Labour shadow, John Ashworth was a “reasonable and sensible man.“I like him. My politics are probably closer to him than his are to the leader of his party,” said Hancock, to laughter.Gesturing to the former Labour MPs, he then added: “Why doesn’t he have the gumption to join his friends over there in the Independent Group rather than backing this hard left proto communist?”MPs have been pressing Health Secretary Matt Hancock on whether adequate supplies of insulin will be available in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Speaking during questions in the Commons, Hancock said “I am confident that if everybody does what they need to do then the supply of medicines will continue unhindered.”Vicky Ford, a Conservative, was among a number of MPs who said that constituents had contacted her about supplies of insulin in particular.Hancock told her that the two major suppliers had prepared stockpiles of double the six weeks which the government had called for when it came to drugs storage for Brexit eventualities.The government has pledged to look into cases of missed targets after it was revealed that there had been a dramatic rise in hospital admissions for potentially life-threatening eating disorders in the last year.Health Minister Jackie Doyle Smith was responding to Labour’s Paul Sheriff during questions in the House of Commons, where the latter referred to a  report this week on a growing crisis of young people experiencing anorexia and bulimia.Sheriff asked that, if prevention was better than cure, why were so many children with eating disorders going to Accident and Emergency departments?Figures seen by the  show year-on-year rises in hospital visits, with admission numbers more than doubling from 7,260 in 2010-11 to 16,023 in the year to April 2018. The latest figure is up from 13,885 the year before – the highest spike in eight years.Experts said the surge in numbers was down to the failure of NHS services to tackle anorexia and bulimia at an earlier stage, before people become so unwell that they need to be admitted to hospital.The Irish writer, Fintan O’Toole, has penned another of his semi-psychoanalytic takes on Brexit.Writing in the , he argues this time that unfolding events indicate that the “harmless eccentrics” which the English have long warmed to have mutated into the “harmful kind”.When all of this is done – if indeed it ever is done – a question will puzzle historians. How did absurd characters like Boris Johnson, Jacob Rees-Mogg, and all those lesser swivel-eyes loons you think must have just have wandered into shot but who turn out to be long-serving Tory MPs, come to exert such influence on the fate of nations? They will have to grapple with a strange phenomenon – the way the English love of eccentricity turned sour.Michael Gove told the National Farmers’ Union’s annual conference in Birmingham that reports that Britain would operate a zero tariff regime was “not accurate”. “It will not be the case that we will have zero rate tariffs on food products, there will be protection for agriculture and food,” Gove said. He warned that British farmers could be locked out of the EU from 30th March in the event of no deal. The NFU has already warned that health and safety audits required on inidual food processing plans required by the EU could take six months to complete, effectively locking British farming exporters out of the bloc. Gove today confirmed this pointing out the EU had, with six weeks not classified the UK as a “third country” which will only happen after these audits are complete. “The EU still have not listed the UK as a full third country…as I speak there is no absolute guarantee we will continue to be able to export to the EU,” he told farmers. He also said that the dangers of no deal would not be removed if, in future, a trade deal was sealed between the UK and the EU. Once tariffs are imposed by the EU on British exports “it will be difficult to reestablish that market access even if tariffs reduced in the future.” He also admitted that there in the event of no deal there will be delays in Calais as fresh food exports and animals will all be subject to mandatory checks. A bit of a bombshell has been dropped by Michael Gove in his speech to farmers.Ahead of the speech, there have also been warnings that high tariffs on beef and lamb imposed after the UK’s departure could wipe out some farmers who rely on exports to the EU.The government is to announce its proposals for tariffs in a no-deal scenario this month.The report by the UK branch of the United Nations Association suggests Britain will lose political capital on the 15-member UN security council and the larger general assembly in New York because its campaigns will no longer be automatically aligned with those of the EU.Based on more than 40 interviews, on and off the record, with current and previous UN-based diplomats, the report suggests the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, will need to work harder to highlight a more value-based diplomacy, and a commitment to multilateralism, to retain the UK’s traction.It says few overseas diplomats regard the phrase “Global Britain” as anything other than a slogan for domestic consumption.’s Lisa O’Carroll has been tweeting from the National Farmers’ Union annual conference, which is being addressed by the environment secretary, Michael Gove.He called on farmer to put pressure on their MPs to vote for the deal which Theresa May has negotiated with Brussels.Also, there was this insight into how Gove kicks back when he clocks out of the office:Chuka Umunna has said he hopes a new party will be created by the end of the year, after he and six other MPs quit Labour citing anger at the party’s Brexit policy and the issue of antisemitism.Umunna hinted that he expected more MPs, including some from the Conservative party, to depart in the coming days and weeks.“I would like to see us move as quickly as possible and certainly by the end of the year, but that’s my personal view,” he told ITV. “There needs to be an alternative, so that’s perfectly possible. But I don’t get to determine this.”Umunna – who quit the party alongside Luciana Berger, Mike Gapes, Chris Leslie, Angela Smith, Gavin Shuker and Ann Coffey – said moderate Conservatives had “become demoralised by the Ukip-isation of their party and their position on Europe”.At least two Tory MPs are believed to be seriously considering their position in the party and more could follow them, with names including Sarah Wollaston, Heidi Allen and Nick Boles.Other Labour MPs on Monday night suggested their response would be governed by the reaction of the party leadership. “Frank Field left Labourover bullying six months ago,” MP Neil Coyle said.A man who worked at the Honda plant in Swindon for more than two decades has directly linked its impending closure to Brexit, describing the government’s handling of the UK’s imminent departure from the EU as “idiocy of epic proportions.”There’s a clip of him which which is rapidly going viral..Somehow I suspect we’re going to be hearing more from him in the next 48 hours.West Streeting, Labour Ilford North in Essex, has given this reaction to those comments from earlier by John McDonnell about the need for Labour to engage in a “massive listening exercise.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5697b978cdd1e232bbbc28a652820f11ca109d32/0_391_4607_2764/master/4607.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b18e270db415c0a6c175b056ec7f28fa","title":"alysa liu figure skating young athletes sport","story":"The figure skater is barely into her teens and is already the US champion. But some believe the mental and physical strain of elite sport should waitAlysa Liu covered her face and cried as the results were announced at the US ladies figure skating championship in Detroit, Michigan, last month. Her coach, Laura Lipetsky who has worked with her since she was five, hugged her.Liu had just won the national title at the age of 13, making her the youngest athlete to have done so, and with two triple axles no less. The weeks since have been a media frenzy. She appeared on the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, and profiles on her meteoric rise have been published across the world. But for all the attention Liu has received, she won’t be able to compete in Worlds. She’s too young. A 1997 International Skating Union rule requires athletes to be at least 15 by 1 July preceding the season to participate in senior-level international events.That poses a question: is 13 too young to devote one’s life to sports? How young is too young to be a full-time athlete?Liu’s childhood has been anything but ordinary. She usually trains four to five hours a day at the Oakland Ice Center under Lipetsky, who says in an email she spends so much time with Liu on a daily basis that “I feel like I am a mother to her.”At the age of 10, Liu enrolled in California Connections Academy, an online program used by other elite skaters, to allow her the flexibility to travel for competition. Liu completes her homework between practices at her father’s nearby office. She eats dinner in the car on the way home and goes to bed around 8.30pm. Despite the rigorous schedule, her father, Arthur Liu told the San Francisco Chronicle, “She has lots of friends, has sleepovers. I’m trying to provide her with a normal life.” Lipetsky says that despite Liu’s age, she does not coach her any differently. “I want all my students to be able to be the best they can at any level they are in.”There are countless cautionary tales about young phenoms burning out, leaving their sport – or at least taking a break – seemingly before their time was up. Jennifer Capriati. Björn Borg. Sonny Pike. Todd Marinovich. Pike, who was touted by some as the next Diego Maradona, described how the pressure affected him. “At 17 my head was finished. I was suicidal,” he told the  in 2016.The cautionary tales exist for good reason. Kids have different needs. Parents can be controlling, channeling their ambition through their children. Coaches can abuse their power. The pressure can be overwhelming for someone so young. But for every cautionary tale, there are prodigies who have had long careers: the Williams sisters, Magic Johnson, LeBron James. Unfortunately, there is no formula that can determine whether a young athlete with the necessary talent is ready to play a professional sport or not. “I don’t think there is a certain age,” says John Stevenson, a registered psychologist and mental performance consultant. “It really comes down to the inidual.”There are, however, some factors that can predict success or failure.Andrea Jaeger, who reached the US Open semi-final at the age of 15, recalls waking up at 5am to run in Chicago winters. “It’d be 10F (-12C), and I’d be excited to do it because I loved training,” she says.That kind of love of the sport makes it less likely a young athlete will face burnout. “That intrinsic drive is really difficult to quantify. If that’s coming from them, and not from the parent, that’s probably healthier,” Dr Charles Popkin, a pediatric orthopedic surgeon at Columbia University Medical Center, says.Beyond parenting, avoiding burnout is about balance. While success depends on long hours training, it shouldn’t feel like a job. Dr Stephen Smith, who specializes in clinical sport psychology for adolescents, describes the difference between deliberate practice, where the focus is on drilling and improving skills, and deliberate play, “where kids get together, sometimes with an adult and sometimes not, and they just play.” While both are important to improving one’s skills, it’s important that the young athlete isn’t just practicing the sport the enjoyment, after all, comes from playing it.Jaeger only started playing tennis at the age of eight, but by 10 she was giving interviews, and by 14, she had turned pro. “I had People Magazine, Sports Illustrated, and Life Magazine at my junior high,” she says. Now 53, Jaeger recalls having fans recognize her with her signature long pigtails in airports in Japan. Jaeger rose to No2 in the world, her highest ranking as a professional tennis player, at the age of 16. She beat Billie Jean King, Martina Navratilova, and Chris Evert. “Personally, for me, I was fine being 14, being a professional tennis player. The environment wasn’t ready for me,” she says. “Professional women’s tennis wasn’t ready for a 14-year-old phenom. They just weren’t.”Jaeger recalls going out on court at 1am to play a match and sharing locker rooms with grown women. She notes today’s organizing bodies are better, but she says there should be a safety system that includes background checks on adults who come in contact with young athletes. Jaeger points to the failure of USA Gymnastics to protect athletes from the sexual abuser Larry Nassar. “There’s no excuse for it,” she says. “Address the professionalism in the adults, and then maybe you’ll see these kids lasting longer.”Jaeger, for her part, faced an organizing body that didn’t understand and actively tried to dissuade her from her other passion: charity. In between matches and practices, Jaeger would often go to the local hospital and bring toys for the kids. She never told anyone what she was doing in her spare time, but when a local newspaper wrote up as story about her talking about suicide prevention at a high school in White Plains, New York, the WTA gave her an ultimatum: tennis or charity. “You have to quit doing this. It’s not helping those kids. And it’s making us look bad,” Jaeger recalls being told. She was baffled.Injuries tend to plague young professional athletes. Part of this is the wear and tear that specialization in a sport, defined as competing for at least nine months of the year, requires. When there’s no off time, there’s less time for muscles to heal. (It’s no surprise then that Liu has had multiple hip surgeries.)Popkin noticed a problem that came up time and again when treating young athletes’ injuries. After the injuries began to heal, some children would avoid their sport. “There was a psychological component to overcome as well. There were some similarities with PTSD,” Popkin says. Along with other surgeons and psychologists at Columbia University, he shared his findings in a paper this past summer. They found that young athletes who tear their ACL, have “emotional trauma, anxiety, symptoms of hyperarousal, avoidance of their activity.” The problem, Popkin says, is that for “a lot of kids, particularly if they specialize early, their identity is wrapped up in their sport.”Smith has seen the same thing. “You have someone who has just done one sport, and they don’t think of themselves as good students, they don’t think of themselves as artists, they don’t think of themselves as anything but their sport, and then they blow out a knee or they have an ACL tear, or they’ve got one too many concussions, whatever it is, then what?”For Jaeger, that point was put to her starkly after she blew out her shoulder in the first round of the 1984 French Open. After she defaulted the match, she says a reporter came up to her and told her: “You will never amount to anything ever again now that you can no longer play tennis. She now recalls: “People didn’t talk to me for years, years because I was no longer of value.”But Jaeger had other plans. “My shoulder popped, and I was like ‘OK, God decided I go help kids full time.’” It took her a few more years to leave professional tennis, but when she did, used her winnings to begin The Little Star Foundation, a charity for children with cancer she still runs today.Many people point to Jaeger as an example of a child prodigy who lost her childhood. Jaeger doesn’t see it that way. “I had a great childhood. I traveled my juniors. I went to Australia at age 10, South Africa at age 13.” Jaeger missed her prom, but “I just wasn’t that kid,” she says. “I chose to be on the circuit. I chose to turn pro. My parents did not make me do it.”For now, Liu’s season is over. Her latest trip wasn’t for ice skating, but for fun. Along with her family, friends and Lipetsky’s family, she headed to Disneyland this past weekend. “That is our tradition we have after the season is over,” Lipetsky said.When asked whether 13 is too young to compete as an elite athlete, Lipetsky says that everyone progresses at their own rate. “Age is just a number and she should not he criticized for her age … she has proved to everyone that she deserves to be a professional athlete.”Jaeger agrees. “If they’re succeeding, how can you stop them?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/501a4fea5bcd250ad29a4a617b880ed0606844eb/0_83_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2aca44a8a352bdc339d47e63512d4be","title":"wales alun wyn jones six nations england","story":"Some statistics in rugby are barely worth collating. The “most carries” column, for example, does not necessarily reveal whether a player had a good or even a moderate all-round game. “Metres made” does not show the speed or subtle angles at which they were covered. The number of passes a team makes matters less than their accuracy, their timing and how often they split the opposing defence.One list, however, never lies. It remains the original and the truest measure of a player’s ultimate worth: how often was he or she deemed good enough to represent their national side? To play international rugby even once is an achievement to play it virtually non-stop for well over a decade, collecting more than a century of caps and multiple trophies, is to enter the realms of the superhuman.Most normal people would be hospitalised within 30 seconds of exposure to the ultra-physical professional game. Now imagine the fitness, resilience and bloodymindedness required to cope with 131 Tests in one of the sport’s most demanding positions. Take a look at Alun Wyn Jones during the anthems in Cardiff on Saturday and ask how many lock forwards have been more pivotal to their national team’s identity than Jones for his beloved Wales.Try telling the Welsh captain he has played in an era of cheap, confetti caps. If anything the game grows steadily less forgiving. Wales have had plenty of fine second‑row forwards, from Brian Price, Delme Thomas, Roy John and Rhys Williams to Allan Martin, Bob Norster and Gareth Llewellyn, but Wales’s current captain has outdone them all. When he takes the field for his 132nd Test on Saturday (including nine for the British \u0026amp Irish Lions), he will move within 16 caps of Richie McCaw, the world’s most garlanded international player, and just a couple short of Wales’s all-time record holder Gethin Jenkins.It is a few years now since the  was brave – or foolhardy – enough to ask Jones if his career might conceivably have been easier had he been born English. The response was unequivocal. “I’d have moved to Wales. Because I’d rather be Welsh.” He might be a father now, but those who rubbed shoulders with him on the 2017 Lions tour to New Zealand still testify to his enduring competitiveness. “People like Alun Wyn have an aura about them,” England’s Jamie George said this week. “He was a big leader on that Lions tour, he is respected around the rugby world and he’s a brilliant player. To have done what he has done is very impressive.”All of which brings us to the nagging doubt in the back of English minds this week. On recent form the visitors should theoretically be good enough to beat Wales on Saturday on paper, even without Mako Vunipola, Maro Itoje and Chris Ashton, they still have an array of weaponry. But what if Owen Farrell limps off after five minutes and Wales gain an early foothold? What price then any sense of pre-game complacency in the baying Welsh colosseum?Under those kind of circumstances, Jones’s influence becomes increasingly apparent. Smart enough to talk proactively to referees, proud enough to keep on pounding away until the end ... if England do win, it will not be through any deficit of Welsh spirit. “They’ve got a few figureheads, especially in their pack,” George said. “Alun Wyn’s a big talisman for them, Ken Owens is another one, Ross Moriarty to a certain extent. They’ve got a few guys who set the tone.”Quite so. You will not find the word “hywl” on the stats sheets, nor any definitive measures of a player’s heart and soul. In theory, at 33, Alun Wyn should be entering the twilight zone of a fine career. Regardless, shortly after 4.45pm this Saturday, England should still expect to be hit by an elemental force clad in red. If ever there was a day made for Wales’s skipper to channel his inner Dylan Thomas and rage against the dying of the light, this is it.Might a Welsh victory this weekend be written in the stars? The following sequence would certainly suggest so ... in the corresponding fixtures in 1949, 1959, 1969, 1979, 1989, 1999 and 2009 Wales have beaten England every time. Should the pattern repeat itself, Eddie Jones’s squad can hardly claim they were not forewarned.Last season there were just four away wins in the entire Six Nations tournament. It was the same in 2017. This time around, conversely, there have been four already in the opening two rounds, with home wins this weekend potentially once again in the minority. In theory that is healthy for the competition, which thrives on unpredictability of outcome. In practice, however, the tournament organisers would ideally prefer three home wins for France, Wales and Italy. In that event, the 2019 title race would go right down to the wire."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0fa526e006e0d3cc722b30ef57577877adf13a76/0_147_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88700907b654e0a75a272d7769c7b37c","title":"facebook google whistleblowers ad tech","story":"Initiative by not-for-profit Fight for the Future offers employees of Silicon Valley firms a way to organize and leak informationSilicon Valley activists have launched a whistleblower campaign to help workers organize against “unethical tech”, including ads on social media platforms targeting the employees of those companies.Fight for the Future, a not-for-profit digital advocacy group, unveiled an initiative Tuesday to provide support for tech employees seeking to blow the whistle on their companies’ harmful products and practices. A new website, SpeakOut.Tech, encourages workers to safely leak information and organize their colleagues and includes a video ad that the group is promoting by using the micro-targeting ad features of Facebook and Google.“It’s really awesome that tech workers are pushing back against their employers,” said Jelani Drew, campaigner for Fight for the Future. “People are really fired up.”The campaign comes at a time when Silicon Valley’s most powerful firms have faced growing internal backlash and outside scrutiny surrounding the potential damage caused by their technology and their ethically dubious government partnerships.Last year, Fight for the Future pushed a campaign against Salesforce, the cloud computing technology firm which has a controversial contract with US Customs and Border Protection (CBP). The law enforcement agency is responsible for implementing Donald Trump’s anti-immigrant policies and uses Salesforce technology to “manage border activity” and “modernize” its recruiting process. Microsoft and Palantir have also faced protests surrounding immigration contracts.The disclosures from a whistleblower at Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics firm, also launched a scandal surrounding Facebook’s privacy practices and use of people’s personal information, prompting investigations and regulatory scrutiny across the globe last year. Cambridge Analytica shut down as a result.Tech activism further had a dramatic impact last year at Google, where workers successfully organized global walkouts following revelations about the company’s $90m payout to an executive accused of sexual misconduct.

Out on old Route 66, only the once-flashing neon sign still stands, rusted beyond repair. The arrival of the Interstate Highway in the 1970s rerouted custom elsewhere, and like thousands of motels across America, its fate was sealed. These emblems of the American road seemed in steady decline, that is, until recent years, when hoteliers began to recognise the potential in their architecture and storied past, and set about repurposing them.The new generation of motels have co-opted the vintage aesthetics and mom-and-pop atmosphere of the 1950s and 1960s originals but given them a glossy finish with artisanal interiors, fancy linens, and locally brewed kombucha, or the like, catering to the values of the millennial traveller.All this comes at a price. In the 1960s a motel room was $8, roughly the equivalent of $65 today, but few renovated motels are less than $100 a night. These aren’t the motels of old with their bulletproof glass, ratty net curtains and bed bugs (which do still exist): these are motels concentrated in areas likely to draw tourists, and offering more than simply a bed for the night.* all prices include taxes and are room-onlyNamed after the Beat Generation writers whose antics added to the mythology of life on the road, the Drifter still has its original flashing motel sign outside, though a 2017 renovation saw it reimagined for Nola’s more hedonistic tourists. The rooms are small and simple, with concrete walls and white linen all the action is outside. Styled as a retro tropical resort, with palm trees, bright murals and Mexican tile work, it has a pool bar churning out frozen drinks and food trucks serve Haitian and Cuban food. There’s a pool party here most weekends, with DJs and flamingo inflatables aplenty – also, a no-kids policy.• Doubles from $103, thedrifterhotelLiz Lambert is often cited as the pioneer of the roadside motel revival, renovating her first property in Texas two decades ago. She has a knack for turning a hotel into a hotspot and the Austin Motel is no different. Reopening it in 2017, Lambert stayed true to the motel’s retro roots with lurid red-lipped wallpaper, tufted-vinyl platform beds, old school push-button phones, and silk-screened music posters. It’s tongue-in-cheek, kitsch-yet-classy (high-quality bedding and organic bath products). At its heart is a kidney-shaped pool with red-and-white striped pool bar. Tex-Mex style diner Joann’s Fine Foods opened inside the motel in 2018 and offers breakfast tacos and all-day dining (not included in room price). In continuous operation since 1938, the hotel was once nicknamed the Phallus Palace for its phallic sign, still flashing passersby to this day.• Doubles from $135, austinmotelHusband and wife Philip Sterling and Kaitlyn Canfield flirted over the idea of opening a motel on their first date, in 2014. Two years later, they’d packed up their lives in Texas … and Amigo Motor Lodge in Colorado was open. Within walking distance of the arty town of Salida, the motel is surrounded by the mountain trails, ski sites, hot springs and white-water rapids that draw outdoor enthusiasts to the state. The rooms are simple, and brightened by hand-woven Oaxacan textiles and lots of plants, while the atmosphere is casual and comfortable, more Airbnb than hotel – but with the couple on hand to help. There are also three renovated Airstreams that can be booked, a hot tub, a teepee and a fire pit.• Doubles from $115, stayamigoWhen chef Alice Amory first saw the faded six-room Seaview Motel and Cottages for sale she decided this was the life challenge she needed. Having recently returned from New York, she bought the property in 2015 and spent the spring pulling up the thick yellow carpet, tearing down fake wood panelling and slapping white paint on everything. Now, the original cabins have pretty flower-filled window boxes and bright blue doors. The design is uncluttered: rooms are decorated with photographs, an illuminated globe, and a record player instead of a television. Records and books are available to borrow from the common room, where there’s tea and coffee. The four-acre property looks out over Penobscot Bay, with a pool, barbecue grills and lawn games. Amory tells potential guests this isn’t a polished resort – and, for many, that’s its appeal.• Doubles from $105, lincolnvillemotelThe western village of Pioneertown was built as a film set in 1946 by film star and tycoon Roy Rogers, with the motel accommodating the actors. Not much had changed when brothers Matt and Mike French bought the property in 2014, but they then repurposed the 1870s-style structures into a boutique motel. The 20 rooms are kitted out by local artists with heavy textiles, cowhide rugs, and cacti. The motel hosts DJ sets and yoga classes for the creative community that has sprung up around this surreal outpost. For food, head across the road to the town saloon, Pappy \u0026amp Harriet’s. Shop for vintage denim and hand-blown glass crafts on Mane Street – and then watch a staged wild-west shootout. The real attraction, however, is the neighbouring mystical desert landscapes of Joshua Tree national park.• Doubles from $185, pioneertown-motelIn a thriving cultural destination in want of good accommodation for years, this motor lodge was ripe for renovation – and reopened in 2018. The Berkshires is home to the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art and the Clark Art Institute, not to mention outstanding hiking. Set in 55 acres of woodland, the motel is crossed with walkways guiding guests to the river, pool, yoga pavilion, outdoor art installations – and a 19th-century former farmhouse, which, in late February, will open a restaurant, The Airport Rooms. All-day food and cocktails are available in the lounge-like Lodge, and unlike many motels, it offers room service, too. There is also a line-up of live events and an emphasis on communal spaces. The rooms are airy and bright, with lots of blond wood and natural beauty products in the bathrooms.• Doubles from $199, touristswelcomeOriginally built to cater to the tourism boom from the 1960 Winter Olympics at Squaw Valley, this motel had fallen into disrepair before its multimillion dollar overhaul in 2016. Now the 42-room hotel at the base of Heavenly Mountain is an upscale ski lodge with a hint of the retro motel it once was. There’s a Tesla charging station and the rooms have Apple TVs and heated toilet seats. In the communal lobby, line up for complimentary Stumptown coffee and breakfast waffles. In the evening there’s a small bar with wine and beer. Outdoors there’s a pool, hot tubs and fire pits. Most importantly, the ski gondola is just steps away. • Doubles from $137, coachmantahoeDiscover the gateway to the rugged terrain of Grand Teton and Yellowstone national parks or some of the state’s best skiing in Jackson Hole.

The Shaker-design rooms have cast-iron beds and thick, custom-designed woollen blankets, and guests are encouraged into communal areas: the lobby, which doubles as a hip take on a General Store, has a wood-burning stove and coffee from the local town roastery and the onsite restaurant, Glorietta, serves wood-fired Italian dishes and cocktails by NYC’s Death \u0026amp Co. The hotel will also help with a build-your-own adventure from a roster of snowmobiling, snowshoeing and dogsledding.• Doubles from $110, anvilhotelOnce a roadside dump with a by-the-hour reputation, this motel was boosted by the resurgence of Santa Rosa’s SoFa Arts District, including local chef Liza Hinman’s restaurant The Spinster Sisters, a Sonoma County favourite. Hinman recognised the potential of the Astro, built in 1963, and refurbished the property to open in January 2018. Hinman employed local artists for the interiors, with the LED rocket ship sign outside setting the tone, and each of the 34 rooms pop with retro colour. Local drinks and snacks are available in the rooms and the lounge offers complimentary coffee, fruit and fresh pastries every morning. Every item you can see, from the antique rugs to the art, is for sale, too.• Doubles from $178, theastroThis motor lodge is a holiday camp worthy of a Tenenbaum family retreat. The original 1940s Sunburst Motel was renovated in 2017, with a Wes Anderson-esque twee charm that appeals to younger travellers.

On Maker Mondays, local artisans give craft lessons. Even the signage is cute: pool rules include, “Do not attempt duet event without partner.” Three mineral pools are fed by geothermal hot springs and there are DIY mud baths in the mud bar. There’s in-room organic coffee and free snacks in the lobby but plans are afoot for an restaurant later this year.

And, as result of millions of Americans standing up and fighting back, all of these policies and more are now supported by a majority of Americans.”After a midterm election cycle that saw women and minority candidates sweep to power, the nominating contest is likely to be fought not only over questions of ideology but over identity and electoral strategy. Already, the 2020 candidates are being pushed on how they can appeal to the party’s broad range of demographic groups, which includes working-class families, black and Latino voters, suburban women and millennials.This year, Sanders apologized publicly and privately to former female staffers after allegations of sexual harassment by male staffers on his 2016 campaign. He has also continued to stumble on questions about race, despite a years-long effort to improve his standing with minority voters.Still, no candidate will enter the race with as many built-in advantages as Sanders, who ended the 2016 primary with more than 13m votes and nearly $230m raised, much of it through small donations. Now, he begins a second run not as a political outsider but as a top-tier candidate with near-universal name recognition, a dedicated following and an unrivaled donor list.Yet he will likely face far greater scrutiny, in a growing field already populated by colleagues and allies including the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, his closest friend in Congress.Senators Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota have all entered the race, as have lower-profile contenders including the former San Antonio mayor and federal housing secretary Juán Castro and Pete Buttigieg, the young mayor of South Bend, Indiana.The former vice-president Joe Biden, former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke and billionaire businessman Michael Bloomberg are all weighing whether to run.Sanders did not immediately reveal details about when and where he would hold his first campaign rally. The initial phase of Sanders’s 2020 campaign was expected to focus on gathering commitments from one million voters, an effort he outlines in the email.With a fractured Democratic field, advisers believe Sanders’ core support, should he retain it over the next year, will be enough to power his campaign in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, the early voting states that helped lift his 2016 campaign. South Carolina, where African Americans made up a majority of the Democratic electorate in 2016, will probably present a challenge.He is also likely to benefit from a campaign waged by his allies to reform the party’s primary process, which succeeded in stripping voting power from the so-called “superdelegates”, a major source of controversy in 2016 when Sanders lost the battle for the nomination to Clinton.Sanders will face opposition from moderate Democrats and from Republicans who are likely to use his candidacy to paint the party as too liberal. In a preview of Trump’s re-election campaign, the president used his State of the Union speech this month to warn against what he said was the creep of socialism in America.Sanders made clear on Tuesday that he plans to go after Trump directly in his campaign.“I think the current occupant of the White House is an embarrassment to our country,” Sanders said in an interview with Vermont Public Radio, where he first announced his bid. “I think he is a pathological liar... I also think he is a racist, a sexist, a homophobe, a xenophobe, somebody who is gaining cheap political points by trying to pick on minorities, often undocumented immigrants.”Born to Jewish parents with roots in Poland and Russia, Sanders grew up poor in a cramped apartment in Brooklyn, New York. He graduated from the University of Chicago, where he became involved in the civil rights movement. In 1981, he was elected mayor of Burlington, Vermont. In 1990, Sanders became the state’s sole representative in Congress, where he served until he joined the Senate in 2006.Following the election of Trump, Sanders published a book titled Our Revolution: A Future to Believe In. He has four children and is married to Jane O’Meara, a former president of Burlington College and his closest adviser."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17ac625fbcc16839a4d151de1f76aed51b5f9fe2/0_82_2248_1349/master/2248.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73d439c4dfdad41a30afaeadd9b8658b","title":"cowboys politics climate immigration poetry nevada","story":"At the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering in Nevada, friends and performers with wide-ranging views met to discuss climate change, immigration and other concerns ‘without demonizing each other’Several weeks ahead of the 35th annual National Cowboy Poetry Gathering in Elko, Nevada, Gail Steiger, a rancher and singer-songwriter from Yavapai county, Arizona, emailed a proposal to a small host of close friends and fellow performers.“None of us fit easily in any box, but we all hold each other in high regard,” he wrote.“If we can’t talk to each other about the future course of our country, who can?“Maybe,” he added, “we could see if old friends can at least have a conversation about these issues without demonizing each other.”Steiger was proposing a political rendezvous amongst friends – some Republicans, some Democrats, some in the wild, open range in between – who have largely avoided the subject for their more than 30-year history together.In other circles, Steiger’s request may have seemed commonplace. At the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering, a weeklong festival of western poetry and song cherished by thousands for its cultivation of community, it was a perilous suggestion. More than a few performers, they say, have shot themselves in the foot proselytizing in Elko. Of the five poets Steiger initially invited to participate in his offsite roundtable, two respectfully declined.The rodeo poet Paul Zarzyski, a diehard liberal from Great Falls, Montana, was one of them.“These people are so locked in. I was going to run head-on in that room,” he later told me. “I didn’t need that here. Elko might be the one place I can come to and disconnect. When I go back, I’m going to be looking on Huffington Post in the morning. I’m going to be watching MSNBC. I’m going to be thrown right back in again and this is a little sanctuary for five or six days.”The rest of them quietly gathered in the old Hotel West, the Basque steakhouse next door boisterous with tourists and townies, the blinking lights of Elko’s tiny brothel district visible from the back door. They sat around a large dining room table, discussing climate change and immigration, passing the “talking stick” back and forth and striving unsuccessfully – like newcomers to a board game – to follow the rigid guidelines of a Socratic dialogue: more questions, fewer opinions.The son of a rancher and five-term Arizona congressman, Gail Steiger grew up with “a different brand of politics”. He used to accompany his father Sam to the weekly meetings of the Arizona delegation, and though all but one of them were Republican, he says, the lone Democrat commanded equal respect at the table.“They’d laugh about that, but they were friends! They would sit down and say, What is best for Arizona? They really tried hard to do that.”But he’d never harbored any particular fantasy of a career in politics, not after watching the way it skewed so many simple encounters into perverse transactions, everyone “blowing smoke” to gain access to his father. After he dropped out of college to help run his father’s Senate campaign in 1976, he shut the door on politics for good, suddenly all too aware of just how manipulative and hollow the enterprise could be. The final straw was an encounter with the then governor, Ronald Reagan, who agreed to endorse his father.“He stands right on his mark and he looks at that camera and in one take – you would have sworn that he and my father had known each other their whole lives and they were just like this,” he says, crossing his fingers. “This guy had sincerity like you wouldn’t believe.”Finally disillusioned by politics, Steiger earned a business degree in Colorado, took a summer job working cattle back in Arizona and gradually fell in love with the work he’s been running cattle ever since. He credits the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering with shifting his perspective on environmental stewardship. The forum in Elko, which mixes ranchers and environmentalists, conservatives and liberals, helped him see what both groups have in common – an intimate connection to the land.“If climate science suggesting we should take steps to reduce our use of fossil fuels …is in error,and we take the suggested action anyway, the downside will be that we’ve left more fossil fuel in the ground for our descendants,” he wrote to those involved in the roundtable discussion. “If the preponderance of climate science is correct, and we do nothing to alter our carbon footprint, the downside will be that we’ve rendered our planet uninhabitable for humans and many other species, all for the short term gains of those who currently benefit most from the status quo.”Steiger’s views on immigration stem primarily from his own experience working with undocumented immigrants in Arizona, the “overwhelming majority” of whom he found “to be honest, hardworking people who did their jobs, supported their families and paid their taxes”. He’d rather see the US focus its time and money on the “economic conditions, lawlessness, violence and desperation that causes people in Mexico and Central America to seek asylum here”.Born and raised on a ranch near Jiggs, Nevada, a ghost town 36 miles south of Elko, Waddie Mitchell quit school at 16 years old. Like the cattlemen and “true cowboys” he idolized as kid, he soon found himself starting colts for a nearby ranch and living alone in a tiny bunkhouse with little but his own imagination to occupy him.That first winter alone, he was desperate for thicker gloves and new boots his parents sent him a box of old books instead. “I thought it was the worst present ever,” he says. But the isolation got the best of him. He finally ed in. “To this day, I think it was the best present I ever got.”It planted the first seed of what would later become a full-time career in the arts, writing and performing cowboy poetry for audiences across the country, from Elko to The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. In between, he’d buckaroo all over the west, serve a tour in Vietnam, break horses for the US Calvary in Fort Carson, Colorado, get married, raise five kids, and help found the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering in 1985.In recent years, Mitchell has been an outspoken supporter of the Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, whose refusal to pay federal grazing fees led to an armed standoff in 2014 with government agents. Mitchell has written a host of op-eds for the local newspaper arguing against government overreach and the Bureau of Land Management’s treatment of ranchers whose roots in the area predate the enforcement of grazing limits on federal lands.“We should not allow these unconstitutional, martial law minded BLM globs to abuse power THEY GAVE THEMSELVES, against citizens who, unlike the tax suckers, actually produce something,” he wrote in the Elko Daily Free Press in January 2016.Like the poet John Dofflemyer at the other end of the table, Mitchell stops short of declaring global warming a manmade issue, but he calls the increase in extreme weather events in his lifetime “substantial” and says he stands with “the scientists, not the petroleum pamphlets, on this one.Vess Quinlan was 10 years old when he contracted polio. One day he was helping his uncle break horses on a ranch near Eagle, Colorado. The next he was “crippled”, he says, confined to the hospital for a year, subject to the doctors’ whims and his mother’s whimsey, neither of which allowed for even the slightest suggestion of a return to the ranch. He killed the time reading Will James and the poems his grandmother had clipped from the livestock papers and collected in a shoebox, tranquillized by a stiff cocktail of existential despair.His mother eventually moved the family to Pueblo, Colorado, where his teachers tried their best to steer him towards more intellectual pursuits. But the cowboy never left him, and his heart remained at the ranch.“It created this huge conflict with everybody around me. With my folks, with my teachers. And that’s my little problem with authority.”At 15, he ran away from home and spent the rest of his teenage years hiring himself out at various ranches, earning $20 a month and attending roughly nine high schools before finally cobbling together enough credits to graduate. He kept working as a ranch hand until he met his wife, who purchased a farm and ranch in the San Luis Valley. They’ve lived there ever since.Quinlan doesn’t question whether the climate is changing – it always has, he says – but he’s hardly convinced it’s a manmade issue, nor does he place any faith in warnings from “publish-or-perish scientists and professors” whom he believes are often bought and paid for by corporate interests. “The same agencies and scientists that are now predicting manmade global disaster,” he says, were predicting the same when he first moved to the valley in 1970.“But it didn’t really matter: the experts were predicting a coming famine because other farmers were even dumber than me and allowing erosion to wash all their topsoil into the Gulf of Mexico and would soon be trying to plant their soybeans on bedrock,” he wrote. “And besides, we were running out of fossil fuel and would soon be reading by candlelight and canning our meat. What meat we had left was from ranchers even dumber than farmers who were destroying their pastures by overgrazing.”Like Steiger, he’s worked with many undocumented immigrants over the years, almost all of whom were “decent people and good hands”. If he were living in the same conditions they fled from, he says – the cartel violence and economic despair – he’d do the same.“I would be here asking John for a job picking fruit in his orchards, or asking Gail for day work on the Spider Ranch. If caught and sent back, I would start walking north as soon as I got off the bus.”And though he believes America has a responsibility to “develop a fair, affordable, and accessible immigration system”, he also considers tight border security a moral imperative: “I think it is immoral when we steal the best and brightest from poor countries by not controlling our border. Most of the illegals I worked with over the years were a credit to this country and would have … been a credit to their own if given a chance at a decent life.”Zarzyski grew up in awe of his father, an iron ore miner in Hurley, Wisconsin, and the brute force with which he approached every facet of his life, whether a mile deep in the hematite mine or “making firewood”.From an early age, he learned to throw his everything into everything. It’s an ethic he carried to graduate school at the University of Montana, where he studied poetry under the celebrated American poet Richard Hugo and began competing as a bareback bronc rider. He kept at both until his mid-30s, subsisting on occasional winnings from the rodeo circuit, meager paychecks from a part-time teaching gig at the university, and the scraps he earned from his published work. Serendipitously, just as his body began to give out, he found a wider community for his work through the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering.Few who are familiar with his work would be shocked to learn Zarzyski – one of the few here to write in mostly free verse – is liberal. Still, he makes it a point to step aside from politics each year when he enters Elko county, and he has dedicated more than a few poems to close friends across the aisle.“If you’re asking, ‘Do I bring it out in the open verbally?’ the answer is no. It would be an extreme violation of all the goodness this gathering has stood for,” he says. “I have witnessed year after year people making pilgrimages here because they’re in need of something missing from their lives that they can’t quite articulate, but they had a pretty strong instinct that if they came here, they would be graced with that mecca-something or other, and they almost always inevitably are.”A fifth-generation cattleman in Larry county, California, John Dofflemyer “weaned” himself on the poetry of Gary Snyder, which he first encountered as a teenager while packing mules in the Sierra Nevada. “I ran across his work and just came undone,” he says. “His poetry really spoke to me in that minimalistic form. Gary doesn’t use a lot of multisyllabic words, and I realized, shit, I was capable of writing.”After graduation, he enrolled at the University of Southern California, distractedly studying business, certain “my graduation present would be an AR-15 and some camo gear”. But he failed the draft physical with a bum knee from a rugby injury and instead returned home to work the family ranch full-time. After first performing at the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering in 1989, he launched the quarterly Dry Crik Review, encouraging verse grounded less in the past than the cowboy present, the challenges and opportunities facing ranchers today. Though he no longer prints the physical chapbooks, he continues to publish his own work on the Dry Crik Journal website. Work like The Climate of Change, in which he finally asks:How long can we be entertainedby delusion, the dissolutionof civility, of compassionas the planet preparesfor the business of war –already overstocked with banksDofflemyer often resists crediting human activity for global warming, but either way, he wrote: “It’s only prudent to make provisions for a warmer and drier climate where we can.”As for immigration: “Congress needs to address our immigration policy in a practical and humane way. Separating children from their parents and holding immigrants in concentration camps is no better strategy than completing the construction of a wall that has been tunneled under for decades. Instead of a political bargaining chip, the DACA program needs to be resolved compassionately.”Later that week, as visitors flooded downtown Elko and the group scattered to fulfill their various performance schedules, each of them told me separately they had never held any hopes of changing anyone’s mind and were certain no one had. Still, they were curious to see how the night would play out.A few of them felt the exercise was important, a test of their friendship, an affront to the larger partisan forces currently alienating friends and relatives. Though none of them tested the waters again – certainly not on stage – they regretted little more than their own mismanagement of the dialogue. They had opined too much, or their questions had been too narrow, or they had lost track of the order. They had never gotten around to income inequality.“I don’t have any illusions of saving the world, but you do what you can,” Steiger says. “And I will tell you that I feel a lot better after trying than I did just ranting and raving about those stupid son-of-a-guns who don’t agree with me.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d105bcc326bfcf5ac9595278f9e0fe9acfe0eaf6/0_374_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db4d7716ba7aa3665bdee4df21f3961c","title":"vatican reveals secret rules for priests who father children","story":"Spokesman says guidelines for those who break celibacy vows will not be made publicThe Vatican has acknowledged for the first time the existence of secret guidelines for priests who break their vows of celibacy and father children.However, it has declined to make its advice public, saying it is an internal matter.The document requests that a cleric who has fathered a child leaves the priesthood to “assume his responsibilities as a parent by devoting himself exclusively to the child”.Gisotti told CBS News that the document was “for internal use … and is not intended for publication”.The disclosure of the guidelines comes as survivors of clerical sexual abuse from around the world gather in Rome this week to hold vigils and protests outside an unprecedented summit of senior bishops and other church figures called by Pope Francis.The number of children born to priests is unknown although one support group, Coping International, has 50,000 users in 175 countries. Some children are the result of consensual relationships, others are the result of rape or abuse.According to Vincent Doyle, the son of a priest and the founder of Coping International, the issue of clerical offspring is “the next scandal” to confront the church. “There are kids everywhere,” he told the New York Times.A commission set up by Francis to tackle clerical sexual abuse was tasked with looking at how the church should respond to the issue of priests’ offspring.In May 2017, Irish bishops published guidelines saying that if a priest became a father, the “wellbeing of his child should be his first consideration”.The document adds: “A priest, as any new father, should face up to his responsibilities – personal, legal, moral and financial. At a minimum, no priest should walk away from his responsibilities.”Some people have argued the Roman Catholic church should drop its requirement for priests to take a lifelong vow of celibacy. They say it may be a factor in sexual abuse, and that it deters people from signing up for the priesthood – a major problem in countries where there is an acute shortage of priests.The eastern Catholic churches have a long tradition of married priests, and exceptions to the celibacy rule have been made on a case-by-case basis for former Anglican priests who convert to Catholicism.But last month, Francis said he was opposed to any general change to the centuries-old tradition.“Personally, I think that celibacy is a gift to the church,” he said. “I would say that I do not agree with allowing optional celibacy, no.”Exceptions could be considered in “very far places” where there was “a pastoral necessity” due to a lack of priests, he added."},{"url":null,"title":"exorcisms thelutheran intercessors nigeria pictures","story":"Comment: Let\u0026#39s stop blaming the car industry\u0026#39s woes on Brexit -

Some pastors take worshippers for full immersion baptisms in the cold of the Thames Estuary. Others believe that when congregants suddenly start speaking in unknown languages it marks the presence of the Holy Spirit.But the researchers from the University of Roehampton found things that many churches have in common, including a drive for professional advancement, a commitment to spend three hours or more at Sunday service and typically very loud worship.“That is how we express our joy and gratitude to God,” says Andrew Adeleke, a senior pastor at the House of Praise, one of the biggest African churches in Southwark, in a former theatre.“The church is not supposed to be a graveyard,“ Adeleke says. “It is supposed to be a temple of celebration and worship and the beauty is to be able to express our love to God, even when things are not perfect in our lives.”For some, the noise from amplified services is a problem, leading to complaints to local authorities from residents.But many churches face bigger challenges than unhappy neighbours: some provide food for people struggling to make ends meet, or work with young people at risk of recruitment by gangs.With clubs, churches and motorcycles, Berlin becomes home for migrantsAndrew Rogers, who led the University of Roehampton researchers, says pastors have to juggle retaining the churches’ African identity while appealing to children of first-generation immigrants, many of whom have never lived outside Britain.They typically have a more liberal world view which can be hard to reconcile with conservative Pentecostal teachings.Rogers recalls speaking to one pastor who lamented he was unable to talk about religious miracles to his children.“If the church doesn’t adapt, then they are going to leave and look elsewhere,” Rogers says.Reporting by William Schomberg, ReutersWe’ll tell you what’s true.

And they could be as big a change as when the wires dropped out of Apple\u0027s existing headphones and they were first born.Introduced in 2016, the two truly wireless earphones haven\u0027t been updated since. They came with a wide range of futuristic features – but a range of rumours have swirled around them about new updates, that would bring new and even more futuristic features.The AirPods are actually two (or three) different things: the case that protects them and the earphones that sit inside. Until recently, they\u0027d be considered one and the same – but recent leaks have suggested that Apple might update the two separately, with different release dates.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialAccording to recent rumours, the new case is likely to arrive earlier, and maybe soon. It could even be a part of Apple\u0027s March event. The actual release date is probably dependent on when Apple releases the AirPower mat that it\u0027s charging could rely on.The earphones themselves are likely to undergo a more dramatic reinvention. But that could also take longer to arrive.

And most of the rumours focus around how exactly it would do that.New AirPods charging case could come before updated earphonesMost likely, the biggest change in any new case would be the addition of wireless charging. That would allow them to charge up just like a phone, being able to be plonked down a wireless charging puck and then transfer that into its battery as well as the AirPods themselves.Apple has actually teased a new case before, when it announced the AirPower wireless charging mat. It said that a new case would be needed to allow the AirPods to be charged through that new product – but then the new product never actually arrived.The company did say then that the case would be updated but that the existing AirPods would be compatible with the new one. And people would be able to pay a reduced price just to buy the case and update, it made clear – an offer that will presumably stay around with the new earphones.Another rumoured change includes the addition of a new and grippier kind of plastic, which should make the box easier to hold. And if as suggested Apple does introduce new colours of AirPods, such as black, presumably the case will also change colour too.But it\u0027s the earphones that have most of the technology. Rumours have suggested that a whole host of new (and sometimes strange)\u0026nbspfeatures could be coming to the new earbuds.The most likely feature – in part because it\u0027s been apparently revealed by Apple\u0027s own software – is always-on Hey Siri. That will mean that people don\u0027t have to do the uncomfortable move of tapping their own ears to wake the earphones up, and instead just say Hey Siri any time they\u0027re wearing their AirPods to speak with the voice assistant.Other rumoured updates including new health tracking tools. Apple has been keen to get into those features with technology like the Apple Watch, and the inside of people\u0027s ears is a great place to take readings for things like heartbeat and temperature, which could happen with future AirPods.Apple is also likely to improve the performance in less obvious ways. The new buds will probably feature better wireless connectivity, and improved waterproofing.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Since then, prices have slid on a consistent basis, only recently showing moderate signs of recovery.These optimistic price movements, combined with a strong volume of apprximately $27 billion in the market, may well suggest that the long-awaited bull market is not far away, Mati Green, a senior market analyst at the online trading platform eToro, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.Still, until bitcoin sees a strong breakout above the psychological level of $5,000, the longest bear market in cryptocurrency\u0027s short history continues.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Shares in Greggs rose 7 per cent after it published its trading update on Tuesday. “The new vegan sausage roll has helped bring home the bacon for Greggs, prompting a spike in sales at the start of this year.

Shares in Greggs rose 7 per cent after it published its trading update on Tuesday. “The new vegan sausage roll has helped bring home the bacon for Greggs, prompting a spike in sales at the start of this year. The company has therefore upgraded its profit expectations for the coming year, and that’s sent the share price up sharply,” said Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Laith Khalaf.The biggest vegan food launches of 2019 so farThe cons outweigh the pros when it comes to veganism, researchers sayNatWest staff member told customer ‘vegans should be punched’Miley Cyrus shares photos of vegan wedding to Liam Hemsworth“It’s unclear how much of the boom can be attributed to sales of actual vegan rolls rather than simply the publicity associated with the launch.

The main upgrades will include tools that allow the phones to use precise indoor positioning and navigation, a frosted glass casing, better Face ID facial recognition, and bigger batteries.The biggest new feature however is said to be a triple-lens camera, which is endorsed by the new report and has been widely rumoured. That will allow the phone to include a wide, telephoto and ultra-wide lens system, the new report claims.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That was first shown off in 2017, as a wireless charger that could power up AirPods, an iPhone and an Apple Watch at the same time – but despite the promise it would come soon, nothing has been said about it since, and some have even suggested it might not be coming at all.The AirPods themselves will also receive an update. They will include wireless charging capabilities and improve Bluetooth – and might also feature a whole range of other more exciting upgrades.Both the AirPods and AirPower mat are expected to be released in the first half of the year. Apple almost always releases new iPhones in September, and it is not clear when the Macs will arrive.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It remains surprising that one of their few films to evade any nominations is this endlessly quotable mistaken identity comedy starring Jeff Bridges as The Dude.Brian De Palma doesn’t exactly make films in the hope of winning award, but his political thriller - based on Michelangelo Antonioni’s Blow Up – would have deserved any Oscar it was nominated for.Breathless\u0027 failure to receive a nomination is proof that the Oscars can’t be trusted. Despite being one of the most studied films in the world, Jean Luc-Godard’s French masterpiece has an Academy Award tally of zero.The Academy rewarded many notable screwball comedies, though this Howard Hawks-directed standout starring Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn - who’d go on to hold the record for most wins - wasn\u0027t one of them.Courtesy of BFINicolas Roeg, who directed this Venice-set chiller, is one of the most unfairly overlooked directors in Oscars history.  Richard Kelly’s science-fiction mind-bender, which made a star of Jake Gyllenhaal, was a festival favourite upon its debut in 2004. Many expected a screenplay nomination to manifest.1047 The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)It wouldn’t be until the 1990s that western films found favour with the Academy. It was ironically  thanks to Unforgiven, a film directed by Clint Eastwood whose career flourished after starring in this Sergio Leone film that many consider to be the genre’s peak.Mathieu Kassovitz’s black-and-white drama – translated in English as Hate – follows three young friends and their struggles living in the suburbs of Paris.The Academy may not be frothing at the mouth to nominate horror films, but do have previous (see: The Exorcist and The Silence of the Lamb), which makes the absence of John Carpenter’s influential Halloween a glaring oversight.1347 Harold and Maude (1971)This offbeat romantic drama was a critical and commercial flop at the time of release, which probably accounts for its lack of Oscar nominations. Today, though, it’s cult following ensures it remains in good favour with film fans.On paper, the big screen union of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino in Michael Mann’s cop drama was a shoo-in for awards, but no Oscar nominations manifested.Yet another Howard Hawks screwball comedy starring Cary Grant that criminally failed to secure a single Oscar nomination.While falling short of Christopher Nolan’s best,  modest drama Insomnia – made years before Batman Begins – had enough strong performances (Al Pacino, Robin Wiliams, Hilary Swank) to warrant acting nominations. Alas, it received none.Bill Forsyth’s beloved comedy-drama follows the mishaps of an American man sent to buy up a Scottish village where the oil company he works for wants to build a refinery. Forsyth won the Bafta for Best Director, but the film received no such love from the Academy.You’d be mistaken for thinking the “M” stands for “masterpiece” in Fritz Lang’s German drama that follows the manhunt for a serial killer - not that the Academy agreed.Robert Bresson’s adaptation of André Devigny’s memoirs charts the French Resistance member’s time as prisoner of the Germans during World War II, and is even more enthralling considering Bresson himself was held captive years before.Kenneth Lonergan would go on to win an Oscar for Manchester but he Sea, but Margaret - his three-hour plus drama featuring a searing performance from Anna Paquin - failed to secure a single nomination.2147 In the Mood for Love (2000)Wong Kar-wai set the benchmark for romance in film with his acclaimed Hong Kong drama following a man and woman (Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung) who develop feelings for one another after suspecting their respective spouses of having an affair together.2247 The King of Comedy (1982)It may have taken him decades to win an Oscar, but the Academy has rarely balked at nominating Martin Scorsese films – especially for films starring Robert De Niro. The King of Comedy was an exception.Robert Altman’s superior thriller stars Elliott Gould as Raymond Chandler’s private investigator Philip Marlowe in one of the director’s most entertaining films. The director would go on to be the recipient of the Honorary Award in 2006.He may have hosted several times, but Steve Martin has never been nominated for an Oscar. One film he deserved recognition for was Carl Reiner\u0027s 1983 sci-fi comedy, The Man with Two Brains.2547 A Matter of Life and Death (1946)The Academy Film Archive may have preserved A Matter of Life and Death in 1999, but voters failed to recognise the Powell \u0026amp Pressburger’s fantasy-romance at the time of its release in 1946.It may not be credited as his debut, but Mean Streets is very much the first true Martin Scorsese film.

There’s no cynicism, sneering, or snark here – listening to her naive optimism is like seeing your twitter feed in negative. But the clever thing about Tina Fey’s fast-paced, wise-cracking show is that it isn’t, well, too fey. Kimmy’s zest for life comes from having been held captive in an underground bunker for years rather than being broken by that, she emerges determined to get the most out of life. Four seasons in, there’s still something rather inspiring about that. If you’ve ever dreamt of sacking off the rat race and giving countryside self-sufficiency a try, why not live vicariously through this delightful, warm-hearted Seventies sitcom? Here, though, Tom (Richard Briers) and Barbara (an effortlessly cool Felicity Kendal) don’t quite make it to the countryside, instead attempting to raise goats, pigs, and chickens in their suburban back garden after Tom packs in his corporate job. Buoyed by its wonderful supporting characters, namely the Good’s painfully conventional next-door neighbours Margo and Jerry Leadbetter, The Good Life is an utter joy.310 Pride and PrejudiceThe work of Jane Austen, as a whole, is a kind of the ultimate comfort blanket. She offers us a smart, witty view on the world, where love can be transformative, but should never be pursued at the cost of losing all your senses. The BBC’s 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice captures this feeling, and has dynamism to spare. It’s wistful and romantic without feeling naive, anchored by a relatable heroine in Jennifer Ehle’s Elizabeth Bennet, and (of course) features that swoon-worthy, brooding performance from Colin Firth as Mr Darcy. Then there’s the lake scene – need I say more?Five gay American men do a makeover, and it’s fabulous. That’s the basic premise of Queer Eye, a Netflix reboot that introduced the world to the new Fab Five. Each has their area of expertise – Antoni Porowski teaches cooking, Tan France es into wardrobes, Karamo Brown provides life coaching, Bobby Berk re-designs their homes, and Jonathan Van Ness is in charge of grooming – and each one makes the show that little bit special in their own way. Even when the person getting the makeover is at the other end of the political spectrum to our hosts, the show focuses on the positives and shows that everyone, whether they’re democrat or republican, can do with a little self-love.Stars Hollow is excellent in all seasons, as demonstrated by Gilmore Girls: A Year in the LifeThis early Noughties comedy may be the product of its time, but it still makes for deeply unchallenging viewing. A single mother, Lorelai, and her teenaged daughter, Rory, have an upbeat and supportive relationship, speaking in snappy one-liners and rapid-fire dialogue. They live in Stars Hollow, a pastel picture of small town America at its most loveably eccentric. While it delivers poignant emotional truths galore, the focus is blessedly narrow, the stakes untroubingly low, and the outcome usually uplifting. Gilmore Girls has all the bite of a marshmallow – but soft and gooey is, sometimes, just what you need. Could there be a more quintessentially British TV show than The Great British Bake-Off? A batch of contestants try their hardest to impress two judges with their ornate cakes and pastries, all while cheering each other on and become the best of friends. There’s not a whiff of bitterness between them as they leave the tent – only sadness that Paul may never taste their grandma’s macaron recipe. And with the sardonic wit of Mel and SueNoel and Sandi keeping things fun – even when the pressures on – there’s never a mean-spirited moment. Bewitched is absolutely the product of its time, but that’s also what makes it so delightfully subversive. Samantha Stephens (Elizabeth Montgomery) is, on the surface, the ideal housewife of the 1960s. Each episode ends with her household in perfect order, dinner on the table, and a martini ready for her husband the second he walks through the door. Yet the joy of Bewitched comes from the fact that Samantha does these things with a wry smirk. We know she’s a witch, after all, actively choosing to the wear the guise of housewife despite the option to live as an all-powerful, supernatural being. We also know that it’s often her pulling the strings behind-the-scenes on this idyllic marriage. Despite its mid-century suburban sheen, Bewitched is a rebel in disguise. And that’s always enlivening to watch. Brooklyn Nine-Nine is a friendly embrace of a TV series, a sitcom in which all members of its erse ensemble deliver on cheer and belly laughs in each and every episode. Its the endlessly likeable Andy Samberg who leads the charge, and his Peter Pan-style detective Jake Peralta is the kind of character that makes you feel any issue can be resolved. As such, the show offers more of a motivational boost than you might expect for a series about hapless members of a police precinct. After all, if they can do it, anyone can.A staple on ITV3, Inspector Morse is the televisual equivalent of slipping on your favourite slippers: familiar and cosy. Sure, there are quite a few murders, but what about that beautiful Oxford setting, where dreaming spires tower above the grisliness? It\u0027s intelligent and has brilliant characterisation, with John Thaw\u0027s curmudgeonly, Wagner-loving, real-ale man its wonderful centre of gravity. The series ran from 1987 to 2000 and its legacy has lived on through spin-offs Lewis and Endeavour, but neither of which can quite match this series for charm. Sure, the further away we get from the end of Friends’s decade long run, the more blatant its many problematic moments are – but this ensemble sit-com is also enduringly funny, brilliantly acted, and endlessly bingeable. It rightly made stars of its six cast members when it premiered in 1994, and managed to continually evolve through the course of its ten seasons without losing its warm, inimitable charm. Once you\u0027re hooked, you\u0027ll have 236 episodes to get your teeth into – which is enough that by the time you\u0027re done, you\u0027ll be ready to start again.She dresses like a primary school teacher, smiles like the Cheshire cat, and sees the best in absolutely everybody: Kimmy Schmidt is an unusual heroine today.

Samantha Stephens (Elizabeth Montgomery) is, on the surface, the ideal housewife of the 1960s. Each episode ends with her household in perfect order, dinner on the table, and a martini ready for her husband the second he walks through the door. Yet the joy of Bewitched comes from the fact that Samantha does these things with a wry smirk. We know she’s a witch, after all, actively choosing to the wear the guise of housewife despite the option to live as an all-powerful, supernatural being. We also know that it’s often her pulling the strings behind-the-scenes on this idyllic marriage. Despite its mid-century suburban sheen, Bewitched is a rebel in disguise. And that’s always enlivening to watch. Brooklyn Nine-Nine is a friendly embrace of a TV series, a sitcom in which all members of its erse ensemble deliver on cheer and belly laughs in each and every episode. Its the endlessly likeable Andy Samberg who leads the charge, and his Peter Pan-style detective Jake Peralta is the kind of character that makes you feel any issue can be resolved. As such, the show offers more of a motivational boost than you might expect for a series about hapless members of a police precinct. After all, if they can do it, anyone can.A staple on ITV3, Inspector Morse is the televisual equivalent of slipping on your favourite slippers: familiar and cosy. Sure, there are quite a few murders, but what about that beautiful Oxford setting, where dreaming spires tower above the grisliness? It\u0027s intelligent and has brilliant characterisation, with John Thaw\u0027s curmudgeonly, Wagner-loving, real-ale man its wonderful centre of gravity. The series ran from 1987 to 2000 and its legacy has lived on through spin-offs Lewis and Endeavour, but neither of which can quite match this series for charm. Sure, the further away we get from the end of Friends’s decade long run, the more blatant its many problematic moments are – but this ensemble sit-com is also enduringly funny, brilliantly acted, and endlessly bingeable. It rightly made stars of its six cast members when it premiered in 1994, and managed to continually evolve through the course of its ten seasons without losing its warm, inimitable charm. Once you\u0027re hooked, you\u0027ll have 236 episodes to get your teeth into – which is enough that by the time you\u0027re done, you\u0027ll be ready to start again.“Tom and I are working hard and Sorkin loves it, and obviously it’s his creation and I had such an amazing time on it,” Munn said. “There’s been so much that has happened in the news and in media that we could really speak on, and it’d really be interesting to see what his take would be on it and what The Newsroom would do today.”Munn added that, having earned a journalism degree from the University of Oklahoma, she valued the show’s treatment of the media.\u0026nbsp“And as somebody who went to journalism school and has such love for journalists and media, it was to me that show was always a love letter to journalists, showing the struggles of what they go through to really tell the stories they want to tell,” she said. “So, I hope, we’ll see.

Only very detailed future archaeological research will stand a chance of finding the route and cracking that particular mystery.In the first, more maritime, scenario, the stones would potentially have been moved by raft (or catamaran) down Pembrokeshire’s Afon (river) Taf into the Bristol Channel and then along England’s River Avon to within 20 miles of the Salisbury Plain site earmarked for Stonehenge.In the second scenario, the stones would have had to be carried by stretcher or hauled on sledges (or possibly rollers) for long distances over often extremely challenging terrain (with only limited opportunities for river transport).This second method would certainly have had ostentatious political and ideological advantages – but it would have required vast amounts of manpower, time, effort and intertribal or interclan acquiescence.The discovery of the stone quarrying tools, dating to approximately the right date (3350-3000 BC) for the construction of the first stone phase of Stonehenge (c 2900 BC), proves, beyond reasonable doubt for the first time, that Neolithic people quarried the Welsh stones that ended up being used to build the world’s most famous prehistoric temple.But why did the builders of Stonehenge want to get their standing stones from 175 miles away when they could have used perfectly good local stones from Salisbury Plain?The answer is probably genealogical. Chemical (isotopic) signatures recently found in the bones of early Stonehenge people (excavated by archaeologists at that famous monument) suggest many of those iniduals were originally from western Britain – not from Salisbury Plain. It is therefore conceivable that the stones of early Stonehenge were brought to Salisbury Plain from the area associated with the builders’ ancestors.Fascinatingly, in much later (medieval) Arthurian literature, the stones of Stonehenge are said to have been brought by the magician Merlin from the far west (although, in the legend, from Ireland, rather than southwest Wales).The fact that the stones were brought from Pembrokeshire to Salisbury Plain raises another key mystery. If indeed they were transported to their new home as clan or tribal heirlooms, then it suggests they already possessed great significance. And that implies the possibility that they had already functioned as a ritual monument (i.e. as standing stones) in Wales, long before they were taken to Salisbury Plain.So the big archaeological question is whether the initial stones of Stonehenge were originally second-hand and pre-loved – or freshly quarried for use so far away. If the former theory is correct, then the original Stonehenge was actually in Pembrokeshire – not in England. The hunt is therefore now on for the original site of this potential Welsh proto-Stonehenge.Without doubt Salisbury Plain’s world-famous prehistoric temple still holds many secrets – but on-going archaeological research over the coming years is likely to gradually reveal them.British people \u0027more familiar with Eiffel Tower than Stonehenge\u0027Groundbreaking research reveals origins of people who built StonehengeThousands gather for summer solstice sunrise at Stonehenge Stonehenge tunnel \u0027could destroy traces of human life from Ice Age\u0027Congestion expert warns worst Christmas jams will be at StonehengeThe discovery of the quarrying tools – published today in the British archaeological journal, Antiquity, has been made by a team of archaeologists and geologists from UCL, Bournemouth University, the University of Southampton, the University of the Highlands and Islands and the National Museum of Wales.The project’s leader, Professor Mike Parker Pearson, said: “What’s really exciting about these discoveries is that they take us a step closer to unlocking Stonehenge’s greatest mystery – why its stones came from so far away.”“Every other Neolithic monument in Europe was built of megaliths brought from no more than 10 miles away. We’re now looking to find out just what was so special about the Preseli Hills 5,000 years ago, and whether there were any important stone circles here, built before the bluestones were moved to Stonehenge.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Now we are beginning to make tremendous progress in understanding the people and the community which built Stonehenge,” said the project’s osteologist, Christina Willis of University College London’s Institute of Archaeology.The research was carried out by archaeologists and other scientists from the University of Oxford, UCL, the Free University of Brussels, and the Museum of Natural History in Paris and is being published\u0026nbsptoday by the online\u0026nbspjournal\u0026nbspNature Scientific Reports.The ever-increasing body of evidence suggesting Stonehenge and the original Stonehenge community’s western British origins has substantial implications for our understanding of British prehistory.UCL)Firstly, it demonstrates the extremely broad geographical horizons that the builders of Stonehenge had. It shows that, despite agriculture increasingly tying people to the land, at least certain sections of society were well travelled and almost certainly had family connections spread across thousands of square miles.Secondly, it shows the lengths that prehistoric people were prepared to go to achieve seemingly non-utilitarian objectives – i.e. the realisation of spiritual or ceremonial aspirations.Thirdly, it suggests the possibility that the western origin of Stonehenge was so\u0026nbspimportant and memorable that it was celebrated across the millennia through collective memory and epic storytelling passed on across the generations. Potential evidence of this is\u0026nbspthe Arthurian story of the magician Merlin, who transports the stones of Stonehenge from the west. The\u0026nbspMerlin story describes how the stones\u0026nbspcame from Ireland – but southwest Wales is certainly close enough to Ireland, and also has\u0026nbspimportant Irish connections. The story was first written during the medieval times – but may well have had its roots in prehistoric collective memory.\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

The reason I don\u0027t believe that is because I think the Prime Minister\u0027s deal will go through.But if it doesn\u0027t get through, before then Parliament will have taken control, we will have a small extension to Article 50 and Parliament will then decide on alternatives.I believe that will become the Plan B.\u0026nbspTheresa May is to\u0026nbspto meet Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels on Wednesday, the\u0026nbspEU commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas has just told reporters.\u0026nbspA former EU commissioner Jose Manuel Barroso has said the most likely scenario now is that the UK will delay Brexit - and not leave on 29 March.I think the most likely scenario is not to do that in March this year, he said according to Reuters. We need more...preparations.“Even if there was a positive deal now, from a practical point of view, it’s obvious that everything is not ready. So I think the right thing to do is to have some extension, and I believe that if the UK demands an extension of Article 50, European Union countries will naturally accept it.”Leaving his home in North London, Jeremy Corbyn declined to answer questions from reporters on whether more resignations from MPs are coming after seven jumped ship on Monday, creating a new grouping in the House of Commons - The Independent Group.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspJohn McDonnell - the shadow chancellor and close ally of Jeremy Corbyn - has told Sky News: We need a mammoth, massive listening exercise and (to) address some of those criticisms that have been made.But he played down suggestions that as many as 36 Labour MPs had been considering a split.I don\u0027t think there is that scale, but the key issue for us - and it was made clear at the Parliamentary Labour Party, Tom Watson said it and others - the Labour leadership, and I\u0027m part of that, we need to keep listening, bring people in, talk to them, he said.One of the MPs who quit Labour, Chuka Umunna, told ITV\u0027s Good Morning Britain on Tuesday: We are not the SDP. This is a different century.Asked when the group of MPs could evolve into a new centre party with a name and more members, Mr Umunna said: I would like to see us move as quickly as possible and certainly by the end of the year, but that\u0027s my personal view.He added: There needs to be an alternative, so that\u0027s perfectly possible. But I don\u0027t get to determine this.According to reports in the , senior ministers have told the prime minister she must stop using the threat of a no-deal Brexit as a negotiating position in the Brexit talks as the prime minister prepares to meet her cabinet on Tuesday morning.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspDuring today\u0027s session the Brexit secretary\u0026nbspStephen Barclay is to brief the cabinet on his latest talks with Brussels amid continuing deadlock over the Northern Ireland backstop.Mr Barclay was said to have had a productive discussion with the EU\u0027s chief negotiator Michel Barnier in the Belgian capital on Monday.However, it appeared that they were no closer to resolving the fraught issue of the backstop - intended to ensure there is no hard border on the island of Ireland - which remains the main stumbling block to an agreement.\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

To confront the scale of the problem and meet the consequences. To keep others from leaving.”One source involved in the split on Monday told The Independent that other MPs\u0026nbspwere close to quitting and would follow depending on what happened over Brexit in the coming weeks.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIn his statement, Mr Watson said that “a virulent form of identity politics has seized” control of Labour, and said Mr Corbyn’s team now must “reflect the balance of opinion” across all MPs in the parliamentary party.He also lashed out the “hard Left”, who he claimed “can be too easily tempted into the language of heresy and treachery”.It came after the MPs faced a wave of abuse in the wake of their decision to leave, including fellow MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle who compared them to “cowards”.The Young Labour twitter account posted a line from the party’s anthem, The Red Flag, reading: “Though cowards flinch and traitors sneer, we’ll keep the red flag flying here.”I’m a Remainer but I feel betrayed by the defecting Labour MPsWhy an area ‘showered with EU cash’ still thinks Brexit is a good ideaShadow chancellor John McDonnell called on the breakaway group to do “the honourable thing” and fight to retain their seats, while Unite union boss Len McCluskey hit out at the “splitters” who had “no stomach for a fight for Labour’s core values”.The decision to quit the party had been the result of months of soul searching for the MPs, with one telling The Independent: “I’ve been getting out of bed every morning for the past two years thinking, ‘Shall I resign from the Labour Party today or tomorrow?’”The most recent Brexit votes on 14 February appear to have been a tipping point for some angered by Mr Corbyn’s reluctance to support a second referendum.One source in the breakaway group said: “We were looking at the amendments that the Labour Party was putting down and hoping, I was hoping anyway, on the 14th we would have had a little more movement on a People’s Vote but in fact we ended up going backwards and it wasn’t referenced at all.“Clearly a lot of us have had issues with the leadership of the party going back quite some time ... We tried everything to save the Labour Party.”Mr Corbyn’s response to the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal also “crystallised” concerns, another MP said, arguing they were not prepared to sponsor a government led by him.As she resigned, Ms Berger said Labour had become “institutionally antisemitic”, while Mr Gapes, a former chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, told the press conference Labour is now a “racist, antisemitic party”.Corbyn accused of ditching Labour’s Brexit policy by party delegatesHe added: “Jeremy Corbyn and those around him are on the wrong side on so many international issues – from Russia, to Syria, to Venezuela. A Corbyn Labour government would threaten our national security and international alliances.”Mr Umunna called on MPs from Labour and other parties to “leave the old tribal politics behind” and join the new independent group.He said: “It is time we dumped this country’s old-fashioned politics and created an alternative that does justice to who we are today and gives this country a politics fit for the here and now, the 21st century not the last one.“We’ve taken the first step in leaving the old tribal politics behind and we invite others who share our political values to do so too.”As well as other Labour MPs, there has been speculation that some Tories may consider joining the new group, with several facing deselection moves in their local associations due to their soft-Brexit stance.Among those is the Tory MP for Grantham, Nick Boles, who said: “They’re all good people and I understand completely why they felt driven to leave Labour.“I have not spoken with any of them about their plans and am totally focused on working with MPs of all parties to stop a no-deal Brexit on 29 March.”Work now begins in earnest on framing what the Independent Group stands for and how it will be run, with its first meeting due in the coming days.A source said they needed to get moving quickly or “the machines of the existing parties are going to come after us in a very significant way”.“It’s D-Day today”, the MP added.Sources were keen to emphasise their independence from pro-EU campaigns such as People’s Vote and also from prominent figures like ex-Labour prime minister Tony Blair – despite their support for a Final Say referendum.Scant detail has emerged about how the group is going to be funded, apart from a crowdfunding page which crashed when the announcement was made.Asked whether they had union funding, one MP said they respected the union movement but joked it was “nice to be free” as most were run by a “tiny clique”.We’ll tell you what’s true.

None of the MPs have commented on their intentions.Meanwhile, Mr Corbyn was\u0026nbspwarned he could face more resignations unless he gets to grips with antisemitism complaints, in a stormy meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party on Monday night.Labour sources said party chairman Ian Lavery stressed the leadership\u0027s commitment to rooting out antisemitism at what was described as a heated behind-closed-doors gathering.But his claims were greeted with derision by some of those present with accusations that he failed to understand the enormity of the problem.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell sought to strike a conciliatory tone on Tuesday morning, telling\u0026nbspSky News: We need a mammoth, massive listening exercise and (to) address some of those criticisms that have been made.He played down suggestions that as many as 36 Labour MPs had been considering leaving the party.I don\u0027t think there is that scale, but the key issue for us - and it was made clear at the PLP, Tom Watson said it and others - the Labour leadership, and I\u0027m part of that, we need to keep listening, bring people in, talk to them, he said.Mr McDonnell said the only disagreement we have had within the party is around how we handle Brexit and I think we are bringing people together on that.We’ll tell you what’s true.

But Amy could do nothing about this, for the woman who had punched her in the face and kicked her as she lay crumpled on the floor was her master, and Amy was her slave.Shes one of an estimated , victims of slavery in the UK, who live alongside us unnoticed - washing our cars, painting our nails and cleaning our neighbours houses, hiding in plain sight up and down the country. And when slaves do manage to escape from their masters - , were rescued in Britain last year - they are shockingly only entitled to  days of help from the government.Which is why The Sun is today launching a campaign to Stamp Out Slavery, in conjunction with Co-Op, backing Lord McColls victim support bill, which proposes to extend support given to rescued slaves from  days to one year.Here, speaking exclusively to Sun Online, Amy, now , tells her story.Domestic slavery might sound like something out of a Victorian novel, but last year alone  people, like Amy - including  children - were rescued from domestic servitude across Britain.As her story proves, almost anyone can be forced into slavery.Amy, an -year-old orphan, was bursting with excitement when she flew over to the UK from Ghana.After the death of her parents in , she was befriended by a lovely woman called Mary who offered to take her to the UK to become a nanny.She tells Sun Online: “My parents died and suddenly I was alone. I dropped out of school and had no-one.She says: “She knew I didn’t have family and was a hard worker, so she got me a passport paid £, so I could travel over. I was going to look after her five-year-old daughter and I couldnt wait.“Because of the money she’d spent, I felt like I owed her big time.”But within days of arriving in the UK, Amy realised all wasnt as it appeared and it soon became clear that she wasnt here to look after Marys child.Once in the UK, Marys tone changed and she made Amy sleep on the floor with no duvet or mattress.Within a week, she was forced into working -hour shts cleaning Marys flat - and went days without eating.Amy says: “I went through hell.She told me I had to sleep on the floor. Her friend offered me a free mattress, but she said I didn’t deserve it.The only clothes I had were hand-me-downs and I slept about four hours a night. She didn’t want to see me sleeping -she was in the house and awake I had to stay up just in case.“I’d sneak one or two meals in when she was out - I’d have eggs and rice, just cooking leftovers.Every day I had to hand wash all Mary and her daughter’s clothes and I wasn’t allowed to use the hot water.“I was trapped and felt suicidal.”Sobbing as she remembers her ordeal, Amy says that Mary pimped her out to strangers who came to the flat.“Within a month she began to let men sleep with me.It happened twice a week - men came over, paid her a handful of notes, raped me and left.The first time it happened it was really bad. I told her I couldn’t do it and she said I could, because I’d already been raped.If Amy didn’t do as she was told, she was threatened.Amy says: “She took my passport and told me to stay away from the police, andI talk to them she would stab me with a screwdriver. So I just did what she asked.”After  months, Amy reached breaking point.One day while Mary was out, Amy seized the opportunity and found courage to flee, frantically breaking down the lock on the front door.With nowhere to go, she ended up homeless. But sleeping rough on Londons streets seemed like a better option than spending another day under her mistress tyrannical rule.   A few months later, Amy bumped into Mary on the street.Amy says: “She slapped me and demanded I collect my belongings. Then she called the police, who called immigration.”Now, Amy lives in temporary accommodation in the Midlands, supported by The Sophie Hayes Foundation, a charity set up to help victims of trafficking.She says: “I don’t trust people. I don’t sleep properly and am on antidepressants. For a long time, I wanted to take my own le. I didn’t see the point of living in this world.Sadly, stories like Amy’s are far from unique. Elvira, , from the Philippines also arrived at Heathrow in  and was taken to a luxury flat in London’s Kensington where she was forced to work  hours a day.“I had to work all the time, without a day off, and I slept on the floor by her bed,” Elvira toldin .  “My mistress would shout at me, saying I was stupid or call me a “dog”. I was given just a piece of bread and cup of tea for the whole day. I became emaciated. I felt like a slave, like I was in prison.”She wanted to run away but her captors had her passport.One morning, when he employer went for a nap, she found the keys to the door and ran. Hiding in a nearby church, she called for help.Thankfully she did manage to escape. Of the  referrals for potential victims of domestic servitude made last year,  were female but it shows its not only women who are at risk.Ofonime Inuk was  and an orphan when he was lured to the UK from Nigeria and kept as a slave for  years in the West London home of NHS doctor Emmanuel Edet and his we.His passport was confiscated and he was forced to work -hour days cooking and cleaning, with a thin foam mattress in the hallway as his bed.In  Edet and his we were sentenced to six years in prison but Mr Inuk, now , said: “I’m not going to get my le back, it’s gone now.”Brenda, , from South East Asia, was beaten, abused and kept as a prisoner for four years by a London family.As a single mother, shed sought work abroad to provide for her two children but was not never allowed tohome.“I was forced to care for a bed-ridden old man and was beaten badly, she tells Sun Online. I was only fed his leftovers and he called me animal.It went on for four years. I was starved, they held my passport and locked me in.Her chance to escape finally came when cleaners knocked on the door of the apartment and she screamed through the door.The cleaners called  and  minutes later the officers freed her. Brenda says: I was scared, because I didn’t have anything, only my clothes. I didn’t know what to do.”The UK recognised a staggering , victims from  countries in , including adults who had been used for organ harvesting and children that were forced into sexual exploitation.At present, trafficked victims have just  days support after being freed before they are expected to leave the UK and are deported by the Home Office.During this short time, they are given accommodation, financial aid, medical treatment, counselling, a support worker, a translator and legal advice.We want the government to: Back Lord McColls proposed bill, which suggests all victims of modern slavery should be given a years support to recover.Alongside that they should be given special support to help them, including housing benefits, financial help and other services.She was directed to the National Referral Mechanism, a framework for pinpointing victims of human trafficking or modern slavery and ensuring they receive the appropriate support.But after  days, the Home Office issued a negative decision on Brendas right to asylum.She was removed from her safe-house and referred to charity, Kalayaan.Working on her behalf, the charity launched legal action against the Home Office who are now reassessing Brenda’s situation.She has been waiting for a decision on her claim for four years. During this time she has not had permission to work so her children have continued to struggle back home. “I am angry,” says Brenda. “I need justice.” Thinking of her children, she starts to cry. “It’s a long time since I have seen them. I miss them so much.”Last year, Wiltshire Polices #telluswhatyousee campaign went viral, after they released a seemingly innocuous video of a woman cleaning the windows of an ordinary suburban house and taking out the rubbish. The video aimed to highlight that modern slavery can be very dficult to spot, and flagged up the signs to watch out for.Justine Currell, Director at modern slavery charity Unseen, says: “Domestic servitude is one of the most hidden and under-reported forms of modern slavery, taking place mostly behind closed doors.Heartbreaking stories like these are why The Sun is backing calls for a change in the law so that specialist support given to modern slavery victims – including forced labour and human trafficking – is increased from as little as  days to a full year, as they rebuild their lives. You can sign the petition for the Modern Slavery Victim Support Bill here.Find out more about Co-Ops Bright Future programme, which offers employment to survivors of modern slavery, here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It repeats endlessly that the withdrawal agreement is closed and that it isn’t going to reopen it.When the Brady amendment passed the House of Commons, saying Parliament would accept the dealthe backstop was replaced, the EU responded by saying they didn’t think this Parliament majority was “stable”.Thursday night’s vote helps them make that argument.As one No source laments: “We don’t want to give the Europeans a chance not to engage with us.”I understand that when the Brexit Secretary, Steve Barclay, dined in Brussels this week Sabine Weyand — the EU’s deputy negotiator — spent her time telling him that a customs union was the only major change available to the backstop.The EU think that Corbyn’s support for it means that a customs union could pass Parliament. I am told Barclay attempted to disabuse them of this idea.Mrs May can’t entirely escape blame for this week’s fiasco.No should have made sure that its own MPs were happy with the wording before publishing the motion.“She’s like a football team that can’t string two wins together,” complains one minister.But the Tory Brexit ultras should have paid more heed to the real-world consequences of their actions.Another effect of Thursday night’s defeat for the Government is that it increases the chances of the Cooper amendment passing on February .This would compel the Government to seek an extension to Article Mrs May hasn’t won Parliament’s support for an exit deal by March .One Cabinet minister, with close links to several of the ministers who might quit to ensure this amendment goes through, tells me it is now “much more likely” to pass.This Secretary of State complains that the Government’s defeat “makes it harder to make the argument that we should hold our nerve” as “the best evidence for holding your nerve was that the outcome would be the same as when the Brady amendment went through”.Another minister warns: “If she doesn’t come back with something cooking by the th, there’ll be trouble.”I understand those around Mrs May know they need to have shown progress by the th.One insider tells me: “If the Government doesn’t want Parliament to take control, they need to have a plan.They can’t just sit there for two weeks.”Other Cabinet ministers aren’t so sure Cooper will pass.One tells me: “I don’t think the ministers will resign, andthey don’t resign, then it doesn’t pass.”If Cooper does go through, politics will enter into an even more unpredictable phase. One May Cabinet ally is predicting a general electionthis happens.But it is hard to see how a general election could end in anything other than disaster for the Tories in these circumstances.If Mrs May is forced to ask the EU for an extension but with no Parliamentary agreement in sight, the EU is more likely to offer a long extension than a short one.I understand the view in several EU capitals is that the longer the extension, the more likely it is that the political dynamics in the UK will change.But a long extension would prolong this damaging, political uncertainty.This Government, and this Parliament’s, job is to get Brexit done. Time is running short. Both Parliament and the Government need to get their act together.But it may well be because the NHS – traditionally Labour’s strongest suit – is not the most important issue in politics right now.But that number is down to  per cent this winter, according to the pollster Ipsos Mori.The question now is whether the Tory decision to spend an extra £billion a year on the health service by  leads to a decline in public concern.But in January AE departments recorded their worst waiting times since the figures started being collected in .Matt Hancock, the new Health Secretary, is setting up a new NHS-X unit to try to bring the health service into the digital era, which would help the NHS to better use its resources.There are many things the Tories have to do to win the next election – not least, deliver Brexit – but they must also reassure voters on the NHS.Butthey can be ed they should be subject to the full force of the law.Justice must be done and must be seen to be done.Churchill wouldn’t have been Prime Minister but for the Labour Party’s willingness to serve in a government led by him.When it came to the crucial decision to fight on in , Clement Attlee and Arthur Greenwood, two Labour members of the War Cabinet, were more solid than some of Churchill’s Tory colleagues.But Attlee and Greenwood came from a very dferent Labour tradition to McDonnell: They weren’t Marxists or Trotskyists.There are some Labour MPs who are just not prepared to try to put into power people who are so outside the traditional bounds of the party.One minister likens the coming Tory leadership race to the  Grand National, when a crowded field led to a pile-up at the rd fence and the victory of the - outsider Foinavon.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We don’t believe they’ll get a No Deal exit either, and eventhey did the short-term chaos would kill their party.Instead Parliament would postpone Brexit, possibly finishing the Tories for a generation. This current purgatory would go on for months longer — maybe long enough for Remainers to reverse the referendum result.The Government would have failed in its only mission. It would instead have undermined our democracy and ensured bitter isions that would never heal.The one person unable to compromise, oddly, is the Prime Minister. Because what Brussels, Labour and Tory Remainers glibly ask of her, a permanent customs union, ALSO wrecks her party and destroys Brexit’s economic case.It was folly to expect the Tory ERG group to vote to “take No Deal off the table” on Thursday night. Logic was on their side, at least.But they need to think hard now how they will feel on March Brexit is put off and they are blamed. If they have opened the door to a toxic, anti-Semitic, anti-Western Labour rabble so crazed by ideology they cannot even allow Winston Churchill’s historic defeat of Nazism to trump his other failings.A party committed to massive tax rises, maybe even a  per cent windfall levy on anyone’s “wealth”. A party led by pension-age Marxist revolutionaries friendly to Putin, Hamas, the IRA and hard-left dictators but hard on private enterprise, job-creation and free speech.We sincerely hope Labour moderates stop dithering and resign to undermine Corbyn and McDonnell. We marvel that so many can still stomach these sinister men poised to do unimaginable harm.But eventhey can’t grasp that, Tory Brexiteers can. And we say this to them:Wake up. Look how close you now are to bringing this calamity about.WILL the Government squander the biggest potential shale gas discovery in our history It is believed there is enough under the East Midlands alone to power Britain cheaply for  years.Yet the Tories are suffocating this new industry at birth by persisting with an absurdly low limit on the level of tremor allowable when drilling. It is hundreds of times weaker than anyone can feel.A Government public information campaign must nail the lies the eco lobby has told to turn Brits off fracking.If Theresa May ever sorts Brexit, she must take charge of it personally.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And it was an old-school print journalist, the brilliant Anthony Loyd of The Times, who found Begum in a Syrian refugee camp containing almost , people.Loyd’s interview with her is a gripping insight into the twisted mind of a British youngster who ran off to join IS’s murderous caliphate. And the BBC had bugger all to do with it.While BBC staffers were sipping their skinny lattes and nibbling almond croissants in Broadcasting House, a journalist from The Times got his scoop the hard way, tramping into a chaotic refugee camp in one of the most dangerous parts of the world.Why does this matter  Because this country has one of the most vibrant newspaper industries on the planet.And the bloated, over-funded BBC is KILLING it.The Cairncross Review, a Government report into the future of UK journalism, revealed this week how tax-dodging tech giants Facebook and Google, together with the publicly-funded BBC are annihilating our free Press.They have already destroyed what was once affectionately known as “the local rag”.Over the past seven years, hundreds of local papers have shut down and thousands of regional journalists have lost their jobs. , journalists worked on local newspapers in  — now it is just ,. And it is your money that bankrolls the BBC.At a time when the BBC is contem­plating ditching free TV licences for the over-s, the debate we should REALLY be having is about how much of your money we should be chucking at Auntie.We have a great newspaper industry and it is worth preserving.Because it wasn’t the BBC that broke the story of MPs fiddling their expenses — it was a newspaper . And it wasn’t the BBC that broke the story about charity Age UK receiving £million from an energy company to flog gas and electricity to pensioners — it was a newspaper .It wasn’t the BBC that dared to publish the names of the killers of Stephen Lawrence — it was a newspaper .And what was the most-read story on the BBC last year  Strictly minx Katya Jones snogging Seann Walsh  — a Sun on Sunday exclusive.The BBC, like Facebook and Google, is a parasite that lives off the flesh of real news-gatherers.What makes the BBC dferent from the tax-dodging tech giants is that we love it. And you can’t grow up in this country and not have a deep and abiding affection for the BBC.I have endless happy memories of the BBC — from Match Of The Day to Top Of The Pops, from David Attenborough documentaries to The Likely Lads, from Fawlty Towers to the Hairy Cornflake.But the BBC has got far too big, far too bloated and far too wealthy.Lord Reith, the visionary behind it, wanted our state broadcaster to “inform, educate and entertain”. Lord Reith never dreamed of a state broadcaster that was all-powerful.The BBC gets far too much of your money and spends it far too easily. Why does the BBC need to be over every nook and cranny of the internet To the generation growing up on Netflix and YouTube with an entire universe on their smartphones, the BBC pocketing more than £ a year from everyone with a TV set is absurd.The BBC has got too big for its publicly-funded boots.That’s what we should be talking about — not the merits of free TV licences for granny and grandad!The Cairncross Review told how the BBC’s expansionist online empire has come very close to destroying the local newspaper industry.Are we really going to keep giving the BBC £billion every year so it can do the same to the national newspaper industry In the same week as the Cairncross Review came out, Bruce Sharma, , fought off thieves armed with a hammer and a machete with just his rolled-up copy of The Sun.Bruce was reading The Sun in Ram Stores in Long Eaton, Derbys, when the hooded pair burst in demanding money. “Instinct took over and I tried to whack them with the paper,” says Bruce.You can’t do that with a TV licence.GORDON Banks lit up my childhood.For my generation – a wide-eyed kid on that magical summer’s day in  – those World Cup winners will always feel like family.Gordon never got a knighthood.

The gaping wounds left by this internal conflict could soon prove fatal to him.There were sharp intakes of breath yesterday when seven moderate Labour MPs announced they have resigned to set up a new Independent Group.Their number may be small — and none of them, except perhaps Chuka Umunna, may be household names — but their move is certain to have a huge impact on British politics.It throws the Opposition into chaos.  Beleaguered by dismal poll ratings, serial incompetence, isions over Brexit and accusations of extremism, Corbyn will now come under brutal pressure.The Gang of Seven’s decision to quit will feed into the narrative that he is a Marxist mediocrity, whose toxic spell at the helm since  has not only dragged his party to the lunatic fringe but has also allowed vicious anti-Semitism and intolerance to flourish.The seven splitters made precisely those charges yesterday, using language that  will be gleefully exploited by Labour’s opponents.Luciana Berger, the MP for Liverpool Wavertree who has endured death threats and deselection attempts from socialist zealots, said she would be “sickened and ashamed to remain in the Labour Party” because of the  “culture of bullying, bigotry and intimidation”.Equally powerful was Chris Leslie,  the Nottingham East MP, who argued that Labour had been “hijacked by the machine politics of the hard Left”, peddling “abuse and hatred”.Labour’s turmoil follows the battering that Corbyn received in a new book by investigative journalist Tom Bower.With a wealth of shocking details, it exposes the full scale of the Labour leader’s dreary left-wing fanaticism, his links to anti-Semitism, his anti-British instincts and his low intellectual calibre.As the book graphically demonstrates, never was there any politician less fitted for the premiership.Given the y charge sheet against Corbyn, it is amazing that the party split did not happen earlier. But the moderates hung on in the forlorn hope that Corbyn might change or that Labour might move back towards the centre ground.There was never any chance of that.Corbyn and his dogmatic followers are not interested in compromise or debate — only in enforcement of their warped ideology.  They have turned what was once a broad church into a narrow personality cult.In fact, many Corbynites, like a kind of Trotskyite Taliban, welcome the split because they see it as an opportunity to rid the socialist creed of impurities.“Though cowards flinch and traitors sneer, we’ll keep the Red Flag flying here,” screeched the infantile Young Labour movement.Yet the charge of cowardice is an absurd one to make at the splitters.It took courage to quit. Most of them had relatively safe Labour seats. Yet they have put their political careers and livelihoods at risk in protest at Corbyn.In addition, they will be forced to endure a barrage of abuse from party members, since Labour is a profoundly tribal movement, where betrayal is regarded as the darkest sin of all.But this will only be the start of a major rebellion against Corbyn.To the Gang of Seven can be added three other moderate former Labour MPs who already sit as Independents, namely Frank Field, Ivan Lewis and John Woodcock, who describes Corbyn as “a clear risk to national security”.Public interest in the new group is strong. By early yesterday evening they had gained , followers on Twitter.And more Labour MPs are likely to resign, emboldened by the Gang Of Seven.  It should be remembered that in  no fewer than  Labour MPs —  per cent of the parliamentary party — openly declared their lack of confidence in Corbyn’s leadership.Tellingly, Tom Watson, the Deputy Leader, said in a bitter swipe at Corbyn yesterday that he “no longer recognised” his own party and merely condemned the defections as “premature”.Even with its modest beginnings, the Independent Group launch represents the biggest split in British politics since the formation of the SDP in , when Labour was lurching to the Left under Michael Foot. But the parallel with the SDP also highlights the weakness of the new group.The SDP was headed by the big figures of Roy Jenkins, David Owen and Shirley Williams, all experienced Cabinet Ministers and potential premiers.There is no one remotely of that stature among the new Independents.Their most high-profile member, Umunna, briefly ran for the Labour leadership in  but withdrew at the first whf of media scrutiny.Nor does the Independent Group have a coherent set of policies beyond being anti-Corbyn and pro-EU.In contrast, the SDP had a clear stance in favour of Britain’s nuclear deterrent, Common Market membership and the market economy.The splitters’ claim to be standing up for democracy is also weakened by their reluctance to accept the result of the  EU referendum, the greatest democratic exercise in British political history. Indeed, in their Remoaner posturing, there is an unpleasant air of the narrow, metropolitan progressive elite about their operation so far.Nevertheless,they help to prevent the election of Corbyn, they will do a service to British politics, just as the SDP helped to halt the advance of Foot almost  years ago. If the new Independent Group is really to reshape the British political landscape, it will have to be far more than just a narrow, elitist breakaway from Labour.A burst of anti-Corbyn hype is not enough. To become an authentic third force that dominates the centre, it will have to attract MPs from other parties.That means taking over the increasingly moribund Lib Dems, now led by the ineffectual Sir Vince Cable.More importantly, it   requires winning over Left-inclined Tories and anti-Brexit MPs such as the noisy Anna Soubry and the former GP Sarah Wollaston.Gaining Conservative support was precisely what the SDP failed to do, ultimately dooming it to failure. Just one Tory MP, Christopher Brocklebank-Fowler, became a Social Democrat.Gang of Seven member Gavin Shuker said that Labour had “turned its back on the British public”.He is absolutely right — which is  why Corbyn’s mob must not be allowed near power. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She fumed: Soon there will be nothing left at all to appeal to moderate centre ground voters.

The Sun reports six Tories - Heidi Allen, Sarah Wollaston, Anna Soubry, Antoinette Sandbach, Justine Greening and Phillip Lee - are on defection watch by senior Tories. One pro-Remainer, Nick Boles, dismissed claims he could join the breakaway group - telling Sky News they were b****cks.But he tweeted last night: The MPs who set up Independent Group today are all good people.

What happens next is crucial, more Labour MPs ripping up party cards to join what is calling itself an Independent Group would be another gt for the Conservatives. Labour should first consider why the seven departed to avoid others following, addressing grievances on Europe and anti-Semitism in the hope of uniting the party. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell’s call for MPs to stand again in by-elections, now they’re against the party which got them into Parliament, is, alas, likely to be rejected.   The prospect of a Labour government is a little more remote today and the Tories a little more secure as a result of the split. Surely that can’t be good for working people.

The split in  continues to cast a dark shadow over the party. Then, as now, a group of moderate MPs left in protest at the party’s shyleadership, the infiltration by the hard left and isions over Europe. Then, as now, the splitters promised to break the mould by changing the “broken” way of doing politics. In the end they only proved the dficulties of establishing a new political force under our first-past-the-post electoral system. In , the SDP-Liberal Alliance got . million votes, a shade below Labour’s . million, but won  seats to Michael Foot’s . By , the SDP was wound up following the creation of the Liberal Democrats.  Many in Labour fear history could repeat itself with the “gang of seven”. The lesson they draw from the creation of the SDP is that a new party will split the Labour vote and hand the Tories the next general election on a plate. Angela Smith said yesterday that comparisons with the SDP do not “stand up to scrutiny”.  “This is a dferent century and the challenges that the country faces are on a scale that I don’t think we have seen at any other time in the post-war period,” she said. There is no doubt that Brexit is testing traditional political allegiances. Many voters now identy themselves by how they voted in the referendum, rather than by which party they tend to support.  But it is far from certain this upheaval will lead to a redrawing of the political map. Historian Dr Matt Cole, from Birmingham University, said: “The inidual MPs have a steep hill to climb, it is rarely successful. “The culture of British politics is one in which the main political parties, however unpopular they are, nonetheless are incredibly resilient. “They are like a company that nobody likes the products of, but they can’t stop buying them.” The two main parties’ joint vote in  was the highest since , he said. There may be, as Ms Smith said, a large number of people who feel politically homeless. But evenyou provide then with a new house the chances of breaking the two-party monopoly are slim.  Unlike in , the seven dissident MPs cannot claim to be political heavyweights. The founders of the SDP included Roy Jenkins, a former Chancellor and Home Secretary, David Owen, a former Foreign shySecretary, and Shirley Williams, a former Education Secretary. The highest rank achieved by Chuka Ummuna was shadow Business Secretary under Ed Miliband. At the moment, the Independent Group lacks all the components required to form a new party – a grassroots base, money and a distinct agenda. The MPs were brutally honest in saying what they were against: the failure to tackle anti-Semitism the hard Left’s grip on the party machine the lukewarm opposition to Brexit.  They were less clear when it came to spelling out what they did stand for. But this does not mean the Labour leadership has nothing to fear from the breakaway. The centrist seven could be joined by other MPs, including Conservatives, and their message may shyresonate with disillusioned Labour councillors, activists and voters. Which is why many expected a stronger response from the Labour leadership to the most serious fracturing of the party in almost  years. It was moment when the party’s MPs and activists looked for reassurance and direction. Instead, Mr Corbyn issued a tersely worded statement expressing his disappointment and sent an email to members urging them to stay united.  There should have been, at the very least, an acknowledgement that the criticisms made by the departing seven would have chimed with many Labour MPs and supporters. Those who may still quit need to hear from the Labour leader why they should stay. It was left to Deputy Leader Tom Watson to try to articulate the mood of a dismayed and anxious party. His warning that unless things change others could follow the seven out of the door was a direct challenge to Corbyn. Labour could only prevent others from leaving, Watson said,we “reach out and extend beyond our comfort zone”.  There was also a more veiled message that the leadership needed to listen to the Parliamentary Labour Party on Brexit. It was noticeable that in his email to party members, Mr Corbyn reaffirmed that the option of a second referendum remained on the table. Some believe that unless he follows through on this demand then other MPs could join the nascent Independent Group. How the leadership responds will be a major factor in determining whether the breakaway MPs are a flash in the pan or a new movement. If allies of Corbyn turn viciously on the quitters they will confirm their reasons for leaving and could encourage others to follow.  The leadership must ask itself why moderate MPs feel they can no longer stay in the party and respond to concerns about Brexit and anti-Semitism. At stake is Labour’s chance of winning the next election. In dozens of marginal seats the Independent Group could split the opposition vote and allow the Tories to keep power. The legacy of the SDP was to force Labour to sht to the centre, where elections are usually won or lost. Today’s seven MPs may have decided to sacrice their careers for the same ambition.

Doing the honours was celebrity tattooist Jay Hutton, who appeared onChannel s Tattoo Fixers. Presenting him with McDonalds burger, Coline said: I have a challenge for you. I would like to get a tattoo of a Big Mac. Coline worked in the fast food chain for two years and loved it, she said.   The Big Mac is what epitomises Macdonalds, Jay said.

It’s posh and full of snobs.”So that evening I mentioned this to the audience, and a woman shouted, “It’s true, they are posh – they’ve even got theirown dentist.”Incidents like this led to the Radio  show Mark Steel’s in Town, in which I visit a town each week and write a show about it, performed to a local audience. This is why I’ve encountered attractions such as Hebden Bridge, the scenic Yorkshire town so famous for its lesbian community that the manager of the tourist office told me a woman came in that week, striding past brochures for coach trips and rambles, and said, “I’ve heard this town is full of lesbians, so I want you to find me one.”  A few miles away, the people of Stockport are immensely proud of the  night bus route, on which they insist every journey entertains you. One discussion went, “Does that bloke still get on with no shirt, always carrying a rabbit ” – “Of course he does, he’s the driver.” Stockport also shyexperienced a plague of wild peacocks. No one knew where they’d come from, but they were sat on cars, screeching on fences, and the local paper quoted one woman saying, “It was terrying. One came into the kitchen and knocked over a kettle.” In nearby upmarket Wilmslow, Cheshire, where soap stars and Manchester United footballers live, I found a leaflet in an estate agents, advertising a bungalow for poundmillion, which said: “This bungalow boasts one feature not found in any other bungalow in the area: it has an extra floor.”Sometimes it feels asthe area puts on a show on purpose. When I visited shyBirkenhead, Merseyside, someone suggested I go to a local bar called Moodz. It was a long thin room, brightly lit, with a dozen people drinking on their own, facing forwards and scowling, while one man rode up and down in a mobility scooter. Then Come on Eileen by Dexys Midnight Runners came on the jukebox, and a woman of about  stood on a table and sang along to it very loudly. The man in the mobility scooter stripped down to his pants, then stood up, trying to dance while clinging to the bar. The woman came down from the table, whipped off his pants, they sang “too-ra-oo-ra-ay”, while no one  took the slightest bit of notice. The producer of the radio show nudged me and said, “And it’s only half past seven.”  Almost every town has a rich tradition of protest. So everyone in Walsall, West Mids, seems to know Sister Dora – the Victorian nurse who transformed hospitals by campaigning for them to be kept clean – who has a statue in the town centre. And all of Hull knows Lily Bilocca, the woman who led the campaign for safety laws on trawlers, whose face is on a vast mural by the docks. But in the genteel Durham town of Barnard Castle, there was fury because British Telecom installed a small green box on a pavement. One woman said: “I was delivering the church newsletter and wasn’t looking where I was going so I nearly walked into it.” But they were determined to resist. The local paper reported: “A group of knitters are threatening to produce a tea cosy to cover up the cabinet... However, having considered their tea cosy protest, fear of getting into trouble with the authorities is making them think twice.” It’s like reading about the struggles of Nelson Mandela.  Some of the proudest areas are just outside cities. Don’t suggest to someone from Paisley they’re a part of Glasgow. You’ll face abuse that goes, “We’re nowhere near Glasgow, we’re at least two miles from Glasgow, I don’t even know how I know it’s two miles away as I’ve never heard of Glasgow.” In a pub in Paisley I was told of the time a dog’s jaws locked around a man’s testicles. The police were called but action was required urgently, so a passer-by whacked the dog with a baseball bat. Later the police said: “It was lucky this happened in Paisley, as it’s the only place you can shyguarantee there’ll be a passer-by with a baseball bat.” On the surface, modern Britain looks increasingly unorm and soulless. Every town has its shyidentical shypedestrianised precinct, Tesco Expresses, and out-of-town retail parks with Homebase and identical staff and pot-plants. But in Portishead, the shypersonality they asked to turn on the Christmas lights was Nigel who worked in Homebase, “chosen above TV stars, for his cheerful demeanour and helpful attitude”. By the end of the series, I’ll have been to  towns, and every one has been packed with enthusiastic people who adore their town, because each place is ridiculously gloriously dferent. Because it’s only in Hastings that businesses can have names such as “ waxing for men”, and a builder called “William the Concreter”.Mark Steel’s In Town, Radio , Thursday, .pm.

After receiving three messages from the stranger, Mary, who was also married to someone  at the time, responded to let Peter know he must have the wrong number. But their relationship soon blossomed over text messages and the pair confided each about their failing relationships - until Peter travelled from Bolton, Lancashire, to stay with Mary and her then husband.   When Peters we found out about their friendship and Mary eventually split from her own partner, the pair realised that fate had brought them together. Despite the unusual method of meeting and the -year age gap, the couple claim their shared sense of humour ensures they are well matched. Mary, from Newcastle, Tyne and Wear, said: It was fate that brought us together. When I first received Peters messages, I just ignored them - I had no idea who they were from. I was receiving messages in the early hours of the morning because Peter worked at a similar time to me and thought he was texting his we. Then one day I had the courage to say Im sorry, but I dont know who you are and he apologised. But we kept in touch on and off about our days after realising we both worked similar hours. We chatted about what was going on in our lives and eventually got round to talking about our relationships at the time.  It turned out Peter was having the same problems in his relationship too and we used each other as a backbone really. After over a year of texting and talking on the phone as just friends, Peter had a blazing row with his we and came to stay with Mary and her then-husband. Mary said: Peter came up for a couple of days after an argument with his we and he stayed at my house with me and my husband. Before he came to Newcastle hed only sent me one photograph of himself and his son at his wedding - thats all Id seen. But I knew he was in need and after talking to my ex-husband, he suggested he came and stayed with us. There was nothing romantic at that point. He tried to get his head together while I just got on with my normal routine. After Peter went back to his hometown of Bolton in March , he left his we a couple of weeks later and went to stay with a friend. In July, Mary left her husband and went to stay with her sister, while Peter decided to move up to Newcastle to be near her - although they insist they were only friends at this point.  It wasnt until later that year that the couples friendship evolved into something more as they helped each other through orces and decided to take a trip to Blackpool. On their , they finally decided to give their relationship a go. Mary said: We didnt decide what was going on until we went to Blackpool just to seewe could work as a couple. At first I thought the age dference would be an issue but it wasnt. We had a lot in common, the same sense of humour and most importantly I trusted him to keep me safe. Its been a lucky escape to a better place. People are always so shocked when we tell them how we met. Theres a girl at work this week who asked Peter - she couldnt believe it. In , after  years together, Mary and Peter finally married at a low-key ceremony surrounded by close friends and family. Mary said: Everything was lovely. I didnt have a new dress - I had a dress that had been made for me previously. Peter had a kilt from his first wedding so we had that all dismantled.   I made the flowers myself and all the button holes for the men. I also made my own wedding cake. Our wedding song goes back to the time we actually met - it was Daniel Bedingfields I Will Never Leave Your Side. Peter, who now works at the same supermarket as Mary in Newcastle, split up with his we after she reportedly became jealous of their friendship. He believes they grew together because of their shared sense of humour and similar experiences. Peter said: Id just bought a new phone so was saving my ex-wes number, but must have typed in the wrong digit. There was one number dferent between my we at the time and Marys numbers. Id sent a few messages and Mary eventually messaged back explaining Id got the wrong number. She explained who she was but I didnt mention it to my we because we were going through a bad patch. From the same day we started talking to each other. It was a case of messaging back and forth then. Eventually, my we found out about Mary but I was still keeping in touch and ringing her. She didnt like that - you can understand why. One day it just got too much and I left. I had to find somewhere to live. I had to sleep on my friends sofas for a couple of months until I could move up to Newcastle. I soon had a job lined up though and in July  I moved up there. I was in the flat for about  months until  when Mary and I got a house together. Weve got the same sense of humour and in the early days we could talk about the things that were going on in our lives. Thats how we grew closer.

The phenomenon will see the moon come closest to the Earth during its monthly elliptical orbit, and as a result will appear much bigger and brighter than normal. Weather forecasters have warned that cloudy and overcast conditions on Tuesday could leave many stargazers disappointed, particularly in Scotland and the north of England. Some of southern England will remain clear and dry, meaning it may be the best place to see the so-called Super Snow Moon . Emma Smith, from the Met Office, told the Mirror: Rain coming in from the west will make it a wet day for many access the UK. It really will be quite overcast tonight although there may be some breaks in clouds for those on the south coast.  There will be persistent rain in northern England, Scotland and Wales with heavy downpours of up to mm in higher areas. The Met Offices forecast added: After a chilly start there will be sunny spells for many. Dull, wet and windy weather will develop over Northern Ireland though, spreading into Scotland, northwest England and Wales later. It will be wet and windy at times across the north. For southern areas it will stay dry though, with some clear spells in the far south.  ASupermoonis a celestial wonder because it is when the moon can appear nearly % brighter and almost % larger than a typical full moon, said Slooh astronomer Dr Paige Godfrey. It is one of the few nights a year when people really notice the full moon rising. The Moons closest approach will bring it within , kilometersof the Earth, otherwise known as perigee. Thats about , kmcloser than it was two weeks ago, during the apogee, when it was , kmfrom the Earth.  During theSupermoon, the effects of the moons gravitational pull on the Earth’s oceans will be more pronounced, generating higher than normal high tides, known as Spring Tides. In early Native American tribes, the February full moon was known as the Snow Moon because the heaviest snow fell at this time of year. It was also sometimes called the Hunger Moon, because the snow made hunting dficult, or the Crust Moon, because the snow cover becomes crusted from thawing by day and freezing by night. The more northern tribes of the north eastern United States knew it as the Crow Moon, when the cawing of crows signalled the end of winter.

Tara Gratton, , claims doctors were baffled by her partially formed vagina before she was diagnosed with Mayer-Rokitansky-K ster-Hauser syndrome . Its a congenital disorder that affects the female reproductive system. After being diagnosed with the most severe form aged , the support worker was told she had no vaginal tunnel, no womb, no cervix, no fallopian tubes, and only one kidney. Tara was left devastated after realising shed never be able to carry her own child but after meeting partner, Stuart Pretswell, , the couple began researching their options.   She opted to have her vaginal tunnel rebuilt through using her bowel as a teenager and is now on the waiting list for a womb transplant - with the couple now hoping, through using her own eggs, theyll be able to start their own family. Tara, from Stakeford, Northumberland, said: At  years old I was diagnosed and had my first surgery so Id be able to have sex as an adult. I had a vaginal tunnel built from my bowel as only part of my vagina had formed properly. My surgery was a risky one as it involved using two inches of my bowel to create a new tunnel opening. I was really young but naturally I was embarrassed about my condition back then as it was so rare. Since then I have met my partner, Stuart, and were desperate to have a family after meeting four years ago.   I dont have a womb so the next surgery I need is a womb transplant. It would be amazing to have our own family to show others anything is possible.

She added: My parents had originally taken me to the doctors when I was three, as I kept having kidney infections and nothing seemed able to stop them. I spent a long time in Newcastle Childrens Hospital and with antibiotics, it was eventually managed quite well. It took them a long time to discover what was actually causing all my problems, and doctors even said, it was the first time theyd ever seen a girl like me.  Tara decided to have the invasive vagina surgery at  to give herself a normal future. She added: After the surgery I had to have lots of dilation therapy - which essentially stretched my vagina. Doctors thought I didnt have any oies but as I grew older, I discovered that they were wrong - I did have oies which meant it was possible for me to have children - but I would have to go through IVF and alternative routes. After finding her current partner Stuart, also a support worker, Tara was open about her condition and together theyre excited about the prospect of starting a family together. Tara has since applied for the womb transplant trial, that has only recently become a viable option. The first baby from a womb transplant from a deceased donor was born in December of last year. However, with a long waiting list, Tara is also looking into surrogacy as a possible path. Tara said: We have two embryos in storage and are raising money to cover any potential costs from surrogacy. Now I want to help others like me by speaking out. It took me a long time to get a diagnosis, and to find help - but with more awareness, more support could become available. Tabitha Taya, founder of LivingMRKH, one of the UKs only support groups, said: We first met Tara back in  after she reached out to us after she read our LivingMRKH founders story in a daily newspaper. It is now a pleasure to work with her in sharing her message to help others. We have since got to know Tara through several social gatherings held to support those living with this condition. We all have dreams and aspirations, to be a mother is one of Taras and we wish her and her partner all the very best. The road to parenthood for those with MRKH can be challenging, but not impossible, its important to remember the condition does not define us and there are options available to make our journey a little less stressful and isolating. We hope Taras courage to share her journey provides hope and inspiration to our fellow community.

Nicole Knight, , from Queensland, Australia, goes into chef mode every Sunday as she plots the familys eating plan for the week ahead.The mum, who shares her tips with , Instagram followers, boxes up a iety of meals for her partner Adam and two-year-old son Aspen, the Daily Mail reports.And Nicole claims she creates the full eating plan - and does the rest of her shopping - for around pound-pound each week.  This includes the items needed for little girl Zephi, who is still too young to eat her mums meals. Nicole has a couple of tips for anyone who wants to start weekly prepping. She recommends keeping the number of dferent dishes you create to a minimum at first. And one time-saving hack is to cook bigger portions at dinner so any leftovers can be boxed up for the next day. When it comes to saving money and packing each dish full of healthy vegetables, Nicole has a few favourites.   She leans towards pasta bake, Sheppards pie, lasagne and spaghetti bolognaise because she can hide lots of veggies in them. Nicole said she started prepping in huge volumes because she wanted to take control of what her family were eating. She added: Generally on Sundays I like to plan my meals and write a shopping list accordingly. I then either shop at a fruit and veg store, butchers, markets or your typical grocery store.   Once home I write a list of what I need to do whilst prepping. I try to write this list in order, for example each element in the meals like cooking rice pasta or preparing certain meats. I either find recipes online or use my own. I ide the meals into containers once cooked and store them accordingly . Most meals last - days in the fridge depending on their contents.

For those not aware, charcoal face masks are used to help improve skin by unclogging pores and the product is black in colour because the main ingredientalso happens to be black.The mask is applied to the face, left for a while to dry, before being peeled or washed off. The argument around the product began several days ago with a tweet by a woman named Nicole Oliver, who wrote: Racism is so insidious that you can promote blackface for years under the guise of pore mask and it goes unchecked. She added the hashtags #blacklivesmatter #StayWoke #BIORE #poremask and #Blackface to her post as well as several examples of the charcoal masks being sold online.   Her tweet garnered a lot of attention, with more than  people responding to her words. Many thought she was being ridiculous and told her so. One person replied: Is this satire or stupidity  A second said: Umm. They dont make Caucasian charcoal...   People like you are the reason civilisation cant advance, added a third. Despite this, Nicole wasnt the only person to think negatively of the masks and liken them to blackface. A dferent user wrote: White women love self care and doing casual blackface with charcoal face masks. Another asked: Arent we ever going to address how the charcoal mask takes blackface up to    You put it on, it looks really racist, then you pull of the black to get flawless skin.The backlash surrounding charcoal face masks comes after designer fashion brand Gucci were criticised for making a balaclava jumper that resembles blackface.The pound black balaclava-style jumper, part of the autumn winter  collection, is designed with a high neck and red outline around the mouth.One Twitter user spotted the jumper and shared photos of the item on social media, writing: Balaclava knit top by Gucci. Happy Black History Month y’all.The tweet went viral after being shared around , times, with Gucci facing a flood of criticism from social media users. The high fashion brand was slammed by people accusing the high fashion brands knitwear piece of being racist, disgusting and unacceptable. Gucci has since issued an apology statement on social media, and said the brand has removed the item from its online and physical stores.

Now it’s a question of getting settled in as quick as I can and just playing football,” he said.“I had obviously spoken to Derek McInnes and he said to speak to Jim McIntyre before making any decision.“The gaffer at Aberdeen left it up to me.“He told me he’d love to have me still up there butI wanted to go and get games he understood.“So I spoke to the gaffer here on the phone and I loved everything he had to say. I jumped at the chance to come down here.”And the -year-old sees the draws against Hamilton and Kilmarnock since he arrived as proof this is a squad that can pull away from the relegation zone between now and the end of the season.“The only frustrating thing for me so far is that we’ve not taken six points out of six from the two games I’ve been involved in but I think all the fans and us as a team can feel from those performances that we are building momentum.“In the Hamilton game it was a case of everyone trying to get used to each other. A lot of us had only come in right before the deadline and we only really had one training session together.“It was about trying to get to know everyone’s games, their personalities. I think we are all starting to gel now and you can see that on the pitch.“Not having a game last weekend because we’re out of the cup has given us a bit more time to work on that. That gives us a better picture going into the game against Livingston this weekend.”Today’s trip to the Tony Macaroni Arena to face Livingston is a meeting with a team who have taken the Premiership by storm this term but have been struggling for a win of late.Since thumping Hearts - in mid-December, Gary Holt’s team have not won in eight outings. Wright does not see that as a sign this could be an easy  minutes for Dundee.“We have to treat it that every game from now on is going to be a big game for us and this will be.“We know how Livi will be and they will work hard but all we can do is just prepare the way we want to and work on how we can play. Hopefully, that will be enough.“They haven’t won in a few games but it’s a testimony to Livi how many points they have. They started the season so well.”Today, of course, will see Dundee asked to play on Livi’s much-criticised plastic pitch.The debate over their use has surfaced again this week via the PFA canvassing their members for views on them. While Wright is very much in the camp that prefers grass surfaces, the articial surface is not something he’s going to gripe about.“All we can do is get on with it and we are not going to use the pitch as an excuse,” he added.“Playing in Scotland, you get used to them.“However, I think having everyone playing on grass is something that would benefit the top league.“You prepare for a team each week but, for these games, you also have to prepare for the pitch as well.“All we can do as players is give our opinion about them.”"},{"url":null,"title":"gomis set to take over as dundee united target hat trick of wins down at queen of the south","story":"Veteran Morgaro Gomis is set to take over in midfield when Dundee United try to make it three wins on the bounce as they head for Queen of the South today.The -year-old is expected to replace Calum Butcher, who will serve the first game of a two-match ban after his red card in the Scottish Cup win at St Mirren last weekend.His second game on the sidelines will be the cup quarter-final against Ross County or Inverness Caley Thistle which has been confirmed for Sunday, March  at pm.The game is also being televised live on BBC Scotland.As well as continuing their recent winning run, the Tangerines will be looking for their third success of the campaign over Queens.To do that, though, manager Robbie Neilson is well aware they will have to keep in-form home striker Stephen Dobbie quiet.His spectacular strike in the cup at Aberdeen on Sunday was the -year-old’s th goal in just  appearances this term.“He has been on fire lately and someone we will have to get to grips with,” said Robbie.“He has a lot of quality, he knows how to score goals.“He’s just a very good player and I think he has the freedom of Dumfries these days. He’s a god down there.”United have their own in-form attacker in the shape of Pavol Safranko.The Slovakian, who’s on loan from Aalborg, has hit the net three times in his last four games.That’s taken his tally so far to  goals and he’s scored on the two previous occasions he’s faced the Doonhamers.“We been playing well and we’re looking for that to continue,” added Robbie."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/5c6694df0b4f51.77481809.jpg ","title":"livingston may be off form but dundee boss jim mcintyre expects a tough test today","story":"Dundee boss Jim McIntyre is taking nothing for granted when his improving team face off-form Livingston at the Tony Macaroni Arena today.The Dark Blues head over the Forth on the back of displays against Hamilton and Kilmarnock that, but for injury time mishaps, would have earned six points instead of two.An injury-time equaliser cost victory at Accies while the chance to take maximum points against Killie last week slipped away when Kenny Miller’s penalty was saved in the fth minute of time added on.Now it’s on to Livi, who’ve not won since before the winter break but Jim believes Gary Holt’s team remain formidable opponents.“It’s natural that at some stage of a season you will have a dip and they’ve still had a brilliant season. They have some very good players,” he said.“The first thing we have to do is try to win our battles but don’t forget they have scored some quality goals, some good team goals.“We have to try to make sure inidually we get the better of them and try to go and create opportunities to win the game.”Dundee go into the clash with controversy over plastic pitches like Livi’s rekindled by a PFA survey showing top-flight players are unied in opposition to them.The manager is also in that camp but hasn’t forgotten that defeat at the Tony Macaroni in his first game in charge was down to what happened in the air and not the surface.That day back in October his team conceded four goals from set pieces.“We didn’t deal with set plays and that killed us. It was an eye-opener that day in terms of what we had to work with,” he said.“There’s no doubt, though, the surface is an advantage. I was the manager of a team, Queen of the South, who had an articial surface andyou train on it every day it’s a definite help.“At the same time I’m not trying to detract from how well Livingston have done because they’ve done exceptionally well.”Dundee are still nursing a few niggling injuries from that Killie draw, but it’s hoped everyone who was on duty then will be available.

Figures obtained by the Tele last year showed the council had cut street cleaning expenditure by % since .The annual budget – which covers work such as litter-picking, equipment maintenance and cleaning up graffiti and gum – has dropped from £. million to £.m in the last five years.The Tele took to the streets to ask a cross-section of people for their views.Catriona Simpson, , from the Hilltown, who works as a carer said: “I don’t think the streets are brilliant but around the city centre area is good.

Graeme Shinnie today accepted Aberdeen’s Pittodrie slump is concerning and demanded an immediate improvement at home.The midfielder was left “annoyed” after the Reds’ home hurt continued with a dismal - draw with St Mirren, the side rock bottom of the Premiership table.Aberdeen had to fight back from a goal down twice to salvage a point against a struggling Buddies side who had lost six straight league matches.Scotland cap Shinnie did not pull his punches in his indictment of both his own performance and that of the Dons against the relegation battlers.“Not good enough,” he admitted.However, the concern is that it was not a one-off at Pittodrie as the Dons have taken just two points from the last  at home.Sandwiched amid that run was a - Scottish Cup draw against Stenhousemuir, bottom of Scotland’s third tier.With a Scottish Cup quarter-final tie against either Rangers or Kilmarnock on March , fixing the home form is a matter of urgency.Shinnie said: “The home form has been annoying and it is something we have to deal with.“We have not been good at home since the turn of the year and that is something we have to put right.“The form and the way we have played in the home games has not been good enough.“Stenhousemuir came up and got a draw .“Against Queen of the Southwe scored good goals in the second half but I don’t think we played overly great in the game.“Normally our home form is strong but recently it has not been good enough and that is something we have to put right.”Prior to the recent slump, Aberdeen had only dropped eight points at home all season – in  Premiership matches.Now they have dropped  in the last four league matches at Pittodrie.In contrast, the Dons’ form on the road – six straight wins – has kept them within touching distance of second-placed Rangers and still in the cup.Dropping points to the league’s bottom side was damaging, but the Dons did not lose any further ground on Rangers, who drew - with St Johnstone.Shinnie said: “At this stage in the season this has been a missed opportunity, with other results.“We need to get back to winning ways.”Midfielder Shinnie was uncharacteristically despondent after dropping points to St Mirren. He also refused to trot out any excuses for the result.He said: “We weren’t good enough. We need to be so much better as St Mirren are bottom of the table. When you score two goals at home you should be winning against the team that is bottom of the league.“I am annoyed at our performance as the first half wasn’t good enough. We didn’t move the ball about quick enough. We were slack in possession, from me especially.“It is not aswe played well, missed some good opportunities and were frustrated.“Throughout the team we were slack with the ball and St Mirren were comfortable in the way we were lacklustre and tried to get the tempo up.“We said we needed that tempo before the game but we didn’t do it. In the second half we then lost another goal, which is annoying and not good enough.“After that we were fighting to try to get back in the game.“Although we got the goal back, it didn’t really salvage anything.“At this stage of the season chances don’t come around too often. If we want to challenge right at the top then games like theseare ones you need to be winning.”Aberdeen suffered further disappointment at the weekend when defender Tommie Hoban was stretchered off in the first half with a knee injury.The on-loan Watford defender, , twisted awkwardly when attempting to change direction.Hoban was sidelined for the entirety of last season following surgery on a cruciate ligament injury, although the injury sustained at the weekend is to the other knee.Hoban had only recently ed for the Dons having been absent for five months following shoulder surgery in August.Shinnie said: “I am gutted for Tommie. He had done so well to get back to being fit again.“He has had such a good couple of weeks’ training and you could see the buzz in his eyes to be back involved and playing again.“To see that was devastating and I feel bad for him. I wish him well in his recovery and hopefully he can bounce back again.”The future of club captain Shinnie remains unresolved as the midfielder is out of contract at the end of the season.Aberdeen have offered the -year-old a lucrative new deal.A number of Championship clubs including Wigan Athletic, Hull City and Brentford have been monitoring Shinnie’s situation.Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes confirmed he had held fresh talks with the midfielder recently and had not given up hope of retaining Shinnie.McInnes hoped to have clarication, one way or another, over whether Shinnie was staying either this week or next.After the disappointment of dropping points to St Mirren, Shinnie was in no mood to discuss his future.He said: “After a game like that I have no thoughts on my contract situation.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/MPU-offers.jpg ","title":"aberdeen recycling centre to reopen on saturday","story":"An Aberdeen recycling centre will remain closed for three extra days.Work got under way at East Tullos Household Waste and Recycling Centre on Monday February .mdash Abdn City CouncilFebruary , The essential work is now due to be completed by Friday.The centre will then reopen the next day."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 01","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe conditions being endured by refugees on a remote Greek island might seem of little importance to folk living in Argyll, but Pam Gregory spends time helping make their lives easier.More volunteers are desperately needed to assist as conditions worsen during the winter and Samos Volunteers would love to hear from anyone with the inclination to help.Pam#s dedication and the support of the Craignish community deserve great credit.

First performed in , Within This Dust has gone on to be staged all over the UK and internationally, including at the   memorial and museum.Especially inspired by Richard Drew#s unforgettable photograph, The Falling Man, Within This Dust details the experience of witness, Lisa Hood, and victim, Vince Virr, of the   attacks.The witness finds herself surrounded in dust, made of crumpled paper, and begins a grieving process of hunting through the papers, finding meaning in the words, as someone tries to tidy around her. The second act features the victim joining the witness, creating a connection that will inevitably be broken, when finally, in the third act, the victim is alone, caught between a choice of the smoke and fire within the collapsing building or the  metre drop to freedom.It was a very poignant performance, tenderly expressing the horror of the incident, perhaps now weakened due to overindulgence. When the lights came up everyone stayed where they were, perhaps a little too stunned to move. Chatter was in whispers, for respect to people who could not hear them.As the narrator of the show captured and pieced together from coverage of the attacks said, the dust has not settled, and never will. The losses of the people in the planes and buildings is still felt, and the wider western world is still wary, still learning, still recovering.Within This Dust manages to depict the horror of that day beautully, and more importantly, delicately. No easy task for a grieving world.PIC:Craignish Village Hall was full. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood amongst the #dust#. _aWithinThisDustDancer, Lisa Hood. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood collecting dust. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood and Vince Virr. _aWithinThisDustDancer, Vince Virr. _aWithinThisDustVince Virr facing the smoke, or the window. _aWithinThisDust"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll rugby fans form scotlands honour guard","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThree Mid Argyll-based girls were among those given the honour of forming the honour guard at Friday February #s Scotland v Italy women#s rugby game.Amber Russell, Drew Buckley and Anya Gritten travelled to Scotstoun stadium on Friday night with their Oban U teammates to form the honour guard for the Scotland women#s team as they took on Italy in the first game of this year’s six nations tournament.The girls formed a tunnel of Saltire flags for the teams to run through as they took to the field.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution.

The bunds will help reduce the risk of debris reaching the A in the event of a landslide.This project allows BEAR Scotland to maximise the benefit of recycling the material being excavated from the Rest and Be Thankful while minimising the overall cost of these works.To keep roadworkers and motorists safe throughout the works, temporary traffic lights will be in place on the A at each location. This next phase of the works is expected to last approximately  weeks.Commenting on the works, Eddie Ross, BEAR Scotland’s North West Representative said: #The installation of the next stages of the mitigation measures will provide more protection and resilience against any future landslips blocking this key route at both the Rest and Be Thankful and Glen Kinglas.#The temporary traffic lights are necessary to keep our teams as well as users of the route safe during the works, and the teams will do all they can to complete the project as quickly and safely as possible.#We encourage road users to plan their journeys in advance by checking the Traffic Scotland website for up to date travel information.#"},{"url":null,"title":"third sector interface launches new approach to service delivery","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Third Sector Interfaceis changing the way it supports all types of third sector organisations, including charities, social enterprises and community groups.Due to many people now finding information through digital means and the need for information and assistance to be accessible and consistent across the whole of Argyll and Bute, not just in the main towns, the organisation has launched a new website, argylltsi.org.The website, reflecting the TSI’s new corporate identity, contains a self-serve area allowing third sector organisations to find links to a whole iety of locally-based and more national resources that can support their development needs, as well as useful templates to use to run their organisations.The TSI will be growing and developing self-service over the coming months, with the site becoming a ‘one-stop shop’ for information that third sector organisations need to set up, govern and manage organisations – everything from how to start a social enterprise to raising funding from major donors.The TSI can also now be contacted through a central freephone number #   , available between the hours of am-pm, Monday-Friday.

Her conclusions drawn from experience was that when the monitors were around, there may have been unpleasant situations, but no tragedies. When there was no monitor around – clearly defined by their unorms – people died.Philippa had only been home for eight weeks when she spoke to the Justice and Peace Group, and she admitted that she was still processing the often brutal and violent scenes she had witnessed.

Arthur Street Kitchen applied for permission to host live al fresco entertainment in the town centre. But councillors worried about noise want to carry out a site visit before making a decision. The venue’s manager Andy McPherson said: “We would like to have entertainment for customers in the garden this summer.” He said the music would not be too loud as the business is aware of residents living in the Arthur Street area of the town. Appearing before the South Ayrshire Council licensing board, he added: “We are hoping to reinvigorate Arthur Street. It is starting to come to le again.” Board chair Craig Mackay said: “Noise is the main issue here. “We would be looking for a noise report.” Mr McPherson said it would be background music featuring a musician playing acoustic guitar, for example. Ayr manager John Neil told the meeting no noise complaints were made last summer. The restaurant and pub also want to have a large screen to show sport and films. Arthur Street Kitchen is based in the former West of the Moon premises and beside the Vinyl night club. Councillor Mackay said: “The West of the Moon was a family space. What you are proposing is quite dferent.” Mr Neil said Arthur Street Kitchen still caters for children.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13926204.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18355078.jpg","title":"ayr united 2 inverness 3","story":"NewsAyr United  Inverness : John Roberston hails Somerset Park among best grounds in worldThe Inverness gaffer was full of praise for the old fashioned surroundings as his side clung on in the face of a stirring fightback.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsNathan Austin puts Caley - up \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJohn Robertson hailed Somerset Park as one of the best grounds in the WORLD after Caley held off a storming Ayr fightback. Inverness were three up and on easy street after a crazy opening  minutes which saw United gt-wrap the game. But a Lawrence Shankland inspired comeback almost grabbed a share of the spoils for Ian McCalls title contenders. A relieved Robertson said: Had it finished - you wouldnt have been surprised. Somerset Park is one of these grounds that sucks you inyou give them a snf. Its a good throwback and their fans make it intimidating and a good atmosphere for teams when you lose a goal. Its brilliant...one of the best grounds in the world to come and play your football. In the past we might have lost a game like this so Im delighted.  Ayr knew a win here would take them top of the Championship and started well with Robbie Crawford missing a good chance in the first minute. But they soon hit the self destruct button as their defence went AWOL to allow Nathan Austin in for a double before Liam Polworth rammed home a third. The game looked over with barely  minutes on the clock and shellshocked Ayr took time to regroup. Coventry-bound Michael Rose rocked the post with a header before Michael Moffat drew a fingertip save from Cammy Mackay. McCall turned to the bench at half time and introduced top gun Shankland who immediately turned the tide. He set up Declan McDaid to haul Ayr back into the contest with a close range finish eight minutes after the restart. And a resurgent Ayr thought they had a penalty when Carl Tremarco appeared to handle in the box but ref Nick Walsh waved away loud protests. United continued to pour forward as the clock ticked down and Shankland set up a grandstand finish when slamming home a  yard free kick with five minutes left.  But their comeback proved too little too late as Inverness clung on. Ayr boss McCall said: Im just gutted. Weve conceded three goals and at least two of them were gted with just crazy defending.

His death revealed he had left his entire fortune in his will to his native town of Troon. His legacy would provide education awards and grants for the people of the town along with a new public school. As Marr’s train travelled north he decided to break his journey, to pay a visit to his sister in Girvan. He was close to his sister Helen and visited her often after her marriage to ColonelABGrant, owner of Killochan Castle estate at Girvan, who was also a senior partner in the firm of Grant Somerville  Co in London and was later ordained as Revd. Grant in the Church of Scotland. Marr had intended to spend part of his fortnight at Girvan but extended his stay to a month. Perhaps his change of heart was due to the widespread unrest taking place in Glasgow at that time. The January of  saw the so-called ‘Harbour Riots’, where racial confrontations were breaking out between black and white merchant seamen on the town’s quayside and spreading into the town. A four day General Strike was called for on January  and four days later George Square was crammed with tens of thousands of angry workmen. Crowds of unemployed men joined in the fracas for a  hour working week. As tempers flared the army was deployed, troops brought in tanks and armored vehicles to control the crowds. As tensions heightened it was not an environment travellers would want to find themselves caught up in. Eventually CK Marr left Girvan on Saturday February  for his onward journey north to his annual shooting and fishing break in Perthshire. As the train made its way towards the city he took ill with acute appendicitis. When taken off the train at the Central Station he was rushed to the Glasgow Nursing Home, but it was already too late as he tragically died in the operating theatre. There is little known of Charles Kerr Marr, despite having a successful career in the coal exporting business. Born on October , , at  Welbeck Crescent, Troon, he was the third son of Captain John Marr, master of the merchant ship ‘Reciprocity’, sailing between Troon and Canada. John Marr and his we Amelia had five children, sons William, John and Charles, along with two daughters, Helen and Amelia. Up to the age of ten, Charles attended the Parish School in Academy Street at Troon, going on to join his two brothers at Irvine Royal Academy to complete his education. On finishing his schooling, Marr was apprenticed at A  J Guthrie, Coal Agents at Troon Harbour. Unlike his brother John, who followed in his father’s footsteps to become a sea captain, Marr left home as soon as his apprenticeship ended, to work as a Commercial Clerk with Kitstons, Iron Merchants in Glasgow. Moving later to take up the position of cashier at Clyde Ironworks, only to leave a short time later to be manager of the firm of GrantSomerville  Co in London. The move may have been influenced by A B Grant, who was a senior partner in the company and married to his sister Helen. By the time he met his future we, some years later, there is no evidence as to when he moved back to Glasgow, or indeed any explanation found as to his change of occupation. Marr is recorded in the Scotland census of  as residing in Renfrew Street in Glasgow and again on his marriage certicate a year later, where he is also recorded as being employed as a Soft Goods Warehouseman.  Little is known as to why he left coal exporting to go into the Drapery business, or where he met and fell in love with his we Agnes Murray Kinghorn. However, Agnes’s father was a General Merchant, so it would seem likely he met her in his line of work. Charles and Agnes married on March ,  and set up home at Sutherland Terrace in Glasgow’s Hillhead. Unfortunately, after only  months of married le, Agnes tragically died of Phthisis Pulmonalis . She was just  years of age. Her death was a severe blow to Marr, leaving him brokenhearted and distraught, which had a profound effect on him. Shortly after he laid his we to rest, he had thought of going abroad to work, but instead accepted an appointment with Hull Blyth  Company of London. Within a year he was made a partner in the company when he developed the firm’s export trade. His work of establishing depots in numerous ports in the world gave him an opportunity to travel abroad, especially to China and Japan, where he found an interest in collecting oriental treasures. During his time with Hull Blyth the firm went on to become one of the largest shipping charterers in the UK. Charles Kerr Marr played a signicant part in the company’s worldwide success. Charles Marr moved to London after his we’s death, he never again owned a house. All his years in London, he alternated between two clubs, the Athenaeum and the Constitutional. The nearest he came to having a home was in his later years, when he rented two rooms in Camden House at Chislehurst in Kent, which was originally built for Napoleon the rd. Just being there helped him to relax and take up golf. He was reputed to be good company with a great sense of humour and well known to be very generous. Marr was a lover of the arts and music and in all that time he rarely spoke of his we, or of her death and he never remarried, even his closest friends assumed he was a bachelor. When he retired in  he spent a good part of each year fishing and shooting in Scotland. Two years before his untimely death, Charles Marr carefully drafted out his will in , leaving his entire fortune to the people of Troon and setting out the way it was to be carried out. Marr’s coal fortune legacy has given the town a magnicent architectural school building with playing fields the envy of the country. Marr College on its own is a fitting tribute to this man of extraordinary vision. By the time Marr College opened in  the school had attracted the most renowned academics to come and teach. It was the only grant aided school in Scotland that didn’t charge fees. A public school for every child of the town, had oak led class rooms, inlaid parquet flooring, Italian tiled corridorsa copper domed library, purple velvet drapes and teachers attired in flowing cloaks with mortar boards on their heads, this was seen by all to be a stunning,not magnicent, comprehensive school, deemed to be the best school in Scotland and envied by it. The CK Marr Educational Trust, the only one of its kind in Scotland, has provided awards or grants to hundreds of Troon students, of all ages each year. The addition of the MarrEducation Resource Centre in Troon Library, the only one then in Ayrshire, is a valuable educational resource for all who use it. Marr College and the CK Marr Educational Trust are a testimony to the wishes of Charles Kerr Marr and a fitting memorial to this great benefactor. He was buried beside his beloved we in CathcartCemetery in Glasgow. Over the past century the people of Troon owe a huge debt to custodians of Marr’s vision, the Marr Trustees, past and present. Over the decades the many Trustees, Boards of Governors and ious Clerks, Treasurers and Accountants, who have and still do today and for many decades to come, have successfully upheld the wishes of the town’s greatest ever benefactor and extraordinary visionary, Charles Kerr Marr.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnChurch of ScotlandUniversities and CollegesGlasgowEducationFishingArmed forcesLove and romanceSchoolsRenfrewTroonPerthshireGirvanAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"cinema set return prestwick after","story":"NewsCinema set forto Prestwick after  year gapReturn to the golden age of screen in PrestwickShareByStephen Houston:,  FEB NewsFriends of Broadway - they want cinema open again \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCinema made a boldto Prestwick for the first time in more than  years.

A number of venues in the Auchinleck area applied to open their bars for a tipple at am on match day as Talbot geared up to face Ayr. Licensing bosses at East Ayrshire Council knocked back the flurry of applications for early morning drinking before the January  showdown. Despite the historic nature of the sporting event, the department decided to maintain their stance on trying to clamp down on excess boozing during football. The East Ayrshire Licensing board depute clerk Stuart McCall told councillors it was important to maintain the standard policy and have consistency. He pointed to Celtic and Rangers matches as examples of tense clashes requiring robust licensing rules. Mr McCall said: “The standard practice is games start early and the reason for that is to limit the amount of alcohol supporters can have.” “We all know the outcome excess alcohol can have in certain circumstances.” Congragulating Talbot, he added: “We are all delighted to see the result. “The maintenance of the policy is important so we are not accused of favouritism.” Some venues wanted to offer breakfast to supporters. Auchinleck Talbot defeated Ayr by one goal to nil. Alcohol was not permitted inside the grounds and fans were told they would be refused entryintoxicated. However the licensing board made a slight concession for the Auchinleck Talbot versus Hearts game on Sunday, February .

This week he was continuing his latest community activity as a hand bell ringer at Cumnock Old Church. John, , said: “All I want is the best for Cumnock and we are so fortunte to have so many things going on now. “I just want to make it better than it is.” The Keir McTurk Memorial Committee chose John after “much deliberation” from all the nominations. Chairman Colin Chisholm said: “John is someone who prefers to work behind the scenes rather than be at the forefront. “But his efforts for the community have proved invaluable.” John, originally from Edinburgh, has freshly retired from the Crossriggs veterinary practice in the town. When he arrived in  it was chiefly large livestock but treats mostly small animals. His we Heather, also a vet, remains involved in the management and their son Iain, the third member of the Senior family who is a vet, runs the practice. John is a very active member of the Cumnock Action Plan Committee, in which he has reformed the Cumnock Gardening Club assisted living in the arrangements for the Christmas festival and was actively involved in the poppy display marking the centenary of the end of the First World War.

Cycling Without Age Prestwick is transforming lives of those with limited mobility in the area with their specially designed trishaw, a light three -wheeled vehcile with pedal used in Asian countries . The three-wheeled rickshaw is a little more than a ‘sofa on wheels’ as it is engineered to accommodate two passengers in the front and driven by a pilot in the rear. Those with mobility restrictions - old and young- can take a trip to the seafront, enjoy the Prestwick promenade views and have a good old natter. Now the community project, who’s base has been kindly gted by St Ninian’s Episcopal Church, are eager to find more volunteer pilots and those keen to get out on the trishaw. Chris Cheales, of Cycling Without Age Prestwick, said: “We now have two trishaws and we are in the middle of a training programme to help - people become qualied before starting the operation in spring. We offer two-hour sessions to two passengers and there is the opportunity to go for a drink, stop to chat, pet a dog or just enjoy the views. “We are looking for people with limited mobility who may or may not also struggle with loneliness and isolation and who would benefit from the freedom of feeling ‘the wind in their hair’. “Time is a wonderful gt to give anyone. The group hope to expand as the project grows and take their trishaws on tour to visit care homes in the area. Chris added: “We envisage days allocated to ‘user groups’, to include care homes, those recommended by Dementia Friendly Prestwick, retirement housing and local churches. “Trishaws are not cheap so we need ongoing help to keep all this on the road. “We are looking forward to another sunny summer and sharing the project with others.” The Prestwick Peoples Project has also benefitted those involved, helping volunteers flourish and gain confidence. Zara Crumlish has been a Young Ambassador for Cycling Without Age for six months.

abruptly, leaving the village and Upper Tweed area without a key community resource.\"Since then, Upper Tweed Community Enterprise, has been working hard to secure funds to buy and run the shop as a community enterprise.\"It is not just the board of UTCE but the entire local community that will rejoice to know that we have secured such a generous grant award from the Scottish Land Fund.ldquoThe sum awarded includes a substantial contribution towards the purchase of the shop and includes ringfenced funding for a staff position and essential repairs.The original village shop closed last March, resulting in the loss of five jobs and forcing villagers into a  mile round trip for basic provisions.Previous owner Rani Jolly sold up due to a ldquodesire to retire.The move prompted the community body, now UTCE, being set up to fill the gap.They put in an application to the Scottish land fund at the end of last year and are delighted to hear it has been successful.Upper Tweed Community Enterprise is one of seven groups across Scotland sharing in pound, of Scottish Land Fund cash.Minister, Cabinet Secretary for Land Reform Roseanna Cunningham said: ldquoToday marks an important milestone for the seven projects that have had funding approved by the Scottish Land Fund, enabling local residents to push on with their plans to acquire and develop vital local assets.A total of pound, of the Scottish Land Fund cash can be used towards the purchase price of the store, which has been agreed at pound,.And the remaining money will be used to assist with repairs to the building and the appointment of a professional shop development manager.The UTCE is currently raising the balance to meet the purchase price through a community share issue and a further funding application.Over  supporters of the village shop campaign have between them pledged almost pound,.It is understood thateveryone who has pledged buys their shares the UTCE will have sufficient funds to complete repairs to the building, buy new equipment, and then stock the shop.Previously named the Broughton Shop Development Group, the UTCE is authorised to raise money for the project locally through a Community share offer.Shares are set to to be launched on Monday, March  at an event in the Village Hall - and a pledge form can be found on www.broughtonvillagestoreThe position of shop development manager will be advertised shortly."},{"url":null,"title":"pet-of-the-week","story":"This weeks Pet Of The Week, from Borders Pet Rescue, is Starsky.The charity told us: \"Starsky came in

Now, with less regulation in place, there are thousands.’True to the name, Viola FC is a family-run agency # his son Johnny joined its ranks in early  # with their main work both in representing players coming to the UK, and ‘brokering’.John explained: ‘We mostly represent footballers transferring to the UK, while brokering involves working with clubs, players and other agents to help bring those players here.‘That said, we have done a lot of work in countries such as Brazil and China in recent years, where there is a huge appetite for football. You make valuable contacts and get to see some exciting players.’However, for John the image of the football agent thrashing out a lucrative deal for himself as well as for the player, fails to tell the whole story.He explained: ‘Of course working in football can be financially rewarding, but it’s a hard job. People think you’re just walking around in a suit with a laptop and phone, but so much goes into being a player representative.‘You need to travel a lot, and that means lots of airport lounges and hotel rooms.‘You’re working long days and doing lots behind the scenes, and all year round,  because that’s what it takes.‘The public see the excitement of the transfer windows on TV and then think that’s all agents do.‘If an agent does their job properly, they are available day and night, looking after the whole package for the player, like houses and children’s schooling.‘We’re more than a ‘necessary evil’, we do an important service for both the club, and the player.’Thinking about Campbeltown visits again, John brings up a memorable trip to the Wee Toon, where his son Johnnybecame an unofficial pool champ.John said: ‘My uncle John took us to the Commercial Inn to watch a game of football on the TV. Johnny was only young but he ‘won’ a pool competition in the pub.‘Of course, the adults had let him win, but he believed for about ten years he was the pool champion of Campbeltown!‘That’s just one but I have lots of good memories of visiting Campbeltown, and the surrounding areas, such as Machrihanish.#For me Kintyre is a special part of Scotland.’Reflecting on a career in football of more than  years, including representing many Celtic and Rangers players, his hunger as an agent remains.John, whose recent travels include talent-scouting missions to Portugal and Ghana, added: ‘I am blessed to do this job. I have made some great personal connections and am even godfather to some players’ children.I grew up in Easterhouse, and now I get to work with top players and managers, visiting great stadiums. It’s not bad to be able to say that.‘At the same time, I know I have worked hard for those opportunities and I don’t take them for granted.’John Viola with his son Johnny centre and former client, and now colleague, Craig Moore in Ghana."},{"url":null,"title":"young footballers saddled up for funds","story":"Last Saturday, in the Co-op foyer, players took half hour shts, on two bikes, to raise more than £, towards funds to compete in the three-day Edinburgh International Youth Cup in August.A Campbeltown and District Juvenile Football Association spokesperson said: #A massive thank you to Campbeltown Co-op for allowing us to use their foyer to spin our way to a massive £,..#Thank you to each and everyone of you who supported us and also the words of encouragement, which meant a lot.#CDJFA, supported by quiz queen Helen Gilchrist, will hold a Big Quiz Night, at Stronvaar Bowling Club on Saturday March  with a £ top prize.The evening#s entertainment will include a quiz, raffles and television show games.The young spinners from left are: Josh MacDonald, , John McTaggart, , Jack MacNab,  and Daniel McEachran,._cfootballfunds_CDJFA"},{"url":null,"title":"andrew mccornick re elected president of nfu scotland","story":"Having already led the union for two years, Dumfriesshire farmer Mr McCornick will now hold office for a further two years by which time he will have served the maximum allowed under the constitution of a pair of two-year terms.After a keenly fought election, the vote for the two vice presidential posts saw Perthshire farmer Martin Kennedy re-elected to serve alongside Charlie Adam from Aberdeenshire, currently Livestock Committee chairman.The unsuccessful vice presidential candidate was Ian Sands from Perthshire, who is chair of the NFUS#s Combinable Crops committee.Under the terms of the constitution, Mr Kennedy, as a serving vice president, will be seeking re-election next year, having already served as vice president for two years.Mr Adam, being elected to the position of vice president for the first time, will initially serve for two years before the post reverts to an annual election.After the election Mr McCornick said: #There are dficult and challenging times ahead but Martin, Charlie and I have been given a clear mandate by members to represent them and we are honoured to carry their message forward.#Throughout the protracted and frustrating Brexit process, NFUS has been crystal clear about its priorities and through our ‘Steps to Change’ work we have mapped out our thoughts on a new agricultural policy for Scotland.#I believe we have a top table team, which, backed by the members, staff and secretaries, has the vision to deliver on that.#Those who choose to seek office and represent fellow members in any capacity undertake a huge commitment and although missing out, I congratulate Ian for the part he played in a hard-fought campaign and the outstanding work he does in representing his sector.#NFUS president Andrew McCornick.

The doorsquocot is a clue that once a residence of some signicance stood here. It was called Dolphingstone Castle. Nothing now visibly remains of the castle, but around  years ago ruins were still to be seen.It was at one time an elegant mansion, but before that, on the same site, an older castle once stood ndash now all gone, and the structures of modernity are hemming in what is left of this ancient site. A wave of new housing laps at its walls to the west, the A traffic roars past on its south, and roads surround it on other quarters.One wondersthis small slice of East Lothian history will survive the developers. I hope it does. It is a small, historic fingerprint and gives a mysterious glimpse into our countyrsquos past, in an area now being carpeted with thousands of new houses.Earlier maps suggest that Dolphingstone Castle was surrounded by woodland. So perhaps the planting of a small wood or orchard within the old walls could create an island of both nature and history amidst the tide of urbanising development in this area.Up above on the ridge of Falside Hill to the south, the restored Farsquoside Castle looks down on the developments below . It sits like an eagle perched on a high ridge, observing the land below.How dferent the landscape it surveys would have been in  when, according to an old story, a small force of hand-picked warriors descended from the castle under the cover of darkness.It was just past midnight when they left, guided by a slither of moon. It was a raiding party, bent on revenge and heading for Preston Tower in what is now Prestonpans.Tradition tells us a feud had existed between the houses of Farsquoside and Preston for some years. The cause of the feud was the breaking down of walls between the two estates and the animals of each side grazing on the land of the other. Regular, and sometimes violent, clashes had taken place.But then Hamilton of Prestonrsquos livestock had been poisoned, or so it seemed. They had drunk from a burn which flowed from Farsquoside and it was assumed the water had been deliberately poisoned. Hamilton of Preston Tower, making no investigation, sent his men on a raid of violent retribution.Farsquoside Castle was attacked and blood was shed. This was the act which the select band of warriors who had set forth from Farsquoside were to avenge.In darkness, they filed down from the ridge on a path now known as Whinney Loan. This took them down to where the new houses are now being built on the southern edge of Wallyford.From here, great care was needed lest they be seen or heard. Dolphingstone Castle lay ahead and although their grievance was not with the occupants of Dolphingstone, early discovery could ruin the element of surprise.So the raiders veered north of Dolphingstone, by way of Prestoungrange, and at dawn, with the smell of the salt pans in their noses, they set about their vengeful work.Screams and running bairns alerted the occupants of Preston Tower. Armed men were ready, for this raid was expected, although not from this direction.The walls of Preston Tower held the attackers at bay but the people of the village suffered the worst of the slaughter. What senseless violence: neighbours separated only by the brae of a hill had been whipped up into a hateful frenzy against each other. Gradually the raiders melted away, back up the hill, with blooded swords.But hate builds on hate and the reckoning was not slow in coming. The very next day, Hamilton of Preston led a force westwards. It arrived by the walls of Dolphingstone Castle and then rounded past them to head up the hill towards Farsquoside, crossing where now the A speeds by.No attempt at surprise was required, this was to be an open fight. The Lord of Farsquoside had arranged his men along the top of the ridge, looking down on the approaching force of Hamiltonrsquos men. The order to charge was given and the men of Farsquoside poured down the slope.The leaders of both sides were in the thick of the fighting. It was the Lord of Farsquoside who fell, pulled from his horse and hacked to death by Hamiltonrsquos men.Seeing the death of their leader, the men of Farsquoside fled back to the castle. But the Lady of Farsquoside, in shock and rage at the death of her husband, rallied the men. She led them out of the castle in a furious charge as the sun began to set, forcing Hamiltonrsquos men to flee back to Preston.The battle, or skirmish as some would call it, was over, and the feud had reached its bloody climax. Soon after it was discovered an infectious disease had stricken the cattle, not poisoned water. Cattle on both sides had been equally affected. No one was to blame.How easy it had been to make enemies out of neighbours based on  assumptions. We are told Hamilton attempted to make amends. But the dead could not rise and the Lady of Farsquoside was said to be devastated at the loss of her husband. We can be sure others of lesser status suffered no less.This feud was over little remains to record it except tradition passed down, captured and retold by th-century writers such as P MrsquoNeill and Robert Seton, from whose works this account is garnished.Preston Tower still stands in Prestonpans, in a ruined but still defiant state. Farsquoside, much restored, is a visual delight still keeping watch atop the ridge. But only those feint hinds of Dolphingstone Castle remain, most of it lost to time and mystery just like the details of this story.But all the more reason to preserve and value them, I think."},{"url":null,"title":"betting-businesses-told-to-monitor-gambling-habits-of-people-on-benefits","story":"East Lothian Councilrsquos licensing board has approved a new gambling policy which puts the responsibility for policing the risks of betting in the hands of new licensees.Among the issues that new applicants will have to prove they have addressed before being given a licence will be monitoring ldquogaming trends that may reflect benefit payments, ldquoidentying and reporting attempts to launder money on premises and ldquoprotecting vulnerable people and those with gambling dependencies.Approving the new draft policy, which will govern the boardrsquos licensing decisions for the next three years, board members raised concerns about a lack of legislation to stophigh streets in deprived communities becoming lined with betting shops.Councillor Lachlan Bruce, Preston Seton Gosford ward member, called for current laws which prevent local authorities from refusing a licence to betting businesses because of overprovision to be changed.He said that it was impossible to walk down some town centre streets without being confronted by gambling premises offering promotions and deals.Mr Bruce told the meeting: ldquoThere are high streets in East Lothian where [betting shops] seem to be every  yards.ldquoThere is an issue where it is impossible to avoid gambling premises.The board was told that the Gambling Act  precluded using overprovision as a reason to refuse a licence for a betting shop.The councilrsquos new policy will put the onus for local risk assessments on applicants who want to open licensed gambling premises ranging from bookies to casinos, bingo halls, tracks and travelling fairs.Board member Councillor Jane Henderson, North Berwick Coastal, spoke of the dangers of gambling addiction, saying: ldquoGambling is an extremely destructive situation and sometime it does not get the headlines other things do.ldquoBut it crosses all walks of le and we, as a board and as iniduals, have a moral duty to recognise it is as much an illness as anything  and anything we can do to help should be taken very seriously.Councillor Willie Innes, council leader and Preston Seton Gosford ward member, cautioned that only a minority of people who gambled were affected by addiction and for others it was simply an activity they enjoyed.He told board members: ldquoWhen I first joined the council, gambling was a backstreet activity with premises down back alleys and it took us a long time to persuade the industry to come onto the high street.Mr Innes said that the new policy, which set out additional risk assessment requirements for applicants, sent ldquoa clear message to both the industry and those concerned about it."},{"url":null,"title":"prominent-cockenzie-campaigner-larry-tomlins-remembered","story":"Larry Tomlins, who was chairman of Cockenzie West Tenants and Residents Association, was involved in campaigns to reduce speeding and upgrade local park facilities in his community.The grandfather-of-two was an active supporter of the recent fight to implement speeding restrictions outside new housing at The Chimneys, Cockenzie, and helped oversee the trial and subsequent introduction of  miles per hourspeed limits in the Whin Park area of the village.Mr Tomlins, , grew up in Ayrshire and moved to Cockenzie more than  years ago, where he raised his family with we Ann.A consultant engineer, he ran his own successful business and still found the time to be an active member of his local community.He was a founding member of the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association, which helped improve Whin Park for local families.Ward councillor Fiona OrsquoDonnell said: ldquoLarry made a huge contribution to the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association and the wider community.

But spring still feels like a long way off.I crave it, not just because it makes the evening walks in the woods possible once more, but because of the beauty it s to the landscape.The land is still dormant, with nature seemingly sleeping. Itrsquos at this time of year that the ugly results of peoplersquos disregard for the land can be most clearly seen. Litter of all kinds lsquodecoratesrsquo the roadsides. In summer it is partly hidden as hedges, roadside bushes and grasses grow. But in winter nature retreats and exposes the extent of peoplersquos uncaring behaviour.I canrsquot understand it, I really canrsquot. Our country is so beautul, yet so many people just throw rubbish from their car window. Do they not see the results and feel a sense of shame and horror  In a country where we have the facilities to dispose of our rubbish, there is simply no excuse to trash our landscape like this.And in a time when there are cuts to vital services, councils having to pay money to pick up peoplersquos rubbish from the sides of roads is just another unseen effect. Itrsquos not just that itrsquos ugly to look at, itrsquos polluting our environment, killing wildle and leaving an appalling legacy for our children.And so as we set off last Sunday for a walk, the sight of litter strewn everywhere along the roadside was quite depressing. And my children noticed its ugliness too. ldquoWhy do people litter like this  I was asked by my five-year-old Skye, and to be honest I struggled for an answer.ldquoI really donrsquot know, but it must be because they donrsquot care.My daughter seemed forlorn at this reply as we drove past a mass of discarded fast food remains, plastic bottles, beer bottles, plastic bags and yet more fast food rubbish.But I wanted to lt her spirits and so told her we were going on a hunt for something beautul. We were on a snowdrop hunt! And so as we drove to our destination, I reminded them of my version of the old story:lsquoMany years ago, Snow had no colour. It felt ashamed and left out to be colourless, especially when the land was so beautully covered in flowers of all dferent colours.And so Snow asked the flowersthey would be willing to share just a little of their colour. First Snow asked the daffodils, who were a beautul yellow. But they said no, they needed all their colour for themselves.Then Snow asked the bluebells, who were a wonderful blue. But they said they were too small to share any of their colour.Then Snow asked the whin bushesthey could share some of their vivid yellow, and they said no because they needed the colour.Snow even asked the roses of summer, but got the same answer: no.Then Snow heard a small voice and looked down. It was a small white flower. We can share some of our colour, with you it said.ldquoBut you are so small and you need your colour for yourself, said Snow. ldquoYes, the flower replied, ldquowe are small and we need our colour, but there are many of us andeach one of us gives a little then we can give you enough colour.ldquoThat is very kind of you but I donrsquot want to ruin your beautul appearance, said Snow.ldquoDonrsquot worry, said the wee white flower, ldquowe can all take a little colour from the inside of our petals, so it will not be noticed that any white is missing.rsquoAnd so that is how Snow became white. And because of the kindness shown by this little flower, Snow agreed to share its name with it, and so they became known as snowdrops.Snow also shared its space with the wee flower, so snowdrops and snow are often seen on the ground together. Andyou look carefully inside the snowdrop, you will see the hidden part where the white has been scraped off to give to Snow.With the storyrsquos end we arrived at Smeaton Lake, near East Linton, our destination for the snowdrop hunt. Itrsquos such a beautul place where a planted wood stands guard by a lake created  years ago. The woodland here is possibly unsurpassed in East Lothian for the canopy of snowdrops it displays.Excited screams at small patches of the flower soon gave way to ldquowow, look as we reached the end of the waterside and a wood carpeted by the wee flowers.My spirits were lted as I watched my daughter carefully examine flowers for evidence they had shared their colour. She showed her wee brother the green strips inside, explaining that is where the white was shared from. Both were careful not to damage or pick the flowers, despite their desire to do so.ldquoWersquoll find some growing in a less happy place and take those ones home, I assured them.And so we eventually headed back, a delicious bowl of ice cream at The Goth in Prestonpans, accompanied by traditional music, the reward for a good dayrsquos hunting.That night my daughter was reflective. ldquoI wish people wouldnrsquot spoil nature, she said. I felt guilty shersquos only five, I thought to myself, and shouldnrsquot have to be concerned about such things at that age. Perhaps I should have kept my thoughts to myself.ldquoBut I wonrsquot, and Irsquoll tell my friends not to as well. Can you tell me the snowdrop story again  So I told her the story once more.She had one wee snowdrop in a bowl by her bed. We had found it growing precariously at the verge of the road, surrounded by litter, and she wanted to lsquosaversquo it. So we did, hopefully with roots intact.ldquoWell we will plant the snowdrop in the garden and perhaps we will have our own snowdrops next year! I said to her, and she was happy at this.I went downstairs as she slept. My thoughts and emotions flooded me. My anger and depression at the ignorant mess we are making of our planet was superseded by my daughterrsquos determination to make a small dference, just like the snowdrop in the story.And perhaps therein lies the true message of that old tale: a dference can be made,we all do a little, but do it together.The children are the future, but letrsquos not leave all our ugly mess and destruction to our children to deal with. Let us all do something small, as many already are, to change the way we behave and how we appreciate what we have been gted.For our childrenrsquos sake, I really hope itrsquos not too late."},{"url":null,"title":"county-team-conquer-kilimanjaro-in-memory-of-vera-cameron","story":"Dougie Cameron and daughter Laura-Jane were joined by seven other men and women in climbing Mount Kilimanjaro last week.The trek was the latest fundraiser in memory of Vera Cameron and in aid of Cancer Research UK.Laura-Jane said that her mum would have thought the fundraisers were ldquooff our heads but would be ldquoreally proud of their achievement, which takes the fundraising total to about pound,.She said: ldquoIt was a really tough challenge but the fact we were doing it for charity kept us going.ldquoAt the end of the day, it was for such a good cause and we wanted to get to the top and keep the sponsorship going.ldquoThe whole experience was totally dferent to what I expected.ldquoBeing over seven days, we have never done anything like that before and it was tough mentally and physically.ldquoWe had one goal ndash to get to the summit ndash and we ended up making lots of new friends and spent a lot of time with other groups.ldquoIt was a really good experience overall.Vera, of Macmerry, worked for East Lothian Council as a senior administrator in transportation.Dougie, who is site attendant at Kinwegar Recycling Centre in Wallyford, was joined by seven colleagues from the council on the memorable trip.Laura-Jane, , and her dad set off from Scotland on January  alongside Ray Montgomery , Paul Ritchie , Lorraine Faulds , William Kelley , Stuart Baxter , Rachael Cormackand Vanessa Sanal .The group began the trip up the near-,-metre-high mountain on the Saturday and reached the summit last Thursday.Then it was back down before flying home on Sunday and back to work on Monday.Laura-Jane, who works as a PR officer, said it was ldquosurreal to think that just a few days earlier she had been standing at the top of Kilimanjaro.Already, more than pound, has been donated to the good cause, with that figure set to rise to pound, when all the money has been donated and counted.Previously, fundraisers have completed a number of other challenges ndash although nothing on the scale of the latest achievement ndash in memory of Vera, who was  when she passed away from cancer in .The West Highland Way, which stretches from Milngavie to Fort William , and the Three Peaks Challenge, which sees the highest peaks in Scotland, England and Wales ndash Ben Nevis, Scafell Pike and Snowdon respectively ndash climbed have been completed.Laura-Jane, who lives in Tranent, said: ldquoI think my mum would think we were off our heads for doing what we have done but really proud of us.

Good riddance.To say This Week is past its sell-by date is an understatement. Launched in , it seemed fresh and quirky back then to have heavyweight Neil cosy up with a coterie of pals after dark to chat about political developments. Over the years, Michael Portillo and DianeAbbott,party rivals who had known each other since school, became the Richard and Judy of the show, giggling away with cheeky chappy Neil about the issues of the day under New Labour. It was all very self-congratulatory, a bit like the times themselves.Marianne Taylor: Onus is on men to stop abusing workplace powerSixteen years later, itrsquos not only the governing party that has changed. Over the years, as the issues being became more downbeat ndash the  financial crisis, austerity and now the Brexit crisis ndash the format looked ill-equipped to deal with the big questions. Most cringeworthy of all, however, was Paisley-born Neil himself.Donrsquot get me wrong, the aggressive, belligerent interviewing style he is known for had its place, certainly back in the alpha-male s and s when he was king of the jungle . But, as is the case with Humphrys, the increasingly arrogant behaviour on air and in public debate reveals a comically self-important figure who makes Alan Partridge look in touch with the times.Take his embarrassingly pompous monologue about the greatness of Winston Churchill on last weekrsquos show, following weeks of hysterical and pointless national debate about whether the wartime PM should be judged hero or villain. Casting himself as a cross between Margaret Thatcher and a s grammar school headmaster, Neil imperiously instructed us with a severe wag of the finger that Churchill was indeed the most heroic Briton that ever lived. Talk about condescending. And also plain bizarre.Why any BBC journalist would be allowed to showboat like this on live television is quite beyond me. But it just goes to show how unwieldy Neil has become. A couple of weeks earlier he had an equally cringeworthy on-air spat with left-wing columnist Owen Jones, who took him to task over his affiliations with the right-wing press. Surprise, surprise Neil did not take kindly to being put on the spot.Marianne Taylor: Onus is on men to stop abusing workplace powerAs to why he thought it was acceptable to take to Twitter and call respected Observer journalist Carole Cadwalladr, whose excellent work helped expose the Cambridge Analytica scandal a ldquomad cat woman, one can only surmise - rightly, it would seem - that he believes he should be held to dferent standards than other BBC journalists. He has refused to properly apologise for this blatant misogyny.Did this catalogue of awful behaviour have anything to do with him leaving This Week  Who knows. The BBCrsquos director of news, Fran Unsworth, says she is looking to ldquodevelop future projects with Neil. Well, wersquoll see.As for Humphrys, I donrsquot doubt that some will miss his Daily Mail-style sneering and harrumphing on Today at any societal development that wasnrsquot around in his day, his astonishing insensitivity when discussing sexual crimes and the unequal pay of his own female colleagues, his terrible condescension when interviewing young peopleand ethnic minorities, but I certainly wonrsquot. The way in which he has approached Brexit, meanwhile ndash suggesting truculently to the Irish foreign minister recently that Ireland should leave the EU and ldquothrow in their lot with the UK was a particular low point ndash has led many people, me included, to switch off.Irsquom not saying for a minute BBC journalists shouldnrsquot be robust in their questioning, and there are plenty, both male and female ndash Kirsty Wark, Gary Robertson, Emily Maitlisand Nick Robinson spring to mind ndash who can incisively demolish the arguments of those in power.But punching down and wearing prejudices on your sleeve is not only editorially questionable, leaving the Beeb open to accusations of bias, but also astonishingly arrogant.And here we come to the crux of the matter: Neil and Humphrys have had their day. They have worn their arrogance and male privilege as a badge of honour for too long, lacking the humility or self-awareness to examine their own behaviour. Put them out to pastureso they can moan away till their hearts content, perhaps even to each other, about how hard done by they are, how it wasnrsquot like this in the old days.As research highlights, the BBC is losing younger viewers and listeners in their droves.

stunned the Democratic establishment in  with his spirited challenge to Hillary Clinton.While she ultimately became the partys nominee, his campaign helped lay the groundwork for the leftward lurch that has dominated Democratic politics in the Trump era.The question now for Mr Sanders is whether he can stand out in a crowded field of Democratic presidential candidates who also embrace many of his policy ideas and are newer to the national political stage.That is far dferent from , when he was Mrs Clintons lone progressive adversary.But there is no question that Mr Sanders will be a formidable contender for the Democratic nomination.He won more than  million votes in  and dozens of primaries and caucuses, and opens his campaign with a nationwide organisation and a proven small-dollar fundraising effort.\"Were gonna win,\" Mr Sanders told CBS.He said he was going to launch \"what I think is unprecedented in modern American history\": a grassroots movement \"to lay the

Concord.\"But I will tell you Im not a democratic socialist.\"Senator Elizabeth Warren, of nearby Massachusetts, will be in New Hampshire on Friday.One of the biggest questions surrounding Mr Sanderss candidacy is how he will compete against someone like Ms Warren, who shares many of his policy goals.Ms Warren has already launched her campaign and has planned an aggressive swing through the early primary states.Shortly after announcing her exploratory committee, Ms Warren hired Brendan Summers, who managed Mr Sanderss  Iowa campaign.Other staff from Mr Sanderss first bid have also said they would consider working for other candidates in .The crowded field includes a number of other candidates who are likely to make strong appeals to the Democratic base, including Ms Harris and senators Cory Booker, of New Jersey, Amy Klobuchar, of Minnesota, and Kirsten Gillibrand, of New York.The field could also grow, with a number of high-profile Democrats still considering presidential bids, including former vice president Joe Biden and former Texas representative Beto ORourke.While Mr Sanders had been working to lay the groundwork for a second campaign for months, it was unclear whether he will be able to expand his appeal beyond his largely white base of supporters.In , Mr Sanders notably struggled to garner support from black voters, an issue that could become particularly pervasive during a primary race that could include several non-white candidates.Last month, he joined Mr Booker at an event in Columbia, South Carolina, marking the Martin Luther King Jr holiday.In , Mr Sanders lost the South Carolina primary, which features a heavily black electorate, by  points.Mr Sanders also faces dferent pressures in the #MeToo era.Some of his male staff and supporters in

campaign.Politico and The New York Times reported several allegations of unwanted sexual advances and pay inequity.In an interview with CNN after the initial allegations surfaced, Mr Sanders apologised but also noted he was \"a little busy running around the country trying to make the case\".As additional allegations emerged, he offered a more unequivocal apology.\"What they experienced was absolutely unacceptable and certainly not what a progressive campaign - or any campaign - should be about,\" Mr Sanders said on January  on Capitol Hill.\"Every woman in this country who goes to

The team is both proactive and reactive in its mission to keep Scotland’s roads moving – planning for issues it can see coming and responding quickly to those that it can’t.Partnerships play an essential role in the day-to-day operations here.For example, we’re sitting in the resilience room where Transport Scotland, the Scottish Government agency which oversees our transport industry, meets during major crises, such as the Beast from the East.It is here, too, where action plans are drawn up to cope with major events on the annual calendar or roadworks on vital routes.A Police Scotland officer is based in the centre at peak times, along with Traffic Scotland’s media officers who Tweet updates throughout the day and INRIX, a radio team which transmits travel updates, both on the website and to most of our radio stations.From September to April, a MET office employee is also based in the centre.But Traffic Scotland has many more partners behind the scenes too.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fetoday webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"It looks likely that the council will raise the areas Council Tax rates by three per cent\"  Counterfeit cash alert after incidents reported in Fe viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FFPL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FFPL | Article Teaser\"Stein explained: “We work closely with event organisers to ensure people get to the Open or Royal Highland Show with as little disruption as possible, particularly when two major events are on at the same time.“We also work with the road operating companies, Freight Haulage Association and public transport providers, such as Abellio Scotrail. We co-ordinate road and rail works to minimise the impact for commuters and the Scottish economy.”With all of the country’s roadside SOS calls also being answered at the centre, there are few down times.It’s a round-the-clock job and often a tough one, with operators witnessing incidents that take a toll.Even Stein, despite his many years in the job, isn’t immune.He explained: “Operators can take a call from someone saying they’re going to jump off the Erskine Bridge, pan the camera round and see them jumping. That can really stay with someone.“One that sticks in my mind was an accident at Charing Cross in Glasgow.“The car was a mess and as we panned the camera round we saw a child’s car seat, empty, on the road.“The room fell quiet but nothing was said. Later on, the police told us there were no fatalities and no children had been hurt – the sense of relief here was amazing.”Staff have access to counselling, should they need it as a result of anything they’ve witnessed.But you get the sense of a camaraderie among the team too which undoubtedly helps get them through the tough days.Last February and March, the Beast from the East proved a real challenge – some operators didn’t make it home for days, while others couldn’t make it in.Stein was at the helm through it all, steering the ship through the worst road conditions witnessed in Scotland in a generation.He said: “It was pretty bad in  but the Beast from the East is the worst weather I’ve ever experienced.“Usually, we can marshall maintenance teams and gritters from one part of the country to help in other areas hit by severe weather. That just wasn’t possible. “I was camped out here for five days, as was Humza Yousaf, the then transport minister. The operators couldn’t get home either so they just got on with the job, like they always do.“It was the first red weather warning in Scotland – everyone learned from it.”A Hilltip Icestriker from Finland is now being trialled on the M to ensure recovery teams can access incidents and an electric powered spreader has been deployed on the M.As for daily operations, the public also has an important role to play.“We have just over  CCTV cameras on km of roads,” said Stein. “It’s not a lot to cover such a large area.“So the public are often our eyes and ears, alerting us to breakdowns so we can send out a recovery team.“We get a lot of thank you letters as a result.”Those worried about big brother watching need not fear either.Stein added: “We don’t record number plates or incidents, unless the police ask us to.“So while we get a lot of requests, we can’t help solicitors looking for accident recordings – we don’t have them.”Crossing over the Forth is now far more reliableTraffic Scotland’s National Control Centre was opened on April , , by then depute first minister Nicola Sturgeon. Also used as a contact and education centre for pupils to find out more about the £. billion Queensferry Crossing, thousands of children visited to get a bird’s eye view as the project unfolded. At . miles , it is the longest bridge of its type in the world and also the tallest, towering mhigh. But has it eased congestion for those travelling along the east coast artery between Fe and Edinburgh According to Traffic Scotland statistics, the crossing is very much doing the job it was intended for.Since September , there have been  occasions when the Forth Road Bridge would have been closed to high-sided vehicles due to high winds.Wind shielding on the new crossing enabled it to remain open, affording far more reliability for commuters and hauliers who regularly use it.The hard shoulder on the new bridge also means there are no longer lane closuresvehicles breakdown along its span.Stein said: “The crossing’s improved reliability is delivering benefits not only for commuters but for businesses and the wider Scottish economy too.”"},{"url":null,"title":"crossing borders with your dog after brexit","story":"A.

He said some areas of the town, such as Shore Street and Upper Ormlie, had been designated as one-way streets some time ago but this had not been implemented. \"That needs to be corrected,\" he said at Tuesday nights meeting.Mr Potts and other community councillors felt something had to be done to address the issue of speeding and one suggestion was for more sleeping policemen to be installed in problem areas of Thurso.Councillor Rosie, who represents Thurso and Northwest Caithness on Highland Council, said what is needed is a transport review which can take a comprehensive look at the issue. \"We need a strategic look at the whole thing ndash something which covers transport management and pedestrians,\" he said.However, community councillor and former police officer Bert MacLeod urged caution. He said: \"You need to be careful you dont go overboard with this  mph limit. Modern cars can stop quicker than vehicles did in the past. We need to be sensible.\"Mr Potts claimed \"some of the driving in Thurso is abysmal\".Mr MacLeod replied: \"Why should you and I be affected because someone drives like an idiot \"He also pointed out there are problems with installing sleeping policemen on roads. New laws have been introduced as cars have been damaged by them, he said.\"It is not just a case of putting them down,\" stated Mr MacLeod.

We have been calling for more parking enforcement in Wick for a while now.\"High Street and Bridge Street are far too regularly packed with cars parked where they shouldnt be. Its an issue that has been raised time and time again by both drivers and pedestrians. Some people think they are above the rules and for too long theyve got away with it.\"He added: \"Under the current proposals Bridge Street and much of High Street will essentially become double yellows, meaning no parking at any time. This should also help stop the constant issue of people selfishly parking in areas like the Market Square.\"The parking bays there are intended only for those who are disabled badge holders but these rules are often ignored by people who just canrsquot be bothered walking.\"Councillor Sinclair said the order would give council officers the power to enforce parking restrictions once they receive the required training but, initially, existing enforcement staff would carry out the work.\"We should expect a much more regular presence than under the old system,\" he said. \"The discussions Irsquove had with the officer responsible for parking have been extremely encouraging.\"Having an enforcement officer in the town for regular and random visits is a great start butthe situation doesnrsquot improve we will still be pushing to get someone in this post locally to clamp down on rogue drivers.\"He explained that in Inverness several council employees have been trained to undertake parking enforcement duties as well as their day-to-day jobs. \"There is no reason why the same couldnrsquot be done up here. If these orders get the go-ahead, and I am confident they will, then I hope we will begin to see a dference in peoples behaviour.\"The Caithness civic leader, Councillor Willie Mackay, also backed the plan. \"It is a fantastic idea but it is the enforcement that is the key to the success of this,\" he said. \"If we can get enough staff trained up to act as traffic wardens ndash and I am pretty sure we can ndash then their presence will deter bad parking.\"Parking in the centre of Wick has been a contentious problem for some time and has often been raised by the local community council and others.

This was despite the fact that the name and address of the person they needed to contact — his mother Edna — was engraved on the memorial.#Vandals couldn#t have done a better job,# he said.Following this wave of public concern, OIC convener Harvey Johnston and chief executive Alistair Buchan have now released a statement apologising for the concern and upset that this project has caused.#Following a tragic accident involving a young child at a Glasgow cemetery, the Scottish Government asked councils to carry out detailed inspections in the interests of public safety,# they said.#We therefore engaged in the kirkyard safety programme for all the right reasons, but recognise that the process we have followed needs to be improved. It was never envisaged that the resulting work would leave kirkyards in the condition they are in. We are sorry about the concern and upset this has led to.#As a caring organisation, responsive to public concern, we will restore kirkyards to the condition people would expect. We will also consider how best to contact and discuss the remedial work required with those concerned. People’s safety is an important concern for us and we will continue to carry out headstone inspections.

Known today as Rae Strait, it was the missing link in what would become the first navigable Northwest Passage.He also reported back on the ill-fated Franklin expedition, reported evidence of cannibalism — findings which were effectively rejected by the then establishment, and which led to Rae#s achievements being almost completely ignored.The modern-day team, who hope to raise further awareness of these achievements, will be led by Scottish-born and Canada-based expedition leader David Reid, with Scotland also represented by Broxburn-based former Royal Marine Richard Smith.The team will also include two Canadians — adventure film-maker Gerry Tutte and adventurer Frank Wolf.Over  years later and supported with modern-day kit from outdoor specialists Tiso, the explorers are hard at work preparing for the physical and mental challenge of hauling kg sledges for nine hours daily and for up to  consecutive days.Their route will cover undulating, windswept tundra, river valleys and sea ice during what can be the coldest time of year.The Arctic expedition will finish once the four explorers have finally reached Gjoa Haven on King William Island.Mr Smith said: #The Arctic Return expedition will be extremely tough but ultimately our aim is to raise awareness fo the exploits of John Rae and to help restore his rightful place as one of the greatest Scottish explorers in history. It is also our hope that this awareness will inspire the public to support fundraising efforts by the John Rae Society, to restore Rae#s birthplace at the Hall of Clestrain in Oprhir.The team have said any addition funds raised are to be used to produce a documentary film and book about the le and exploits of Rae, the expedition and the history communities, culture and wildle of the Arctic.The public will be able to track the team#s progress at their official website and through social media.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

These include:* A possible community buyout of the Black Isle Leisure Centre run by High Le Highland for Highland Council.* Appointing a business consultant to update the  business plan and probe funding applications.* Appoint a design team by competitive tender to revise the building plans and invite tenders.It was noted that the Black Isle remains a growing area with future housing and an expanding population.While a lottery bid for pound million towards the estimated poundm cost of the scheme failed back in , negotiations with the Scottish Land Fund via Highlands and Islands Enterprise to consider developing the project as a community enterprise company have continued.Mr Sinclair said: \"A unanimous positive attitude was evident at the meeting which allows further progress to be made to develop this very important project for the benefit of folk on the Black Isle and beyond.\"A follow-up meeting is planned later this month.Whats your view  Email newsdesk@spp-groupTuesday  Feb  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Basically, we need to get a grip on our expenditure. As a result we have been examining every budget line and turning over every stone, to make sure that we are getting the best results from the resources being used and challenging where performance can be improved.ldquoIf you always do the same things in the same way, you will get the same results. It is time to change how we do things and so this is a budget for change.\"The change fund is an exciting element of our budget strategy and will underpin our programme of change over the coming year.Council leader Margaret Davidson said: ldquoThis is a decent, thoughtful and ambitious budget which will help move us into the future, protecting jobs and services.\"It aims to set the council on a journey of much needed change. We are all ambitious for improvement and what has struck me is the huge buy-in from all staff in challenging circumstances.ldquoThis budget will enable us to be sustainable and I am really confident that we have the necessary knowledge and expertise in our top team to take forward the change programme that is required.Chief executive Donna Manson added: ldquoThis budget process has been about us being connected. Connected to our communities, to our staff, to our partners, to each other ndash building relationships and enabling better conversations and improved understanding.ldquoI really appreciate the input from staff across the organisation during the whole engagement process, and for some really honest feedback. I am equally delighted with the really positive engagement across the political groups.ldquoWe need to manage all our resources, to redesign, to become more resilient, to be more efficient, to invest in our workforce and to plan for the future. We need to embed effective performance management and effective scrutiny.ldquoThe Corporate Plan will be coming to council in March and this will focus on scrutiny and driving performance.

It was a beautul thing and I cherished it for years. But I remember one of the strange things about that Christmas was going back to school.It must have been primary  or , and we had a group discussion in class about what Santa had brought us all.At the time, I wondered why so many of my classmates had asked for what I innocently termed “boring” things, like a new coat.Years later however, when Christmas began to bite into my own budget, I realised that my child’s vision of the world had not seen the real signicance of the gts.I do not come from a particularly well-off background.For the first decade and a half of my le we lived in a house rented from the housing association.We didn’t have a lot but I had both a new coat and a bike that year.I’m not sure but I think that memory had a lot to do with my recent determination to be my party’s spokesperson on the Department of Work and Pensions .Oh some witty person – probably one of my sisters – will say it’s more to do with me getting closer to my pension.But as any WASPI woman will tell you, that’s not as close as it used to be, which is an argument for another day.No. Every week constituents come to me who have been given what can best be termed as “the run around” by some section of the DWP.: Amber Rudd: Families on universal credit did have to use food banksIt could be pensions, it could be Universal Credit or it could be the system of Personal Independence Payments for those with a disability which, as assessment systems go, is not fit for purpose.In every one of them, I see someone who deserves to be treated better.In each case I’m reminded that in this, the fth richest nation on earth, there are still people for whom le is a daily economic challenge.And what we often overlook is that the majority of those who find themselves facing an uphill financial struggle are already working for a living – the ‘just about managing’ to whom Theresa May promised so much in her first speech as Prime Minister.In a meeting this week with the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, I was stunned to hear that of the already unacceptable number of children living in poverty in this country, two-thirds are from working households.How are we getting it so wrong in this country I have written in this newspaper before about my frustrations at the problem in our country’s welfare system, of which we were once so proud.I have criticised the management of the changes in state pension age for women.And I have railed at the issues with the well-intentioned but fatally underfunded Universal Credit.Only this week the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Amber Rudd, admitted that its failings have been responsible for sending so many people to food banks.But the crux of my gripe is that I realise that we have slipped very far from the fair society, backed by a strong economy, we aim to be.: Rudd urged to ditch DWP policies after damning UN reportOne half of that, the former, we have managed to achieve. The other still seems to be tantalisingly out of our reach. And it needn’t be.I am not in Government. ButI were, the first thing I would do in my new post would be to act on that recognition which Amber Rudd is the first in the Cabinet to publicly acknowledge.I would put back the £ billion which George Osborne took out of the budget for Universal Credit.Then I would pause the roll-out and migration from legacy benefits and fix the obvious problems that are leaving families with nothing to live on for more than a month, causing people to fall into rent arrears and adding stress to an already intolerable burden.After that, I would address the issues which still allow situations where the benefits of getting a job are undermined.But, more than anything , I would want to do something about those children in poverty.I thought about them this week and I thought about that Christmas when I was no more than eight or nine years old.At that time, le was simple for me.I had a big loving family and any financial challenges my parents might have faced were well hidden from us.For my younger sisters, it was slightly dferent.When my dad died at the age of , we went overnight from being relatively well off and living in a home we owned to a single-parent family with no income. My mum went back out to work and somehow managed to give my sisters everything I had known.But, at the age of , I realised how easy it is to fall through the cracks.Then, like now, I thought about those kids in my class that Christmas.Most of them had at least as much potential as I did, but not all of them got to fulfill it.Today that thought as much as,not more than, any political principle I have is what drives my daily le. I have been lucky. I have been able to give my daughter the start in le my parents were able to give me.Maybe because of that I want every child to have the opportunity to fulfill their potential, and feel it’s up to those of us who have to make sure it happens.No family should have to choose between Christmas presents and keeping warm.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"parents who drive kids to school responsible for toxic air quality","story":"Parents who drive their children to school rather than walk are responsible for damaging the air quality, a health minister said.Jackie Doyle-Price laid out what the Government is doing to deal with the issue of toxic air, but said iniduals need to take more responsibility for their actions.She was responding to the Lib Dems’ Christine Jardine in the Commons during Health Questions this morning.The MP for Edinburgh West said studies show living within  metres of a major road as a child creates a % increased risk of contracting letime asthma.Ms Jardine asked: “Given that there are also , nurseries in this country close to dangerous high levels of polluted roads, what action can the minister assure is being taken along with her counterparts in Scotland and Defra to tackle this on a UK scale ” - Nicola Sturgeon dismissed critics of her French tripMs Doyle-Price explained the Government’s clean air strategy, led by Environment Secretary Michael Gove, including measures to reduce overall levels of pollutants, take cars off the road and “tackle wood-burning fires”.She added: “But also, we need to be much more vigilant in advising the public of the risks to this, and including actually how they uses their cars.“The time was when I went to school I used to walk there, too often we see parents dropping their kids off with idling engines that cause pollution.”Labour’s Barry Sheermancalled the response “warm words”, saying the Defra plans “are to tackle the poisonous air that our children are breathing, pregnant women are breathing, by ”, adding: “The fact is that children are being poisoned now, get on with it!” - New rapid sepsis test by Scottish scientists could save thousands of livesThe minister replied: “I can assure him we are working very closely with Defra, but ultimately we do need to encourage the public to change its behaviour, and we need to have much more open debate about the consequences of bad air.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon eu nationals crucial to scotland s well being","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Nicola Sturgeon will say EU nationals are #crucial# to Scotland#s well-being as she appears before delegates in the French Parliament today.Scotland’s First Minister will appear before the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Assemblée Nationale, the lower house of the French legislature in Paris.The SNP leader will attack theUK’s decision to end Freedom of Movement as part of its Brexit deal as a ‘self-defeating measure’ and pledge to give her support to EU citizens currently living in Scotland. - Scottish students warned off taking music as a subject to save schools money“Those EU citizens of course include , French people, who are our colleagues, friends, neighbours and in many cases our family.

We would like to thank everybody for the great support locally.”The house was originally built in  for Eilidh#s great grandfather Samuel Campbell, and for many years it operated as a temperance hotel.Fire ravaged the building in the s and, although part of the domestic side was occupied up until around  years ago, it has since lain dormant.Councillors on the review body said the couple deserved sympathy and support in their vision to restore a building which had been in Mrs Mcniven#s family for four generations.The couple#s supporting statement before planners said: “It is important to remember that this is a property that has been in the same family for  years and is about to become a new home for a young local family. The historic value of the property is not lost on them. However without intervention it may very well be lost entirely.”Dingwall councillor Margaret Paterson said she thought it “sad” that obstacles had been placed in the way of a couple who proposed to put so much into a building that was “almost falling down”.Lochalsh councillor Biz Campbell and Raymond Bremner, who represents Wick and East Caithness, also spoke in support of the couple#s plans.Councillor Bremner said he believed the aluminium window frames, as proposed for the development, had changed considerably from previous types which did not stand up well to spray from seawater.He added: “I have a lot of sympathy with the applicants and with the points made in their appeal. I don#t have an issue with the change of use.”Broadford and Strath Community Council had lobbied in support of the couple, while neighbours and local businesses also backed the proposed conversion.Community council chairman Hamish Fraser said: “They are proposing to restore a building that will become an asset to the community. It#s a common-sense decision to support a young couple who want to live and make a business here.”Planning officials had turned down the original application on the grounds that it had breached three policies of the Highland-wide local development plan.In their reason for refusal planners said modern windows and a door with patterns “is not in keeping with the character of a historic building”.In his letter of support of the couple, local historian and broadcaster Professor Norman Macdonald said: “In many years of regularly attending Highland Council planning committee meetings at all levels I do not recall a single application where a big and ambitious idea has come to the brink of jeopardy over such relatively immaterial and tangential matters.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/DUNVEGAN-CASTLE-SNOWDROPS-3.jpg","title":"the waterboys set to kick off skye live festival","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLegendary Scottish-Irish folk-rock band The Waterboys are to kick-off the Skye Live festival’s fth-anniversary celebrations this autumn.The opening concert in Portree on Thursday th September will see the bandto Skye for the first time in nearly  years.

It is a safe bet that there are only three: Robert Somerville, John Keenan, and Bob Fulton.Back in March , when they were union shop stewards at the town#s Rolls Royce plant, the three men # and thousands of their co-workers # were responsible for virtually grounding the air force of Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet, who had seized power just a few months before in a savage CIA-backed coup. The documentary #Nae Pasaran#, screened in Portree last weekend, tells the story of how these principled trade unionists came to be awarded the highest honour the Republic of Chile can bestow upon foreigners.With much of the world appalled by the overthrow, in September , of the democratically-elected socialist Government of Salvador Allende, it fell to Bob Fulton # a burly, no-nonsense Christian with wartime experience of fighting fascist dictators # to set the ball rolling in East Kilbride. Arriving for work on the morning of th March  he uncovered a chilling truth about the eight Rolls Royce jet engines that had just been delivered to the plant for servicing: the engines came from the British Hawker Hunter jets used by Pinochet loyalists to bomb, amongst other targets, the presidential palace in Santiago where Allende died on the day the coup began.Now in his mid-s, Bob immediately #blacked# the engines that is, he declared them subject to an industrial dispute. As such, they could not be touched by any worker # or anyone , for that matter # until the dispute was resolved. His colleagues soon followed suit, much to the consternation of management and the UK Government. And so the engines sat, untouched, out in the open air for the next four years, until they became useless lumps of rusting metal. Moreover, the East Kilbride plant was the only place in the world licensed to service the engines. So, aside from the eight now-engineless jets, the rest of Pinochet#s air force could not be kept airworthy while workers thousands of miles away stuck to the principles of international solidarity. How many lives this saved on the ground is a moot point.#Nae Pasaran# is a paean to what can be achieved by collective action, and to what might be described as the golden age of trade unionism. But the documentary # written and directed by Felipe Bustos Sierra, son of an exiled Chilean journalist # also works as an emotionally-charged voyage of discovery.For over  years, Bob, John and Robert, and other former plant workers doubted whether or not their actions had any lasting effect on the lives of persecuted Chileans, many of whom were trade unionists like themselves. #Nae Pasaran# works in a dramatic sense because we watch as this gap in their knowledge is filled. The Scottish refuseniks did make an impact. Their stand mattered.What makes #Nae Pasaran# so moving is that the surviving union men, interviewed atby Sierra in his adopted homeland, are shown interviews he conducted back in Chile with survivors of Pinochet#s brutality. Now old men themselves, the victims recalled how they took solace in smuggled radios tuned to Radio Moscow, which broadcast regular updates on the Scottish union#s boycott. The action # or rather inaction # of the Rolls Royce workers gave many Chileans hope that they would not be forgotten or abandoned by the outside world.

Indeed, Mr McEleny drew an #obvious parallel# with Venezuela, where the democratically-elected socialist Government of another resource-rich South American country is being targeted for regime change.He said: #In Chile, before the coup, US corporations had huge commercial interests in copper mining and they sought to undermine and destabilise the Allende Government, and this is pretty much what we are seeing in Venezuela right now. Poverty in Venezuela has been engineered by the US, just as it was in Chile. We are seeing the same media pattern, a capitalist conditioning programmeyou like, drip-feeding propaganda to make intervention look like the right thing to do.

James is  years old and is a professional cookery apprentice at the Galgorm Resort  Spa Hotel and Northern Regional College. James was studying for his A-Levels in Nutrition and Food Science, Le and Health Sciences and Applied ITC at Cambridge House Grammar School when he had the opportunity to take up work experience in Antrim’s Ramble Inn. For James – who had always dreamed of being a chef – his time in the Inn’s kitchens led to the realisation that his passion could be his full-time career. When he found out about the apprenticeships with Northern Regional College and the Galgorm Resort  Spa, he jumped at the chance. He said: “I love the creativity that comes with being a chef, you get to make people happy with your food.“So when I was given the chance to learn more and get hands-on experience in the kitchens of one of the biggest players in Northern Ireland’s hospitality sector I just couldn’t pass up that opportunity. It was a no-brainer for me!”James decided to leave school after his AS-Levels and hasn’t looked back since: “I really enjoyed school and I had thought that afterwards I would maybe go on to catering college. However, this apprenticeship is a chance to get experience in the industry and offers me an immediate route into the career I love – why would I put that off for another year ” What does a typical day at the work look like for James  At the moment, he has an enviable position looking after the restaurant’s delectable range of desserts. This means weighing out and prepping ingredients, plating up panna cotta, sticky toffee pudding and cheesecake and making sure the Galgorm’s fridges never run low of sweet treats. If you’re lucky enough to be on campus on a Wednesday, you might even get to sample some of James’ cooking. He and his colleagues spend their morning whipping up meals and being assessed on their abilities. Their top-class cooking is served up to hungry staff and students in the canteen. The afternoon is spent familiarising themselves with the extensive health and safety rules which every chef must know. When asked why he chose the apprenticeship route James says that for him it was the obvious choice: “With the apprenticeship you get to earn while you learn, and you have no student loans to worry about paying back at the end.”But most importantly, it’s the hands-on experience he has received throughout his training which James claims is most valuable.“You can read in a text-book that a professional kitchen is a high-pressure environment, but unless you’ve been in there at peak dinner-serving time, you can’t truly understand it.” James says he would “most definitely” recommend the apprenticeship scheme to someone : “If you want to go into the hospitality sector, I honestly think it’s the smartest career move you can make.” And his advice to them  “Just go for it! You have nothing to lose and so much to gain!”  "},{"url":null,"title":"the top six questions people are asking google about brexit","story":"Heres the answers to your questions:What is the new Brexit Party, which has been supported by Nigel Farage What is the new Brexit Party and how do I join The Brexit Party was launched with the support of ex-UKIP leader Nigel Farage in January and recognised as an official party at the beginning of February .

When we go back and look at the stats, those are the things we will be saying.#It was a slow start to this game with both teams hitting early wides, but the pattern was soon established with James McNaughton and Alan Devine trading frees before Aonghus Clarke fired over from range.Three McNaughton frees gave Antrim the edge as he then traded points with Devine before Nigel Elliott finally shot Antrim#s first from play on  minutes to make it - to -, but this was to be their final score of the opening half.Westmeath drew level thanks to a Devine free and a magnicent sideline cut from Derek McNicholas before Devine gave them the lead.It was to get even better for the visitors on  minutes as Devine got a touch to Robbie Greville#s long delivery to find the net, while McNicholas and Devine added points to make it - to - at the break.With the swirling wind at their backs in the second period, Antrim needed a bright start and they got it with McNaughton clipping over a free and then Nigel Elliott sent Keelan Molloy in to flick to the net.McNaughton and Kevin Rice added points but, crucially, Antrim could never get ahead.The visitors rallied with the next three points and this was a lead they were to hold for the majority of the second period as the teams effectively went score-for-score.Antrim did get to within one with Conor McCann – who had what looked like a good shout for a penalty waved away when hauled back by Tommy Doyle late on – and McNaughton hitting scores.

After giving the matter some thought, Squinter has been unable to separate two candidates, and so the prize is jointly awarded. First co-winner is Andrea Leadsom, Tory Leader of the House, for her reaction to Donald Tusk’s statement that there’s “a special place in hell” for those who promoted Brexit “without a sketch of a plan”.Andrea’s response was rather more temperate than that of Sammy Wilson, who opined that Mr Tusk was a “devilish, trident wielding, euro maniac”. She remarked, with what would appear at first blush to be commendable restraint: “The man has no manners.”But on hearing Andrea’s mention of the word “manners”, a little bell went off somewhere deep in Squinter’s hippocampus and after a short period of beard-scratching and pencils-sucking, it came to Squinter why the Honourable Member is on rather thin ice when it comes to matters of polite conduct.Come back in time with Squinter to the summer of , just two weeks before Britain voted to leave the EU. Andrea was locked in a battle with Theresa May for leadership of the Conservative Party. In an interview with The Times, when asked why the party should opt for her, she replied that her rival “possibly has nieces, nephews, lots of people. But I have children who are going to have children who will directly be part of what happens next.”So there we have it. Andrea pitched for the top job by saying having children gives her more of a stake in the country. At which point, we should remind ourselves that Theresa May has spoken honestly and movingly about the fact that she and her husband Philip were unable to have children.Manners  Yih pays yer money…Joint winner is British Transport Secretary Chris Grayling who announced on Friday that he was cancelling the £ million contract he had awarded to Seaborne Freight just before Christmas to provide a ferry service from Ramsgate to Ostend to ease the pressure on the port of Dover should the UK crash out with no deal.Mr Grayling’s tenure has been one of the great comedy shows of British politics and it’s widely believed that he remains in office only to direct fire away from more senior colleagues. Not that he could have seen this mess developing. After all, Seaborne Freight was a highly respected company with a long history of professional and responsible conduct in the business of ferries and freight, right  Well, since the company only hit the news in December you probably don’t need Squinter to remind you that Seaborne Freight:• Was a completely new company• Didn’t own a ship• Cut and pasted its website terms and conditions from a pizza delivery firmand an online boutiqueThe high-flying cabinet minister sent out to back Grayling when the contract was scrubbed was Communities Secretary James Brokenshire. You know, the bloke was Secretary of State here for a while and nobody noticed.Chris’ll be gone by the end of the week, then.Fail to prepare#LET’S be honest, Jim Wells isn’t flavour of the month within the DUP. The South Down MLA had the party whip withdrawn last spring after he fell out with the top brass over his claim that they had reneged on a promise to reinstate him as Health Minister after he stepped down in  over an election hustings row.Jimbo claimed then party leader party leader Peter Robinson promised to reinstate him when andthe furious furoreblew over . He further alleged that when Arlene Foster took over as leader she ignored two written requests from him to honour Peter’s pledge. These days Jimbo’s something of a voice in the wilderness, technically still a DUP MLA but shorn of any authority to speak for the party. Which makes him of considerable interest to journalists, since the resentment he clearly still feels makes him a little bit more willing to open up about things than other DUP reps.Jim’s been at it again this week and, given the state we’re in at the moment, you’ll probably not be surprised to hear that it’s Brexit-related. Jim revealed that at the extraordinary meeting at which the party decided to back Leave in the months leading up to the EU referendum in , there was zero discussion of what a Leave vote would mean for the local economy. This would be an awkward revelation for most parties, but after the tsunami of controversies that the DUP has been through in the past couple of years, it seems to have reached the point that its brand is so polluted the tin can’t get any more dented, the label any dirtier. But that’s not the disaster that it would certainly be for any other party because the DUP’s substantial vote clearly consists of people who don’t care what they get up to as long as they’re not Sinn Féin.Lack of planning – it’ll do for ye every time. Fail to prepare, prepare to fail, that’s the old saying and nowhere does it ring more true than in the crazy world of Brexit. Let’s take a look at a few of the most notorious failures of a lack of foresight and seewe can work out where the DUP Brexit calamity fits in…Betamax’Member when video cassettes were the most exciting innovation in the history of technology  You don’t  Well, you must be under , so let’s seewe can explain. Two Japanese giants of the global electronics industry were caught up in the race to win control of the massive new market. JVC produced the eventually successful VHS format, while Sony produced the toploading Betamax system. Although the Betamax system was of a superior picture quality, it was considerably more expensive and had a shorter recording time. At a meeting in , Sony were advised by Matsushita engineers to switch to the VHS format, but declined. It wa a historic mistake, dealing the company a crippling financial blow from which it would take years to recover.Ford EdselFord were inordinately pleased with the Edsel, a new model released in the United States in , the year after the Ford family relinquished control of the company. The Edselwas designed to give Ford the upper-hand in the highly competitive premium intermediate market . The company missed the design boat, though, as the car harked back to an earlier age at a time when families were increasingly turning to compact vehicles. The Edsel was discontinued two years later, with sales signicantly less than half the break-even sales figure. Executives took their eye off the ball and didn’t realise the Edsel was flopping until over .bnhad been spent on design, manufacture and new dealerships. To this day, new models that fail are still referred to in the US automobile market as ‘Edsels’.New CokeIn the mid-s, as other soft drinks were increasingly threatening the dominance of Coca-Cola, the company decided it was going to ditch the original Coke formula and go with an improved ‘New Coke’.The  launch was a disaster and sales were badly hit, particularly in the southern states where Coca-Cola was considered an integral part of American culture. Tens of thousands of complaints flooded into company HQ weekly. The problem was not so much with the taste – the company had disastrously underestimated the hold that the Coca-Cola brand had on the American psyche. Smelling blood, rivals Pepsi began a new ad campaign with the strapline ‘Now I Know Why Coke Did It’ . Fans started booing ads for New Coke at large sports events. Just  days after New Coke was launched, the company announced that it was bringing back the old formula.Has to be a Brexit message in there somewhere, no "},{"url":null,"title":"belfast schools funding review after exam results excluded from statistics","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Photograph: ©Fran Veale NO REPRO FEE“A dog is a big commitment, soyou are still thinking of getting a dog in the New Year we would ask the public to do careful research on where you are sourcing your dog from, research the breed of dog to suit your lestyle and try to anticipate any major lestyle changes such as an upcoming move, a new baby, and consider how a dog may impact this before bringing one into your home.”Last week a litter of three puppies were dumped in a box with their mother and left for dead before being rescued by the animal welfare charity.The eight-week old puppies – Tayana, Tefi and Timoti – were left for dead in freezing temperatures with their mum Tati before the Dogs Trust rescued them.Tati has a deformity in both her front legs causing them to buckle outwards, which the charity said can be very painful, especially in later le.Her malformation is also suspected to be genetic, in which case it is very possible that her pups could also develop the chronic condition.Tati and her three puppies will be looking for homes over the next few weeks.To highlight how important it is to choose a dog based on their personalities, rather than the way they look, we have removed all photographs of the dogs in our Rehoming Centre today from our website #NotJustAPrettyFace #ValentinesDay— Dogs Trust IrelandFebruary , Head of operations Karla Dunne said: “It’s so incredibly heart-breaking to see these beautul creatures being discarded in this way with little thought for their safety or well-being.“We’re just grateful that they were found and brought to us so that we can care for them here until they find loving homes.“Thankfully all four of them are now thriving here and mum Tati can get the veterinary treatment she needs, but sadly many other puppies are not as fortunate and this could have been a completely dferent story had they not been found so quickly.”The Dogs Trust operates at full capacity and offers as many places as possible to dogs from Irish pounds, as they are the ones most at risk of destruction, so the charity is not in a position to take surrendered dogs from members of the public.However, in the majority of the cases so far this year, the welfare of the dogs found abandoned or surrendered was of such concern, that the dogs were admitted for immediate veterinary attention.The charity said this has impacted upon the number of dogs it can rescue from the local authority pounds."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37829372.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/elfast_-_Read-Only_.jpg","title":"former inm staff to take legal action over alleged data breach","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mr Buckley has pledged to robustly defend his position.Barrister Hugh McDowell told the court Mr O’Reilly, Mr Brophy and Ms Scott wished to use affidavits and documents gathered by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcementas part of their intended legal action. The material was gathered as part of the ODCE’s successful bid to have High Court inspectors appointed to investigate the suspected data breach.It included a list of  people whose names are feared to have been searched for during an “interrogation” of the data.Mr Brophy and Ms Scott’s names appeared on the list, but Mr O’Reilly’s did not.Mr McDowell said his clients had been granted access to certain ODCE material last April on condition that any parties seeking to use those documents would seek the permission of the court to do so. He said the ODCE had no objection to his clients using the material, but INM was objecting.The court heard INM’s concerns were that the three had failed to identy the nature of the proceedings and against whom they would be taken. The company also feared that providing consent would infringe on data protection law.Mr Justice Peter Kelly agreed to hold a hearing on the application next May."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37812018.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/kill.jpg","title":"ulster woman set alight by candle during mass saved by gaa star","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

That’s what they do.”She added: “I would say that the majority of house builders do not do that because they make their money by selling houses and getting aon their investment that they’ve put in, but that’s not to say that some land owners don’t do that.”Craig McLaren cited the Letwin review, undertaken in England, which looked at the issue of land banking and said: “It said you couldn’t rely on large-scale housing developers to solve the housing crisis because they will have land but they won’t release it all at the same time…because that will have an impact on the prices they can charge because there could be an oversupply.”"},{"url":null,"title":"man finds working 30yearold apple computer in his","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It gives an account of a drowned man whose distressed thrashing in the water was mistaken for waving.Charity officials say the No Lost Cause initiative is designed to complement the highly successful Pop Up Art project which is funded by the Big Lottery until this October.Over the le of the No Lost Cause project, charity officials will strive to reduce crime through erting people away from substance abuse and associated links to criminal activity.Le Change, Changes Lives officials have confirmed that the new project also aims to reduce reoffending by providing training and skills development activities and counselling to deal with substance and relationship family issues and provide support to improve the self-esteem of participants to help them re-engage with family and communities.They hope that through the basic food hygiene training, cooking participation and demonstration project that it will help parents revive cooking healthy, affordable family meals, to be eaten together at the kitchen table, helping achieve interaction and involvement in young peoplersquos livesAilish Teague, who helped establish the Downpatrick charity with her husband Manus, is delighted with the Department of Justice funding.She said competition to secure the money for the next three years was competitive, with groups in each of the provincersquos  councils eligible to apply.ldquoThe application was made through the Policing and Community Safety Partnership and the asset recovery is a brilliant resource, with money taken from criminals invested back into community projects, said Ailish.ldquoWe can use this money for the programmes we deliver, working closely with people who have a range of addictions.ldquoOur clients are also delighted that we have secured this funding which will enable is to deliver an NVQ Level One in hospitality services from our Market Street base with the food hygiene aspect of the course designed to give people a taste of employment.While delighted to have secured funding under the Department of Justice scheme, charity officials are conscious that their Lottery funding ends this October.Mrs Teague says officials have met with Lottery representatives and has suggested that the chances of having their funding extended are ldquozero to nil.She added: ldquoIt will be dficult to secure more Lottery funding which could leave us with no money to finance our core costs including rent and other overheads.

They were well prepared.ldquoThey had carried out research which helped them to face questions about migration and environmental issues. There was no doubt, they had been given the short straw as the other countries were ready to attack them for their current position in wanting to leave the EU.ldquoHowever, the students put aside their own views and represented the country they were delegated, in this debate.ldquoBeing the UK is what made it so challenging and also so rewarding as they did a fantastic job.Mrs Orsi said: ldquoNot being able to participate in future debates is only one of the educational detriments to leaving the EU.ldquoI think our students are going to be greatly affected on many levels, both in terms of academic opportunities, funding and employment. It is the very people who were not able to vote who will be impacted upon most.Ciara said studying A-Level politics definitely helped the girls flex some political muscle in their challenge.She added: ldquoWe have been discussing Brexit a great deal in class and we felt secure in our knowledge.ldquoHowever, what we did find challenging was trying to find out the positions of other smaller EU countries in terms of their policies on migration and the environment.ldquoI am very interested in politics and as a language student, I feel it is important we are involved in these debates to ensure we continue to develop our understanding of our European neighbours.ldquoWhat is unfortunate is the fact this might be the last time we will be asked to participate as we will no longer be a member state.The debate was organised by the British Council with the aim of developing studentsrsquo intercultural understanding of other countries while learning more about the political workings of the ious states..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch farming family feature on BBC documentary  ","story":"THE trials of farming will be shown through the eyes of a Ballynahinch family as they are featured tonight in the BBC Two series, This Farming Le.Top beef cattle breeder Geoff Rodgers allowed a film crew to capture him and his family work their -acre farm between Ballynahinch and Dromara for most of last year.Geoff inherited the farm when his father died Martin and runs it with his we, Lizzie, who is a special needs classroom assistant at Spa Primary School, with their three children, Emma , Martin , and  year-old Lucy.He admitted that he had turned down previous offers to take part in other farming shows but finally agreed to take part as he was a real fan of the show.The result is a moving insight into what it takes to care for  animals  hours a day and what happens when it all goes wrong.ldquoI think some viewers will be reduced to tears. Well, thatrsquos what happened when all of the farmers featured watched the programme a few weeks ago, said  year-old Geoff.ldquoIt will show that there is a real connection between the family and the animals and itrsquos not all just about sales or winning competitions.Two months before the crew started filming last January, the family were hit with terrible news mdash Bovine TB was discovered in their pedigree herd and  animals had to be slaughtered.A movement restriction then had to put on the herd which meant that no animals could enter or leave the farm until two consecutive TB tests prove negative.The programme catches up with the family on the day a vet calls to carry to do the next test and to determine whether any more of the herd will have to be slaughtered.ldquoIt just happened that the crew came to us in one of the most challenging times for the farm, said Geoff.ldquoAnd while I wonrsquot gave too much away, what happens not only affects me but also my children as they all get involved, especially the youngest Lucy, to help me get the animals ready for the likes of Balmoral Show.ldquoWe not only lost some of the animals but you also lose years of breeding, particularly with some of the animals my father had bred them, which was hard, and then of course, therersquos a knock-on loss of new calves.ldquoIt was particularly hard as I had buyers waiting to buy bulls and cattle of me but we couldnrsquot do anything until we got the all-clear.The tension builds over the next few episodes of the show as the deadline looms to Balmoral Show mdash the highlight of the farming calendar in Northern Ireland and the major sales day for Geoff.Viewers will see that the Rodgers familyrsquos hopes of further success at Balmoral are pinned on bull Mario, who Geoff described ldquoas a real character and his young half-sister, Nadia.This Farming Le starts tonight at pm on BBC ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"British Irish group on High Street conference  ","story":"THE impact of online sales on the High Street was discussed at a recent meeting in Newcastle.Representatives from the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly were in the resort where they were met by South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Mark Murnin.Mr McGrath explained the committee has a dferent area of investigation each year and that in  is focusing on the impact of online sales on the High Street and how governments can deliver initiatives and projects to address the problem.The Assemblyman said with the nature of the traditional High Street changing, many people, especially the young, are shopping online with this trend only going to increase.ldquoWe are seeing and hearing that people want experiences and see their shopping trip as much more than simply shopping, wanting to incorporate food and activities as part of their experience, said Mr McGrath.ldquoHaving clean, welcoming public spaces, areas that can facilitate events and having a erse range of experiential shops and boutiques is critical in making the High Street thrive. In Newcastle, the public realm and promenade schemes, in tandem with the shop front improvement scheme, have helped the resort buck the trend and is reporting increasing footfall.Mr McGrath also highlighted the need to continue to develop experiences people can avail of to maximise footfall and is confident ambitious future proposals including a gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes will be critical to enhancing what Newcastle has to offer.He continued: ldquoIn Downpatrick, the former Irish Street police station and car park have the potential to redevelop the town and breathe new live back into its retail centre.ldquoDeveloping a space here which can enhance and deliver a customer experience and product will be critical to developing new shops and products, but also complement existing businesses too.ldquoRates and the entire rating scheme was a major recurring theme from business organisations and this will form part of a report being compiled by the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly following their visit.Mr McGrath said the inadequacies of the rating system were well known, with the British-Irish body, of which he is a member, keen to find other ways of helping businesses thrive.The MLA added: ldquoTimes are changing and local authorities and central governments must reflect this in the work they do. I look forward to the report our committee will deliver which will reflect on time spent in Newcastle, Belfast, Dublin, Newcastle Upon Tyne and Stockton on Tees.Cllr Murnin said he was delighted that representatives of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly view Newcastle as an example of good practice for their research into revitalising the high street.He continued: ldquoWe have worked very hard to make our district a better place to carry out business and as a place to visit.

Itrsquos something I have always had to be aware of in my own le. I feel very strongly that there are issues in Northern Ireland that arenrsquot being addressed as far as mental health is concerned.A former pupil of St Malachyrsquos Primary School in Castlewellan, Niamhrsquos dficulties compounded after leaving Assumption Grammar School in Ballynahinch. A talented actor, who shone in the schoolrsquos theatre productions, she applied for and got a place at Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama in Cardf.Niamh was fortunate that while not academically minded, she found that drama, theatre studies and English always came ldquonaturally to her in school.The youngest of five siblings, Niamh says that she had always wanted to leave Castlewellan for ldquoan adventure. But she did not realise that her living in Cardf, away from family and friends, would take such a toll on her.ldquoI was just very, very homesick because our experiences in Northern Ireland were so unique and I didnrsquot have anyone that I could explain that to, she said.ldquoI felt emotionally unsupported. I felt very much like fish out of water as I was surrounded by a lot of very wealthy people and I struggled to connect with them. I was longing for the familiarity and the closeness, and the craic of home. My homesickness lasted for many years, it didnrsquot just go away.ldquoEvery time I went home for Easter or Christmas I was in floods of tears going back to the airport but yet I made myself do it, nothing nor nobody  was forcing me to do it.She went gone to appear alongside actors such as Sir Patrick Stewart of Star Trek fame in an acclaimed production Macbeth which played Londonrsquos West End and New Yorkrsquos Broadway, as well as former X-Files star Gillian Anderson and  Shades heart-throb Jamie Dornan in the psychological murder drama The Fall.Niamh is currently working on two film projects and says that as a newly married woman, her professional and personal le is going great.However, she maintains her mental health by practicing yoga and mediation and feels it is important to be upfront about having had issues.She explained: ldquoI donrsquot see a problem talking about mental health because I donrsquot like that itrsquos still taboo. If it helps one person seek help, then thatrsquos great.ldquoPeople could be sitting with mental problems and they donrsquot know it. Because thatrsquos what anxiety and depression do, they sneak on you and it really starts to alter your view of the world without you noticing.ldquoOver time with mediation you can be in control of your mind. It does not have to be in control of you.

Hutley was given another chance around  minutes and this time took full advantage after Enniskillen had been deemed to be offside on the back of a break from Down scrum half, Chris Gibson.For the remainder of the first half, and indeed for  minutes in the second half, the score remained at - with both teams trading blows, but neither were able to alter their account on the scoreboard.Down did have their chances to take the lead, but lacked the finesse in handling that they had shown against their rivals from Carrick and Omagh in previous rounds.As the game entered the final quarter, Enniskillen managed to extend their lead, scoring a try by barging over from short range following a well won line-out.With Enniskillen now in possession of a  point lead, Down were left with no alternative but to chase the game. Again, they created some opportunities and applied pressure in Enniskillen territory with some great carries from Josh Hanlon, Conor Moag and Joe Charles, but the dogged defence of the locals held out and with it, Down frustration grew which made putting quality attacking play together even harder.In the closing minutes and with the outcome of the fixture already beyond doubt, Enniskillen added a final unconverted try confirming them as the team who would progress to the quarter-finals.The final whistle brought bitter disappointment to the hard-working Down squad who knew they hadnrsquot been at their best on this occasion.The side now enter the Subsidiary Shield competition and they have drawn Royal School Dungannon at home in a quarter-final game to be played on Saturday, February, , at am.Having been finalists in this competition for four consecutive years and winners in , everyone at Down High knows there is plenty left to play for this season..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C February 13%2C 1979  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash A Ballynahinch horse breeder is a very disappointed man this week mdash and all because of the lsquoflu.

His parents and medical team are constantly working to ensure his lungs remain as clear of mucus as they can be.Jen said: ldquoItrsquos hard to believe when you look at him that anything is wrong as he looks so perfect, but inside him the mucus is causing havoc.ldquoDermot and I never expected to becomes nurses as well as parents to our child. We do his treatment willingly but with heavy hearts.ldquoIf the drugs didnrsquot exist, I think we could just accept things as they are and get on with our lives and make every day count.ldquoBut as it is we canrsquot rest until we have access to Orkambi and the pipeline of drugs for Lorcaacuten and all the others with cystic fibrosishere need.ldquoThis situation makes it dficult to enjoy our son without feeling pain at time passing.The couple, who live off the Vianstown Road, believe that the sooner their son starts on Orkambi the better.ldquoOrkambi not only slows the decline in lungby up to %, it also reduces hospitalisations by up to %, Jen explained.ldquoEvery day people go without access to these drugs is a day in which their body could become more damaged. Since he was  days old, Lorcaacuten has not had a single day without taking some type of antibiotic, as well as  enzymes.ldquoSome people [including young children] with CF have to attend the hospital for two weeks of IVs every three months and thatrsquos considered to be ok when there is a drug that could potentially help Families of CF sufferers believe that Orkambi can lsquostop the clockrsquo on further decline of the patient as they get older.However, the US drug company which developed it has so far failed to agree a price so that it could be introduced by the UK.Jen added: ldquoThe drugs currently in trials are supposed to give sufferers a chance at a near normal le, but this is partly dependent on them being healthy enough when they begin taking them. There is no time to wait.ldquoTwo hundred and twenty six people have died in the UK since Orkambi was licensed over three years ago. We need Orkambi and we need it now.The couple have been lobbying local politicians to get their help at keeping their campaign in spotlight in Government.Strangford MP Jim Shannon raised the plight of Lorcaacuten at Westminster this week.South Down MLAs Jim Wells and Sinead Bradley, along with Lagan Valley MLA Trevor Lunn, are planning to host a meeting in Stormont within weeks with Richard Pengelly, Permanent Secretary at the Department of Health in Northern Ireland.Mr Shannon said: ldquoI was contacted by people throughout Northern Ireland asking me to push government to allow a crown licence for this le-changing drug, as I have been vocal in my belief that this drug should be available on the NHS.ldquoWhat impacted me most was a mother in my area who sent me a picture of her beautul two year-old son with his little mask on, telling me that he was now old enough to get it and it would make such a dference to him.ldquoI supported the calls for the drug and will continue pushing government to find a way to overcome the issue between the drug company and NICE guidelines.While Jen says she has received local cross-party support, she is urging people to sign the petition

technology is to be used to inform peoplethe bathing water at Newcastle beach is safe to swim in.The beach is one of six across the province which features in a new EU-backed initiative to provide people with live updates of the water quality.The resortrsquos beach and surrounding river catchment area has been selected as part of a major new study, with a weather station and river water level recorders already in place to send real time data to a server which the public can access.A new electronic sign is to be erected at the Downs Road car park to provide live updates on the water quality, but the European Unionrsquos so-called SWIM project goes a step further with people able to get information via text messages and internet alerts.News of the new initiative comes just three months after it was revealed that while Kilclief, Ballyhornan, Tyrella and Murlough beaches continue to enjoy some of the best bathing water quality in Europe, it was a case of lsquomust do betterrsquo for Newcastle, with the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs labelling the resortrsquos water quality as ldquosufficient.Details of the SWIM project were outlined at Monday nightrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee.Councillors were told those involved in the scheme are working on developing a real time monitoring system, allowing local people and visitors to the beach to check the water quality via a series of measures.Council officials say the innovative project will enable what they have described as ldquoshort term pollution to be predicted.Funded by the Special EU Programmes Body, those behind the project which includes Newcastle, Castlerock, Portrush, Waterfoot, Ballyholme and Ballywalter beaches in Northern Ireland and Clogherhead, Enniscrone and Ladyrsquos Bay in the Republic, say it will help protect public health.In addition, they are confident that it will signicantly improve communication about water quality and contribute to tourism promotion in the resort.At Monday nightrsquos council meeting, Mournes councillor Willie Clarke said: ldquoThis new programme is good news for the resort and can have a positive impact on tourism.ldquoThe fact that people will have real time access to the quality of the bathing water builds confidence which is positive.ldquoThere is a problem with nitrates finding their way into the water at the beach and it is something that needs to be addressed.ldquoHowever, the fact that we will soon have a scheme which enables people to know the quality of the water before they take a dip is groundbreaking.Rowallane councillor Harry Harvey, said the decision was good news for Newcastle and could boost visitor numbers.ldquoThis is a forward step for a beach where the water quality has improved from what it was a number of years ago, he said.ldquoThe beach has yet to achieve blue flag status which in part recognises the quality of the water and it would be greatthis could be secured in the long term.ldquoWith the focus on the here and now, the provision of the electronic sign and the availability of real time information is indeed a welcome development and a forward step for the resort..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/ource

recently recorded a single at the iconic Abbey Road Studios, a place made famous by The Beatles.Calling the experience of recording in the same studio as The Beatles ldquosurreal, Sean explained how the opportunity arose.ldquoIrsquove just recently joined up with a guy called Rory Gallagher, hersquos from Kilcar, Donegal, and his project is called Rory and the Island for he owned the Island Bar over in Lanzarote for five or six years before he came home. He asked me would I come along and join him so we have been out on tour and we were over playing in Camden, in London last week, said Sean.He continued: ldquoHe signed with a record label called Buddy Records and they got it all sorted for us to go in and record with Abbey Road, so we were recording our new single lsquoCall My Name.rsquoWith the new single due to release on Spoty at the end of next week, Sean said: ldquoWersquove got it all nearly ready to go so therersquos just a few mixes that need to be done.Talking about the recording day, Sean said: ldquoWe were in early morning and we were just straight into it, I never really got thinking about it and about midday we took a walk around the building and seen all the big studios.ldquoWe recorded in the Gate House studio and we went into Studio Two and Studio Three to do wee bits of sample and background vocals. That was where The Beatles, Ed Sheerin and Adele all wouldrsquove recorded in as well. So it was just madness, he added.During the recording of the single Sean played his great grandfatherrsquos fiddle, an instrument which has a tale of its own to tell. Sean explained: ldquoMy great grandfather had ordered this fiddle in  before the First World War broke out and hersquod sent the money with the order. Basically then the war broke out and the fiddle didnrsquot turn up so he thought all was lost. As soon as the war was finished in , the fiddle arrived at the door. He couldnrsquot believe it. So I took it with me to Abbey Road and the song we were recording was a slow song, and therersquos a lovely deep tone out of the fiddle so I took it with me.ldquoIt was my grandadrsquos father and my grandad was delighted that I took it with me, he added.When asked how he first met Rory, Sean explained that it was through his dad, Conor Magee. He said: ldquoRory was in a band way back years ago called The Revs and they wouldrsquove been doing sets at the likes of Slane Castle. My dad is a sound engineer, and he done the sound for The Revs about  years ago. We were going over to Lanzarote and I didnrsquot know Rory at all and dad had messaged him to seehe would get me up for a song in the Island Bar.Sean continued: ldquoHe got me up and shortly after that he sent me a message to seeI wanted to do a couple of gigs over in Lanzarote. He asked me thenI wanted to go out on tour with him when he was home. So it came out of nowhere really.Sean has since been touring with Rory and the Island for the last six months, travelling all over Ireland and the UK. Talking about their upcoming gigs, Sean said: ldquoWersquove Germany for St. Patrickrsquos weekend and America then in April, over to New York.He added: ldquoWe also have a local gig in Charliersquos Bar on March .

Mr McAteer was barred by law from acting as a spad because of a serious criminal conviction. However, Sinn Fein circumvented the law by making him a ‘super spad’, putting him over the party’s team of spads and ministers – something which civil servants agreed to, even though it was against the spirit of the law.Stormont Castle has not acknowledged the existence of minutes of the meeting between Sir Malcolm and the DUP and Sinn Fein spads, suggesting that no minutes of the meeting were taken. The following morning, Sir Malcolm emailed his two senior civil service colleagues with a draft of the letter which he had drawn up and asked them for any comments by lunch time.Three hours later Dr McCormick replied to say that he had discussed the issue with Mr Sterling and they had agreed a series of changes to the text. Mr Sterling felt it contained a section on agriculture which was “too long”, something which “unbalances the overall thrust of the letter”.Five days later the amended letter was sent to the private secretaries of the first minister and the deputy first minister. Not a word of that letter was changed by the ministers or their spads before it was sent to Downing Street the following day.Sinn Fein makes unity pitch to civic unionists Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES: The  locations across N.I. where speed camera vans operateTwo cases of meningitis confirmed at NI primary schoolMan caught with  lsquopackagesrsquo of cocaine in his body at Belfast City AirportBallymena manager David Jeffrey praised his side after their - defeat to Linfield in the BetMcLean League Cup Final.LIVE BLOG: League Cup final  - Ballymena United v Linfield          ..

Pic by Ben LowryMrs McDonald said it was impossible to “undo that damage or that loss” during her speech at the invitation of the fledgling Civic Space group.Although billed as a unionist event, a signicant number among the  or so invited participants were from Sinn Fein or the wider nationalist community, including Michelle O’Neill, Declan Kearney, Tom Hartley, Chris Donnelly and Professor Colin Harvey.The warmest applause of the night was for Belfast businessman Suneil Sharma who questioned whether the Sinn Fein leader’s reference to “changing demography” leading to a united Ireland was a polite way of talking up a sectarian head count.“Are you saying that soon there will be more Catholics than Protestants in Northern Ireland  Is this not the sort of crass, identity politics that is not about reconciliation, but reinforcing tribalism ” Mr Sharma said.Mrs McDonald said that the changing demographics was only one aspect of her belief that a united Ireland is inevitable.In a y speech, Mrs Donald said all suffering during the conflict should be acknowledged and remembered.The party president urged a duty of candour and acceptance of dference, and said reconciliation “sits above” the constitutional question surrounding the creation of a united Ireland.“We have an agreed process to deal with the constitutional question. We now need an agreed process for reconciliation.“I and my generation of republicans will work tirelessly to build a society in which no other parent is left without a child or a child left without a mammy or daddy.”Referencing the Carson-era opposition to an independent Ireland with a parliament sitting in Dublin, Mrs McDonald acknowledged that “in the south, Home Rule did indeed become Rome rule”.However, she said that although some people felt bewildered at the loss of their British identity, “it was mostly women that paid the price in the mothers and babies homes, as slave labour in the laundries”.UUP MLA Alan Chambers blasts Sinn Fein’s ‘double standards’ on legacy Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Rev Chris Hudson of the Non Subscribing Presbyterian Church askedshe now regretted opposing a small Orange Order parade in Dublin in the summer of .Rev Hudson also told Mrs McDonald there would be a better chance of getting an Irish Language ActSinn Fein been involved in pushing for one.Responding to the question about the protests that led to the parade being called off, she said her “politics had changed”.She added: “It was a very fraught situation” with “communities under siege” in Northern Ireland at that time, but parades can be accommodated “where it’s not seen as an encroachment”. The civic unionism event follows a much larger civic nationalist event at Belfast’s Waterfront last month which took place without unionist involvement.Among the audience last night were two young Ulster Unionists, Hannah Niblock, who works in Belfast, and Katie Armstrong, a student at Queen’s University.Hannah said: “No matter what your background you can tell Mary Lou speaks from the heart and she comes across well.”Katie said: “Despite having two very dferent backgrounds we have a lot of things in common in how we can move forward.”try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES: The  locations across N.I. where speed camera vans operateTwo cases of meningitis confirmed at NI primary schoolMan caught with  lsquopackagesrsquo of cocaine in his body at Belfast City AirportBallymena manager David Jeffrey praised his side after their - defeat to Linfield in the BetMcLean League Cup Final.LIVE BLOG: League Cup final  - Ballymena United v Linfield          ..

I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide.

These will be considered in accordance with the relevant legislation and guidance, part of which specically relates to the need for an Environmental Impact Assessment.ldquoShould a planning application follow, it will be considered in exactly the same way as any other of its type. In order to gain approval, among other factors, it will need to satisfy national and local policies, including those contained in the LDP, while members of the public will also have the opportunity to express their views before any decision is taken.Welsh Government and the architects have been contacted for comment. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

When he was in his s, Pat McKeever took over the farm after the death of his father Peter, who had run an apple canning business on the site. Pat said: “My daddy was one of three brothers who used to can apples. They’d get the apples from the local orchards, peel them and can them. Daddy then started growing his own apples and supplying the fresh market and the cider markets.”Now Pat’s son, and Peter’s grandson – also called Peter – is the third generation farmer who is set to carry on the business. Pat’s we Catherine and their four daughters also have integral roles to play as the craft cider making end of the agri-business continues to grow.Pat, Catherine and Peter McKeever of Long Meadow FarmLong Meadow started off with two craft cider drinks in  before introducing a mulled cider and a cider aged in oak barrels, some of which had been used in the original apple canning business. Over the past two years the company has branched out into flavoured ciders, apple juice and apple cider vinegar – famed for its health benefits.Catherine said: “I know everything goes through a bit of a fad, but I think the craft ciders are still holding their own. The mindset of cider has changed with craft ciders. “A lot of people would have associated cider in their younger days – maybe when they were at university – as a cheap drink you can buy in big quantities and get a hit off.“But that wasn’t craft cider. People are prepared to pay that little bit extra for the quality that comes with craft cider.“We’re using all our own fruit. We make it in smaller quantities so it can hold all the flavours, that’s the way we want to keep it. We only use hand-picked fruit, not any that has fallen on the ground.”Of the harvesting process, Pat said: “We would have between  to  pickers. They would come the third week in July and do a bit of summer pruning.Resurfacing works on A Portadown Road, ArmaghBrexit and data protection - will firms still have to comply with the new EU GDPR  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“Once that’s finished, in August they start into the picking of the apples, that goes right through to the end of October, first week in November.“The picking season we call it the nine weeks of hell. It’s your livelihood. You are depending on that fruit.“We harvest approximately , tonne of apples yearly.”Catherine explained how the orchard came to be illuminated: “A man called Walter Holt came to the farm last year to buy some apple cider vinegar. “I got talking to him and he gave me his card and told me what he did – an outdoor lighting artist.“I didn’t think much of it at the time, but I think the seeds had been sewn. I played about with it in my mind for a long time that it could be something we could work with.”Walter Holt and his assistant Orlanda Delaforce spent a total of  hours working on the installation of the lighting scheme.Walter commented: “The challenge on this particular scheme was working with smaller trees in an orchard setting. It’s a compact area and our solution was to develop a one way circular trail. “We tried to have as much creative iety as possible, implementing dferent approaches to dferent trees, with the whole colour scheme carefully thought out.”The light display is accompanied by music composed by Londonderry musician Sharon Graham.Catherine said: “We chose Valentine’s week for the treelumination launch as we felt it was a novel way in terms of adding to the romance of walking in the moonlight, but it’s by no means just for couples, it’s designed very much as a family experience for everyone.“I think we all have a vision of apple orchards complete with apple blossom or an abundance of fruit.“This illuminations event highlights the orchards in a totally dference perspective – a raw natural resting state before the cycle of growth begins.”The light show – designed by Walter Holt of Travelling Treeluminations – is the first of its kind to be held in an orchard environment and will open to the public from today until Saturday, from pm to pm each evening at  Loughgall Road.Entry is £ per adult and £ for children. A family ticket for two adults and two children costs £.Visitors will be given the opportunity to see the pressing and blending facilities on the farm as well as taste some of the products.Artisan food will be on sale as well as some free refreshment including tea, coffee and hot chocolate. Set to benefit from the four-day event is local charity ‘Katie-Rose’s Journey’.For more information on this week’s illumination event and other aspects of the farm go to www.longmeadowcidertry catch  TrendingThree vehicle crash near PortadownPartner and child were lsquomaking too much noisersquoDiscovery of mans body sparks murder probeJail sentence for man who spat and screamed at hospital staffConcern as disabled woman who carrys oxygen tank slapped with parking ticket          ..

Subject to confirmation by the all-island Single Electricity Market Committee, the auction for electricity generators to be awarded capacity contracts, on an all-island basis, has identied electricity capacityof , MW which will be in place for the year starting October ,  – , MW of that all-island total is attributed to Northern Ireland.This is a critical series of draft decisions which will reassure the large conventional generators about their contracts and will impose the discipline of revenue limits constrained by the capacity auction. The draft decisions also point to the expectations in terms of the capacity earmarked from renewable sources, from inter-connection with the Scottish grid and the capacity adjustments that may follow from demand-side adjustment contracts.SONI has not been as open and transparent as should have been possible. Readers must make the assumption that ties location to where capacity payments are identied in sterling and euro.The SONI statement lists  generator names ,  of which are identied as DSUswhich leaves  others. Eight are shown as part of the AES capacity in Ballylumford and Kilroot: four are small capacity generators, six each have capacity of over MW , and the last capacity source linked to Northern Ireland is the Moyle Interconnector.SONI does not present the capacity awards in a way that allows readers to identy the location of each successful unit.The Utility Regulator has agreed that the available Northern Ireland capacity should include  MW from the Moyle Interconnector which represents over % of locally available capacity. This is a judgement that might be queried. Is the interconnectora guaranteed source of capacity  If, at a time of peak demand in Northern Ireland, demand in the grid in GB had no spare capacity, presumably the capacity might not be available for supply to Northern Ireland. The regulator and SONI are well placed to judge the probability of this outcome and might argue that it is a minimal risk.There are some interesting features stemming from the assumptions made in setting the framework for the capacity auction. First, Northern Ireland has been treated as meriting some contract iations because of locational constraints. This is a reflection of the limited capacity of the electricity grid on the whole island to send electricity to the places where there is demand. Both the Dublin area and Northern Irelanddid not attract auction bids adequately to supply these area locational constraints. For Northern Ireland. the easy explanation lies in the absence of the long awaited north-south grid expansion from to the planned distribution hub in Co Tyrone.The capacity auction allowed for the acceptance of bids with prices which are higher than the main auction prices which would match supply and demand across the whole island. Because of the locational deficit, some Northern Ireland bids now show capacity payment prices above the all-Ireland ceiling of £, per MW which applies to most of the successful bids.In the quotation from AES for the two large fossil fuel burning units, the proposal is that they should attract payment prices of £, and £, per MW. At first sight this appears to allow a premium of nearly % on the payment price for each MW. This seems more than a marginal cost and points to the possible cost savingsthe proposed new north-south link had been operational.This answer for the older high capacity units at Kilroot is a further reflection of the doubt about the continued viability of these units. It will be remembered that a year ago, these same two units were deemed unsuccessful in the auction but, at a late stage when faced with a request for a derogation to be allowed to close these units, the initially agreed settlement was revised.A year ago, the first capacity auction under the rules of the newly instituted I-SEM, was accepted with a capacity supply of near to , MW for all of Northern Ireland. Now, in early , SONI has concluded that for security of supply Northern Ireland should contract for just under , MW. There is no obvious major uplt in demand in Northern Ireland so that, quietly, the suggestion is that the arithmetic in late  may now be thought to have been slightly too risky.The capacity auction is a fundamental building block of electricity supply policy for Northern Ireland. However, on its own, the allocation of capacity and the possible scope for investment in new generating capacity must also be seen in the context of increasing,market forces allow, the proportion of electricity supply that is supplied from renewable sources. The distribution of generating capacity is still dominated by fossil fuels. Northern Ireland’s capacity is nearly % from gas andcoal. However, the statistics showing the proportion of electricity supply from renewables points to average consumption from renewables of nearer to -%. Because of the iability in the contribution of wind based renewables, it would be hazardousgreater security dependence was allocated to renewables.In turn, the caveat about the possible role of renewables points to the possible value of further investment in energy storage for which no major scheme has been launched. If Kilroot power station survives for a further three to four years, then the experimental electricity storage capacity on that site may become an attractive asset.There are several continuing questions about Northern Ireland’s security of electricity supply. Will Kilroot be given further stays of execution after   Will the North South interconnector eventually be built  Will the proposed large natural gas burning power station be built in Belfast  Will the politically unpopular investment in anaerobic digestion plants be tackled  Will the Brexit settlement, or lack of it, damage the continued operation of the all-island single electricity market  But... it seems Kilroot has been given a temporary extension of its role in keeping the lights on.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pmcg.jpg","title":"ryder cup legend to address belfast leadership conference","story":"Posted on Friday February  by Ulster Business Ryder Cup legend Paul McGinley has been revealed as one of the key speakers at a leadership event taking place in Belfast next month.

Its surveying team are members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors . Nurturing talent and progression is a core principle that the firms stands for with  of their surveying staff having become qualied throughout the firm’s training program. We sat down with three members of the team.Gail Prentice-Jackson, associate director Over the last  years, Gail has worked right across the business, now within the asset management department.She manages a large mixed-use portfolio of property which includes leading shopping centres and retail parks right across Northern Ireland.Within that her role is ied and includes managing one of Northern Ireland’s most successful retail schemes. Day-to-day this can include everything from managing service charge budgets to maximising rental income through lease renewals and rent reviews. Another key role is to provide regular accounting and financial reports to clients.“One of my key roles is to support my agency department colleagues in their  acquisitions of investment assets and upon completion ensure that a comprehensive management regime is followed to ensure continued growth of our clients assets,” she says.“The role of a ‘property manager’ has evolved signicantly over the course of my career with much of our work now focusing on compliance and risk management. We pride ourselves on making sure our clients are well advised, mitigating any risks that may be involved with their particular property.”Some of those clients include retail sites such as Rushmere Shopping Centre in Craigavon.Gail is also one of just eight female surveyors in Northern Ireland with the designation of FRICS, a Fellow Member of RICS.“While females still only make up % of the surveying profession as a whole there are a signicant number of women working within the commercial property sector in Northern Ireland, it’s no longer a male orientated profession.”As for the business landscape Gail says that whilst there is general economic uncertainty they are seeing an increase in demand for their services as investors seek to maximisefrom their investments.“Interestingly we took on a number of new properties over the course of , often on behalf of investors who were keen to maximise rental s and ensure their property is run as efficiently as possible.”  Marian McFlynn, surveyor Since graduating from Ulster University in  with a degree in property investment and development, Marian’s career began on the other side of the globe – working for multi-billion dollar US-owned LaSalle Investment Management at its offices in Sydney.“In Sydney, as part LaSalle’s centre management team, I was responsible for leasing, marketing, administration and operation of a bulky goods shopping centre, home to over  homemaker and lestyle stores,” she says.“I ed to Northern Ireland, and joined the property and asset management department of Osborne King as a graduate surveyor in June ,” she adds. And following training, Marian became a chartered surveyor in . She’s now responsible for managing a range of commercial assets on behalf of clients. “This involves asset enhancement advice, tenant liaison, building maintenance, health and safety management, rent collection and accounting, service contract tendering and service charge administration,” she says.“I continue to build on my client and property portfolio.”And Marian also says that uncertainty hangs in the air for investors, while the ongoing lack of clarity over a post-Brexit landscape still exists.  Lisa McCaffrey, surveyorLisa has five years at Osborne King under her belt. Having graduated from the property investment and development course at Ulster University’s Jordanstown campus in , she worked at a Belfast estate agents before joining Osborne King in  becoming a chartered surveyor in .She works within the professional services team which sees her carry out valuations for a wide range of clients including private iniduals, large companies and the major lending institutions. As part of this Lisa is a member of the RICS Registered Valuers Scheme.Lisa also provides rent review and lease renewal advice to landlords and tenants throughout Northern Ireland.Additionally, Lisa was involved in the  non-domestic rating revaluation providing advice to a wide range of clients and negotiating the valuations with Land  Property Services on the clients behalf at application and appeal stages. Following the  revaluation Osborne King saved clients in excess of £.m. Lisa is working on the upcoming  non-domestic revaluation on behalf of a iety of clients.“I am fortunate to be involved in a wide range of work, some of which involves regular reporting to key clients such as one of Northern Ireland’s largest car showroom operators and well-known supermarket, convenience store businesses and global coffee brand.”  For more information contact Osborne King on   , email property@osborneking or visit the website at www.osbornekingView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/harbour_1221.jpg","title":"belfast harbour sets new cargo record","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by John Mulgrew Belfast Harbour has handled more than  million tonnes of cargo for the first time in its history.
