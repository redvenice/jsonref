He took it up when he was forced to give up polo in 1971 due to an arthritic wrist.         Wood Farm (pictured), an unassuming cottage on the edge of the Sandringham Estate close to the Norfolk coastline, is where the Duke has been whiling away his days since retiring\u0027He terrified his guests. Once, he took someone on his carriage and told him, \u0027Horses get used to the way they normally go and usually they\u0027d turn right here. I\u0027m going to make them turn left – and they won\u0027t like it.\u0027\u0027He was right. The guest was thrown from the carriage, while Prince Philip was thrown the other way. After they were rescued and safely in the back of a Land Rover, the Duke simply turned to him and quipped, \u0027See what I mean?\u0027\u0027I\u0027ve seen him do it and it looks terrifying but his former private secretary says it\u0027s relaxation for him.\u0027If you\u0027re doing it at speed and going around obstacles, you have to concentrate so hard you don\u0027t have time to think about anything else. That\u0027s the point of it for him, I think.\u0027Penny and the Duke \u0027get on very well together\u0027, he added.\u0027I\u0027ve seen them all together – the Queen, Prince Philip and Penny – at Windsor and she stays at the castle. They spend a lot of time in each other\u0027s company.\u0027Wood Farm was once the home of the so-called Lost Prince – Prince John, the youngest son of George V and Queen Mary.His tragic story was turned into an Emmy award-winning 2003 BBC drama.The Prince, who had epilepsy and learning difficulties, was sent to live in the cottage with his nanny to shield him from the public gaze, but he regularly saw his grandmother, Queen Alexandra, who was living at Sandringham. He died in 1919 aged just 13.Wood Farm had been occupied by a tenant until it was turned back into a Royal residence.Mr Vickers added: \u0027Wood Farm is more practical than opening up Sandringham. It\u0027s not tiny, but it\u0027s a normal house that anyone could live in. It\u0027s very un-Royal.\u0027Just, perhaps, the way the Duke likes it."},{"url":null,"title":"Dog undergoes lifesaving operations swallowing 34 Christmas decorations","story":"Share this article \u0027They went above and beyond for him and I will be forever grateful.

Dickens\u0027 character Fagin may have been inspired by Robert Mudie\u0027s descriptions of a gang-leader \u0027 of the Israelitish cast\u0027 that he wrote about in his book, London and Londoners The youngster mirrors the character of the Artful Dodger who, in the 1837 novel, enlists Oliver and introduces him to Fagin before moving him in with the gang of young thieves in Saffron Hill.The information came to light after The Times archive editor Rose Wild discovered the article in the newspapers\u0027 records.   Tomalin said: \u0027It\u0027s very striking, and could certainly have given Dickens ideas for Oliver Twist.\u0027He was planning a novel which was almost certainly Oliver Twist as early as December 1833. Clearly he visited the courts, and he may well have read law reports in The Times.\u0027 During the 19th century,  London was experiencing a slowly burgeoning immigrant population, with groups of black soldiers and seaman being displaced after the Napoleonic wars and settling in London.These settlers suffered prejudice along with many challenges, as did many native black Londoners who would often be branded criminals, uneducated and uncouth.     Twist in the tale: how Dickens found his Fagin in words of a crusading Scot | Books | The Guardian"},{"url":null,"title":"Army veterans reunited 60 years chance encounter Christmas party","story":"Share this article Widower Mr Halloran, who worked as a steelworker, said: \u0027We were in the same Company, and John was a character around the camp.

Opened two years ago, the hotel is billed as having “the worst view of any hotel in the world” and is filled with original Banksy artwork.“Love” and “peace” are respectively graffiti-tagged in English and French on the installation’s concrete blocks, while three large wrapped presents are at the forefront of the scene.“It is a nativity,” the hotel’s manager, Wissam Salsaa, said after the piece was installed. “Banksy has his own contribution to Christmas.”“It is a great way to bring up the story of Bethlehem, the Christmas story, in a different way – to make people think more” of how Palestinians live in Bethlehem.The highlight of the hotel is room No 3, known as “Banksy’s Room”, where guests sleep in a king-size bed underneath a Banksy artwork showing a Palestinian and an Israeli having a pillow fight.Israel began building the separation barrier – in parts concrete, with other stretches consisting of fencing – in 2002 during the Palestinian uprising, or intifada.Built mostly inside the West Bank, Israel says the wall is necessary to prevent attacks, but Palestinians say it separates them from Jerusalem.Banksy is known for making political statements with his graffiti, and has made previous forays into the Palestinian territories.In one secret visit, he drew a girl being pulled upwards by balloons on the iding wall, and he is believed to have entered Gaza to draw four street murals, including one on a metal door that depicted the Greek goddess Niobe cowering against the rubble of a destroyed house.The identity of the world’s best-known graffiti artist remains a mystery and he was not present during the revealing of his latest work.“Banksy is trying to be a voice for those that cannot speak,” Salsaa said, adding that he was “creating a new model of resistance through art”.More traditional Bethlehem Christmas festivities will take place next week at the church built on the spot where Christians believe Jesus was born."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ca0be7a5be16dae71c09dbcaa3be3a7e27d17bd/444_744_5206_3124/master/5206.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=675e20246575c759cff8719e5acd0bb4","title":"the big picture neil libbert harlem new york 1960","story":"A blizzard hit New York in December 1960, closing schools and businesses. Wandering the streets of Harlem, 22-year-old photographer Neil Libbert noticed a group of kids playing in the snow and began shooting. It wasn’t long before they spotted him and turned the tables, in time-honoured fashion.Documenting the street games of children was a staple for many leading British photojournalists in the late 1940s, 50s and 60s. In a less wary era, kids played out, often unaccompanied by adults, and their chaotic exuberance made great pictures.Memorable work was produced by Picture Post photographers Thurston Hopkins and Bert Hardy, street photographer Roger Mayne – who, in 1961, illustrated the Observer’s Review section cover feature titled “The private world of children’s games” – and of course the great Salford-born documentarian Shirley Baker.Another native of Salford, Libbert also honed his powers of observation and his clandestine approach to his subjects on the backstreets of Manchester in the late 50s, photographing street games, the down-at-heel and life in the snickets. His admiration for American social documentary photographers Walker Evans and Dorothea Lange informed his striking images, and his work opened the door to the Manchester , which he joined first as a freelancer, then on staff.In 1960, Libbert persuaded the paper’s features editor, Brian Redhead (later a Today programme presenter), to give him a grant to help him get to the US. In America, he took some portraits for the paper, but would spend most of his time as “a stranger on strange streets, meeting strangers”, camera in hand. This is archetypal Libbert: a witness in the background waiting to “pounce on that unguarded moment, because once people are aware, they pose”. Eye contact is a rarity – until he meets his match.In Harlem, Libbert’s stealth couldn’t save him. Earlier frames in the sequence (three of which were published in the  on 21 January 1961) show the kids playing, unaware of the photographer’s presence, but that didn’t last long. Once they rumbled him, kids do what kids do, be that in 1960 or 2019, their aim as true as that of Libbert’s Leica."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/216d02627020ec7006b639896bb66af7b0825f76/0_447_4724_2835/master/4724.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a677f27a650b04dfb02627faed1bfe7","title":"20 photographs of the week","story":"Anti-government protests in Santiago, the impeachment of US president Donald Trump, a girl power music festival in Buenos Aires – the best photography in news, culture and sport from around the world this week"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57c40338c936322ce12af66eb722951821821cef/160_272_2373_1424/master/2373.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=816ab557855012992144d534e38d181d","title":"amazing mazes cities puzzles in pictures","story":"New York-based artist Sean C Jackson has been creating colourful mazes since he was 10.

Her son, who is the real Dogger’s owner, tells all…Most mornings, when in London, I climb the stairs of the house where I grew up during the 1950s and 60s to what was my bedroom, now my mother’s studio – and there she is, at the drawing board, aged 92.The woman that countless grandparents, parents and children call Shirley Hughes and Philip Pullman calls “a national treasure”, I have the honour of calling Mum.The view beyond the winter branches has changed: cranes over White City, and Grenfell Tower. But the porcelain palettes of carefully mixed colours, and the design on silver tubes of Winsor \u0026amp Newton paint, are as they were when I was a child and Mum would write and illustrate her children’s books, listening to the Beatles, Billie Holiday and Edith Piaf.Sixty years later the task in hand these past months has been quite something: Dogger’s Christmas. It’s a sort of remake of Mum’s best loved and most successful book, Dogger, about a boy, Dave, who loses the cuddly toy on which he feels his life depends, the ensuing trauma – and resolution.It feels a bit like a greatest hits album. Mum has done other books for this season of the year: Lucy and Tom’s Christmas, one of her earliest, and Alfie’s Christmas, featuring her longest-running character. But she has never before infused Christmas Day with that unlikely superhero, a stuffed toy dog cuddled with such intensity that his fur has worn off.Last March, Mum had a fall and it was a worrying time. I can’t say I was surprised at her recovery, but Dogger’s Christmas, announced by Penguin Random House last week, will be, among other things, testimony to Mum’s resilience of body and spirit. “I have to get back to work,” she would say. So back to the studio: “My publisher said they wanted another Christmas book, and what better offering to my readers than a Dogger drama on the big day?”The original Dogger was published in 1977. Dave mislays his companion and is distraught, only to find Dogger on sale at a school fete for 5p. By the time Dave finds his family, it is too late – Dogger is sold. But his athletic sister Bella wins a prize – a huge teddy bear – with which she duly entices Dogger back from his new owner.The book has origins in two true stories. Mum recalls the first: “My mother, a widow, did not drive, and we were being taken in a taxi – a converted hearse – by a man called Eric Barrington from the Wirral for holidays at Llandudno Junction. The window was ajar and for some reason I threw my koala bear, Oscar, out of it. I have no idea why. Not for miles did I raise the alarm. When I did, we went back, Mother and Mr Barrington searching the roadside to no avail.”Then the second: the afternoon I left my indispensably favourite teddy bear in then-tatty Holland Park. “It was just awful: Dad going down there with a torch, climbing in, searching – we never found the bear you didn’t sleep for ages.”Dogger really exists. I was given him for Christmas 1959 (I think) by my Irish great-uncle, Hugh Hynes, a general practitioner. Says Mum now: “Little did Uncle Hugh know …”She made Dogger the hero of her adapted tale, giving these cruel real-life narratives a fictional happy ending. The book won the 1977 Kate Greenaway prize, the children’s books Oscar, then 40 years later the “Greenaway of Greenaways” – a bit like being the all-time hall-of-famer in the baseball hall of ame – weeks after my father’ death, while Mum was working on another book about a toy lost in this-time-enchanted Holland Park: Jonadab and Rita.“Dogger has become something of a celebrity,” says Mum now. “He was put in a glass box, on tour, at the Ashmolean in Oxford and Liverpool Walker Art Gallery. He has one ear flopped down, as it should be, and another that was cocked up from years of cuddling and has remained that way after 60 years. His eyes are rather far apart, which I think makes him especially endearing. He’s retired from the celeb circuit now, living in a shoebox, only coming out for the occasional photoshoot” – including last week for the Observer.Why did the book do so well? “So many children know that dependence on, and love for, a cuddly toy – and the trauma of losing it. But parents too: all hell lets loose when something like that happens in a child’s life, and no one can sleep.”But there’s also this: “The real story, though, is about Bella, her kindness and self-sacrifice, understanding what’s really important in life: Dave’s old dog and all it means to him, rather than this big, new, shiny bear she’s won. She’s a good sister, and a good human being.”Those who reckon that lightning doesn’t strike twice, think again. Dave is the same age now as he was in 1977, and dammit if Dogger doesn’t go missing again, on Christmas Day.Some might think that part of the appeal in Mum’s books is that life is the way it used to be, or should be – not how it is now. That could be true of Christmas, too. But it’s not as simple as that.Mum is not especially religious, but beneath her books, apparently simple, cuts a riptide which could be described as “christian” with a small “c”. “Christmas in this book is more about family and home than cheap booze and shopping,” she says. “Dave, Bella and Mum go to visit an elderly neighbour who lives alone while – please note! – Dad cooks. It matters a lot that the children know that Christmas is about the baby in the manger, the birth of Jesus and all it stands for. Whether you are Christian or not, there are universal values associated with Christmas.”Yet there’s always stress on the day. “Alfie’s sister, Annie Rose, throws a temper, over-excited there’s a battery lacking.” All this is nothing, however, compared with Dogger, almost forgotten in the bustle, buried under a pile of wrapping paper – then nowhere to be found.Will Bella do it again? Is Dogger gone for good this time? “I’m not telling what happens,” Mum rolls her eyes, “but it’s a close shave.”• Dogger’s Christmas will be published by Penguin Random House in autumn 2020."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bc8f41290223b1b12c012b7b170f4f646bf7c77/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae114dd3716fb1ef8bc315f65eeb962e","title":"co op goes back to its roots with move into academy schools","story":"175 years after opening its first store, chain hopes education can boost deprived communitiesYoung people in Co-op-branded uniforms are chatting among themselves as they walk along brightly painted corridors to work – but this is not a grocery shop or warehouse.It is the Co-Op academy Manchester, a secondary school that forms part of the mutual’s latest effort to put itself at the heart of local communities.When a bunch of young weavers in the Rochdale Pioneers Society opened their first grocery store on 21 December 1844, their hope was to promote ethical trade and share profits with their members and community. It was their response to a ided country rocked by economic problems with the poor suffering.One hundred and 75 years on and the Co-op says it is taking inspiration from those founder members, not only through selling Fairtrade goods and funding local charities through its membership scheme but also by putting itself at the heart of communities through the sponsorship of 24 academy schools.Steve Murrells, the chief executive of the Co-operative Group, says that by 2022 as many as 40,000 students at 40 schools will be wearing a uniform sporting the company logo.The mutual, which had a reading room above its first shop so that Co-op members could educate themselves, is planning to become one of the largest multi-academy trusts in the country.“It goes back to where it all began when school classrooms were above the shop,” Murrells says, as he tours the modern buildings of the academy in Blackley, Manchester. “A hundred and 75 years later we are refocusing back on that very much within the market of education. There is a full end-to-end solution for them with a modern twist.“We are taking things done in the past and making them modern and relevant. Schools and education are something we are quite uniquely placed to do.”Some may question the basis of the academy system, which gives businesses sway over schools funded entirely by the state, taking them out of local authority control where resources and best practice can be shared. But Murrells says the Co-op can give education a multimillion-pound boost through the use of its executives’ expertise and contacts.“We are trying to put more of the wealth we create back into communities,” he says.In a fast-changing market where new skills are in demand, Murrells suggests the idea that education is the sole responsibility of the government doesn not make much sense. He says the Co-op’s work with schools is part of a wider aim to help foster strong communities.“At a time when the country is in disarray, ided between the haves and have-nots, the country needs more Co-ops showing doing good is good for business,” says Murrells.“Inequality is really opening gaps between the haves and have-nots in communities in a way it has not had before. Brexit has distracted the government from focusing on communities. We are focused on communities and that can only be helpful.”Steve Brice, the principal of the academy in Blackley, says the Co-op’s contacts and expertise have helped the school get better value for money on a recent expansion project, helping it install a theatre, climbing wall and gym. He says its links with the mutual also offer pupils high-quality work experience and access to apprenticeships, which are valuable in a community challenged by lack of resources.Six years ago, schools wanting to raise children’s aspirations were hardly likely to be knocking on the Co-op’s door. The mutual’s name was mud after a period of mismanagement and missteps led to the near-collapse of its now sold bank under a chairman accused of taking class A drugs and paying for sex.Since then, the Co-op has trimmed down, also selling off farms, pharmacies and travel agencies to focus on a revamped grocery chain, insurance and funerals. The retailer is outgrowing many bigger grocery stores with its mix of fresh veg, Fairtrade goods and modernised own-label food, such as tempura prawns and woodfired pizza.The group is also reviving its image with campaigns on loneliness, modern slavery, knife crime and mental healthMurrells is also aiming to broaden the Co-op’s appeal with pop-up stores at music festivals including Glastonbury and franchise outlets on university campuses that he says are going “phenomenally well”. Franchise outlets will be a key part of the group’s expansion plans with the aim of opening 150 franchises by the end of 2020, up from seven at present.“Two years ago we spread ourselves too thin, trying to do too many things,” he says. “In the last 12 months we have started to articulate a clear vision for the Co-op which centres around our point of difference. We have been able to work out what’s really meaningful and important for us to do in communities to play a major role.”He says the Co-op grocery chain’s stores are partly protected from wider difficulties in the retail industry because they are mostly based in local communities rather than on high streets, which are suffering from falling numbers of visitors.Murrells expects the Co-op to trade well over Christmas but says the festive season is likely to be “bloody hard” for retailers in general amid the fallout from Brexit and the general election. “The mood of the country is still low,” he says.The Co-op’s history as community champion will help it stand out in difficult times, he says. “It’s about recognising the community needs us. Our ability to put real support and funding back into local life and the things people want us to do that government has been unable to focus on.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f3c336e6c7966cd986ddeff4cc3fb0dc20f7149/0_66_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f285d85955961470c50f0d68653a9681","title":"bjp citizenship amendment act indians","story":"Huge nationwide protests, involving people of various religions, professions, castes and classes, such as haven’t been seen since the freedom struggle, took place in India last week. To understand this outpouring of rage and euphoria connected specifically to the recent Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), and more broadly to what it means to be an Indian, we must look to the re-election of the rightwing Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) in May with an overwhelming majority.Absolute power became for the BJP a licence to initiate one draconian change after another, all of them in some way to do with the status of Muslims in India, and, umbilically connected to this, with the status of democracy. Among these was the implementation of a national register of citizens (NRC) in the state of Assam, ostensibly to uncover illegal migrants from neighbouring Bangladesh. The real motive seemed to be to identify Muslim migrants. The government made a promise: once this was complete, it would happen in the rest of India.Those who read this would have done a double take without quite knowing why. Litanies of religions and names have been common in testimonials to India’s ersity: the national anthem is an example. What felt wrong about this glowing reassurance and the accompanying list? It was the absence of a word: “Muslim”. If the bill became law, refugees would be granted citizenship on the basis of religion for the first time in India’s history. One faith, followed by 200 million Indians (the third-largest Muslim population in any nation), was to be rendered invalid by studied amnesia.After the shock of absorbing what felt like an unadorned expression of a fascistic vision, citizens’ groups, the press and opposition parties began to raise fundamental objections and point out the bill’s absurd inconsistencies. For one, it pretended the sentence in the constitution’s preamble that said “India is a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic” didn’t exist. Also, why was the government saying citizenship would be offered to “persecuted refugees” from three nearby Muslim-majority countries (Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan) but not, say, to Rohingyas from Myanmar?Once the bill had been passed in the lower and upper houses of parliament, Prime Minister Narendra Modi insisted that no Muslim citizen would be affected by what had now become the CAA. It’s worrying when a governing party makes as many reassuring noises as the BJP does. Reassurances are the domain of those who diagnose terminal illnesses. What’s being put to death here with the omission of a single word is what it means to be Indian: part of a fraught but great experiment that has no parallel anywhere in the world. Every Indian has contributed to creating India, and we – not just Muslim refugees – are suddenly being denied access to what we’ve created.The act was challenged in the supreme court by several litigants for its unconstitutionality and legal arbitrariness. But the Modi government’s second term has seen an exceptional departure from predictability in the judiciary. So the beginnings of the mass protests last week in Assam and Tripura were looked upon by those who opposed the CAA with conflicted absorption. Assamese protesters weren’t opposing the CAA for secular reasons they felt they were going to become minorities in their own state once Bengali Hindu migrants were granted citizenship. The protests reminded the nation of the extreme complexity (beyond the Hindu-Muslim binary) of India’s ethnic grievances. They were evidence, despite the violence and the by-now characteristic punitive response (such as the suspension of the internet), of the chaos and untameable nature of Indian democracy. Then swiftly, as if emboldened by the Assamese rioters, came student protests at two universities – Jamia Millia Islamia in Delhi, which has a Muslim provenance but where there’s a substantial mix of Hindu and Muslim students and Aligarh Muslim University in Uttar Pradesh.While it has been appalling to look upon footage of police brutality during these protests, it has been deeply moving to see Indians regain their voice. As has been pointed out, there are undeniable correspondences between the phases leading to the creation of Nazi Germany and what’s been happening in India – but there are major differences. Given how hugely constitutive Muslims are of India’s present and history, or how intricate the facets of Indian identity are, the fantasy of a “Hindu rashtra” is an unfeasible one. We must love one another or die.In the past week, Indian politics has seen the return of a federalism that the BJP is even more bitterly hostile to than Indira Gandhi was. Six states – West Bengal, Kerala, Punjab, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha – have refused to participate in Delhi’s plan for a nationwide NRC. Many iniduals have begun to go into the civil disobedience mode that Indians adopted under the British, saying they would either not furnish papers for the NRC or that they would declare themselves Muslim. Mass protests on 19 December happened despite restrictions under colonial-era section 144 (proscribing a gathering of more than four persons) being declared wherever the BJP has control of law and order. TV channels showed a student stopping the policeman who was kicking her friend with ferocious finger-wagging admonishment alone on 19 December, the historian Ramachandra Guha was dragged away by police mid-sentence in a peaceful protest. It is a time for shame and sadness a time of pride and joy. The “climate of fear” that hung over India, which I wrote about in these pages two months ago, is lifting. When will the BJP stop being afraid – of disagreement, criticism, political opposition, coexistence?• Amit Chaudhuri is a novelist and professor at the University of East Anglia"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd236837ccb6ab0ddc68bdd67ad9b93577623738/0_59_1476_886/master/1476.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e9517e4c7762b2c9471b2600d00e7dd","title":"only aamon the demon is fit to replace jeremy corbyn","story":"During a brainstorming session to debate Labour’s new leader, dark forces loomed largeBoris Piccaninny Watermelon Letterbox Cake Bumboys Vampires Haircut Wall-Spaffer Spunk-Burster Fuck-Business Fuck-the-Families Get-Off-My-Fucking-Laptop Girly-Swot Big-Girl’s-Blouse Chicken-frit Hulk-Smash Noseringed-Crusties Death-Humbug Technology-Lessons Surrender-Bullshit French-Turds Dog-Whistle Get-Stuffed FactcheckUK@CCHQ Get-Brexit-Done Johnson is finally your elected prime minister!

Young activists in the Labour party recognise me as a doom barometer, and tremble when they encounter me. I agreed to meet some of the optimistic hope vessels for a brain-storming session and suggested a fashionably minimalist Dalston bar called Untitled, as if to satirise the youthful city-dwelling socialists’ perceived cultural isolationism.In Workington, for example, pubs still have the names of actual things: the Henry Bessemer is named after the inventor of the Bessemer steel manufacturing process the Pack Horse is named after an actual horse that did actual work, exactly the kind of horse with genuine non-racist anxieties about foreign horses that is now deserting the Labour party in droves and there’s Vinnie’s Bar, which is probably named after Vinnie Jones. Or Vinnie Vincent, who replaced Ace Frehley in Kiss. Either way, it isn’t named after something that isn’t even a thing, like a bar in Hackney called Untitled where metropolitan liberal elitists go.“Should shell-shocked Labour double down with a new leader from its far left again or aim for the centre ground,” I opined, as the activists licked their alcopopsicles. “Sadly, no Labour leader, however convincing, can win an election while the lies of unregulated social media, the false claims of the Conservatives themselves and both the bias and impotence of mainstream media all remain untreated. In short, it doesn’t matter whose head is thrust into the threshing machine. They will still come back with a severely threshed head.” The youngsters nodded in baffled agreement at my aged wisdom.“A Frankingstein assembled from leftover body parts attractive both to the wine-quaffing, avocado-crushing, lentil-souffle-nibbling, champagne-socialist hypocrites of Hackney and the chip-butty-gobbling, fish-gut-snuffling, raw-offal-scoffing racist troglodytes of Hull will never fly,” I continued, holding forth. “And yet the Labour party thinks it needs to unite these two incompatible, and quite frankly vile and unacceptable, stereotypes.”“Then how,” asked one young woman, her mascara still smeared from days of unstinting weeping, “do we unite Labour supporters in constituencies as different as Hull and Hackney? I’ve never been to Hull, but I am told it is not the same as London at all. Do they have any of those cafes that only serve breakfast cereals, for example?”“Deluded strategists think the Hull-Hackney ide could be bridged by choosing Rebecca Long-Bailey as leader,” I condescended, “as long as she is made to visit more fringe-theatre productions, go around on a bike towing a trailer full of children in £28 Cath Kidston bobble hats and be photographed at Glastonbury dancing to Toots and the Maytals. Others think the solution is as simple as electing Keir Starmer leader, but never allowing him to appear anywhere except at bookmakers and never without mushy peas, curry sauce and saveloy dip smeared all round his mouth.”“You can get all mushy peas in the chip shop opposite the cemetery,” piped up Dan, hopefully. “Shall I ask them who their supplier is and then we can get masses of the bloody stuff ready to smear on Keir when victory is near?”“It’s too late for that,” I explained, leading the activists out across the road towards De Beauvoir Place, now rebuilt from wartime bomb rubble. “The media and the opposition will demonise any Labour leader that Turds faces across the house. Best to meet the problem head on. The party should be led instead by an actual demon.”“Come on, Grandad! Demons aren’t real!” exclaimed a spotty cynic, unaware that he was standing on the very site of the 1854 birthplace of Aleister Crowley’s acolyte, Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers, who conjured them all, one by one, and knew each of their secret and unholy names.“Not far from here Mathers summoned Aamon, the Marquess of Hell, governor of 40 infernal legions, in the form of a wolf with a serpent’s tail, retching forth flames,” I told the incredulous Labour party activists. “And when they walked south towards Arnold Circus Aamon took the shape of a man, so as not to cause commotion, but his mouth was full of dogs’ teeth and he hid his head, suddenly that of a hawk, beneath a black hood. In the words of Mathers himself, ‘Aamon telleth all things Past and to Come. He procureth feuds and reconcileth controversies between friends.’ Put Aamon in charge. You cannot demonise a demon.”“How about Jess Phillips instead?” piped up an insolent youngster. “She’d be a great match for Johnson in parliament. His cynicism and lies would look feeble before her passion and honesty and she’s properly funny, rather than just saying things in Latin. And she’s all over the detail, whereas he just wings it. And people trust anyone with a Birmingham accent, thinking them incapable of guile. It would play badly when Johnson bullies and patronises her too. The answer is staring us in the face.”“What use is this ‘Aamon’ of yours to the parliamentary Labour party,” squawked another youth, “and why is a demon a more logical choice than, for example, Angela Rayner or even Lisa Nandy?”And then I realised I was alone. The young socialists were drinking small sour drinks and sampling Japanese sharing plates somewhere. And I was on the pavement as it started to rain, shouting up at an obsolete golden chicken, perched atop a former Courage pub, now a Nando’s. “You finally really did it. You maniacs. God damn you. God damn you all to hell.”Extra London dates of Stewart Lee’s latest live show, SnowflakeTornado, have just been announced at the Southbank Centre in June and July, and it tours nationally from January. stewartleelive-dates"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2bb62fb05fd82211c96209459ed58fb17e7894d7/206_29_4000_2402/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6e6db2a8c174863ed4a6077c187a3f0","title":"do you have a favourite tree share your pictures and stories","story":"As part of a new series, we’d like you to tell us about your favourite tree and why it’s special to youAs deforestation continues to threaten green space around the world, and the ’s Christmas appeal launches to tackle it, we’d like to celebrate our trees.Outside of their ecological value, many of us have sentimental attachment to trees.

It is where I keep the homemade damson jam and grapefruit marmalade, preserved fruit and mincemeat, and pots of fig chutney.At Christmas, the stoppered jars are joined by glowing curls of candied orange and citron peel marrons glacés in pleated golden foil and sugar-crusted fruit jellies of orange and lemon and blackcurrant. There are bars of nougat and soft and chewy turron panettone and cellophane bags of rose and lemon Turkish delight that I buy loose and caked in icing sugar from one of the Turkish shops down the road.There is cake, too: a sultana and cherry freckled cake awaiting its blanket of primrose-hued marzipan, a stollen in a hinged wooden box, and a flat, snow-white disc of panforte, its icing-sugar surface studded with almonds, hazelnuts and candied peel. To their right are paper-wrapped, soft-crumbed amaretti in a golden tin. That dense, vanilla-scented panforte is the prince of Christmas sweetmeats. I’m not sure it is worth making your own. The best are on the soft side, wrapped in brown paper and string and are light for their size.I am making an ice-cream parfait for after Christmas dinner. A dessert to keep in the freezer and serve in slices (and, should you wish, trickled with dark, sweet sherry.) Think of a classic vanilla ice, but warmed with the butterscotch notes of maple syrup and flecked with crumbled panforte. A luxurious dessert, as befits the season, we served it with strips of candied peel. It has a hint of Christmas pudding about it, but this is lighter after Christmas dinner and, with luck, will please the plum-pudding naysayers.You may need something for the carol singers that is less work than rolling pastry and making mince pies. Some soft almond and dried-fruit cookies might be the answer. (Made a few days in advance they keep well in an airtight tin.) I will also mention they are good for crumbling into hot custard or ice-cream or for passing round with coffee after dinner.A soft, cut-and-come-again frozen parfait you can slice straight from the freezer.

Stir the warm cream into the egg and sugar mixture, then rinse and dry the saucepan, return the custard to the pan and place over a moderate heat, stirring until the sauce is thick enough to lightly coat the back of the wooden spoon.Remove the custard from the heat and cool quickly, either by pouring into a cold bowl and stirring for a few minutes to encourage the steam to leave, or by putting the bowl into a larger bowl filled with ice.

Place heaped teaspoons of the cookie dough on the baking tray, leaving enough room for each to spread a little. Bake for 10-12 minutes until the biscuits are pale nut coloured. They should still be soft when you take them from the oven. Let the baked biscuits rest for 5 minutes, then lift them on to a cooling rack with a palette knife.Continue with the remaining mixture.

Everton and Arsenal had created no more than three goalscoring chances between them but anyone who stopped to reflect was keener to dwell on the possibilities that lie ahead.Behind those doors both sets of players had just been addressed by their managers: the first time Carlo Ancelotti and Mikel Arteta had debriefed their charges on a matchday. The consequence was a collective spring in the step, a bubbliness out of keeping with what had passed and a sense of optimism that this time, under managers who set huge stock in making iniduals better, things may just be different.“Be brave, take responsibility and work hard for each other” had been the essence of Arteta’s message to Arsenal, six of whose starting XI were aged 23 or under. The building blocks would be enough this time. Even if the end product was sorely lacking they duly ran, battled, showed for the ball and did most of the basics that have seemed inconvenient to many of their more senior colleagues.They were enthused to learn afterwards they had done much of what Arteta is seeking, although at least one of their teammates could have given them fair warning of those criteria. “For sure,” Calum Chambers said when asked whether it was clear, during the two seasons he played alongside Arteta at Arsenal, the midfielder would become a manager. “When I came here he was one of the senior players he helped me and gave me advice on positional play. He was a very intelligent player – you could always tell he had that side to him. I’m excited everyone’s excited to work with him and learn his philosophy.”Chambers had just put in one of his best performances of the season at centre-back and been named the man of the match, even if he will have tougher afternoons. He was 19 when he joined Arsenal from Southampton and, within two months, would make his England debut. Since then he has plateaued, with loans to Middlesbrough and Fulham punctuating a bit-part presence at his parent club, and at 24 it is time to discover exactly where his ceiling lies.This is what Arteta will have to judge and there are several other examples of players in Arsenal’s squad who occupy that grey area between potential and fully known quantity. Lucas Torreira and Rob Holding are others, while refining the more frustrating tendencies of the younger Matteo Guendouzi will surely be a high priority. It is not necessarily anyone’s fault when footballers fall short of early expectations but they were usually signed for a reason, and Arteta inherits a number of iniduals who are not too far gone to reset.Perhaps that is one reason why the word “excited” arose several times in Chambers’s short conversation. “He was proud of the way we worked and how we worked hard,” he said of Arteta’s reaction banality on the pitch had quickly translated into buoyancy off it.Ancelotti has a similar task but his focus may be different. He is a proven cajoler of top-level players and one of the niggles over his suitability for the role is that Everton have few of those but Gylfi Sigurdsson comes close when operating at the peak of his powers. The Icelander is out of form, even if a first-half free-kick was one of Everton’s better efforts, and not usually the most effusive speaker but there was a sparkle in his eyes when the prospect of learning under the three-times Champions League winner was raised.“I’m delighted,” Sigurdsson said. “He’s obviously a fantastic manager with a lot of experience and a lot of success, so he definitely knows what he’s doing. He knows what he’s talking about, so I think the boys will have a lot of respect. We just can’t wait to start working with him.”At 30, Sigurdsson may start running out of chances to reassume his billing as one of the league’s better attacking midfielders. At that stage of a career it is easy to stop learning but Ancelotti’s name is the kind that makes senior professionals sit up straight. It is fair to think he may have a similar effect on players such as Lucas Digne and Richarlison, who are Sigurdsson’s junior but two of the more compelling talents from whom the manager will seek to extract a consistent tune.Perhaps it was Duncan Ferguson who best summed up the feeling in both groups. Ferguson’s moment in the spotlight is over for now but his enthusiasm pulsated around Goodison’s arteries long after the end. “I can’t wait to start learning again on Monday,” Ferguson said of assisting Ancelotti. “We’re in awe of him really. We’ll go on Monday and we’ll go with everything we’ve got.” For Everton and Arsenal, a brand new education awaits."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02cc6341779649f27912cc3c6914abb66fe3f389/0_32_2546_1528/master/2546.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2faa3d012c8f9548a647df4112fc8f72","title":"english football needs to lead here","story":"The sport has a duty to police racism within its own boundaries but this isiveness comes directly from elected politicians“Ladies and gentleman, this is a security announcement Racism is interfering with the game.” You can say that again. Welcome to Great Britain, 2019, a place of ision and ugliness, a place where a Premier League football match can end with eight minutes of added time for time‑wasting, VAR and monkey chants and a place where racist behaviour is most definitely interfering with the game.This was a wretched occasion for Tottenham in ways that go some way beyond a 2-0 home defeat by an impressive Chelsea team. You can raze the old structures, you can build a beautiful, gleaming stadium. Unfortunately, what you fill it with may not match the modernising dream.Midway through the second half there was a sudden stop to the game, like a needle jumping from its groove. We know how this looks now, that familiar spectacle of players milling around, ball disregarded, a sense of the day starting to fall apart a little.TV pictures would show the source, Antonio Rüdiger indicating clearly that he had been the subject of racist abuse from some part of the crowd in the corner by the home end. The referee was informed. The referee informed both managers. And three times before the end of the game the same statement was read over the stadium PA, warning spectators in a robotic monotone that racism was happening and suggesting there might be consequences if it carried on.This led to some confusion. Under a straight reading of the rules the second announcement ought to have led to the game being suspended. It did not. Tottenham later made it clear this related to just the one reported incident.In which case why keep reading the statement, which was phrased in the present tense as a continuing incident? Why shout fire again? It was, at best, confusing and inaccurate. As the announcements continued, a familiar thought presented itself.English football loves to preach on these subjects, which is fine when it comes from a position of moral certainty, but how far are we willing to go?This was an A-list occasion in the world’s most globally successful sporting league, watched around the world by hundreds of millions of people. The list of commercial partners across every medium is vast, from broadcasters to sponsors to pitchside placards, to ad break stings and shirt logos.What would it take to bring an occasion such as this to a stop? What kind of will, what kind of moral courage would be required to make Tottenham v Chelsea the first high-level club game anywhere in the world suspended, perhaps even abandoned for racist abuse under the new protocols?We didn’t find an answer here, presumably because the repeated warnings were simply some kind of systems error. Plus of course it is important to maintain a sense of perspective. The stadium holds 62,000 people and this was apparently the act of a single racist. The question now is how far English football wishes to go in making an exemplary stand.The idea of a three-step protocol has always seemed a little absurd.Who says you get two free hits, that only once a crime is repeated three times does it become a crime? Why should any footballer, or indeed any person, be expected to shrug it off twice, to offer a margin for indulgence?English football has in the past been willing to lead. Outrage at the massed actions of the Bulgarian hard right is one thing. But there is a higher bar here. Football’s wealth, status and influence comes solely from players and spectators. It has a duty to protect and care for these people.So why not simply walk off when this happens? Zero tolerance for intolerance: there is no obligation simply to accept the Fifa-Uefa guidance.The same goes for sanctions. If it is proved that one or more supporters did racially abuse Chelsea players, the time has come to set an example, to punish the club itself for actions that take place on its premises.A year ago Raheem Sterling was abused at Chelsea. This is far from an isolated incident. How this latest episode is dealt with will be a test, one English football really does need to pass, and without the usual shrugs of helplessness.“I hate racism in society, I hate racism in football,” José Mourinho said after the game. Frank Lampard was equally broad-brush, condemning racism in all its forms but still talking of needing to have it confirmed this incident did happen.Ducking the issue is the easiest option. It has become a remarkably unremarkable statement to point out that this sense of raised tension comes directly from the UK’s politicians, all too easy to state that racism is therefore a societal problem, that football doesn’t create this behaviour. But football does also have a duty to police what happens within its own boundaries, to provide a living example of how to deal with this poison.This matters, and matters in every public space, every place where citizens interact. Walk down Tottenham High Street and you can seen first hand the crush of cultures, the cheek‑by‑jowl existence that can be so easily inflamed by carelessness, stupidity, disrespect, deliberate dog-whistle politics.There is a chance here, and in every other case around the country, to do something different, to lead rather than simply react. Don’t hold your breath."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/148b317aa302eaab508db28471405c9eb64905c2/0_389_6727_4036/master/6727.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=303a9c5685f3a650e39c060001628961","title":"bohemian rhapsody inside new york chelsea hotel last apartments residents","story":"The Chelsea Hotel has been home to cultural icons from Janis Joplin to Andy Warhol. As controversial renovations continue, Colin Miller photographs the hotel’s last remaining apartments and their residentsIn 2015, an architecture firm approached me to take some photographs of the renovations they’d made to the historic Chelsea Hotel after the building was sold. The photographs I took were forgettable, but when I looked down the iron staircase I saw something of the hotel’s former glory. Pieces of the tenants’ artwork decorated the stairwell and amid the construction mess were visible signs of a vibrant community of residents who cared deeply for their home. I had only a vague sense of the Chelsea then, primarily through the film Sid and Nancy and from living in New York on the edge of the punk scene.An aura of fame and creativity emanated from the hotel. Former residents include Allan Ginsberg, Arthur Miller, Stanley Kubrick, Bob Dylan and Patti Smith Dylan Thomas and Nancy Spungen died there Madonna lived and shot her Sex book there, and Leonard Cohen wrote two songs about the affair he had there with Janis Joplin. Struck by what I had seen, I set out to photograph the homes of the last remaining residents before the historic units were further sterilised. The Chelsea’s demise was imminent I had a precious few months before it would all disappear.I met resident Tony Notarberardino for the first time in 2015 and entering his apartment was like crossing into another dimension. In his living room, lit by dozens of candles, my wife and I were rapt as he told us about his life in the hotel. His bedroom was painted in deep reds and ochres and decorated as a kind of burlesque netherworld. When we stepped from the hotel on to 23rd Street the sounds of traffic suddenly returned and we found ourselves back in the real world. But Tony’s home had created a distinct and powerful shift in my perception of the hotel and I began to form a deeper understanding of the worlds people carved out there: his apartment was not only an extension of his personality, but a collection of the lives of those who had lived there before him. The Chelsea is a collaboration across time, an accumulation of the marks so many have made on it. At least until now.The renovation of the Chelsea has progressed very slowly. The months stretched to four years. In the intervening time it has changed ownership twice and it’s still unclear when the Chelsea will finally reopen. At the time of writing multiple lawsuits are pending. In the midst of ongoing renovation there has been terrible destruction, but there have also been victories. The remaining tenants have claimed their rent-stabilised status and may remain. Things are changing, but they’re not dying, as I had originally speculated. And, over time, my project evolved from a requiem to a celebration of what lives on at the Chelsea.This project is about how creative people forge a place for themselves during times of turmoil. The photographs capture a moment in this process and frame an instant of a city in constant transition. Gone are the times when those living alternative lifestyles could find shelter in New York for meagre rents. But those artists who found that at the Chelsea have persisted they’re still living creative and important lives. On one of my last shoots I met artist Bettina Grossman, a tenant at the Chelsea. I noticed on her door, as I was leaving, a small scrap of paper with the handwritten words “Sanctuary – Protect the Magic.” I hope my work will help to preserve and share some of the magic.Australian filmmaker Tony Notarberardino moved into the hotel in 1994, eventually landing in Dee Dee Ramone’s old apartment. It was previously occupied by artist Vali Myers, who’d turned her room into a living art installation, and entertained contemporaries including Patti Smith and Salvador Dali there. She painted the walls in rich, earthy yellows, reds, and browns, interspersed with checkerboard patterns and animal portraits. Notarberardino has resisted the developers, and argues that his refusal to renovate or leave is an important act of resistance that will help preserve the hotel’s history. “People want to come here and touch the wall that Jack Kerouac touched they want that authenticity.” If nothing else, he believes, the hotel might once again attract artists and musicians at the peaks of their careers. “The Chelsea’s going to outlive everybody.”With her husband, nightclub owner Arthur Weinstein, interior designer Colleen brought up their daughter Dahlia in the Chelsea. It took a while, though, for Colleen to come round to the apartment. The turning point was when they uncovered the original marble in the lobby. Since her father’s death, Dahlia has moved back in. As a kid she had mixed feeling about living in the hotel, but grew to love the actors, musicians and writers who populated the lobby. “Everyone was so friendly and open about their lives and their careers,” she remembers. “As I got older, I appreciated it more.”New York nightlife icon Susanne Bartsch arrived in Manhattan in 1987. Of her influence on the drag scene, RuPaul said Bartsch “picked up where Andy Warhol left off”. The transformation of her apartment at the Chelsea has been a proxy for her personal life. With one boyfriend she added a bedroom and curved hallway, with the next she painted the hallway electric pink, gold, and purple, the bedroom red (with an antique opium bed) and mosaiced the bathroom with mirrors. When she had a baby with her third partner, they took over the rooms once occupied by Janis Joplin. “The Chelsea Hotel is a bit like my mum,” Bartsch says, because she feels taken care of here. An interior design feature once referred to her apartment as a museum, but, says Bartsch, “It’s not that precious.”Hotel Chelsea: Living in the Last Bohemian Haven by Colin Miller and Ray Mock is out now (Monacelli Press, £40)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aed152009290027aef0c1e323a3b624601590290/0_181_2992_1795/master/2992.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a1790b02da76ae8ff975408edb902af","title":"my lover has left me at the age of 77 and i miss her","story":"Maybe it’s time to concentrate on the relationship you already have, says Mariella FrostrupThe dilemma I’m 77 and have been married for 54 years. Seven years ago, I delivered the eulogy for a childhood friend. Afterwards the lady next to me held my hand and said, “Good job.” On impulse, I later found her phone number and called her. It was the start of a seven-year affair. She knew I was married. She was separated and later orced her husband. I told her that orcing my wife was out of the question. Also, I said eventually that someone would come along and steal her heart and that she would leave me.Our relationship was wonderful. In time she mentioned that she would like more. Even asked what it would be like if we were together all the time. I brushed these questions off, usually. I thought it was an ideal situation for both of us. She had grandchildren to look after and her daughter was going through a difficult marriage. Our relationship was not going any further. She turned 72 and I knew she was concerned about getting older.Well, it happened. Her only sibling passed away and a childhood friend – who she dated 50 years ago – came to the funeral. Afterwards she told me they were in love and that he was her soulmate. I bid her farewell and good luck. We have not communicated for four months. Do you think she’ll contact me?Mariella replies Well, this is unusual. First, it really is a whole new way of looking at what have been described – perhaps erroneously – as our twilight years. I used to regret the passage of time, as the births, engagement parties and wedding invites dried up and hospital visits and funerals laid a greater claim on my diary. Now I’m seeing the Eulogy Years in a whole new light. Who knew the whole funeral business was such a hotbed of recoupling? Perhaps since you now have a vacancy you should go to them more often, not just to say goodbye to old friends but also acquaintances, neighbours, even being a pew-filler at the ill-attended rites of strangers. Judging by your experience it sounds as though the heightened emotional atmosphere isn’t just energising the mourners to sing the hymns more fervently.The late Jimmy Goldsmith famously said that marrying your mistress creates a vacancy, and there’s obviously an empty space that you remain eager to fill. That means it wasn’t just an accident of timing and chemistry that spurred you into the arms of the lady in question but, rather, an unspecified and still unfulfilled need.I have to be true to form and sensible here. Why are you still with your wife? Do you see it as the decent, noble thing to do, despite your infidelity? Perhaps you’ve reached some sort of agreement that weighs the longevity of your union against indiscretions. You do sound like a casual Casanova, determining the boundaries of the relationship based on what suits you best. Is it possible that, even in your late 70s, you were just in it for the sex? If so, I don’t know whether to whoop for joy that the libido can “rage, rage against the dying of the light”, or curl up in exhaustion at the prospect of having to keep going for another two decades.I suspect you’re not writing to me for my wise words on extra-marital relationships but because you think I’m psychic! Sorry to disappoint, but I have no idea what your ex-mistress is likely to do. Your three short paragraphs are not enough to give me a clear idea of how this total stranger is likely to respond now that she’s found a less furtive relationship.What I can say is that you’ve had a pretty good innings. An enjoyable seven-year affair that’s left your wife none the wiser seems a pretty good result. You wouldn’t be human though if you didn’t want more. This inclination not to count our blessings but to want to increase them seems as natural as breathing to Homo sapiens. Having brushed off this woman’s attempts to make the liaison less ephemeral, you’ve now discovered what happens when that’s all you want. You won’t be the first man to learn to appreciate your lover once they’ve gone. Truly there really are only two courses of action. The first requires you to get in touch with this woman and admit that her absence has left you longing for contact. Though what you have to offer that she hasn’t now got is hard to surmise. The second is to thank your lucky stars for what you had and what you got away with and determine to inject a little of whatever it was that affair offered, even if it’s simply sex, into your marriage.To be revealed as a philanderer at any age is no great compliment but for it to happen when you truly are old enough to know better is bordering on embarrassing. My guess is that you’re a decent man who’s stuck with his partner through life’s ups and downs and, ironically, those are the very qualities that make you attractive to others.

Initial reports from Kantar Worldpanel, which tracks consumer spending, showed that sales of meat remained fairly steady at the start of the year.But since then the firm has charted a significant decline in sales of beef, lamb and pork, although fish and chicken have grown, and a later Kantar study showed that 1.31m people gave up animal products in January 2019.Although many of the new products mimic meat, fish and cheese, from BBQ ribs and bleeding burgers to Camembert and smoked salmon, some vegan entrepreneurs believe they can persuade people to eat plant-based food that hasn’t been manipulated.Alex Petrides set up Allplants with his brother Jonathan in 2017 to offer vegan-only food subscription boxes – frozen meals delivered to your door. “We don’t use synthetic ingredients,” Petrides said, “but we do use the language people are familiar with and can connect to.

For all the criticism and abuse lobbed at MPs, I’m still a cheerleader for them.”He will call for the country to “take inspiration from young people” and “try to re-establish a civility of discourse … It would be good for parliament, for democracy and for our own mental health.“This Christmas, I urge that political difference, personal courtesy should become our guiding lights in 2020, in the Commons, in our workplaces and in our homes.”After being elected to the Speaker’s chair in June 2009, Bercow promised to serve “no more than nine years in total” before abandoning that vow ahead of the 2017 snap election.Hoyle has called for his predecessor to be given a peerage, saying that Bercow had done some “great things” during his time in the Speaker’s chair and should be rewarded in the same way other speakers had after retiring.“My view is every Speaker has been offered a peerage, so custom and practice says that’s what’s always happened – I wouldn’t break that custom and practice,” he told Pienaar’s Politics on BBC Radio 5.“He has served the house, he served for 10 years, he did some great things – and that’s the difference.”Media reports have suggested Downing Street was reluctant to bestow the honour of a seat in the House of Lords on Bercow after finding him obstructive in the bid to deliver Brexit.Bercow’s conciliatory message follows his co-signing of a pledge by senior figures to use “moderate language”, after there was disquiet in the Commons when Boris Johnson dismissed the dangers of charged language as “humbug”.Bercow, who was known to raise his voice as Speaker – not least in his calls for ‘Order!’, uses his Christmas message to argue that “democracy shouldn’t be about decibel levels”.“An opinion is no more valid because it is expressed more loudly, repeatedly or abusively,” he will say. “There are people who cannot entertain the idea that anyone can honourably hold an opinion which differs from their own.”Calling for the nation to learn from young people, he points to how members of the UK Youth Parliament “respected one another and behaved better than many political campaigners two, three and four times their age”.The former Conservative MP also cautions that social media can “amplify hatred, racism, misogyny and abuse”.The Alternative Christmas Message will air on 25 December at 2.25pm on Channel 4, just before the Queen’s Christmas Broadcast begins at 3pm on BBC One."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b75d979e61e6b55514d4aa25b9fcf460792fce53/0_426_2320_1391/master/2320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e82c72e142c9898ca25ea4985d297a5e","title":"if you speak multiple languages which words get lost in translation","story":"Share your favourite words or terms that just don’t translateA new study has demonstrated that while words for emotions such as “fear”, “love” or “anger” are often directly translated between languages, there can be differences in their true meaning, depending on the family the language belongs to.For example, while the concept of “love” is closely linked to “like” and “want” in Indo-European languages, it is more closely associated with “pity” in Austronesian languages.The team behind the research say the way particular experiences are interpreted as emotions appears to be shaped by culture.Are there words you know which can be directly translated, yet have subtle differences in meaning?

Also returning were holiday presents, clothes and food that should have been delivered to the space station crew.After seeing this first test flight cut short and the space station docking canceled because of an improperly set clock on the capsule, Boeing employees appeared relieved to get the Starliner back to Earth in one piece.Recovery teams cheered as they watched the capsule drift down through the air and make a bull’s-eye landing. The touchdown was broadcast live on Nasa TV infrared cameras painted the descending capsule in a ghostly white.The astronauts assigned to the first Starliner crew, two from Nasa and one from Boeing, were part of the welcoming committee in the bitter cold. Top Nasa and Boeing officials poured into Mission Control in Houston, congratulating everyone on the landing.The capsule’s first trip to space began with a smooth rocket ride from Cape Canaveral on Friday. But barely a half hour into the flight, it failed to fire its thrusters to give chase to the space station and ended up in the wrong orbit.The problem was with the Starliner’s internal clock: it did not sync up with the Atlas V rocket, throwing off the capsule’s timing. The capsule burned so much fuel trying to orient itself in orbit that there wasn’t enough left for a space station rendezvous.Flight controllers tried to correct the problem, but between the spacecraft’s position and a gap in communications, their signals did not get through. They later managed to reset the clock. Boeing is still trying to figure out how the timing error occurred. The mission lasted nearly 50 hours and included 33 orbits around the Earth.Nasa is uncertain whether it will demand another test flight from Boeing to include a space station visit before putting its astronauts on board.Boeing had been shooting for its first astronaut mission in the first half of 2020. This capsule is supposed to be recycled for the second flight with crew. Despite its own setbacks, commercial rival SpaceX remains in the lead in Nasa’s commercial crew program.SpaceX’s Dragon crew capsule successfully completed its first orbital demo last March. While the flight to the space station went well, the capsule exploded a month later on a test stand at Cape Canaveral.If a launch abort test goes well next month, SpaceX could start launching Nasa astronauts by spring and end a nearly nine-year gap in flying people from Cape Canaveral.As its space shuttle program was winding down, Nasa looked to private industry to take over cargo and crew deliveries to the space station. The goal was to launch Nasa astronauts by 2017.Because of delays, Nasa is looking to buy another two seats on Russian rockets in 2020 and 2021 to guarantee a continuing US presence on the space station."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d223b2e342c82c2c12f00dbdba601c579671d464/0_153_4886_2932/master/4886.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1286ee03fb1917cb904d3018aa4b9e7e","title":"number of older people diagnosed with malnutrition trebles in a decade","story":"NHS Digital finds more than 1 million people aged 60 and over are malnourished or at riskThe number of older people diagnosed with malnutrition has more than trebled to almost 500,000 in the past decade, according to research.More than 1 million people aged 60 and over – one in 10 – are either malnourished or at risk of malnutrition, the NHS Digital figures showed.“It is shocking that 1.3 million older people suffer from or are at risk of malnutrition in our country and the root of the problem doesn’t just lie with poverty,” said Dianne Jeffrey, the chair of the Malnutrition Task Force.“There are other contributing factors which add to the risk. Public health messages that don’t always relate to this age group a lack of ability to shop, eat and drink at home without help. As well as loneliness and isolation, grief and bereavement, poor physical and mental health or a lack of awareness of the risks by health and social care staff,” she added.Data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (Elsa) showed various factors are contributing to the rise in diagnoses of malnutrition among older people. These include over 230,000 people aged 75 and over having difficulty with the physicality of eating, such as cutting up food, and above 1.9 million having difficulty eating food because of a dental condition.Not being able to afford to eat may be another cause of malnutrition, particularly for those older people living in poverty. Elsa’s data shows that over 360,000 people aged 50-64 and over 29,000 of 65-74 year-olds admit having to cut or skip meals because they didn’t have enough money.“Increasing numbers of people diagnosed with malnutrition is a cause for concern because poor nutrition can be both a cause and consequence of ill health,” said Caroline Abrahams, charity director of Age UK, a member of the task force.“Signs will often go unnoticed until they have made a negative impact on health and wellbeing. Malnourishment can cause long-term health problems for otherwise healthy and independent older people. It can also mean more visits to the GP, increased chances of being admitted to hospital and longer recovery times from illness,” she added.“It is sometimes quite difficult to recognise that you or a loved one is unintentionally losing weight,” added Jeffrey. “At Christmas look out for warning signs like rings being loose and slipping off, clothes looking too big, belts needing to be tightened. Look for dental problems, loose teeth, sore mouth or loose dentures. All will make chewing and swallowing difficult or some may just have a small or general lack of appetite.”For a guide on eating well later in life visit the task force’s website.A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “We must do all we can to avoid older people becoming malnourished, and better diagnosis and detection is key. We are committed to training all health and care staff to spot the early warning signs so effective treatment can be put in place.“NHS England has produced guidance to address issues such as malnutrition and to develop strategies to improve delivery of excellent nutrition and hydration care for patients.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd8c10f5f535a976db262a2a2bf79c34c95af571/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba201f8e352a323c07956e76379fc54a","title":"uk has second lowest number of doctors per capita in europe","story":"Study of leading economies says there are just 2.8 doctors per 1,000 people, with only Poland worse offThe UK has the second lowest number of doctors in leading European nations relative to its population, according to research for the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).With 2.8 doctors per 1,000 people, compared with an average of 3.5 doctors across the OECD, the UK shortage is second only to Poland.This shortfall of doctors persists despite the OECD research showing that British GPs and specialists in the UK earn more than three times the average national salary.However, over the past decade, the UK’s share of foreign-trained doctors has decreased slightly as the number of domestically trained doctors increased more quickly. This is in contrast to Germany and France, where the number and share of foreign-trained doctors grew steadily between 2007 and 2017.Separately, NHS figures show that the UK’s deficit of family doctors has also left some patients without the choice of seeing a GP of the same gender as them, with nearly one in ten practices in England not having a regular female GP.Patients at more than 600 practices only have access to a regular male GP, although they have the right to ask for a female locum. Despite there being slightly more female than male GPs across the country, in some areas three out of four GPs are male.The findings follow a report by health experts earlier this year that the NHS will never recover from its chronic staffing shortages, which warned that “radical changes” regarding staffing are necessary.The report by the King’s Fund, Nuffield Trust and Health Foundation said: “The shortfall in the number of GPs is so serious that it cannot be filled at all. The only way forward is to use the skills of other staff, including pharmacists and physiotherapists, much more widely and routinely in and alongside general practice.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b2e69955150132711d7f13040949df8564c8f96/0_313_5343_3207/master/5343.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77b05f7713acdbcbdc4966802f02c35c","title":"jaw dropping sport moments 2019 simone biles stuns world championships five gold medals","story":"American gymnast became the first woman to land two skills thought impossible on her way to five out of six world title goldsEven for those incapable of counting the twists in a triple-twisting double back or distinguishing an Amanar vault from a Cheng, Simone Biles’s triumphant 2019 world championships was a moment. In total, Biles won five gold medals out of the six medal events in Stuttgart, clinching the team competition and all around finals, before dominating the vault, beam and floor event finals. She is now the most decorated gymnast of all time at world championships with 25 medals across five competitions.One of the greatest difficulties of watching a niche, complex sport such as gymnastics is deciphering the difference between two routines that are usually separated in the scoring by only tenths. But Biles flew higher than the rest of the field, with tighter form and bigger skills. She is so much better than every other gymnast in the world that she makes the sport easy to watch.However, Biles’s victory carries greater significance than medals. Three years ago, she departed the Olympic games in Rio with four gold medals and a bronze. She had been the best gymnast in the world for four straight years in a sport that is normally too difficult and unpredictable for sustained dominance. As she inched closer to the Olympics, the hype surrounding her became impossible to escape. When her Olympic prospects were discussed, the question wasn’t whether she would win but whether it was possible for her to fail badly enough to lose. The pressure could have easily suffocated her. After she won her third straight all-around gold at the 2015 worlds, Biles spoke about her achievement as if she had lost ownership of it to the hype: “I was just glad that it was finally over and everybody got their three-peat. Everyone could finally put that out in the paper,” she told Buzzfeed.Throughout the first years of Biles’s career, the Olympics were always the ultimate goal. Biles and her then coach, Aimee Boorman, countered the risks of failure in Rio by promoting consistency throughout the Games. She was already miles ahead of the other competitors, so instead they focused only on choosing routines that were “easy” for her and were replicable on any given day, regardless of how much pressure she was under. They still happened to be more complex than those of any other gymnast in history.Since returning to the sport in 2018 after a post-Olympics sabbatical, Biles has hired new coaches – Laurent and Cecile Landi – and the 2019 worlds were a reflection of their new philosophy. In lieu of any competitive rivals, they decided that the healthiest way to keep her motivated after achieving her dreams was to remove those constraints and to test her own strength, seeing how far she can push the sport in the process.Throughout the summer, footage of Biles was disseminated to all corners of the internet simply due to the sheer audacity of the skills she was attempting. She became the first woman in history to land a triple-double (triple-twisting double somersault) in the floor exercise and the first person to compete a double-double dismount on beam – two skills that gymnastics fans had dreamed of seeing but never imagined would come to fruition.Many gymnasts can throw huge skills with their legs flailing and form deteriorating, but what sets Biles apart is that her technique makes even the most difficult skills look so tidy and easy. The few times Biles has stepped out of bounds on her triple-double, it has been because she overpowered the skill. It’s difficult to know if she has even reached her limit yet.By landing both skills to her feet in Stuttgart, they became her own. She now has four elements named after her in the gymnastics code of points. Each time she nailed them throughout the week, her smile was as wide as the five times she stood on the podium with a gold medal around her neck. She says that she took more joy from gaining ownership of those elements than winning her medals. It makes sense. She has already won more than she could have ever imagined, but now her name is indelibly written into the rules of gymnastics four times. Now her legacy is complete.No occupation in sport is as ephemeral as a female gymnast’s career. Most peak in the middle of their teenage years before puberty gradually complicates their battle with gravity. It is tough for gymnastics to build a worldwide following when it changes hands so frequently and the public cannot build a relationship with its top athletes.Perhaps the greatest reflection of Biles’s talent is that she has been able to bypass those limitations to enjoy a healthy, fulfilling career and her success has allowed her to build the following she deserves. When her videos flit across social networks, gaining hundreds of thousands of likes, it is because of the excellence of her ability rather than the number of Swarovski crystals on her leotard.Biles has developed as a gymnast with each year and at 22 is better than she has ever been. Away from the gym, she has grown from a wide-eyed teenager into a grown woman who is outspoken and bold. It is not normal for gymnastics to be part of any general sporting conversation in a non-Olympic year, but Biles’s enduring greatness has made it essential."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c22f177689b35bcc719f5827c24ffc45f8a14e6e/0_1_3258_1956/master/3258.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a15e231ff81a73c1f9ff418ae3655b15","title":"london irish bath premiership match report","story":"Seasonal generosity is all very well but, short of serving mince pies and sherry during breaks in play, London Irish could not have been more accommodating hosts in the last Premiership match before Christmas.Bath could barely believe their luck, gorging on five tries in the first half hour alone to leapfrog into seventh place thanks to their most comprehensive win of the season.Given the hard times Bath have been experiencing lately this was the end-of-year tonic their management were hoping for, although they will not bump into many opponents as keen to simplify life for them as Irish were. The Exiles have just started promoting season tickets before their move back to west London next season but this was a less than irresistible sales pitch.There were some mitigating factors, with the All Black wing Waisake Naholo back in New Zealand for the birth of his first child and injury removing Paddy Jackson from the fray prematurely, but Wallaby lock Adam Coleman’s league debut was far from auspicious and his director of rugby, Declan Kidney, did not look a man about to enjoy a relaxing festive break.“Our first-half performance wasn’t us and we need to see why that was the case,” said the former Ireland coach, whose side go to Worcester on Saturday. “Bath played well but there’s a lot for us to take on board.”There was an element of deja vu involved, given this was Bath’s 10th successive Premiership win in this fixture, a run of success that dates back to September 2012. It will hardly ease Irish’s disappointment that five former Exiles players were on the visiting teamsheet, including the full-back Tom Homer, the deserved man of the match, showing consistent pace and enterprise as his side registered six tries, as many as they had managed in their previous five league matches put together.Having lost their last five games in all competitions, Bath would have been happy enough had their first try, scored by the powerful Beno Obano from close range, been their only score of the opening quarter.As it transpired, from Irish’s perspective, it was just the opening reel of an unfolding Christmas nightmare with the visitors collecting another gift with the game less than nine minutes old. Stephen Myler’s attempted pass ended up loose on the slippery deck and Anthony Watson, back fit ahead of schedule from a knee problem to face his old side, completed a 70-metre kick and chase score at the other end.To add injury to this double insult, Irish also lost Jackson after he pulled his right hamstring trying vainly to keep pace with the flying Watson. Such moments tend to indicate a match when nothing is destined to go right and it was no surprise when an aimless kick by Myler was run back with interest by Homer and, despite the suggestion of a forward pass, ended with Semesa Rokoduguni going over.Could it get much worse for Irish? Of course it could. A desperate attempted interception from an offside position close to his own line cost a penalty try and a yellow card for No 8 Albert Tuisue to bring up the visiting bonus point with almost indecent haste and Bath clearly sensed an opportunity to cut loose. A flowing move complete with some delightful offloading, not least from Rokoduguni and Jonathan Joseph in the Irish 22, stretched the plodding cover again and the scrum-half Will Chudley was in the right place to complete his side’s fifth touchdown. Compared with the side who have huffed and puffed through the campaign to date, it was almost like watching a different sport.With their scrum also starting to go backwards, the second half brought only relative relief for the dispirited Irish. A looping pass from Myler was picked off by the alert Homer, who raced 70 metres to score at the other end, and even the home crowd saw the black humour when Nick Phipps succeeded only in hitting the newly signed James Stokes in the face with an attempted long pass.By the time Coleman cut through Bath’s mustard-coloured defensive line for Irish’s try after 58 minutes the game was long since up. Having missed touch one last time near the end, a chastened Myler squatted down for a while after the final whistle with both hands clasped to his head. Everyone connected with this horrible performance will have understood precisely how he felt."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/272de99d0ce633de61b67948611fe9d0ace42ef0/0_98_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c00f155b37c62b32f029f4a776028d1","title":"michael van gerwen eases into pdc world championship last 16","story":"Michael van Gerwen secured a rapid victory over Ricky Evans to progress into the last 16 of the PDC World Championship. The three-time winner of the competition thrashed the Londoner 4-0 with a scintillating display in front of a buoyant crowd at Alexandra Palace. In a third-round match lasting around half an hour, Van Gerwen finished with back-to-back 118 check-outs to remain on course to defend his title.Van Gerwen told Sky Sports: “I could have done a lot better today unfortunately. He is a good player and every set was a bit tough, but I didn’t turn up 100 per cent. I don’t like Christmas because of the darts. I like family time don’t get me wrong, but I don’t like Christmas because I need to make sure my head is on the World Championships.”Van Gerwen was playing the night after Fallon Sherrock stunned 11th seed Mensur Suljovic to continue her historic run. Four days after becoming the first woman to win a match at the PDC World Championship, the 25-year-old upset the odds again as she delivered a 3-1 win to reach round three.“I think she has got a good manager,” Van Gerwen joked. “No, we share the same management and she has done well for herself. Also the way she played, but now the question is can she do it for another game with 70 per cent on the doubles, 92 average so that is the question? We go a set longer, the first to four sets, and she will play Chris Dobey so it will be tough, but nothing is impossible. If she beat Mensur, nothing is impossible.”Earlier on Sunday evening former world number one Steve Beaton rolled back the years to beat eighth seed James Wade 4-2 and reach the last 16 for the first time in 15 years. The Bronzed Adonis made the perfect start to move ahead by two sets but remained calm and composed to hold off Wade’s fightback.At 3-2 up, Beaton saw his rival miss double 20 to level it up and he hit 43 to claim victory. “It was poignant really I had to play James,” Beaton said. I’ll never forget the 2013 one where I blew 122 and I thought I was going to blow it again, but I got over the hurdle and this is the first Christmas I can have at home and enjoy.”Kim Huybrechts, Rob Cross’ conqueror, was involved in a topsy-turvy match with Danny Noppert but came through with a 4-2 win. The 31st seed Noppert moved one set up and then into a 2-1 lead, but his Belgian opponent was soon fired up and began to score relentlessly. In the end, Huybrechts sealed victory with a 150 check-out much to the delight of the crowd at Alexandra Palace.At the beginning of the day, 2019 semi-finalist Nathan Aspinall wrapped up a dramatic afternoon session with a thrilling 4-3 victory over Krzysztof Ratajski. The contest was full of quality with UK Open champion Aspinall taking the lead and then moving 3-1 up before the Polish Eagle levelled.It was not to be for Ratajski, however, with the Stockport player prevailing in a tight game and another close contest occurred between Darius Labanauskas and Max Hopp. Labanauskas overcame some nerves to check-out double 20 and knock out the 24th seed. The afternoon action started with Stephen Bunting cruising to victory in 40 minutes against Jonny Clayton to set up a last 16 meeting with Van Gerwen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/046aded4767086993376d6ccab52deabd711f345/81_163_3431_2059/master/3431.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a564dab4574c6debaa9e76ef1fefeba5","title":"roger federer tennis muhammad ali","story":"Revered by rivals, adored by fans, the charismatic Swiss is fast rivalling Muhammad Ali as a sporting idolWhen tennis fans voted Roger Federer their favourite player for the 17th year in a row it might have stretched credulity beyond Planet Tennis but it surprised nobody within touching distance of his hem. There have been dogs in country and western songs not as faithful as Federer’s disciples. He makes Alan Partridge jealous.Federer’s house is so full of trophies, his wife, Mirka, and their four kids have to live in the car … No, that’s not true. But he is a walking magnet for accolades. It sometimes feels as if people want to give him an award just to be close to him. Certainly one hears the bubbling‑under orgasms at press conferences: “Roger, where would you put that amazing shot in your all-time great shots?” he was asked in Melbourne a few years ago. “Top 100,” he replied too quickly, before blushing.So what is left to get for the man who has everything his genius can bring him? A spaceship? Make him lifetime president of the solar system? A week’s free coaching with Novak Djokovic? Then, just when we thought his Christmas stocking had burst its strings, along bounced a bauble totally out of left field. In a poll conducted by an upmarket men’s magazine, Federer on Friday beat the seriously hip young American actor Timothée Chalamet, after a week-long people’s vote on Instagram, to be hailed as the Most Stylish Man of the Decade.Forget, for a moment, the Agassi-esque bleached locks period of Roger’s distant youth and ignore, if you can, the catwalk disasters at Wimbledon that once induced muffled sniggering in the locker room: the blazer, the military coat, the bizarre waistcoat, the grandad cardigan. Federer has been a suit man for a while now, a sober gent at last, flashing his accessories like his forehand.So, fair play to the 38-year-old father of four from a quiet Swiss village who strutted convincingly enough for the readers of GQ to see off a field including A$AP Rocky, Jonah Hill, Harry Styles, LeBron James, Kanye West and Ryan Gosling. (Andy Murray did not make the shortlist. Or the long list.)It is, it appears, impossible not to love him. A week after Federer and Stan Wawrinka nearly came to blows at the 2014 ATP World Tour Finals in London – because of a hot-tempered final fuelled by Mirka’s courtside taunting – they were celebrating Switzerland’s first Davis Cup triumph in Lille. Happy on champagne, Stan was tickled by yet another sycophantic media question for his old chum, and mumbled to himself: “We all love you, Roger!” Federer, who had also had a glass or too, smiled back. All was forgiven.Nevertheless, for those of us allegedly constricted in our worship by professional distance, it can be difficult to get on track with the love-in that often is nothing less than weird. It’s scary. It’s Beatles‑level adoration. When he won Wimbledon in 2003, the Swiss gave him a cow called Juliette. There is no denying Federer is the game’s most venerated player. Ever. Among all athletes of all time he surely is in the top 10, perhaps top five. Maybe he is No 1, the GOAT of all GOATS. Or is he?The only other sports celebrity to generate such levels of awe by walking into a room was Muhammad Ali. I recall a conversation with Annabel Croft at a tournament a few years ago as Federer strolled through the players’ lounge. “It’s amazing,” she said, watching heads turn, including nearly all the players’. “Only Ali has ever been able to do that.”Ali’s power over us was as complete as his mastery of his contemporaries but he brought more than punches to the party. He was hilariously funny, a bona fide wit, a dominating yet comforting presence, who could make outrageous boasts without sounding arrogant, then launch a rant against prejudice that entranced. He was simple and complex, a sophisticated naïf.Federer has none of Ali’s showmanship or complexity. He has never expressed a political sentiment in his life. He is determinedly Swiss. However, he plays a game anyone can try. Most tennis fans will have some idea how impossible it is to perform some of the miracles Federer produces under intense pressure. There is connection. What fans also embrace is the aesthetic component. Nobody can ever have looked better swinging a racket, so balanced and quietly powerful, so intelligent and intuitive, so in tune with his sport.There are aberrations. In an American-heavy list of a few years ago, compiled by someone who obviously hacked into the Bleacher Report website, Federer sneaks aboard at No 45 among “The 100 Most Beloved Athletes in Sports History”. Lance Armstrong was ranked No 8. George Best was at 97. Nuts.A more credible judgment by ESPN this year put Federer sixth in a “world fame 100”, behind Cristiano Ronaldo, James, Lionel Messi, Neymar and Conor McGregor. The rest of their top 10 read: Virat Kohli, Rafael Nadal, Stephen Curry, Tiger Woods, Kevin Durant, Paul Pogba.Federer cannot go on forever, of course (or can he?). Two years ago at Wimbledon, Tani Christiaens, a 42-year-old Belgian who had followed him all over the world since 2001, could not contain her anxiety when she told a reporter: “It is at the stage now where you have to appreciate every shot, every serve, every time he walks on court. We are blessed every time we witness him.”Julian Barnes, who loves his tennis, observed in these pages a few years ago: “Perhaps, when the Mighty Fed eventually does retire, he will become just an ordinary, down-home multimillionaire, tending his children and his cows behind the 24-hour security fencing. Perhaps we shall even stop being interested in him. And perhaps – is this possible? – his ego is so uninvolved in his success that he will enjoy this.”Barnes, incidentally, tracked down Juliette, the most famous cow at Wimbledon. “She was subsequently sent to a farm in Austria and slaughtered in 2007 for not producing enough milk.”Sometimes you can get too close to your heroes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a403f4580fbbbab4863f15ba0d4ed60809a0322/640_446_3558_2135/master/3558.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4248f1ef8e39cdf89223fa7f74e79115","title":"martin peters a life in pictures","story":"England’s 1966 World Cup-winning midfielder Martin Peters has died aged 76.

With old-school charm and thrills, it’s like The Greatest Showman minus the pop songs, although the soundtrack here is just as fundamental. Evan Jolly’s score sews together a dozen disparate routines with its grandiose, button-pushing drama cueing every ooh and ahh.David Williamson is the avuncular ringmaster and occasionally slightly inappropriate uncle who sets about gently ribbing the kids who come up on stage to be stooges in routines mixing groan-worthy comedy, magic and nostalgic sentimentality.Skill abounds across the cast, even if not every act wows, and they are all eclipsed by the elephants – life-sized puppets full of grace and character. Still, the humans bring surprises too. When it said in the programme there’d be foot juggling, I assumed they’d be juggling objects, but actually it’s people: one man tossed in circles by the toes of another.Other highlights include the most contorted contortionist I’ve certainly ever seen, Senayet Asefa Amare, whose impossibly twisted torso generates a mix of awe and ickiness. There’s more stomach-flipping in the wheel of death, like a giant fidget spinner-turned-hamster wheel hoisted above the stage, in which two men essentially attempt to outrace the laws of physics.Audiences today aren’t the entertainment-starved folk who rolled up to the big top in 1903. In a culture saturated with special effects, juggling an extra club or balancing for a few more seconds doesn’t excite. It is the moments of connection, creativity and wonder that matter.There’s real artistry in the aerialism of Daria Shelest and Vadym Pankevych, their “we’re so in love” schtick translating into heady rushes of movement, Shelest swooping up the hanging silk and into her partner’s arms. And when utterly fearless acrobat Maria Boldyreva dons a blindfold to be swung, tossed and, crucially, caught at great height by Ivan Fomichev, for a moment the music cuts to silence. We’re left with only the audience’s gasps as the soundtrack – and that is the best theatre of the night.Circus 1903 is at the Royal Festival Hall, London, until 5 January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5de9e89d39d1af509928376dc9d997db628e9b9/0_290_8688_5213/master/8688.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77ba543c66be1cbd0a4af8985b458a10","title":"this is not rule of law detention of huawei workers sparks backlash","story":"Arrests have raised questions in China about the company’s ties to the state and the wider tech industry Around this time last year, Zeng Meng, 39, was on holiday in Thailand, having dinner with his father. Suddenly he was surrounded by Chinese police. Plainclothes officers stood on each side of him, their hands on his shoulders, while another filmed the scene.The officers showed their IDs and said they had been dispatched from Shenzhen, the headquarters of Zeng’s former employer Huawei, where he was wanted on suspicion of violating trade secrets. Having no other choice, Zeng went with them, accompanied by four Thai officers. Within a week, he had been extradited to China and formally arrested.Zeng spent the next three months at the Shenzhen No 2 detention centre, reading or working out in his shared 12x6-metre cell. He was not allowed to go outside. The only television allowed was CCTV, which carried the state broadcaster. He slept on the floor.The police urged him to confess, but Zeng, who said he was not allowed to choose his own lawyer, refused. The particulars of his case grew more vague as authorities changed his charge to fraud. In March he was released on bail, which will end in March next year.Over the last year, Huawei, a private company, has fought hard against US accusations that it is closely linked to the Chinese government. At home, however, the connections seem obvious to former Huawei staff members such as Zeng.Huawei, whose name can be translated as “China is able”, is one of the country’s most important success stories. Founded in 1987 by a former military engineer as China’s economy was opening up, it has transformed from a small trader selling phone switches in rural China to the world’s largest telecommunications equipment maker.With almost 200,000 employees and operations in more than 170 countries, it is the crown jewel of China’s tech industry, a leader in fifth generation or 5G internet and the focus of scrutiny by western governments, which see its global expansion as a security threat.Beijing has been extreme sensitive to criticism of its national champion, threatening retaliation against countries that block Huawei from their markets and censoring negative media. Chinese officials have repeatedly said the government would take all necessary measures to defend the company.According to Zeng, that includes action against the company’s own employees. He says he was among five former and current Huawei workers detained last December on suspicion of violating trade secrets and other charges. Two have been released without charge, one has pleaded guilty, and another remains in detention. Zeng expects his case to be dropped in March.He said all five were in a WeChat group of between 50 and 60 current and former employees airing grievances about the company, including allegations that it discriminates against employees over the age of 34. According to another member of the group, two of the five detained had planned to take their stories to the media but were arrested before they were able to.“This isn’t just one or two times,” said Zeng, who believes the five arrests show the extent of Huawei’s “relationships with the government, the police and the courts”. “In China, all three can be manipulated. As long as Huawei says this person has done something, the police will arrest them.”Huawei declined to comment for this article and repeated a previous statement about one of the detentions: “We understand and appreciate the public interest in this matter. This was not a labour dispute, and we reported the suspected illegal conduct to the authorities.”The arrests came at a sensitive moment for Huawei, just weeks after that of its finance chief Meng Wanzhou in Canada and when the US campaign against it was getting under way. They went unreported in mainland media for months, despite Zeng’s efforts to attract attention to his case. Then in late November, one of the five detained men, Li Hongyuan, published details of his case online in a post that quickly went viral.Li, a Huawei veteran of more than 12 years, had been detained for 251 days on extortion charges. He said he had been arrested after he demanded a severance payment of bonuses he was owed. He was released in August because of insufficient evidence and last month the government paid him about £11,500 in compensation.His story struck a nerve. The national symbol of China’s success and embodiment of western insecurities suddenly became the target of criticism and vitriol from within the country, where people had previously rallied behind the minzu qiye, or “national company”.Internet users trolled Meng, the daughter of Huawei’s founder, Ren Zhengfei, as she marked the first anniversary of her arrest with a letter thanking the Chinese people for their support. Two hundred and fifty-one people posted repeatedly in the comments, in reference to the number of days Li had been detained.Images of a pair of Huawei handcuffs circulated on the internet and the criticism threatened to turn political. A list of “eight demands, not one less” of Huawei, a reference to the five demands of Hong Kong’s anti-government protesters, appeared briefly online.A statement from Huawei failed to soothe emotions. The company said in response to Li’s case that it respected the judicial authorities’ decision to release him. “If Li Hongyuan thinks his rights and interests have been violated, we encourage him to defend those rights through legal channels, including suing Huawei,” it said.Li posted on the microblog Weibo last week: “The idea that every person is equal before the law is a lovely wish. But it requires us, generation after generation, pushing for it.” Quoting an editorial about Huawei that has since been censored, he wrote: “This is not rule of law, this is using power to suppress people.”The criticism of a company so closely affiliated with China’s national interest appears to have disconcerted authorities. Comments, reports and trending hashtags about the detentions have been wiped from the internet. New articles have been deleted almost daily, prompting some users to create a GitHub page called “Evil Huawei” to collect “the harm Huawei has done and document what should not be forgotten”.When the  travelled to Shenzhen to report on Li and Zeng’s cases, plainclothes agents followed a reporter from their home in Beijing to the airport and throughout the two days spent in the city. The Communist Youth League of China later posted an article online claiming that protesters in Hong Kong had passed the  information about Li’s case to destabilise China. No protesters or supporters of the protests have contacted the  about Huawei.“The US government thinks of Huawei as something affiliated with the Chinese government, and the Chinese sometimes seem to act that way in defence of it,” said Julian Ku, a professor at Hofstra University law school in New York who has been following Huawei’s legal troubles.“They really think it’s a crucial company that needs extra protection and deserves extra protection. That really undercuts Huawei’s story that it’s just trying to do business,” he said.Legal observers said the detentions were markedly unusual, noting that before arrest, police usually require companies to have the evidence needed for prosecution.“Getting the police to act in these kinds of situations is very difficult unless you have bulletproof evidence. It’s very difficult to do generally unless you’re quite powerful,” said an expert on Chinese employment law, who asked not to be named because of their firm’s work in the country.The outpouring of sympathy over Li’s detention reflects broader disenchantment with the workplace culture of China’s tech industry, one that Huawei helped to build with its so-called “wolf culture” of punishing hours, self-sacrifice and success at all costs.Former and current Huawei staff complained to the  about subjective performance appraisals being used against them and the presence of surveillance cameras to track their comings and goings.“The economy has slowed down. There are fewer and fewer opportunities for advancement. They’re realising they’re just employees. They’re not going to be the next Jack Ma,” said Geoff Crothall of China Labour Bulletin. “People are realising it doesn’t matter how hard they work, they’re still not getting ahead.”Others believe Huawei’s accomplishments outweigh the grievances of critics, including disgruntled employees. One former employee said there was “a lot of unhappiness” when he left the company, which he attributed to “personal resentment”.“China’s 40 years of development has attracted worldwide attention and Huawei has grown from a very small company to what it is today. This is an achievement. I am proud of Huawei and China,” he said.Today Zeng hopes to build on the outrage following Li’s case and push his former employer to change. “Before, there wasn’t much people could do. That’s why we want to take this opportunity now,” he said. “Huawei is saying everyone is equal before the law. That’s totally not true. Huawei has all the resources, and we are just regular workers.”He referred to a line in an article that has since been censored: “The elephant stepped on you. You can step back.”Additional reporting by Lillian Yang and Jiahui Huang"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f209bab04565a51c21507a8f8dabac37613dea5/0_74_3299_1979/master/3299.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80a5f937b0723161e02997a8f82fd44e","title":"a christmas carol review twee free torment fest is a tonic for our times","story":"Children, go to your rooms! This is adults-only Dickens – a foul, funny and thrilling carve-up of festive flimflam that will leave you wondering if Scrooge is more seer than skinflintChristmas is for kids, really, we all know that. But this version of A Christmas Carol, my friends, is for you. Three parts, BBC One, an hour long each, adults only. Not because there’s any sex (although there is a bit of swearing), but because it’s simply … so grownup.We open on the eve of Christmas Eve, London 1843, as all good festive adaptations should. Our first sight is of the late Jacob Marley (Stephen Graham) being roused from his not-as-eternal-as-he-thought sleep. A boy is weeing on the “skinflint old bastard’s” grave, and the drops are seeping through the coffin and splashing on Marley’s face. God rest ye, tweeness, whimsy. Your day is done.This is a take on Dickens’ tale that looks into the darkness of the season, the unhappy hearts thrown into relief by jollity, and asks who deserves their share of joy. It incorporates a trip to purgatory for Marley, via a blacksmith who shows him the links in the chains he has forged before he binds him – each one made from the soul of a man, woman or child who died as a result of his and his business partner Ebenezer Scrooge’s actions. Marley wanders through purgatory and meets a figure stoking a bonfire. “I burn memories and old affections,” he says. “I am the Ghost of Christmas Past, here to smoke out redemption.” He tells Marley that his and Scrooge’s fates are tied – one cannot be saved without the other – because “it was with him that you profaned the soul of humanity”. Marley will be returned to the world above to pave the way. “By the time this Christmas is ash,” says the ghost, “I must search the heart of Ebenezer Scrooge and find if there is a tender place there.”Above ground, things continue in the same unblinking mood. Bustling, urchin-crammed exteriors are replaced by deserted Georgian streets, Victoriana-stuffed interiors with high-ceilinged rooms that are clutter-free and comfortless, and poverty-stricken ciphers with real people struggling to do their best in a world full of problems not of their own making. Tweeness and whimsy have made way for psychological realism. The result is A Christmas Carol for our times, and for many times to come.Bob Cratchit is neither a cowed underling nor a diehard optimist he is a man who can only push back so far against his boss if he wishes to keep his sorely needed job, and justly furious about it.And what a boss he has. Guy Pearce is Scrooge, as tall, lean, elegant and austere as the townhouse to which he retires once another day of extracting work from others, tallying grievances and wrestling with ghosts (for now metaphorical only) is done.His anti-Christmas sentiment is not a miserabilist pose nor an annual crystallisation of a naturally grumpy disposition but an outcropping of an entire philosophy. He gazes out at the street full of smiling passersby and says, almost to himself: “It makes me sad to see all the lies … how many ‘Merry Christmasses’ are meant? Why pretend on one day of the year that the human beast is not the human beast?” It would make more sense, he suggests, to do things the other way round and have one day of acknowledging all our worst impulses. They could call it Scroogeday, says Cratchit, and his desiccated employer is drily amused. He even lets Cratchit use his ink, as Bob’s own has frozen. “Sort of Christmas present, is it?” asks Cratchit. “If it were,” Scrooge replies, channelling the Ghost of Alan Rickman’s Sheriff of Nottingham Yet to Come, “I would have wrapped it in paper and ribbons in order to artificially increase your anticipation.” The entire script is as luxuriant as the visuals are bleak.There are hints that Scrooge nurses guilt and sorrow. He is assaulted by visions of what seem to be workers in cages, but his nephew – on a final, futile visit to invite him for Christmas lunch – tells him he comes anyway because his late mother, Ebenezer’s sister, assured him that he must forgive his uncle: “He is just in pain. A very old pain.”Towards the end of the first episode, it is clear that there are deaths on Marley and Scrooge’s conscience, from a fire in one of their factories – the resonances with Grenfell surely deliberate – but in their other outposts, too, across the globe, all caused by their relentless attempts to keep costs down and profits up. “We vandalised the world for this,” says Marley, gesturing at Scrooge’s towering house, having found his way from purgatory. The system, says this rich, clever, funny and courageous adaptation, implicates us all. It’s not the kind we’re used to, but it’s as fine a distillation of the wider Christmas message – and the wider concerns that animated Dickens in his weightier tales – as you could hope to see."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3df093759b10d1d0f167dabc1e082aa2c82505e/0_200_2344_1407/master/2344.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=292d0f92de1577fc230e642996187a9b","title":"board games books and brand new clothes a guide to christmas shopping in your local charity shop","story":"They’re the cornerstone of every high street – guaranteed to have an eclectic mix of everything from clothes to homeware. Here are the top Christmas gifts to look out for when you next pop in to a thrift shopAs shopping, and living, sustainably becomes a focus for more and more people, this Christmas is the perfect time to turn to your local charity shops for your festive shopping. Not only will you give what you buy a new lease of life, you’ll support your local economy and share the benefits of shopping secondhand. To give you some inspiration, we’ve rounded up the best gifts you can expect to find in your local charity shop.Winter warmersFrom oversized turtlenecks in fun primary colours to neat cardigans and always-appropriate V-necks, charity shops are a goldmine for knitwear, particularly around the time wardrobes are being cleared to make way for (carefully pre-specified) Christmas gifts. Let their castoffs become your festive finds. You’ll save pounds compared with what you would spend on a new item and you’re more likely to find something unique, so your giftee won’t have to worry about running into someone else wearing the same thing.Board gamesChristmas wouldn’t be Christmas without a good board game to bring everyone together or, indeed, ide them … Monopoly and Scrabble are mainstays in most charity shops but there’s plenty others to suit everyone. Take your pick from the likes of Risk, Trivial Pursuit and Cluedo, as well as a plethora of TV- and film-themed games and the latest releases.Bestselling booksAlongside some wonderfully weird 1970s recipe books, you’ll find scores of bestselling titles on charity shop bookshelves. Zadie Smith, Margaret Atwood, Philip Pullman and John Grisham are all regulars, and you’ll find plenty of new authors such as Sally Rooney and David Chariandy too. While some titles may be a few years old, it’s not unusual to find the latest must-read on the shelves, and keep your eyes peeled for signed editions for an extra-special touch.Chintzy chinaFrom cocktails served in teacups to unusual teapots becoming a major home decor trend, the popularity of chintzy, vintage china is on the rise. You’ll discover shelves worth of it in almost any charity shop you walk into. It’s the perfect gift for someone who likes their homeware kitsch. Why not use a floral teacup as a holder for a homemade candle?Classic recordsWith vinyl records increasing in popularity, why not make a beeline for your nearest charity shop as they have plenty on offer. As digital formats took over, people turned to charity shops to free up their once-straining shelves and, because vinyl was donated in such abundance, many charity shops sell records for as little as 25p. You can expect to find everything from classical and krautrock to electronica and soul.Brand-new clothesWe all know someone who’s a little squeamish about the idea of secondhand clothes. But luckily for thrifty gift-givers, charity shops are not only stocked with vintage finds and pre-loved pieces, they’re also home to a huge amount of brand-new, unworn clothes. A quick rifle through the rails of your local charity shop will reveal a whole host of clothes with the original tags still attached. You’ll find everything from bold, printed T-shirts and floaty maxi dresses to jeans and shirts. There’s an abundance of high street labels waiting to be found and, if you’re lucky, you might just stumble across a designer piece.Vintage sewing patternsMore than a million people have taken up sewing over the past few years, with sales of sewing patterns soaring. However, with some patterns costing as much as we’re used to paying for a fully finished garment, the prices involved can be off-putting. To keep the crafty person in your life stitching, have a rifle through the baskets of vintage sewing patterns you often find tucked away underneath shelves. Selling for as little as 50p, you could buy enough to keep them busy until next Christmas.Statement jewelleryYou don’t have to go to an expensive boutique to find the perfect piece of jewellery – there’s plenty to be found in charity shops and they won’t break the bank. Take your pick from delicate vintage brooches, strings of pearls (likely faux, but you never know), oversized earrings, watches and cufflinks. The shelves are full to bursting with an assortment of jewellery that will suit everyone from your best friend to your grandma.Toiletry gift setsOnce a reasonably priced option for a secret Santa, toiletry gift sets seem to get more and more expensive each year. Rather than splashing out, see what’s on offer in your local charity shop. While some people may be worried about buying lotions and potions secondhand, charity shops are very savvy with their stock. Anything opened doesn’t make the shelves and many branches keep high street gift guides from the last couple of years in stock so they can cross-check whether a set is in date or not.Show your high street some loveWhy not seek out the personal touch with your Christmas shopping this year and join Visa in supporting local independent businesses across the country because #WhereYouShopMatters"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b08e67d45c554e1416a0d05e20f37399801fb0de/2810_672_2638_1583/master/2638.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=641c6a1f2409434d9c09472aa8a21693","title":"weve become like a little family of shops we look out for one another","story":"For Karen Harvey, her shop Hoos is fulfilling a lifelong passion for Scandi design while also breathing welcome new life into her local area, writes  Malcolm Jack “I often get people coming in and asking me what the name of the shop means,” smiles Karen Harvey, founder and owner of Hoos. “Everyone thinks it’s Danish or something. It’s actually just how you say ‘house’ in Scotland,” she laughs, “it’s just a bit of fun.”Be that as it may, it’s a name that captures a lot about what makes Glasgow’s haven of gorgeous Nordic homeware such a unique delight to visit. Both in terms of its synergy of fine Scandi and Scottish design (“hus”, pronounced the same way as Hoos, happens to be the word for “house” in the three main Scandinavian languages), and also its welcoming sense of warmth and character. Never more so than in the run-up to Christmas, when Harvey and her staff embrace the rich northern European tradition of bringing cosy light and comfort to long, dark winter nights, with their twinkling decorations and friendly, personalised approach to helping customers pick just the right presents for family and friends.Home has been at the heart of 63-year-old Harvey’s entire working life, in different ways. For 30 years she lived in Suffolk, leading two charities that did revolutionary things in improving the lives, living circumstances and futures of vulnerable young people (she received an MBE for her services). A mixture of professional and personal circumstances led her back to her native Glasgow a few years ago, where she decided to take an entirely new career direction.“I’ve always had an interest in interiors and design, even though that’s not my background at all,” Harvey explains. “Scandinavian design has always been my sort of personal aesthetic, so when I was thinking: ‘OK, what brands do I want to do?’ they were the only ones for me.” She leased small premises on, at that time, a dilapidated stretch of Great Western Road, just off the west end of Glasgow’s central artery Byres Road, and with the support of her architect partner Bill, cleverly transformed the compact space into an immaculately laid out, bright and inviting oasis of select hard and soft furnishings, cool kitchen and tableware, lush green house plants, stylish rainwear, handmade fashion accessories and other assorted pretty things.Starting a new business in a new sector would be a daunting challenge for anyone, but Harvey took it in her stride. “I had to go to Copenhagen and be interviewed by some of the brands, because they’re very particular about what kind of shops they’re going in to,” Harvey reveals. She evidently impressed, because Hoos has become one of the few stockists in the UK for a host of hip makers such as Hay, Normann Copenhagen and Skagerak, to name just a few. “Most of my jewellery is by Glasgow School of Art graduates,” Harvey explains. “We also do textiles by Scottish makers. You’re not going to find these kinds of things in any other store either.”Business is going strong for Hoos, as it helps lead a local high street revival. Harvey is passionate about fostering a thriving community along Great Western Road, which has seen a host of great vintners, victuallers, boutiques, bookshops, bakers and cafes breathe new life into a historic strip of retail premises. She’s involved with Love Great Western Road, a Business Improvement District (BID) proposal encouraging local businesses to work collectively for a brighter, more prosperous commercial future. “It’s helped us to get to know one another,” Harvey says of BID. “We’ve become like a little family of shops – we look out for one another.”As well as local retailers pulling together to support each other, they all rely on their customers doing the same. By reminding people #WhereYouShopMatters, Visa is championing local, independent retailers to help restore richly deserved focus and footfall to our high streets. Not only because our high streets are at the heart of our communities, but also because great independent traders can offer unique and enriching retail experiences, where staff take a hands-on approach to helping you select special things for yourself and for the important people in your life. Shops like Hoos are working hard to not only redefine what it means to be a small, independent trader in the digital age, but also help revitalise our high streets for a new generation, and they deserve to be shouted about for it.“I’m really encouraged by Visa’s #WhereYouShopMatters initiative,” says Hoos’s Karen Harvey, “because it brings businesses like ours to people’s attention. Particularly among younger people, who I think are the ones who increasingly do most of their shopping online. If it brings Hoos to their attention for maybe the first time, obviously that’s fab. And then they’ll come to Great Western Road more often and see all the other fabulous shops too.”Here are some of Harvey’s top tips for great Christmas shopping experiences in her local area:Love and Squalor“A small shop just past Kelvinbridge. Rebecca is the owner and she sells clothes that she handmakes herself. So it’s like going back to how it used to be many years ago. She also buys in things such as wonderful socks and lovely Irish scarves, blankets and candles. It’s just a really nice experience going in there.”427 Great Western Road, Kelvinbridge, G4 9JACottonrake Bakery“A fabulous independent bakery, doing wonderful bread, cakes and bakes. In the run-up to Christmas they do all kinds of special things such as Christmas jams and other nice little presents. We feel extremely lucky to have them nearby.”497 Great Western Road, G12 8HLPaulin Watches“Everyone loves a watch – particularly a handmade one. Paulin’s designs are beautiful. They’re a young, independent company and they sell lots of other handmade things such as risograph prints by local artists.”407 Great Western Road, G4 9JAShow your high street some loveWhy not seek out the personal touch with your Christmas shopping this year and join Visa in supporting local independent businesses across the country because #WhereYouShopMatters"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71f2c9a26f832b9957df0f178b0e25d1a45f8cdd/418_2114_3422_2053/master/3422.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09930e09e9b7d6674f8445610cfea1b4","title":"the more festive the better how the high street becomes a special place at christmas","story":"Shopping takes on a new life at Christmas as the high street is transformed – as shoppers profess to having a little more goodwill than on your average Saturday and independent stores become the top destinationsAt the risk of sounding incredibly basic, I’ll confess: after the Christmas music, the decor is my favourite part of the festive season. While I’m next to useless when it comes to putting up my own decorations, I’m drawn like a moth to the flame to any household, restaurant, market or shop that has put in the extra effort. The more fake snow, twinkling lights and jingling bells, the better.In the car-centric Toronto suburb where I grew up, most of my youthful Christmas shopping was confined to the local mega-malls, which were unfailingly packed with overheated shoppers from Black Friday through to Boxing Day, so moving to the UK has been something of a revelation. No mall Santa, however rosy-cheeked, can really compete with the quaint holiday market in my boyfriend’s Lancashire hometown, or Kew Gardens’ festive trail of lights.That’s why you’re likely to find me gawping at the garlands over Regent Street when they’re illuminated later this month. The first major high street in London to adopt the practice of street-long decoration, Regent Street has been doing its Christmas light display since 1954, after a reporter described London as “drab” during the holiday season. Oxford Street followed suit soon after, in 1959, and by the end of the 1960s, high streets across Britain were invested in the new tradition. In fact, many cities now make an event of the day the lights are switched on, complete with fair rides, pantos and celebrities of varying degrees of fame.These spectacles aren’t just about dazzling onlookers. In Christmas and the British: A Modern History, historian Martin Johnes explains that light displays “gave 20th-century Christmas shopping a sense of occasion that differentiated it from the wider shopping experience that had become so embedded in everyday life”. More than just setting a mood, high street Christmas decorations make shopping less of a chore. If we have to endure the hordes each season, why not do it somewhere we don’t only tolerate, but enjoy?It’s not only the busy high streets following this logic. The coloured lights strung by volunteers in the tiny Cornish fishing village of Mousehole, all funded by donations, attract some 30,000 tourists a year to the benefit of local businesses. And for the last three years, Broadway Road in the Cotswolds has hosted late-night shopping evenings in December, with local stores staying open until 8:30pm so shoppers can stock up on gifts and take in a mix of performances in a cheerful environment. A friend of mine who worked at a Broadway Road hair salon recalls the time her team dolled up Three Wise Women and had them ride down the street on camels.Partial to a late-night browse myself, I usually venture to Mount Street in Mayfair to watch the lights get switched on, and spend the rest of the night wandering through the boutiques, sipping complimentary champagne and stuffing my face with mince pies to a medley of choristers and fashionable DJs. You can get the same buzz on many high streets in December, when independent shops stay open late and a holly wreath (or cup of mulled wine) is always close by.For all my talk about the high street at Christmas, I’m not one of those people who sorts out their list early. I pick up inspiration over the course of the year, and then do most of my shopping in the two weeks before the big day. That period, when the excitement around Christmas is reaching its peak, is when I feel most energised and most excited to take part in any Christmas-related activity, whether it’s ice-skating, eating Serrano ham at a friend’s flat or having one final night out before everyone goes home for the holidays. And in those instances, as with the shops, the more festive the environment, the better.Show your high street some loveWhy not seek out the personal touch with your Christmas shopping this year and join Visa in supporting local independent businesses across the country because #WhereYouShopMatters"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e525b0332feb76a5bf0c6cec4c2d4182c912f808/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46b245b4df27768c21d59e0336fc7b10","title":"2010s decade that left us reeling","story":"In 2009, at the end of the decade for which no better name than the “noughties” was devised, a flurry of books appeared that attempted to make sense of the preceding 10 years. Most were overwhelmingly upbeat. Some bore signs that their final, more sober chapters had been late additions tagged on at the end so as to acknowledge the elephant in the room – that the decade had ended in the most severe economic contraction since 1929.In a little over a week, a second nameless decade will come to an end and the 2020s will begin. The list of upcoming books about the past 10 years appears to be short. Journalists and cultural historians, the sort of people who tend to write such titles, are, it seems, as bewildered as everyone else concussed by the political and cultural blast waves that detonated throughout the decade. Few are confident enough to think that, in their final moments, the 2010s can be neatly summed up in book form.Ninety years ago in the US, Frederick Lewis Allen, the editor-in-chief of Harper’s Magazine, coined a term for histories of the recent past written in the immediate aftermath. He called the genre “retrospective journalism” and was himself the author of one of its classics. Only Yesterday, Allen’s history of the 1920s, was published in 1931, having been written during the early stages of the Great Depression. It took its readers on a tour of a nation that no longer existed, the raucous, booming America of the “roaring 20s”.The one million Americans who bought Allen’s extraordinarily successful book were able to time-travel back to those yearned-for days of wealth and hedonism, and in part the book was little more than nostalgic comfort food, eagerly consumed by people struggling through the depression years. But Allen also reflected on the inequality and the violence of a decade that ended with an even more emphatic economic shock than that of the 2000s.Today, Only Yesterday is a largely forgotten book but it could well stand as a template for the type of books we are going to need to help us make sense of the 2010s.Allen began the book by asking his readers to imagine that “time were suddenly to turn back”, and they were to find themselves in the first years of the 1920s. In such circumstances, “what would seem strange” he asked?It’s a question worth asking again, in the dying days of 2019, from which the first years of the 2010s seem as distant and as alien as the early 20s appeared to the readers of Only Yesterday.The inherent lament within Allen’s title also feels apt in the last days of 2019 as it must have done in the early 1930s. After all, it was only yesterday that the great indictment against British politics was that it was dull and uninspiring. What concerned politicians and thinktanks back then was how disengaged from politics the public were becoming.Only yesterday Donald Trump was a reality TV star, Boris Johnson was the Tory’s in-house joker, and Facebook was just a way of tracking down old friends, rather than an existential threat to western liberal democracy.Only yesterday the prospect of Scottish independence seemed unlikely and that of a united Ireland utterly implausible.Only yesterday the Conservative and Unionist party regarded the maintenance of the union as a sacred duty, rather than something that might be surrendered in a political transaction to deliver another objective. Only yesterday we would have dismissed the idea that any single issue, particularly one that was merely the obsession of a tiny minority, could tear British society apart, rupture party loyalties and even damage familial bonds – how many of us are about to sit down to a fourth (and hopefully final) Christmas dinner eaten under a strictly enforced, seasonal ceasefire, a ban on any discussion of Brexit, to prevent inter-generational conflict from breaking out over the sprouts and turkey?Looking back just 10 years to 2010, it is difficult to understand how we got from there to here but it is easy to see why we are punch-drunk. Since the start of the 2010s we have had four elections, (2010, 2015, 2017, 2019), four prime ministers, seven governments and three referendums (Alternative Vote in 2011, Scottish Independence in 2014 and Brexit in 2016). There have been five Conservative administrations just since the end of the coalition.Back in 2010, people were still debating if Barack Obama’s presidency meant America was on the road to becoming a “post-racial society”. Now, at the decade’s close, we have become virtually anaesthetised to the fact that the current occupant of the White House feels able to describe white supremacists as “very fine people”.In 2011, we were swept along by the optimism of the Arab spring. In 2019, we watched from the sidelines as President Bashar al-Assad and his backers set about crushing what little is left of the Syrian revolution. The first years of the 2010s seem like a foreign country, a calmer, safer, more stable place where they do things differently.Partitioning music, fashion and youth culture into decades just about works. Everyone knows what you mean if you talk about 60s music or 80s fashion.Politics and economics, however, refuse to arrange themselves neatly into decades for our convenience, and at times our determination to ide history up into 10-year blocks distorts our view.It is tempting, given the results of this month’s election, to see the Conservative victory as an emphatic full stop, one that in the UK definitively marks the end of the 2010s.Future events will almost certainly complicate that picture. And it is easy to subconsciously catalogue the crash of 2008, and recession it sparked, as the last big event of the 2000s rather than the fundamental economic and political fact of the 2010s.Recessions and depressions, unlike financial crashes, are not events but processes. They take years to resolve, so just as the reverberations of the Wall Street crash were playing out in the lives of the people who read Only Yesterday, the consequences of 2008 and governmental responses to it were the great seismic forces rumbling under the surface of the 2010s.Perhaps the ultimate inequality in a decade defined by growing ergence in incomes and experience was how the effects of the crash and the great recession were so unequally distributed.For millions of people who lived through the 2010s, there was effectively no recovery from the crash. Their incomes never returned to pre-2008 levels.The austerity policies of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition, which came to power just five months after the start of the decade, made things worse. As did the increasing casualisation of the labour market.The zero-hours uberisation of employment seemed, in some parts of the country, to turn most jobs into McJobs, not just low paid but insecure in ways that a Victorian dockworker could relate to. In parts of the UK, the combination of recession, austerity and long-term under-investment resulted in these places being seen as “left behind”, one of the new terms of the late 2010s.Little surprise then that so many people were in the market for a new type of politics.Only yesterday, populism was a term mainly encountered by history students doing courses on the 20th century. Ten years on and Trump has tested most of America’s “checks and balances” to near destruction. And he is just one figure among a global axis of nationalist leaders who emerged in the 2010s. In 2014, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan became president of Turkey, the same year Narendra Modi and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party came to power in India. The 2010s ended with Jair Bolsonaro joining the club as president of Brazil.The politics of extremes tapped into deepening insecurity, and was enabled by disarray on the left, but it metastasised through technologies whose full potential we had not fully appreciated in 2010.Despite mounting evidence to the contrary, we were still being told in 2010 that the web and social media had brought us to the threshold of a new and almost utopian society.The analogue autocrats of the world would be toppled in “Twitter Revolutions” led by demonstrators who coordinated their marches and their protests using Facebook and Twitter.In 2011, this sort of delusional optimism inflected much of the reporting of the Arab spring. For a few months, North Africa and the Middle East were viewed by cyber-utopianists as vast field laboratories in which the democratising and revolutionary potential of social media was to be empirically demonstrated.The facts on the ground, however, always suggested otherwise. Any delusions that the web represents an irresistible force for democratisation, any suggestion that the new technology was by its very nature on the side of liberal democracy withered to dust over these past 10 years.Not only was the role of Twitter and Facebook in the Arab spring enormously exaggerated, it was demonstrated, later in the 2010s, that the new technology used by demonstrators worked just as well when placed in the hands of autocrats and state security forces.The hit movie of 2010 was Aaron Sorkin and David Fincher’s Oscar-winning biopic The Social Network, which dramatised the troubled relationships between the founders of Facebook. What in 2010 seemed like a strangely dark take on a then celebrated phenomenon feels in 2019 like a prescient foreshadowing of a decade that was to come – a decade that ended with Cambridge Analytica, Putin’s troll armies and Mark Zuckerberg called to appear before a congressional committee to defend his company.To round the 2010s off perfectly, Sorkin earlier this year wrote an open letter to Zuckerberg in which he condemned Facebook’s refusal to fact-check political advertisements, a policy that Sorkin said led to “crazy lies pumped into the water supply that corrupt the most important decisions we make together”.We enter the 2020s free from any delusions about social media as the ally of democracy. Instead, we are asking a question that would have been unimaginable in 2010 – is social media, in its current form, actually inimical to the workings of liberal democracy?When the 2010s are too distant for retrospective journalism and are handed over to the historians, there is one key statistic that could determine their analysis.The decade might well come to be seen as one of history’s pivotal periods, not because it was the most isive or unstable – the 20th century alone has several decades that would be stronger contenders for those titles.Instead, the past 10 years might be most definitively marked as the decade in which the climate crisis reached a point of extreme urgency.The year ends with swaths of the Australian bush in flames and the Amazon blackened from earlier conflagrations. Everywhere are signs of ecological collapse, habitat loss, adaptive behaviours and mass extinction.Only yesterday we had an opportunity – perhaps our last – to change course. In the flurry of events and in the face of constant distraction, we let our attention be drawn elsewhere.That failure is one that future generations will struggle to understand, or forgive.A decade ago, electric vehicles were poised to whisk us silently and smoothly around our cities, replacing dirty motors with a new generation of technologically sophisticated smart cars. In fact, the bottom fell out of the car market altogether. Sales dropped to pre-2008 levels as millennials turned their backs on cars, be they electric or petrol-powered. Instead, the electric bike came to represent a shift to healthier, more sustainable, low-tech, low-impact transport. Ebikes became a non-car solution to our car problems. The pundits were right: it’s an electric vehicle, just with two wheels instead of four. Martin LoveGame of ThronesHBO’s adaptation of George RR Martin’s bestselling fantasy series bestrode the global television landscape from 2011 to its end earlier this year. Along the way, it became the most illegally downloaded TV show of all time, a drama adored by presidents and rappers alike, which, in its first seasons at least, provided some of the biggest shocks ever seen on the small screen. It ended with more of a whimper than a bang thanks to a isive final season. Sarah Hughes At the beginning of the decade, the 2010 Nobel physics prize was awarded to Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov ‘for ground-breaking experiments regarding the two-dimensional material graphene’. Suddenly, everyone was talking about a material made of a single lattice layer of carbon atoms that had remarkable abilities to transmit heat and electricity while also being extremely strong. Suggested applications include improved camera sensors, DNA sequencing, gas sensing, material strengthening, and water desalination. To date, none of these ideas has been turned into devices but it took two centuries of work with silicon before engineers got the full potential out of that material. Robin McKie This was the decade when we became obsessed with taking 10,000 steps a day. According to science, the health benefits are moot but that didn’t stop Silicon Valley firms like Fitbit and Garmin coaxing us into wearing fitness trackers packed with accelerometers and sensors. These data-harvesting devices track our locations, our heart rates, our sleeping patterns and our exercise habits. Who gets the most use from this torrent of data – iniduals or the ‘data industrial complex’- is debatable. Ian TuckerIt was the object that came to represent the culture wars in the restaurant world throughout the decade that drew the line between content and style. It didn’t matter that many chefs just thought it made a nice change from the plate. The roof slate as food serving item became a hate object. In 2010, during a review of a Sheffield restaurant, I merely referred to it as a “serving slate” as if that were a thing. By 2015, when the hugely successful Twitter account We Want Plates was launched specifically to mock dismal non-plate serving items, the slate had come to represent all that was wrong with over-wrought food presentation. It’s still out there. I was served a dessert on one only a few weeks ago. But now the digital eye-roll is guaranteed. Jay RaynerAfter Lena Dunham sent up the concept in Girls, you’d think we’d be wary of calling anyone ‘the voice of a generation’ – yet it happened with Sally Rooney. The Irish writer’s debut, Conversations with Friends, was published when she was 26, but it was the phenomenally successful Normal People in 2018, following the intense, shifting relationship of students Connell and Marianne, that confirmed her brilliance at capturing the experience of being young in the 2010s. Holly WilliamsSadly, it has to be the Amazon Echo ‘smart’ speaker. Sadly because it represented the moment when a tech giant finally broke through the last barrier protecting our privacy – our homes. Alexa exploited our fatal addiction to convenience. And the sales it produces for Amazon far outweigh its loss-making initial cost. John NaughtonTen years ago, coffee shop chains were springing up on high streets across the UK, but with the ‘grab it and go’ revolution came an explosion in the number of disposable coffee cups used – and just as quickly thrown away. It took campaigner Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall to reveal in his War on Waste programme that some 2.5bn of them end up in landfill in the UK every year. Enter the refillable, reusable portable coffee cup which all retailers now sell and which every smart, eco-conscious consumer should carry in their bag. Designs are improving, and often get you a discount to boot. Rebecca SmithersRagnar Kjartansson’s legendary nine-screen installation of 2012 toured the world to universal acclaim, raising the entire level of film art. Shot in one take, in a crumbling US mansion, each screen shows a lone musician in a separate room – drummer in the kitchen, pianist in the salon, Kjartansson on guitar in the bath. Although they cannot see each other, all unwittingly contribute to an astonishingly beautiful lament for the Icelandic artist’s failed marriage. A visual and harmonic feat that mesmerised audiences with its Shakespearian beauty. Laura CummingLet’s look on the bright side: not on the investment of surplus value in hermetically sealed towers and iconic gee-gaws but in the rise of a technology that might just reduce the impact of construction on the atmosphere. This is cross-laminated timber, in essence a sort of super-plywood, which makes buildings out of the renewable resources that are trees. It wasn’t invented in the last decade, but the 2010s saw its application for the first time to buildings both large and high. The future has ways of making faith in such products look foolish, but here’s hoping that it becomes as commonplace as reinforced concrete is now.

Many steps remain before final election results are certified, to ensure the Afghan people have confidence in the results,” John Bass, the ambassador to Afghanistan, said in a post on Twitter.With 9.7 million registered voters, according to the IEC, turnout was at a record low for an Afghan presidential election. Last month, the IEC began recounting thousands of votes due to what it described as discrepancies in its system. Abdullah’s side objected to the recount and called it an attempt to add more votes in favour of Ghani. The IEC dismissed those allegations.In protest, Abdullah’s supporters blocked IEC offices in seven northern provinces to prevent the recount, creating delays in the results’ announcement. Last week, Abdullah allowed the recount but warned that he would not accept a tainted result.“The result that stands is based on fraud and without considering our legitimate demands, will never be accepted,” Abdullah Abdullah’s office said in statement on Sunday.The situation echoes 2014, when both Ghani and Abdullah alleged massive fraud by the other, forcing the US to broker an awkward power-sharing arrangement that made Ghani president and Abdullah his chief executive.Aides close to Ghani, a western-educated former World Bank official, said the incumbent was not ready for another power-sharing deal with Abdullah, a former medical doctor and three-time contender for the presidency.Without a unifying leader accepted by all sides, Afghanistan could split further along tribal and ethnic lines.The election result also comes at a critical time for Afghanistan as the US is showing more interest in negotiating a peace settlement with the Taliban to end a war that has dragged on for more than 18 years.Eighty-five civilians were killed and more than 370 wounded in militant attacks and violence on the day of the election, the United Nations said last month, and the country plunged into chaos with both Ghani’s and Abdullah’s camps claiming victory before ballots had been tallied.Election result announcements in Afghanistan are typically followed by violent protests from supporters of losing candidates."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c21a3f4eaac781106d120f3ad1333f451fe69ef9/392_603_4769_2862/master/4769.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4c1c31d07d9e8049d2c7df75b37f27e","title":"gateshead torah on tyne britains orthodox jewish community","story":"The finest religious education, affordable housing and a dynamic rabbi have given Gateshead a shot in the armOn a residential street in Gateshead, an unexpected sound drifts from open windows. It is the murmurings of hundreds of young men as they read aloud from the Torah or explore the meaning of the religious texts.Not so long ago, the soundtrack of this city on the river Tyne was the noise of heavy industry: shipbuilding, engineering, coalmining. It was all gone by the 1980s and 90s and, like so many other places, Gateshead struggled with unemployment, deprivation and loss of identity. Now it is home to the fastest-growing strictly Orthodox Jewish community in the UK, fuelled by the reputation of its educational establishments and cheap housing.“Gateshead is the Oxbridge of the UK Jewish community,” said Rabbi Shraga Feivel Zimmerman, a New Yorker known to his congregants simply as “the rov”, meaning notable rabbi. Since he arrived from Brooklyn in 2008, the community has doubled in size. “I hope I’ve helped the community to adapt to make it fertile ground for growth.”Gateshead was “quite a distance in miles, culture and mentality” from Brooklyn, said Zimmerman, but he came for the “unique opportunity to lead a community”. “England is a very conservative place and resistant to change in many ways. If you come from the outside, you have a fresh perspective.”The rabbi is credited with turning the community to engage with wider society. Links between the community and Gateshead council, the local further education college and other mainstream institutions have been nurtured. But Zimmerman is conscious of the potential downside of rapid growth. “One seeks a positive dynamic while still retaining a sense of community. Everyone here still knows each other, shares in each other’s celebrations, grieves together. We don’t want to keep doubling every 10 years,” he said.At the yeshiva, as everyone calls the Talmudical College, young men between the ages of 16 and early 20s study and debate religious texts in pairs for about 12 hours a day. They live in dormitories, have no access to smartphones, television or mainstream newspapers, and limited internet access.Nineteen-year-old Dovid Belovski, a Londoner in his second year at the yeshiva, said: “It’s intense, I can’t deny that. But I came here to be challenged, I never expected it to be easy. It’s the foundation for my life.”Studying at the Gateshead yeshiva may also improve a young man’s marriage prospects. The college’s graduates are considered a high-status catch by ultra-Orthodox parents seeking a match for their daughters.But, said David Schleider, who runs a youth club for boys in the community, “not everyone is cut out to be a rabbi or a teacher. We want to encourage those who aren’t to be skilled up while maintaining a full religious lifestyle. We have a very good relationship with Gateshead College, which provides culturally sensitive and accessible training.”In Orthodox Judaism, women cannot become rabbis, but bright girls are encouraged to teach. About 450 girls aged 16-plus – more than a quarter from abroad – are enrolled at the Jewish Teachers’ Training College in Gateshead, which offers A-levels in maths, biology, biblical Hebrew, computer science and art, as well as teacher training. Another girls’ seminary in the community has a more vocational focus, offering courses in information technology, health and childcare.A 2015 study by the Institute for Jewish Policy Research said the average birth rate among ultra-Orthodox women was seven, compared to 1.98 for mainstream Jewish women. A group of women community leaders in Gateshead, who all work outside the home, acknowledged the challenges of large families but spoke assertively about being fulfilled professionally, religiously, and as mothers and home-makers.One consequence of the expanding community is the growing number of businesses owned and run by strictly Orthodox Jews. Kosher bakery goods, milk and meat are produced locally. Blooms, a food takeaway that opened a few years ago with the blessing of Rabbi Zimmerman, is Jewish-owned but is partly staffed by young Geordie women who blithely talk through the requirements of kosher food preparation in between gentle banter with their ultra-Orthodox customers.Low house prices have helped the community to grow. One man who moved to Gateshead from north London a few years ago bought a six-bedroom house for £150,000. “It needed a lot of work but in London it would have cost at least £1m,” he said. Four years ago, the community completed its first social housing project, consisting of 12 four- or five-bedroom houses for rent.“Housing here is significantly cheaper than in London or even Manchester. But lots of families are low-income households, in receipt of benefits, and we tend to have bigger than average families. So there is a big demand for large affordable homes,” said Shlomi Isaacson of the Jewish Community Council of Gateshead (JCCG).Antisemitism appears to be less prevalent than in other places with high ultra-Orthodox Jewish populations. Nevertheless, the yeshiva has 80 CCTV cameras plus security guards. Most incidents fall into the “low-level antisocial antisemitism” category, said Jonathan Klajn, also of the JCCG. “It’s par for the course for someone to drive down the road, roll down their window and shout expletives at us. We’re uncomfortable with the security presence, but it’s a deterrent.” He added: “We rub along fine with the local Muslims.”The JCCG and representatives of Gateshead council meet regularly to discuss the needs of the community. “We recognised the culture and lifestyle of our Orthodox community is quite different to other communities,” said Dave Andrew, who has liaised on behalf of the council for the past 10 years.“Communication is the key, given that many households don’t engage with mainstream or social media so we need to ensure they get to hear what’s happening. This is not an insular community, but the reason for that perception is that it’s a community that helps itself at every life stage from the cradle to the grave.”Rabbi Zimmerman – who answers about 500 emails a week seeking guidance on Jewish law and practice – also rejected the suggestion of insularity, saying the community was independent and self-sustaining. “In former times, children grew up and left, they moved on to a larger world,” he said. “Now it’s a realistic option to stay.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2aa27a2a6980706253837154bb186c66724e72cb/0_38_2835_1701/master/2835.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f1b2219d0054456ef089ee89b81818a","title":"narendra modi defends contentious citizenship law as clashes continue india","story":"PM denies law is anti-Muslim as police clash with demonstrators across IndiaClashes have continued between Indian police and protesters angered by a new citizenship law that excludes Muslims, as the prime minister, Narendra Modi, used a rally for his Hindu nationalist party to defend the legislation, accusing the opposition of pushing the country into a “fear psychosis”.Twenty-three people have been killed nationwide since the law was passed in parliament earlier this month in protests that represent the first major roadblock for Modi’s Hindu nationalist agenda since his party’s landslide re-election last spring.Authorities across the country have scrambled to contain the situation, banning public gatherings and blocking internet access. India’s Ministry of Information and Broadcasting issued an advisory on Friday night asking broadcasters across the country to refrain from using content that could inflame further violence.Modi took the stage at a rally in the capital, launching his Bharatiya Janata party’s campaign for New Delhi legislative assembly elections in February, and quickly turned to the contentious new law.“People who are trying to spread lies and fear, look at my work. If you see any trace of isiveness in my work, show it to the world,” he said.Modi accused the main opposition Congress party of conspiring “to push not only New Delhi but other parts of the country into a fear psychosis”.“They are trying every tactic to push me out of power,” he said, urging protesters to desist from attacks on police and other violence.The law allows Hindus, Christians and other religious minorities who are in India illegally to become citizens if they can show they were persecuted because of their religion in Muslim-majority Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan. It does not apply to Muslims.Critics have slammed the legislation as a violation of India’s secular constitution and have called it the latest effort by Modi’s government to marginalise the country’s 200 million Muslims.Protests against the law come amid an ongoing crackdown in Muslim-majority Kashmir, the restive Himalayan region stripped of its semi-autonomous status and demoted from a state into a federal territory in August.The demonstrations also follow a contentious process in the north-eastern state of Assam designed to weed out foreigners living in the country illegally. Nearly 2 million people, about half-Hindu and half-Muslim, were excluded from an official list of citizens – called the National Register of Citizens, or NRC – and have been asked to prove their citizenship or else be considered foreign.India is building a detention centre for some of the tens of thousands of people who the courts are expected to ultimately determine have entered illegally. Modi’s home affairs minister, Amit Shah, has pledged to roll out the process nationwide.“First, we will bring the citizenship amendment bill and will give citizenship to the Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh, Jain and Christian refugees, the religious minorities from the neighbouring nations. Then, we will implement NRC to flush out the infiltrators from our country,” Shah said in an election speech last April.On Sunday, Modi denied the existence of a detention centre, accusing the Congress party of spreading fear that Indian Muslims would be jailed there. He also said that his opponents resented him for his work strengthening India’s ties to Iran, Saudi Arabia and other Islamic countries.A small band of supporters of Modi’s party marched in New Delhi on Sunday. Activists from India’s north-east, a mainly tribal area where people fear an influx of migrants will dilute their culture and political sway, also held a rally in the capital.The protests against the law began in Assam, the centre of a decades-old movement against migrants, before spreading to predominantly Muslim universities and then nationwide."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8476130bad66214c9f06743a1bade8a0530631f/464_103_2536_1521/master/2536.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a286e0bde6adc4d22232a70eabb42086","title":"croatian president to face leftist former pm in second round run off","story":"Incumbent Kolinda Grabar Kitarović comes second to Zoran Milanović after losing votes to rightwing singer Miroslav ŠkoroCroatia’s conservative president will face a liberal former prime minister in a runoff election in early January after no candidate won an outright majority in a first round of voting on Sunday, near-complete results showed.The vote was held just days before Croatia takes over the European Union presidency for the first time. The governing conservatives are hoping to to keep their grip on power ahead of assuming the EU chairmanship.Some 3.8 million voters in the EU’s newest member country chose from among 11 candidates in Sunday’s election, but only the top three finishers were considered serious contenders.Milanović and Grabar Kitarović now will face each other in a second round of voting on 5 January.Although the incumbent finished second, analysts said Grabar Kitarović could be considered a favourite in the runoff because other right-leaning challengers would no longer be in contention.Addressing supporters, Grabar Kitarović called for all those on the right to unite behind her candidacy in the second round. She described the first round as a 10-on-one battle.Milanović called for a civilised contest rather than a battle, referring to traditionally deep isions in Crotia between the political left and right. “We are going to the second round, not a war,” he said. Let the better one of us win and I believe I am better.”Croatia’s presidency is largely ceremonial. The office holder formally commands the army and represents the country abroad. But retaining the post is important for the ruling Croatian Democratic Union party, known as HDZ, as Croatia prepares for its six-month term in the EU presidency. The job will include overseeing Britain’s departure from the bloc, expected to take place on 31 January, and the start of post-Brexit trade talks.Grabar Kitarović started off her campaign looking strong but her position weakened after a series of gaffes. The 51-year-old incumbent is known for flirting with the extreme right while seeking also to portray herself as a people’s president.Milanović promised during the campaign to turn Croatia into a normal, tolerant country.Although Croatia has recovered since the devastating 1991-95 war that followed the breakup of former Yugoslavia, it still is one of the poorest nations in the EU and corruption is believed to be widespread.Critics blasted the government for setting the election date three days before Christmas, a time when many people travel abroad. The governing HDZ party, they said, counted on the support from Croats who live abroad and normally flock home for the holidays.Analysts said the strong showing by the rightwing Skoro party signalled that the governing HDZ had lost some support among party followers ahead of a parliamentary election set for next year."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Volunteer-run local facility falls foul of corporate reluctance to issue or renew policiesAlmost 50,000 households are living in Hap tenancy properties nationallyIrish Water records reveal four alarms about cloudy water unheeded at the Kildare facilityMarquees were put up and taken down a number of times over the last yearSeveral business owners experience large price hikes, while others are denied coverVaradkar critical of Murphy for reneging on pledge to attend over D\u0026aacuteil appearancesProposed options include widening existing route through Glen o\u0026rsquo the Downs nature reserve and an 8km western bypass of the glenJoint statement describes \u0026lsquogrowing sense of despair in our politics\u0026rsquoReport is highly critical of the use of restrictive practices in mental health unitsMiche\u0026aacutel Martin favours tax breaks to incentivise small landlords to let propertyFestive speech focuses on plight of those seeking \u0026lsquoprotection and shelter\u0026rsquo in IrelandOfficers stop cars, carry out house-to-house enquiries in Lansdowne Road areaParty has dropped Maria Bailey and Verona Murphy as candidates recentlyPeter Pringle won appeal in 1995 against conviction for 1980 murders of two garda\u0026iacutePaddy Hansard (73) thanks family and medical staff who cared for him following attackCJ Stander: \u0026lsquoWhatever we can do to help, even just to get someone out of the cold\u0026rsquoGsoc obliged to notify Garda of every investigation it launches into member of forceDublin man expresses gratitude to Alone charity following recovery from strokeMinister who called for cap to end wasteful use of print facility is among 28 politicians who did not collect part or all of their items"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4123057.1577030915!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"alerts missed at leixlip water plant that put 600 000 on boil notice","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Leixlip water treatment plant where ‘turbidity’ or cloudy water due to suspended particles forced a temporary shutdown affecting 600,000 people. Photograph: Colin KeeganCollins Four alarms warning about the increased cloudiness of water at a Co Kildare water treatment plant that led to a boil water notice affecting 600,000 people in October went unheeded.Detailed records released by Irish Water show that high-level alarms sounded over a period of 51 minutes on the evening of October 21st last at the Leixlip water treatment plant warning about higher levels of “turbidity” or cloudy water due to suspended particles in the source water.Risks posed by potential contamination as a result of the breakdown of the disinfection process at the plant led to the largest-ever boil notice being issued in the country – affecting 615,539 people in Dublin, Kildare and Meath.Irish Water records, released to The  under the Freedom of Information Act, show that problems with the disinfection process at the plant began at 3pm and that no action was taken until 9.20pm when the first attempt to solve the problem was made by switching pumps.This was despite four alarms specifically warning about higher levels of turbidity in the source water being triggered at 6.16pm, 6.17pm, 6.22pm and 7.07pm, according to a presentation document prepared by Irish Water for an audit by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).The operator was only alerted after an off-duty manager happened to spot the high levels of cloudiness in the water when he logged on to the plant’s system for an unrelated issue.Irish Water listed seven “red flags” where preventative measures were missed, including graphs that should have alerted the operator to rising turbidity and text messages to his phone.“Multiple alarms not responded to by operator,” said Irish Water in the document presented to the EPA during its October 24th audit of the plant.Other indirect “red flags” that should have been spotted were the visual and physical evidence of a leaking pump and the visual condition of the water filters, said the company.The presentation says there was “no operator intervention” as the cloudiness of filter water continued to rise above elevated levels from 7.50pm on.At 9.15pm, the assistant plant manager logged on remotely to the plant’s system “on an entirely unrelated matter” and “happens to notice” that the turbidity levels across all filters was “extremely high”.Fifteen minutes later, the assistant plant manager phoned the operator “who advises that he has just noticed the high turbidity”, states the presentation document.At 10.15pm the rostered on-call manager decided to manually shut down the old plant.Within an hour, a contractor was called to the plant and cleared the blockage, managing to complete a “temporary repair”.By 5am the following morning turbidity levels had returned to normal.Irish Water’s investigation found that the initial cause of the “alum dosing” failure was a blockage in the dosing line causing the pump “to ramp up to maximum capacity”.The company found that an operator might have reduced the low-flow set-point on the “alum flow” reaching the raw water below 50 per cent of that required “to facilitate a restart of the plant on a previous occasion and forgot to reset it to its operational value”.Fingal County Council, which operates the plant under a service-level agreement with Irish Water, declined to say whether the operator on duty on the evening of October 21st was the same one working on the night of March 13th who failed to respond to an alarm warning of elevated aluminium and turbidity levels in final treated water in a separate incident.A spokesman for the council said it has “no further comment in relation to ongoing investigations at this time.”Utility appeal to conserve waterIrish Water said that it noticed a reduction in demand immediately after appealing to people in the greater Dublin area to conserve water over Christmas almost two weeks ago.The company reminded customers to use only what they needed over the festival period as the risk to supply still exists while it upgrades treatment plants in the area, including the one in Leixlip.Simple water conservation actions such as turning off the tap while brushing teeth or shaving can save up to six litres of water per minute, said the company. The utility also added that keeping a jug of water in the fridge instead of running the cold tap can save 10 litres of a day.Water production capacity has been reduced as work continues on the old Leixlip water treatment plant that supplies hundreds of thousands of homes in Dublin, Kildare and Meath.Irish Water said at the launch of its appeal on December 11th that the increase in demand was higher than in any previous year. And at 10 million litres higher a day it was the same amount of water needed to fill Liberty Hall in Dublin.Five-day nationwide forecasts, weather warnings and rainfall maps "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4123097.1577034074!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"mother grieving loss of all three children says there is too much space around me now","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tKathleen Keyes: ‘I think there was something in me, calling me to speak, to speak from my own soul and just tell, express . . . a need to get out something from myself.’ Photograph: Nick BradshawThe A mother grieving the loss of all three of her children says she has been left “stunned and reeling” by a huge reaction around the country to her letter in the  over the weekend.Kathleen Keyes (62) from Bray, Co Wicklow, said she penned the letter after marking the first anniversary of the death of her last surviving child Fergal, who died from complications of cystic fibrosis, just before Christmas last year.It went viral online - in an overwhelming outpouring, it was described as heartbreaking, beautiful, humbling, comforting, thought-provoking, breath-taking and brutally moving - and was read by more than 80,000 people within a day of being published.“I think there was something in me, calling me to speak, to speak from my own soul and just tell, express.. a need to get out something from myself,” Ms Keyes told The .“But also a need to let people know this story, make people aware of what they have in having their families around them. Particularly at this time of year - or any time of year.”All three of Ms Keyes’ children had cystic fibrosis. Gráinne died on January 3rd, 2002, aged 15 years. Darragh died on April 10th, 2012, aged 19 years. Fergal died on December 2nd last year, aged 31.“They were just so wholesome, so lovely. They were extremely bright, highly intelligent. I think, having endured that suffering, it evolved them. But they were mad too. Witty.”Gráinne, she said, contracted the bacteria burkholderia cenocepacia - which can be lethal for cystic fibrosis sufferers - when she was eight years old and it “sort of bled into the other two”.“This is what eventually killed my three children,” Ms Keyes said.Ms Keyes said she wasn’t given any advice by the Health Service Executive (HSE) to separate her own children to avoid it spreading.“I am angry. I have a lot of anger there. Can you can imagine how awful that is to live with? I wouldn’t want you to. That on top of losing them, one by one.”Gráinne had “a big head of curls, big blue eyes, was witty and funny.” She loved drama and won a part in the television series Ballykissangel.“Darragh always had the house full of his friends, because he was at home a lot from school. He did videos, he has left a whole lot of videos, movies. He had a camera and was writing scripts.”Fergal was a year and half younger than Gráinne and “it broke his heart when she died.”“He was very into history and drama. He read avidly. If you were to walk into Fergal’s room you would see his whole ceiling covered in quotations.”Ms Keyes said she “always thought Fergal would survive”.“He had a beautiful girlfriend (Becky) and they wanted to be together and have babies, but it didn’t happen for Fergal. They connected incredibly well, they were intellectually together. She is heartbroken. He was so bright and beautiful and so giving.”Ms Keyes, originally from near Frenchpark, Co Roscommon and who moved to Bray 33 years ago, said she “couldn’t say” where she gets the strength from to keep going in her day to day life.She tries to meditate and she writes.“It’s just survival writing,” she said. “I am writing from a place within myself. The letter was just a personal letter. There were lots of other things coming out of it - I was aware of that - but I didn’t expect anything like this sweep of a response.”Keyes completed a masters degree in poetry about a year ago and hopes to write a collection of poetry as well as memoir of her experiences.“I have to do it,” she said, “I’m calling on myself to do it. But I can’t do it too soon, because of what I’m going through now.“This is a huge transition for me. Up to now, I’ve been loving and been with my children, giving them intravenous antibiotics, attending hospitals. I’ve spent all my life doing this, and now my children are gone. There is an empty space around me.“For the first time in more than 30 years, it is time to look at myself. Even up to today, I probably haven’t been able to grieve enough because my son died a year ago, my youngest boy died seven and half years ago and my girl died 18 years ago.“In all of those years, I have just been chasing, chasing.“Sometimes I feel like I’m cycling at the edge of the world now. I don’t know where I am. There is too much space around me now.”Ms Keyes has been hospitalised twice herself in the past year with a condition calledNeurosarcoidosis - an inflamation on the brain. “The doctors think the stress and the years of going, going, going certainly have contributed to it.”She hasn’t decided how she’ll spend Christmas this year. Last year, she got up on Christmas morning and cried. “I was in the sitting room and I visualised all the places where their toys would be down through the years.”Then she went to the cemetery, lit candles and stayed there for hours. “I spoke with my children,” she said.“Christmas is pretty insane for me. Because that blackness is around me, there is a conflict going on within me. When I watch all the consumerism, all the people on the shopping streets, and all the rush - for what?“I would like them to slow down, take their time and ask themselves some personal questions about why they are filling the streets and overtaking one another to get the best buy and where is at all going? Where is the meaning? I want them to ask themselves the question: what are they doing right now and what is it about?”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4123098.1577034573!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"religious leaders urge ni parties to restore assembly","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJoint statement: The leaders of Ireland’s main churches (left to right) Rev Sam McGuffin, Archbishop Eamon Martin, Dr William Henry,  Dr Richard Clarke,  Rev Brian Anderson.The leaders of Ireland’s main churches have urged the North’s political parties to “fully grasp” the opportunity to restore Northern Ireland’s devolved government.In a joint statement, they said they were “disappointed” the devolved institutions had not been restored before Christmas and spoke of the “growing sense of despair in our politics” nurtured by the Assembly’s almost three-year absence.But they said that while they acknowledged that “points of difference obviously remain, the goal of restoring devolution remains within reach, even if it still rests a little way off”.Northern Ireland has been without a devolved government at Stormont since January 2017, when it collapsed in the wake of a scandal over a renewable heating scheme.The DUP said there had been efforts to “box us into a corner” and to “force us into a position of not getting a fair and balanced deal”.Talks will resume after Christmas, with the aim of restoring the Assembly before the Northern Secretary of State’s deadline of January 13th.The statement was issued by the Church of Ireland Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland, Dr Richard Clarke, Dr William Henry, the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, Archbishop Eamon Martin, the Catholic Primate of All Ireland, Rev Sam McGuffin, the president of the Methodist Church in Ireland, and the president of the Irish Council of Churches, Rev Brian Anderson.‘Go that extra mile’It was, they said, “incumbent on all of us to recognise the road that has been travelled since the collapse of the Executive nearly three years ago”.“It is a journey that has damaged our health service and our schools. It has also nurtured a growing sense of despair in our politics and contributed to additional hardships and worry experienced by the most vulnerable people in our society.”The church leaders said they added their “collective support” to the talks process, and encouraged those taking part “to continue working creatively and courageously towards a deal that can bring stability and begin to restore a sense of hope.“For the sake of the whole community, we urge all our political representatives to go that extra mile,” they said.“It is our prayer that through generosity of spirit and courageous leadership a balanced accommodation that serves the common good and has reconciliation at its heart can be found, that will lead to a sustainable power-sharing executive in the new year.”As the talks paused over the Christmas period, they said, it was their prayer “that the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will also rest upon the whole community, and the land that we share”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4123159.1577042899!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"substandard housing a dozen dublin landlords lose hap payment","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLocal authorities are required to carry out inspections within eight months of the tenancy starting and have met this target in 83 per cent of cases. File photograph: Peter ByrnePA WireA dozen Dublin landlords who rented substandard properties to low-income households under the Housing Assistance Payments (Hap) scheme have had their payments stopped, new figures show.Almost 50,000 households are living in Hap tenancy properties nationally with one quarter of them in Dublin. Under the Hap system tenants eligible for social housing are accommodated in the private sector. In most cases the tenant sources the properties themselves, but rent is paid to the landlord by their local authority.Local authorities are required to carry out inspections within eight months of the tenancy starting and have met this target in 83 per cent of cases. The council does not have to undertake this process if the property was already inspected in the previous 12 months.In Dublin city, environmental health officers carry out inspections on a “proactive basis as well as in response to complaints received”, the council said. It has carried out 3,173 inspections of the 6,215 Hap properties so far this year.“If the property does not meet the required standards, environmental health officers take appropriate enforcement action for all non-compliant properties,” it said.This action can include the serving of improvement letters, improvement notices and prohibition notices. The council institutes legal proceedings “where appropriate to ensure landlords bring properties into compliance with housing standards legislation” .Almost all Hap properties fail to meet the required standards on first inspection, but the majority are subsequently brought into compliance.Most improvements required are minor in nature and are complied with by the landlord. However, in 11 cases the council has served prohibition notices stopping rent payments to the landlord.“In cases where a prohibition notice is served on a landlord, and not appealed the Hap payments continue for a 13-week period in order for the tenant to source alternative accommodation with the aid of Hap,” the council said.Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council said landlords must sign a declaration certifying the property is in a “lettable condition and meets the statutory requirements for rented accommodation” before a tenancy begins. It has the lowest number of Hap tenancies of the four Dublin local authorities at just under 1,400. The council has carried out 1,021 inspections so far this year, but these include properties rented under the older Rental Accommodation Scheme, and other private rented housing.Repair noticesWhere improvements are required, the council issues repair notices and undertakes follow-up inspections to ensure the work has been carried out. It said it has not encountered any properties where it has had to stop payments because conditions were substandard. If such a case did arise it would be the tenant’s responsibility to source a new property, but the council said: “The local authority has put supports in place to assist where tenants are at risk of homelessness.”South Dublin County Council has just under 3,000 tenants in Hap properties and has inspected just over 1,100 so far this year. In most cases the infractions are “relatively minor”, it said.“A large amount of cases fail due to relatively minor, easily remedied contraventions of the minimum housing standards legislation eg no fire blanket in the kitchen, out of date or non-functioning smoke alarms, no microwave etc. It has been also noted that properties frequently fail due to updating of regulations.”It has not stopped any payments as it said “time is allowed to the landlord to have the required works completed”. The council “does not find alternative homes for tenants in the event of substandard accommodation” it said.Fingal County Council is the only other local authority of the four to have stopped any payments, but only in one case. It has carried out 2,548 Hap inspections this year, despite having just over 1,720 properties. It said it carries out inspections on foot of complaints in addition to routine inspections. “The council has terminated one Hap tenancy due to the property not meeting the required standard. The council deals with such terminations on a case by case basis,” it said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4123188.1577046156!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"emergency brexit inspection tents in rosslare cost 120 000","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRosslare Europort: Tents were erected ahead of each Brexit deadline this year for use as emergency inspection accommodation in case of a no-deal scenario. Photograph: Niall CarsonPA Wire Temporary emergency marquees for Brexit checks which never happened have been put up and taken down a number of times over the last year at Rosslare Europort at a cost of more than €120,000.The  has learned that tents were erected ahead of each Brexit deadline this year for use as emergency inspection accommodation in case of a no-deal scenario, as permanent infrastructure has not yet been built.The marquees were originally intended to be installed to cover the ramifications of a potential no-deal scenario in March. They were first put up in anticipation of the March and April 2019 deadlines, and remained in place until June 11th.They were then dismantled as the OPW had no use for them ahead of a new Brexit deadline in October.They were then reinstalled on the October 21st, 2019 in preparation for the October 31st deadline.“They are likely to remain on site until the threat of a no deal passes, or if any changes are indicated following the British elections. On completion of the final phase of development of the new border control post on the site, expected by the end of January 2020, the marquees will be dismantled and returned,” a spokesman for the OPW said.According to the Government’s Brexit Contingency Plan, published in July 2019, infrastructure at ports was due to be “refined” and “improved” after the first deadline passed in March.It said that “permanent state inspection facilities will be constructed on a site adjacent to the existing port”.“This facility will accommodate inspection bays for SPS (sanitary and phytosanitary) and food safety checks as well as a number of Revenue turnout sheds. The site will also include office accommodation, a documentary and public office, driver welfare facilities, two documentary and identity check facilities” and parking for 35 HGVs, the contingency plan states.Permanent infrastructureIn response to queries about the cost of the tents, a spokesman for the OPW said that “interim infrastructure was put in place at Rosslare Europort to prepare for a possible no-deal Brexit on 29 March 2019. In the period afforded by subsequent Brexit extensions, this has been enhanced incrementally since then. Permanent infrastructure will be put in place to apply the additional customs, SPS and health checks and controls on a long-term basis”.The OPW said the marquees had a “dual purpose for department staff training requirements and for use as emergency inspection accommodation for use in case of a no-deal Brexit”.The agency says it has already paid €110,400, excluding VAT, for the hire of the marquees with an indicative monthly rate of €27,600, excluding VAT.“The cost of their dismantling, removal from site and reinstallation in October 2019 was €8,500. We were not charged while the marquees were off-site.”A source has told The  that a large fence was also installed and removed at the site. The OPW said the costs for this are not available at this time.“The purpose of the moveable fencing was for site ision and security. Portions of the site were handed over to the client departments for training purposes as they became available.

Products or logos would be inserted into a show during editing, thanks to computer-generated imagery.Now, with the rise of Netflix and other streaming platforms, the practice of working brands into shows and films is likely to get more sophisticated. In the near future, according to marketing executives who have had discussions with streaming companies, the products that appear on screen may depend on who is watching.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn other words, a viewer known to be a whiskey drinker could see a billboard for a liquor brand in the background of a scene, while a teetotaler watching the same scene might see a billboard for a fizzy water company.Streaming services could also drop in brand-name products based on when a show is being watched. Someone who watches a streaming show in the morning could see a carton of orange juice within a character’s reach, while a different viewer watching the same thing in the afternoon could see a can of soda.Created with Sketch.The 40 best films of the decade Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.140 40.

It takes us deep inside the mind of its heroine, 11-year-old Riley, where her unconscious is shown as akin to a magical theme park emotions like Joy and Sadness feature as characters. Director Pete Docter deals with complex subject matter in a lithe and inventive way, and without too many Freudian hang ups.

With every click of the remote, viewers tell the services something about themselves, information that can be used to determine which products might appeal to them.This supercharged version of digital product placement is being developed at a time when the marketing business — which bet big on TV commercials for decades — needs new tricks to grab the attention of ad-hating cord-cutters.Beringer, the head of Mirriad, said the current digital product placement technology has been successful enough to suggest that a bespoke version is a logical next step.“Viewers have been educated to look away from advertising,” he said. “But we’re putting something in that contextually makes sense. If you do it well, and it’s not annoying, it can work.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some of the data is collected by the platforms themselves, others by outside data companies. And now streaming services are mulling how to make use of that information to create tailored product placements.“Just like there’s no reason that all viewers of a program need to see the same advertisement, there’s no reason that they all need see the same brand integration or crossover campaign,” said David Schweidel, a marketing professor at Emory University.Streaming platforms are trying out other advertising innovations, too. Hulu, a platform controlled by the Walt Disney Company, has ads that appear when a viewer hits the pause button. Last week, it rolled out specialised ads for people who are bingeing on three or more episodes of a show, with commercials for Kellogg’s, Maker’s Mark and Georgia-Pacific.This year, Walmart-owned streaming service Vudu enabled so-called shoppable ads on internet-connected televisions. With a click of the remote on the words “Add to Cart,” customers are able to drop an advertised product into their Walmart queue.On the Roku Channel, a streaming channel on the company’s digital media player, viewers can click on certain commercials to request an email or text with details about the product on display.

In another scene, a phone’s broken screen suddenly appears fixed.“Consumers are so much more empowered today to flip the dial, to change the channel, and many of the things they could switch to don’t have advertising at all,” said Scott Rosenberg, a senior vice president at Roku. “It’s incumbent on platforms and apps that are ad-supported to work harder at how they put ads in front of the consumer.”Virtual product placement companies like Mirriad and its rival Ryff said they are talking with streaming services about using data to customize product placements to viewers. Mirriad and Ryff would not name their potential partners.Product placement is appealing to streaming services because it allows them to work with companies without interrupting a show with commercials. Hulu, which comes in a low-cost ad-supported version and also has a commercial-free option for subscribers willing to pay more, said that so-called brand integrations on its platform have been far more effective than 30-second commercials at raising viewers’ interest in products.Some skeptics say virtual product placements based on viewer preferences may turn out to be one of those innovations that does not catch on. A few well-placed TV commercials and billboards are likely to reach the same number of people with less trouble, said Joe Maceda, an executive at the media agency Mindshare.“It’s hard to know if the juice is worth the squeeze,” he said.The possibilities of inidualised product placement were on display in Bandersnatch,\u0026nbspan extended installment of the Netflix series Black Mirror,\u0026nbspa speculative fiction show that specialises in horrifying tales of invasive technologies and exploitative digital companies.Bandersnatch was interactive. Viewers determined how the story, set in 1980s Britain, unfolded by clicking on choices presented to them at various forks in the narrative road. Early on, the film asked viewers to choose between two breakfast cereals, Sugar Puffs or Frosties. Their selection determined which one would appear in a commercial shown on a TV set in the background of a scene later in the film.The most hilarious product placements in cinemaSugar Puffs and Frosties were not included as part of an ad, Netflix said, but rather as a way for the Black Mirror\u0026nbspcreators to enhance the film’s 1980s setting. Netflix was not paid by the cereal companies.But all those remotes clicking on one cereal or the other provided Netflix with data on its subscribers’ preferences. Reed Hastings, Netflix chief executive, cited Bandersnatch\u0026nbspduring a webcast timed to an earnings report this year. Holding up two boxes of cereal, he announced that 73 per cent of Bandersnatch viewers had selected Kellogg’s Frosties.The other executives on the webcast chuckled.“The most critical data point of the quarter!” joked Spencer Wang, a vice president.Netflix, which does not run commercials, said it would not use the information it had gleaned from Bandersnatch,\u0026nbspsaying in a statement that “the privacy of our members is a top priority.”But marketing executives like Ricky Ray Butler, chief executive of product placement company Branded Entertainment Network, are enthusiastic about the possibility of inserting brand-name products into streaming shows based on data generated by interactive programming. Actually being able to do so, he said, may still be a long way off.“The world’s not ready for it yet,” he said. “We’re just at the tip of the iceberg.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The film grossed $332m worldwide against a $175m budget.This entertaining 1990s thriller had such poor box office takings in the US, it was released straight-to-DVD in other countries, including the UK.Michael Cimino\u0027s drama is notable for being one of the biggest box office bombs of its time, losing the studio an estimated $37m (over $114 million when adjusted for inflation).Martin Scorsese\u0027s charming family film was a commercial failure, grossing just $185m against its $150–$170m budget.While acclaimed by critics, Michael Mann\u0027s drama – starring Al Pacino and Russell Crowe – never made back its $68m budget.Despite being one of the best animated films of all time, The Iron Giant was a victim of Warner Bros scepticism towards the genre after the failure of previous effort, Quest for Camelot. Future Pixar director Brad Bird\u0027s film made $31.3m worldwide against a budget of $70–80m.While not a major flop, the classic underperformed at the Christmas box office due to stiff competition from other big films.Elaine May\u0027s maligned comedy, which is being reassessed with every passing year, became a notorious failure at the box office.2335 The King of Comedy (1982)Although Scorsese\u0027s drama was well-received by critics, it bombed at the box office. Lead Robert De Niro said that the film maybe wasn\u0027t so well received because it gave off an aura of something that people didn\u0027t want to look at or know.This unfairly maligned Disney release was a box office bomb, grossing only $260.5m worldwide against an estimated $225–250m production budget and an additional $150m in marketing costs.2535 Man on the Moon (1999)This Jim Carrey film from Milos Forman cost Universal a lot of money after it failed to make back its $52-82m budget.While making its money back, polarising reviews meant that Darren Aronofsky\u0027s psychological horror settled for a $14m profit.It\u0027s considered to be one of the greatest films of all time, but David Lynch\u0027s head-scratcher failed to make back its $20m budget.Despite positive reviews from critics, this spoof grossed just $9m, failing to meet its budget of $20m.  2935 Scott Pilgrim vs the World (2010)Edgar Wright\u0027s beloved cult was a box office bomb, grossing $47.7m against its production budget of $85–90m.This Stephen King adaptation was a box office disappointment, earning only $16m during its initial theatrical run. It would later get re-released and earn $58.3m.This fun action film starring Clive Owen recouped far less than its $39m budget.This Oscar-nominated noir didn\u0027t meet its budget despite sitting at a paltry $17m.It wasn\u0027t until its home entertainment release that this mockumentary became the beloved classic it is today. 3435 Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets (2017)Valerian grossed $225m worldwide, but due to its high production and advertising costs, it was considered a commercial failure.3535 Willy Wonka \u0026amp the Chocolate Factory (1971)This beloved Roald Dahl adaptation starring Gene Wilder made just a $1m profit upon its original release in 1971.Any hope that cinemagoers would enjoy the film more than those who reviewed it were dashed after it received a C+ rating from\u0026nbspCinemaScore, a market research firm that assesses audience response.No additional scenes are expected to be added to the updated copy, which will instead focus on tweaking the CGI human-cat hybrids featured in the film.Cinemas with the ability to download will begin showing the improved version from Sunday (22 December), but other exhibitors\u0026nbspwill have to wait until Tuesday (24 December).Going by the letter obtained by THR, though, Universal is insisting that cinema employees\u0026nbspreplace the current print of Cats as soon as they possibly can.\u0026nbspThe film stars Jennifer Hudson, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo and Taylor Swift.

That decision appeared to be a specific attempt to draw attention to the account, and to make clear that the Twitter boss knew about it.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMoments later, the Mr Dorsey used his own platform to unfollow\u0026nbspMark Zuckerberg. He did not explain the decision, and there was no public interaction between the two.As expected, that triggered an alert from the tracking page that announced that the Twitter boss was no longer following the Facebook founder.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

It is still not clear whether it was the result of a genuine fallout or a more friendly jibe.Mr Zuckerberg\u0027s Twitter account is hardly used at all, despite having more than 400,000 followers. While he used it throughout 2009 to write about new\u0026nbsp features, the only post since was a 2012 message that linked out to a post on his official Facebook page.Mark Zuckerberg followed one new person on Twitter this yearMr Zuckerberg followed only one user of the site through the whole year – in another unexplained, unusual interaction. But that happened at the beginning of the year and is not thought to be related to any of the new events.\u0026nbspSome have speculated that the goat – and perhaps all of the events – are in reference to a strange exchange between the two billionaires at the beginning of the year.In January, Mr Dorsey claimed that Mr Zuckerberg had served one of the animals as part of a meal, during a year when he was only eating food he had killed.Mr Dorsey said that Zuckerberg is a “very, very smart businessman,” and then he went on to say: “He made goat for me for dinner. He killed the goat.”The Twitter boss then clarified that Mr Zuckerberg did not kill the goat in front of him but “killed it before” their meal.“I guess he kills it,” he said. “He kills it with a laser gun and then the knife. Then they send it to the butcher.”Mr Dorsey\u0026nbspthen corrected himself to make clear it was probably a stun gun, and went on to suggest that he did not eat the goat because it was cold.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, Rebecca Long Bailey, the shadow business secretary, and Lisa Nandy, the Wigan MP, are all expected to stand, while backbenchers Jess Phillips and Yvette Cooper are also thought to be considering a bid.Mr Lammy\u0026nbspdescribed Mr Corbyn, who he has known for\u0026nbspdecades as a neighbouring north London MP, as “kind, compassionate and thoroughly decent” but said this\u0026nbspview of the Labour leader\u0026nbspwas not shared by voters.Former Labour MP and Corbyn ally blames Tony Blair for election defeatHe said: “The leadership’s failure to deal\u0026nbspwith the stain of antisemitism\u0026nbspwithin the party stripped Labour of moral authority. Jeremy’s triangulation on Brexit left Leavers thinking he was a Remainer and convinced Remainers he supported Leave. His well-reported hostility to institutions such as Nato cemented the public’s distrust.“It was not Jeremy’s righteous belief in economic justice that lost Labour this election it was his perceived worldview, failure of competence, and mind-boggling decision to abdicate leadership on the biggest issue of the day.”Laying out what would probably\u0026nbspbe his pitch for leader, Mr\u0026nbspLammy\u0026nbspcalled for Labour to promote “civic nationalism” to counter what he called Boris Johnson’s “populist, ethnic nationalism”.

The alternative to Johnson’s ethnic nationalism that Labour should offer is a civic nationalism. Rather than basing national pride on biological heritage, skin colour or religion, civic nationalism says we can unite around shared values and institutions.”Mr Lammy, who served as a minister under Tony Blair and later stood to be Labour’s candidate for Mayor of London, laid out a series of policies that he said would foster civic duty, including setting up a citizens’ assembly to draw up a new written constitution, introducing a proportional voting system, trialling universal basic income and looking at making\u0026nbspnational civic service compulsory for young people.Turning to the question of\u0026nbspwhether he will run for leader, he added: “As for which Labour figure I believe is best-placed to lead this hopeful vision, I will consider that over Christmas.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

My brother gave it to me before he died.’ Omar lost both of his older brothers in the conflict. His brother Abdulrahman was just 7 years old when he died. \u0027He bought it for me in the market and told me to take care of it. We used to watch the cartoon together. I still watch it now.\u0027 He doesn\u0027t remember much about his home in Syria but he thinks it was as big as a Unicef Makani centre, where he goes for learning and psychosocial support. \u0027Most of our stuff we had to leave behind but my mum packed Ben 10 so I could play with it. It\u0027s so important to me. This toy is as precious to me as my own brother. I\u0027m going to keep it forever.\u0027 The best part of Omar’s day is sunset when he comes home from school and Makani, eats food and does his homework sitting with his family. His favourite subject is maths and he studies hard to achieve his dream. ‘I want to become a pilot. I used to be afraid of planes but now I want to travel. Maybe if I get on a plane I won’t be afraid anymore.’ Omar now has two little sisters in Za’atari Refugee Camp. He lets his youngest sister Islam play with Ben 10. When he gets dirty he puts him in the washing machine. ‘I’m the only boy now. I think my brother would be proud of me.’ Makani (which translates as ‘My Space’) centres provide an integrated set of services to children in the camp, including learning support, community-based child protection, early childhood development, adolescent and youth participation, life skills and innovation labs426 Yahya, 13, holds a passport photo of himself‘This is a photo of me. It’s my memory. It means a lot to me because it was taken for my school registration form. I was in the first grade for only one week and then we had to come here. I have memories from this time, both good and bad. I remember how my school looked, it was beautiful. I had started making friends and playing football. But the bad memories are of the war, when we were under bombing. I want to forget this memory and the memory of the journey here. It was night time when we left Syria and we could hardly see the road in front of us. We moved through valleys full of thorns that hurt when we stepped on them. People started throwing away their belongings because of how hard the journey was, anything heavy had to go. I had to leave behind my school books, my pens and my colours because my mum told me too. She said it wouldn’t be long before we came back home. But it’s been six years.’ He is now in sixth grade‘I was in first grade in Syria and my dad gave me this schoolbag. I was only little then but now I’m in the sixth grade.’ Although the schoolbag is now too small for him, he keeps it safe. ‘It’s important to me because my father gave it to me as a gift and I remember him by it. Also because it is from my country.’He still has happy memories from life in Syria, including going to school. ‘I used to feel really happy when break came and I could go to the shop. I remember playing in the schoolyard, my friends chasing me and me chasing them.’ Although he preferred his school in Syria, he still enjoys going to school in the camp. His favourite subject is English and he wants to become an English teacher. He has no plans to give up the old schoolbag. ‘I will keep this schoolbag forever. I will tell my children my father gave this to me and I kept it safe for all these years to show you.’726 Ayoub, 13, holds a set of spoons‘These are my spoons. I was six when I left Syria. I wanted to take them with me from Syria as a memory so I grabbed them as we were leaving the house and I carried them the whole way here. I used to eat my meals with them back at home so I thought that I am going to need them to eat when I come to the camp.’ Ayoub has dropped out of school in the camp but he continues to attend a Makani centre for learning and psychosocial support.  ‘When I grow up, I want to be a taxi driver because I want to leave the camp and go everywhere. I’ve been in a taxi before and I loved it. Inside the camp we don’t have taxis, only bicycles. I’m not in school so I can’t be a doctor or an engineer but I think it’s the easiest thing for me to do when I grow up. In Za\u0027atari, there are 13 Makani centres serving over 7,000 children. Located in every district of the camp, vulnerable children, youth and communities have access to Makani, no matter where they live826 Hamza, 14, holds a handwritten note, from his teacher in Syria‘This note was written by my teacher when I was in first grade in Syria. It’s a thank you letter to my family saying that I am a good student.’ The note calls Hamza a star. ‘I made sure to put it in my bag when we were coming here.’ Hamza is now in the eighth grade and has made a big effort to keep achieving academically, despite the disruption to his education. ‘It’s important for me to keep it because it reminds me of when I was the best student in my class.’926 Mohammad, 16, holds his hat‘This is my hat. My father used to work in Damascus. He bought it there and gave it to me. Life then was magnificent.’ He still remembers the beginning of the conflict in Syria. ‘Children were being killed and houses were being bombed. My father feared for our lives and for our future. When we had to leave Syria, it was winter. I remember crossing a valley and the ground being difficult to walk on. It was dangerous, cars were sliding on the ice.’ Mohammad brought as much of his clothing as he could carry to Za’atari but the hat remains his most loved item. ‘I wore it all the way crossing to Jordan and I still wear it every winter. It’s so precious, it reminds me of Syria. And it’s a gift from my Dad which is why it means so much to me.’Mohammad lives with his parents and brothers and sisters in the camp. He is in tenth grade and likes school. He feels like the camp is home because he is surrounded by his family and a bigger Syrian community who keep their memories alive. ‘My parents tell me about when we were little. They say that Syria was beautiful. I will go back home to my village and continue living there. I will bring my hat and tell my children everything about my story.’  When asked if it’s important for children in Za’atari to try to remember Syria when some of the memories are so traumatic, he replies straight away: ‘Both. I think it’s very important to keep memories but also to forget the horrors of war.’1126 Ahmad, 12, holds a key ring inscribed with his father\u0027s name‘This key ring belonged to my dad, I inherited it from him a long time ago. He died of a heart attack at the start of the war in Syria. I barely have any memories of my dad but the few I have are very precious. My favourite memory is the time he brought us to the river for a picnic and we played in the water. If I want to remember him, I take out his key ring and look at it.’Ahmad wants to be an architect when he grows us because his father worked in construction. ‘I still have a long way to go as I am only in the sixth grade but I will do my best. It would make my Dad proud of me.’ Ahmad lives with his grandmother and brother in the camp. Although they don’t have much, he says that their love is enough for him‘This toy is from Syria. Her name is Farah.’ Yara’s father gave her Farah for her birthday. ‘He used to buy me so many things.’ She enjoys taking off Farah’s dress, washing it and dressing her again. ‘I take care of her because I love her. I feel happy when I’m with her. I take her everywhere. I sleep with her. I tell her the story of Little Red Riding Hood – it’s about a wolf - to put her to sleep.’ Yara still has memories of her bedroom in Syria. ‘It was white and I had teddy bears and one was really big. Bigger than me. It got scary in Syria. There were shootings. Dad said get your stuff together, we’re going. I wanted to bring that teddy bear here but my parents said no, it was too big. So I put Farah in my bag. I told her we’re going to Za’atari. I told her don’t made any sound because if you do, we can’t go in. She was scaredWe were both happy when we arrived in Za’atari. I brought a pink dress too just like Farah’s. I am never going to get rid of her. I have so many toys, even one that costs 5 JD, but I love this one.’ Yara goes to school in the camp and wants to be a pharmacist when she grows up so she can give people medicine that will heal them.  She wants to return to Syria. ‘I will dress her up and get her ready and we will go. But this time, I’m bringing all of my toys1526 Hala, 11, holding a photo of her and her older brother in Syria‘My favourite photo is me and my brother together. It was a Friday. My mum had dressed me nicely for Friday prayer, then we went to the market and a restaurant. After that we went to a photographer’s studio where this photo was taken.’ Hala keeps her photos from Syria hidden in her closet to keep them safe. She takes them out from time to time to look at them. ‘I only remember the war. I used to be so afraid. Bombs used to fall all around our house. Without photos, I wouldn’t know what it was like to be a kid in Syria. Because Syria is in my heart, it is my country where I was born. When I look at this photo, I remember those days again. There aren’t enough words to describe the life I see in these photos. It’s pure happiness.’ Hala missed two years of her education because of the conflict, one in Syria and one in Jordan. Now she is in the fourth grade. ‘I love school a lot. Arabic is my favourite subject and I want to be a surgeon. My mum told me that it was her dream when she was a child to become one but she got married instead. I want her to fulfil her dream through me.’ As well as getting a good education, Hala knows what it will take to achieve her dream. ‘I have to be courageous and not fear anything.’‘These are my house keys. I brought them with me because when we go back to Syria, I’m going to be the one who opens the door. My parents tell me that Syria is beautiful. I was so little that I don’t remember.’Rudaina is in fourth grade and her favourite subject is Maths. She wants to be a pediatrician when she grows up. ‘We once had a home but now we live in a caravan. I feel so sad when I hold the keys because I’m so far away from home.‘This is my blanket. When I was little and it was my birthday, my grandmother bought it for me. I remember that we had to flee because there was bombing. It was night time. That’s why we came here. I was covered in it when I was little and I came here. It protected me against the cold and the rain. I was scared but my mum held me.’Nour wants to be a teacher when she grows up. Her favourite subject is Social Studies because she likes it and her teacher. ‘I still have feelings when I cover myself in this blanket. I feel sadness thinking about the old beautiful days in Syria. But I also feel protected and safe. I’m going to keep it as long as I can.’2126 Iman, 13, holds her doll Her name is Lulu. She’s a gift from my mum so she’s very important. I love her! We brought her here from Syria. When I was little and upset, my parents would give me this toy and I would stop crying. I feel safe as long as Lulu is with me. When the war started and there was shooting, I used to hug her to feel safe. I remember coming here. It was at night and it was dark. On the journey I felt protected having her with me.’ These days, having Lulu near still makes Iman feel better whenever she is afraid or sad.  She keeps her hidden but still lets her little sister play with her. ‘I will keep Lulu forever.’2326 Zaina*, 13, holding a framed photo of her father‘That’s my father’s photo. When I was in first grade he died in the war. I wanted to bring this with me when I came here. It was hanging on the wall. I saw my mother putting stuff together so I ran to the photo and took it off the wall and put it in her bag. I have many memories of all the toys he gave me that I couldn’t bring with me.’ Zaina has been living in the camp for six years. She is in sixth grade and her favourite subject is English. She wants to be a lawyer when she grows up. ‘I wish to return to Syria and for life to be like it was before. I will put my father’s photo back on the wall where it was hanging before.’ *name changed to protect identity‘I brought this dog,’ says Shath. ‘I was little when we left Syria, only 8 or 9 years old. I don’t remember much.  When we had to leave, I took him with me, I was thinking he would protect me. I had so many toys to choose from but he was my favourite. I played with him a lot. I remember being on the bus here and sleeping a lot. I held him the whole way to Za’atari.  ‘The camp was full of tents back then and life was hard, really hard. I kept getting lost. I never let go of my dog in those first days so he could protect me. Now life is sweet. We have these centres and schools and we’re getting an education. We have friends and partiesShatha wants to be a lawyer when she grows up to protect herself and others. ‘I love the Makani, it’s my favourite place in the camp. We learn and we play here. I play lots of football and like the computers. ‘My toy dog will always be with me. I’ll tell my children my whole life story and his because it’s the same as mine.’2626 Sham*, 7, holding a photo of her father‘That photo was taken in Syria. It’s important to me because my father died and I loved him so much. He used to tell me stories, stories about Syria. I loved his stories so much. One day he told me we were going to the camp in five days. He said the war is going to get bad so you have to go. He told me you will grow older and I need you to look after your mother. He wouldn’t come with us and he died in Syria.’ Sham says that if she ever lost the photos of her father, she would never stop looking for them. To keep them safe, she hides them in a bag and then hides the bag in their caravan. She goes to school and is in the second grade. ‘I like to go to school to learn. Science is my favourite subject. I study hard so I can practice on my own without using the books.’ If my dad was here now he would ask me “what do you want to be when your grow up” and I would say, I want to be an engineer just like you’. He would be really proud of me. *name changed to protect identitySyrian refugee children attending Unicef Makani centres in Za\u0027atari refugee camp share the stories behind the objects they brought from Syria and the powerful memories that they represent226 Omar, 11, holds his teddy bear Ben 10‘My Ben 10 transforms into an alien from space and he saves the world,’ says the 11-year-old. ‘I brought it from Syria.

I\u0027m going to keep it forever.\u0027 The best part of Omar’s day is sunset when he comes home from school and Makani, eats food and does his homework sitting with his family. His favourite subject is maths and he studies hard to achieve his dream. ‘I want to become a pilot. I used to be afraid of planes but now I want to travel. Maybe if I get on a plane I won’t be afraid anymore.’ Omar now has two little sisters in Za’atari Refugee Camp. He lets his youngest sister Islam play with Ben 10. When he gets dirty he puts him in the washing machine. ‘I’m the only boy now. I think my brother would be proud of me.’ Makani (which translates as ‘My Space’) centres provide an integrated set of services to children in the camp, including learning support, community-based child protection, early childhood development, adolescent and youth participation, life skills and innovation labs426 Yahya, 13, holds a passport photo of himself‘This is a photo of me. It’s my memory. It means a lot to me because it was taken for my school registration form. I was in the first grade for only one week and then we had to come here. I have memories from this time, both good and bad. I remember how my school looked, it was beautiful. I had started making friends and playing football. But the bad memories are of the war, when we were under bombing. I want to forget this memory and the memory of the journey here. It was night time when we left Syria and we could hardly see the road in front of us. We moved through valleys full of thorns that hurt when we stepped on them. People started throwing away their belongings because of how hard the journey was, anything heavy had to go. I had to leave behind my school books, my pens and my colours because my mum told me too. She said it wouldn’t be long before we came back home. But it’s been six years.’ He is now in sixth grade‘I was in first grade in Syria and my dad gave me this schoolbag. I was only little then but now I’m in the sixth grade.’ Although the schoolbag is now too small for him, he keeps it safe. ‘It’s important to me because my father gave it to me as a gift and I remember him by it. Also because it is from my country.’He still has happy memories from life in Syria, including going to school. ‘I used to feel really happy when break came and I could go to the shop. I remember playing in the schoolyard, my friends chasing me and me chasing them.’ Although he preferred his school in Syria, he still enjoys going to school in the camp. His favourite subject is English and he wants to become an English teacher. He has no plans to give up the old schoolbag. ‘I will keep this schoolbag forever. I will tell my children my father gave this to me and I kept it safe for all these years to show you.’726 Ayoub, 13, holds a set of spoons‘These are my spoons. I was six when I left Syria. I wanted to take them with me from Syria as a memory so I grabbed them as we were leaving the house and I carried them the whole way here. I used to eat my meals with them back at home so I thought that I am going to need them to eat when I come to the camp.’ Ayoub has dropped out of school in the camp but he continues to attend a Makani centre for learning and psychosocial support.  ‘When I grow up, I want to be a taxi driver because I want to leave the camp and go everywhere. I’ve been in a taxi before and I loved it. Inside the camp we don’t have taxis, only bicycles. I’m not in school so I can’t be a doctor or an engineer but I think it’s the easiest thing for me to do when I grow up. In Za\u0027atari, there are 13 Makani centres serving over 7,000 children. Located in every district of the camp, vulnerable children, youth and communities have access to Makani, no matter where they live826 Hamza, 14, holds a handwritten note, from his teacher in Syria‘This note was written by my teacher when I was in first grade in Syria. It’s a thank you letter to my family saying that I am a good student.’ The note calls Hamza a star. ‘I made sure to put it in my bag when we were coming here.’ Hamza is now in the eighth grade and has made a big effort to keep achieving academically, despite the disruption to his education. ‘It’s important for me to keep it because it reminds me of when I was the best student in my class.’926 Mohammad, 16, holds his hat‘This is my hat. My father used to work in Damascus. He bought it there and gave it to me. Life then was magnificent.’ He still remembers the beginning of the conflict in Syria. ‘Children were being killed and houses were being bombed. My father feared for our lives and for our future. When we had to leave Syria, it was winter. I remember crossing a valley and the ground being difficult to walk on. It was dangerous, cars were sliding on the ice.’ Mohammad brought as much of his clothing as he could carry to Za’atari but the hat remains his most loved item. ‘I wore it all the way crossing to Jordan and I still wear it every winter. It’s so precious, it reminds me of Syria. And it’s a gift from my Dad which is why it means so much to me.’Mohammad lives with his parents and brothers and sisters in the camp. He is in tenth grade and likes school. He feels like the camp is home because he is surrounded by his family and a bigger Syrian community who keep their memories alive. ‘My parents tell me about when we were little. They say that Syria was beautiful. I will go back home to my village and continue living there. I will bring my hat and tell my children everything about my story.’  When asked if it’s important for children in Za’atari to try to remember Syria when some of the memories are so traumatic, he replies straight away: ‘Both. I think it’s very important to keep memories but also to forget the horrors of war.’1126 Ahmad, 12, holds a key ring inscribed with his father\u0027s name‘This key ring belonged to my dad, I inherited it from him a long time ago. He died of a heart attack at the start of the war in Syria. I barely have any memories of my dad but the few I have are very precious. My favourite memory is the time he brought us to the river for a picnic and we played in the water. If I want to remember him, I take out his key ring and look at it.’Ahmad wants to be an architect when he grows us because his father worked in construction. ‘I still have a long way to go as I am only in the sixth grade but I will do my best. It would make my Dad proud of me.’ Ahmad lives with his grandmother and brother in the camp. Although they don’t have much, he says that their love is enough for him‘This toy is from Syria. Her name is Farah.’ Yara’s father gave her Farah for her birthday. ‘He used to buy me so many things.’ She enjoys taking off Farah’s dress, washing it and dressing her again. ‘I take care of her because I love her. I feel happy when I’m with her. I take her everywhere. I sleep with her. I tell her the story of Little Red Riding Hood – it’s about a wolf - to put her to sleep.’ Yara still has memories of her bedroom in Syria. ‘It was white and I had teddy bears and one was really big. Bigger than me. It got scary in Syria. There were shootings. Dad said get your stuff together, we’re going. I wanted to bring that teddy bear here but my parents said no, it was too big. So I put Farah in my bag. I told her we’re going to Za’atari. I told her don’t made any sound because if you do, we can’t go in. She was scaredWe were both happy when we arrived in Za’atari. I brought a pink dress too just like Farah’s. I am never going to get rid of her. I have so many toys, even one that costs 5 JD, but I love this one.’ Yara goes to school in the camp and wants to be a pharmacist when she grows up so she can give people medicine that will heal them.  She wants to return to Syria. ‘I will dress her up and get her ready and we will go. But this time, I’m bringing all of my toys1526 Hala, 11, holding a photo of her and her older brother in Syria‘My favourite photo is me and my brother together. It was a Friday. My mum had dressed me nicely for Friday prayer, then we went to the market and a restaurant. After that we went to a photographer’s studio where this photo was taken.’ Hala keeps her photos from Syria hidden in her closet to keep them safe. She takes them out from time to time to look at them. ‘I only remember the war. I used to be so afraid. Bombs used to fall all around our house. Without photos, I wouldn’t know what it was like to be a kid in Syria. Because Syria is in my heart, it is my country where I was born. When I look at this photo, I remember those days again. There aren’t enough words to describe the life I see in these photos. It’s pure happiness.’ Hala missed two years of her education because of the conflict, one in Syria and one in Jordan. Now she is in the fourth grade. ‘I love school a lot. Arabic is my favourite subject and I want to be a surgeon. My mum told me that it was her dream when she was a child to become one but she got married instead. I want her to fulfil her dream through me.’ As well as getting a good education, Hala knows what it will take to achieve her dream. ‘I have to be courageous and not fear anything.’‘These are my house keys. I brought them with me because when we go back to Syria, I’m going to be the one who opens the door. My parents tell me that Syria is beautiful. I was so little that I don’t remember.’Rudaina is in fourth grade and her favourite subject is Maths. She wants to be a pediatrician when she grows up. ‘We once had a home but now we live in a caravan. I feel so sad when I hold the keys because I’m so far away from home.‘This is my blanket. When I was little and it was my birthday, my grandmother bought it for me. I remember that we had to flee because there was bombing. It was night time. That’s why we came here. I was covered in it when I was little and I came here. It protected me against the cold and the rain. I was scared but my mum held me.’Nour wants to be a teacher when she grows up. Her favourite subject is Social Studies because she likes it and her teacher. ‘I still have feelings when I cover myself in this blanket. I feel sadness thinking about the old beautiful days in Syria. But I also feel protected and safe. I’m going to keep it as long as I can.’2126 Iman, 13, holds her doll Her name is Lulu. She’s a gift from my mum so she’s very important. I love her! We brought her here from Syria. When I was little and upset, my parents would give me this toy and I would stop crying. I feel safe as long as Lulu is with me. When the war started and there was shooting, I used to hug her to feel safe. I remember coming here. It was at night and it was dark. On the journey I felt protected having her with me.’ These days, having Lulu near still makes Iman feel better whenever she is afraid or sad.  She keeps her hidden but still lets her little sister play with her. ‘I will keep Lulu forever.’2326 Zaina*, 13, holding a framed photo of her father‘That’s my father’s photo. When I was in first grade he died in the war. I wanted to bring this with me when I came here. It was hanging on the wall. I saw my mother putting stuff together so I ran to the photo and took it off the wall and put it in her bag. I have many memories of all the toys he gave me that I couldn’t bring with me.’ Zaina has been living in the camp for six years. She is in sixth grade and her favourite subject is English. She wants to be a lawyer when she grows up. ‘I wish to return to Syria and for life to be like it was before. I will put my father’s photo back on the wall where it was hanging before.’ *name changed to protect identity‘I brought this dog,’ says Shath. ‘I was little when we left Syria, only 8 or 9 years old. I don’t remember much.  When we had to leave, I took him with me, I was thinking he would protect me. I had so many toys to choose from but he was my favourite. I played with him a lot. I remember being on the bus here and sleeping a lot. I held him the whole way to Za’atari.  ‘The camp was full of tents back then and life was hard, really hard. I kept getting lost. I never let go of my dog in those first days so he could protect me. Now life is sweet. We have these centres and schools and we’re getting an education. We have friends and partiesShatha wants to be a lawyer when she grows up to protect herself and others. ‘I love the Makani, it’s my favourite place in the camp. We learn and we play here. I play lots of football and like the computers. ‘My toy dog will always be with me. I’ll tell my children my whole life story and his because it’s the same as mine.’2626 Sham*, 7, holding a photo of her father‘That photo was taken in Syria. It’s important to me because my father died and I loved him so much. He used to tell me stories, stories about Syria. I loved his stories so much. One day he told me we were going to the camp in five days. He said the war is going to get bad so you have to go. He told me you will grow older and I need you to look after your mother. He wouldn’t come with us and he died in Syria.’ Sham says that if she ever lost the photos of her father, she would never stop looking for them. To keep them safe, she hides them in a bag and then hides the bag in their caravan. She goes to school and is in the second grade. ‘I like to go to school to learn. Science is my favourite subject. I study hard so I can practice on my own without using the books.’ If my dad was here now he would ask me “what do you want to be when your grow up” and I would say, I want to be an engineer just like you’. He would be really proud of me. *name changed to protect identityHe added Turkey was doing everything possible with Russia to stop the bombardments in Idlib.At least one civilian was killed on Sunday as shelling and airstrikes hit rebel-held villages in the province, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and the opposition’s Syrian Civil Defence.Several civilians were also reportedly killed after Russian jets hit a convoy of cars as people attempted to flee the city of Maarat al-Numan.\u0026nbspRescuers said at least eight people were killed, including three women and two children.Former British soldier charged for ‘trying to join Kurdish fighters’Former beauty queen jailed for sending £35 to Islamists in SyriaPair arrested in Dover on suspicion of Syria-linked terrorism offencesAt least 12 children killed in Syria in one day by Assad and TurkeyAt least 16 killed in ‘beyond sadistic’ missile attack on IDP campRussia and the Syrian army, which is loyal to Mr Al-Assad, both deny allegations of indiscriminate bombing of civilian areas and say they are fighting al Qaeda-inspired Islamist militants.The army said it had gained more than 20 villages and hilltops and was coming close to one of 12 Turkish observation posts in the northwest, set up as part of a deal with Moscow and Tehran in 2017 to avert large-scale fighting in Idlib.Residents in the area said many villages were now deserted in a campaign that has displaced more than 500,000 people, according to the United Nations and international relief groups.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He arrived with his mother and father and his eight brothers and sisters after two days of walking. He recalls seeing many dead bodies lining the sides of the tracks that led to Uganda’s northern border. The family were fearful of abduction by rebel groups or becoming caught in crossfire between the government and militia groups. David enjoyed school immensely in South Sudan but said his school had closed due to conflict. He attends Alaba School at Bidi Bidi Refugee Settlement. David dreams of a better life for his family.Sarah, 14, arrived to Kigeme refugee camp from DRC in 2012. Her parents, now unemployed in Rwanda, worked as rag traders. They made the decision to flee the fighting for the safety and relative calm of Rwanda. They were made to feel very welcome by the host community. Sarah is enrolled in class, three years behind where she should be, due to conflict, and she really enjoys her schooling. GS Gasaka school, run by Education Above All Foundation and UNHCR, is providing her the environment to allow her to dream one day of becoming an accountant so she can help her family live a better life.Nakato 19, was born and raised in Yumbe, Uganda. A graduate from Aruma High School, she has aspirations of becoming a journalist. She is actively involved in a movement called “Raise up and Talk” to help empower the younger generation to share their experiences and stories as a form of therapy, to help process the trauma from a life in conflict. Forestal, nine, is in second grade at Marescot School, Haiti. The school is funded through the partnership between non-profit buildOn Haiti, and Educate A Child (EAC), who have constructed 58 schools, as well as training 959 teachers. Forestal explains how she was given up by her father after the death of her mother. She now lives with her auntie as a “restavek” (child in domestic servitude) where she performs chores around the house for at least two hours a day including laundry, sweeping and mopping floors. She can only recall seeing her father once in her entire life. “It was only for one day, but it was really great, we had so much fun,” she says. Forestal hopes that she can see him again – but he lives and works in Port Au Prince, more than three hours away by car.Furaha, six, attends Buremba Primary School. She is a member of the Batwa “Pygmy” tribe, forced out of their native home in the Bwindi Forest to make way for a national park protected as a Unesco World Heritage Site. She lives in Kitahurira settlement camp, about 2.5km and a three-hour walk from her school. The construction of schools and training of teachers in remote areas of challenging geography ensures those hardest to reach have a right to education. Building Tomorrow Uganda through its partnership with Education Above All Foundation has enrolled 53,373 out-of-school children back into quality primary education in Uganda.Niyosenga,12, arrived from Kiyiri, DRC, in 2016. Her mother was killed in the fierce fighting which swept through towns and villages. She made the journey with her father and grandmother to the relative safe haven of Uganda to join the 1.2 million refugees. Niyosenga remained out of education in DRC until the age of nine as the long walk to school was too dangerous with roads closed by police or rebel militia.To help pay for Niyosenga’s school fees her father grows maize while her grandmother, 72, weaves baskets.Jasme, 10, is enrolled at a buildOn school in Perigny. Her two brothers and three sisters all attend the same school. Unlike the reported 300,000 restavek children that live away from their biological parents, Jasme lives with her family.Esperence, 10, goes to Perigny school. Seated on a bench at the end of a long dark corridor, overcome with emotion, he explains how he was given up by his biological parents at the age of eight. He now lives with his auntie and is a restavek child. The term restavek comes from the French rester avec, to stay with. Discussing the work around the house he has to complete as part of his daily chores, he explains: “I can never go out and play with my friends as my house family always call me back inside to do more jobs.”Yean, six, lives in Phnom Penh. Yean’s mother, a widow, feels helpless as she simply cannot earn enough to support her family. Today, Yean lives with her 80-year-old grandmother Khzm Men in Sensok 5, a settlement in the village of Kohmouta on the outskirts of Phnom Penh. The settlement was relocated from one of the capital’s inner city slums areas. Yean attends public school on the periphery of the settlement but due to the informal school fees system in Cambodia, she is forced to consider dropping out due to lack of funds. Yean is desperate to continue her education to fulfil her dreams of becoming a nurse, but without assistance her dreams seem out of reach.Charles, 16, lived with his mother and father in DRC. The Marekera family were forced to leave because their son was persecuted for being an albino. His father was repeatedly beaten after refusing to sell Charles to witchdoctors, who believe teeth, fingers and eyes brought good luck to those who bought their body parts. The transition for Charles arriving in Uganda from DRC has left him with large gaps in his education. Leaving as a senior in secondary school, he now finds himself back in primary school – and facing a similar stigma as an albino in Uganda. His long walks to school are interrupted by strangers attempting to lure him away to profit from the sale of his body parts. Charles explained: “I will never feel safe, however my safety now is less important to me than getting an education. I am determined to get my diploma and have a job where I can help protect the rights of other albinos.”Athar, 21, a beneficiary of Al Fakhoora, a programme of the Education Above All Foundation, was the youngest member to join the writers’ association, aged 14. She stressed the importance of explaining what is happening to the Palestinian people. Five years ago the conflict changed her life forever. She said: “The house was full of our relatives, suddenly everything went dark. I tried to get out of the house, I felt a pain in my leg and there was so much blood. I lost consciousness and woke in the ambulance. Hospitals ran out of anaesthetic so doctors stitched injuries I sustained without it, it was incredibly painful. I heard the news that my father was killed. Losing him was incredibly difficult for me as we were so close.” As a child, Athar had dreamt of becoming a writer or a poet. She said: “My father was my inspiration, encouraging me to write, since his death I have struggled to write anything. For me education is like food or fuel, an energy that gives me power to keep going.”Moza was born and raised east of the Tigris river that ides the city of Mosul. Her parents and five siblings have lived in a two-room concrete dwelling for 10 years. Farhan, Moza’s father, works as a labourer carrying blocks on construction sites across the city. He is in need of a hernia operation, which will cost £200, and finds work extremely difficult. He can’t afford six months off work to recover. The family income is only £62 per month, which barely covers bills. They are forced to take credit from shops to be able to eat. Moza is due to enrol back into schooling. However, at present, she cares for her mother who suffers respiratory problems due to a lodged bullet in her lung after being caught in crossfire during the conflict. She doesn’t know what to expect as she has never set foot in a classroom. Two years beyond the normal enrolment age of six, she still has great dreams of working with NGOs to help residents displaced from the city.Jonas, 12, was born in a village situated on the shores of Lake Victoria. He now lives with his father, a fisherman, and his step-mother a farmer. Jonas enrolled into an Educate A Child (EAC) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT) partnership in 2017. GMT conducted a survey reaching out to the community to help identify out-of-school children in the region. The survey identified more than 20,000. Jonas was one of those and set foot into a classroom for the first time at the age of 10. The mandatory age for school enrolment is seven, however his family’s lack of available funds meant he could not enrol into school. Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment. When asked what it was like to take his first steps into a classroom, he replied: “It was incredibly exciting, and now it is even more exciting as there is a good chance I will go to secondary school.”Ali, nine, a Syrian refugee family from Deir ez-Zur district in eastern Syria arrived in Lebanon in 2011. They fled their home with several neighbours by bus toward a safer haven in Lebanon at the outbreak of civil war, which tore through their country. Heavy shelling bombarded their bus and the remainder of their journey had to be made on foot. Nine-year old Ali Ahmed’s father, an agricultural labourer explained that life in Lebanon was hard as they struggle to pay basic bills such as food and rent. As with most Syrian refugees, they are in debt to their landlords and to local shops owners. The collective family income is barely enough to cover any of their bills. Ali, one of the family’s 10 children, attends school 10km from home and dreams, one day, to be able to return home with his family to Syria.Chacha, 12, was born and raised in a small village in northwestern Tanzania, where he lives with his mother and two siblings. He has never set foot in a classroom and is one of a reported 1.89 million out-of-school children in the country today. Chacha works seven days per week scavenging gold mining sites, digging up rocks containing gold-residue. To avoid being captured or shot by mining and government police for trespass, he works under the cover of darkness, 6pm to 6am. The rocks he finds, he sells to middle men, for approximately £1.50 per shift, who crush them to extract the gold. He explained: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my family. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.” The money Chacha earns he uses to purchase clothes for himself and his siblings, the remainder he gives to his mother to contribute to food costs. When he returns home from his 12-hour shift, he tends to the family cattle.Owen, 16, has been enrolled in Buremba Primary School since 2007 and is one of eight siblings. Now in older years at school, he must pay more money. His parents are peasant farmers and work the land digging and picking tea, this means they must work most days to be able to keep up the payments. Buremba School is one of 60 new schools constructed under the Building Tomorrow and Educate A Child programme in Uganda.Afat, 12, left his home in Deir ez-Zor, Syria six years ago, forced out by the civil war which displaced millions of people, in his case to the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon. He is one of the thousands of Syrian refugee children sat in doorways of Lebanon’s many tents, shelters and makeshift homes dreaming of an education. Instead, he works 11 hours a day collecting scrap metal which he sells for around £2.50. He knows he has a right to education, but he is concerned to help provide for his family. He dreams of one day being able to return home to Syria with his family, to a better life.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school. Abandoned by her biological parents along with her eight siblings, she now lives with her grandmother in the village of Kuriyah. She grazes cattle six hours a day for her grandmother in return for her keep. She was registered for school but never enrolled. Her grandmother and  is unable to afford the voluntary parental contribution fees. Mamoke describes her household as poor, her grandmother unable to provide more than one meal per day for her. Mamoke added: “There are many days where we do not eat at all.” She dreams of becoming a teacher, if she was able to go to school, so she can help others in her current situation.Ikiriza, 5, Kamwenge District, Uganda. Ikiriza who is five years old lives in a small house with his nine brothers and sisters. His parents can’t afford school tuition fees for all the children, leaving Ikiriza with little choice but to fund his own education by working weekends carrying plastic jerry cans of water from the lake for various households of the neighbourhood in Kamwenge district. For this, he earns the equivalent of 5 US cents a day, which helps contribute towards his school fees at Bisozi Primary. He dreams of one day becoming a doctor so that he can help his father who suffers from ill health.Rami, six, lives at Beach Camp, on the sea front amongst the heart of the fishing community al-Shati in the northern Gaza Strip. Rami walks amongst the rubble of shelled buildings, a reminder of past and present conflicts. Restriction to employment and travel have meant many Palestinians are confined in Gaza. Some bright lights still shine as Rami attends grade P1 in school and dreams of becoming a footballer one day.Abdul 10, with his gaze to the floor, wrapped in blankets, huddles by the family stove. His father, Muhammad, emerges from the black of the adjoining room clutching an armful of medical documents written in French, a language he cannot read. His son is two years overdue a heart operation that would save his life. Srey, three, lives in a small dark room with her parents, siblings and relatives. A total of eight people live in a cramped, damp space in a makeshift barn of corrugated metal on the edge of the railroad tracks in the urban slums. The CYMCA Facility drop-in centre, funded in partnership between EAA and Aide et Action, provides emergency education to around 80 children in the area.Joender, six, from Maracaibo in Venezuela arrived in Ipiales, Colombia, after a 33-day journey mainly on foot. He is one of 3.5 million Venezuelan refugees that have left their homes following a catastrophic economic meltdown of his country leaving its citizens starving with no access to food, employment, medical services or education. He holds a packet of crackers, a kind donation from one of the many generous Colombians offering support to the Venezuelan people.Kennedy, 13, displaced to Uganda. He is another statistic of the 2.3 million South Sudanese refugees that fled the outbreak of civil war. Uganda alone shouldering 800,000 refugees. Kennedy was denied a normal childhood and instead became a witness to violence, torture and death in war. Not surprisingly, Kennedy’s family were unwilling to send him to school with threat of armed attack, abduction or recruitment by militias. On arrival in Uganda, Kennedy was still held back from attending school and fulfilling his dream of becoming a doctor. His parents were simply unable to afford the cost of a pair of shoes required for enrolment.“The canvas Billingham bags which carry the tools of my trade. They have sat beside me in the dust of countries around the world listening with me to every word of every story. I feel torn staring at them, joy at returning to my loved ones and the heartache of those I had to leave behind. Now they sit on the polished floor of my room, zipped up and lined up. I need them closer, to feel their weight on my shoulders again, I need to be away.….”David, 13, arrived in Uganda in July 2016 fleeing the civil war that broke out in South Sudan. He arrived with his mother and father and his eight brothers and sisters after two days of walking. He recalls seeing many dead bodies lining the sides of the tracks that led to Uganda’s northern border. The family were fearful of abduction by rebel groups or becoming caught in crossfire between the government and militia groups. David enjoyed school immensely in South Sudan but said his school had closed due to conflict. He attends Alaba School at Bidi Bidi Refugee Settlement. David dreams of a better life for his family.Sarah, 14, arrived to Kigeme refugee camp from DRC in 2012. Her parents, now unemployed in Rwanda, worked as rag traders. They made the decision to flee the fighting for the safety and relative calm of Rwanda. They were made to feel very welcome by the host community. Sarah is enrolled in class, three years behind where she should be, due to conflict, and she really enjoys her schooling. GS Gasaka school, run by Education Above All Foundation and UNHCR, is providing her the environment to allow her to dream one day of becoming an accountant so she can help her family live a better life.Nakato 19, was born and raised in Yumbe, Uganda. A graduate from Aruma High School, she has aspirations of becoming a journalist. She is actively involved in a movement called “Raise up and Talk” to help empower the younger generation to share their experiences and stories as a form of therapy, to help process the trauma from a life in conflict. Forestal, nine, is in second grade at Marescot School, Haiti. The school is funded through the partnership between non-profit buildOn Haiti, and Educate A Child (EAC), who have constructed 58 schools, as well as training 959 teachers. Forestal explains how she was given up by her father after the death of her mother. She now lives with her auntie as a “restavek” (child in domestic servitude) where she performs chores around the house for at least two hours a day including laundry, sweeping and mopping floors. She can only recall seeing her father once in her entire life. “It was only for one day, but it was really great, we had so much fun,” she says. Forestal hopes that she can see him again – but he lives and works in Port Au Prince, more than three hours away by car.Furaha, six, attends Buremba Primary School. She is a member of the Batwa “Pygmy” tribe, forced out of their native home in the Bwindi Forest to make way for a national park protected as a Unesco World Heritage Site. She lives in Kitahurira settlement camp, about 2.5km and a three-hour walk from her school. The construction of schools and training of teachers in remote areas of challenging geography ensures those hardest to reach have a right to education. Building Tomorrow Uganda through its partnership with Education Above All Foundation has enrolled 53,373 out-of-school children back into quality primary education in Uganda.Niyosenga,12, arrived from Kiyiri, DRC, in 2016. Her mother was killed in the fierce fighting which swept through towns and villages. She made the journey with her father and grandmother to the relative safe haven of Uganda to join the 1.2 million refugees. Niyosenga remained out of education in DRC until the age of nine as the long walk to school was too dangerous with roads closed by police or rebel militia.To help pay for Niyosenga’s school fees her father grows maize while her grandmother, 72, weaves baskets.Jasme, 10, is enrolled at a buildOn school in Perigny. Her two brothers and three sisters all attend the same school. Unlike the reported 300,000 restavek children that live away from their biological parents, Jasme lives with her family.Esperence, 10, goes to Perigny school. Seated on a bench at the end of a long dark corridor, overcome with emotion, he explains how he was given up by his biological parents at the age of eight. He now lives with his auntie and is a restavek child. The term restavek comes from the French rester avec, to stay with. Discussing the work around the house he has to complete as part of his daily chores, he explains: “I can never go out and play with my friends as my house family always call me back inside to do more jobs.”Yean, six, lives in Phnom Penh. Yean’s mother, a widow, feels helpless as she simply cannot earn enough to support her family. Today, Yean lives with her 80-year-old grandmother Khzm Men in Sensok 5, a settlement in the village of Kohmouta on the outskirts of Phnom Penh. The settlement was relocated from one of the capital’s inner city slums areas. Yean attends public school on the periphery of the settlement but due to the informal school fees system in Cambodia, she is forced to consider dropping out due to lack of funds. Yean is desperate to continue her education to fulfil her dreams of becoming a nurse, but without assistance her dreams seem out of reach.Charles, 16, lived with his mother and father in DRC. The Marekera family were forced to leave because their son was persecuted for being an albino. His father was repeatedly beaten after refusing to sell Charles to witchdoctors, who believe teeth, fingers and eyes brought good luck to those who bought their body parts. The transition for Charles arriving in Uganda from DRC has left him with large gaps in his education. Leaving as a senior in secondary school, he now finds himself back in primary school – and facing a similar stigma as an albino in Uganda. His long walks to school are interrupted by strangers attempting to lure him away to profit from the sale of his body parts. Charles explained: “I will never feel safe, however my safety now is less important to me than getting an education. I am determined to get my diploma and have a job where I can help protect the rights of other albinos.”Athar, 21, a beneficiary of Al Fakhoora, a programme of the Education Above All Foundation, was the youngest member to join the writers’ association, aged 14. She stressed the importance of explaining what is happening to the Palestinian people. Five years ago the conflict changed her life forever. She said: “The house was full of our relatives, suddenly everything went dark. I tried to get out of the house, I felt a pain in my leg and there was so much blood. I lost consciousness and woke in the ambulance. Hospitals ran out of anaesthetic so doctors stitched injuries I sustained without it, it was incredibly painful. I heard the news that my father was killed. Losing him was incredibly difficult for me as we were so close.” As a child, Athar had dreamt of becoming a writer or a poet. She said: “My father was my inspiration, encouraging me to write, since his death I have struggled to write anything. For me education is like food or fuel, an energy that gives me power to keep going.”Moza was born and raised east of the Tigris river that ides the city of Mosul. Her parents and five siblings have lived in a two-room concrete dwelling for 10 years. Farhan, Moza’s father, works as a labourer carrying blocks on construction sites across the city. He is in need of a hernia operation, which will cost £200, and finds work extremely difficult. He can’t afford six months off work to recover. The family income is only £62 per month, which barely covers bills. They are forced to take credit from shops to be able to eat. Moza is due to enrol back into schooling. However, at present, she cares for her mother who suffers respiratory problems due to a lodged bullet in her lung after being caught in crossfire during the conflict. She doesn’t know what to expect as she has never set foot in a classroom. Two years beyond the normal enrolment age of six, she still has great dreams of working with NGOs to help residents displaced from the city.Jonas, 12, was born in a village situated on the shores of Lake Victoria. He now lives with his father, a fisherman, and his step-mother a farmer. Jonas enrolled into an Educate A Child (EAC) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT) partnership in 2017. GMT conducted a survey reaching out to the community to help identify out-of-school children in the region. The survey identified more than 20,000. Jonas was one of those and set foot into a classroom for the first time at the age of 10. The mandatory age for school enrolment is seven, however his family’s lack of available funds meant he could not enrol into school. Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment. When asked what it was like to take his first steps into a classroom, he replied: “It was incredibly exciting, and now it is even more exciting as there is a good chance I will go to secondary school.”Ali, nine, a Syrian refugee family from Deir ez-Zur district in eastern Syria arrived in Lebanon in 2011. They fled their home with several neighbours by bus toward a safer haven in Lebanon at the outbreak of civil war, which tore through their country. Heavy shelling bombarded their bus and the remainder of their journey had to be made on foot. Nine-year old Ali Ahmed’s father, an agricultural labourer explained that life in Lebanon was hard as they struggle to pay basic bills such as food and rent. As with most Syrian refugees, they are in debt to their landlords and to local shops owners. The collective family income is barely enough to cover any of their bills. Ali, one of the family’s 10 children, attends school 10km from home and dreams, one day, to be able to return home with his family to Syria.Chacha, 12, was born and raised in a small village in northwestern Tanzania, where he lives with his mother and two siblings. He has never set foot in a classroom and is one of a reported 1.89 million out-of-school children in the country today. Chacha works seven days per week scavenging gold mining sites, digging up rocks containing gold-residue. To avoid being captured or shot by mining and government police for trespass, he works under the cover of darkness, 6pm to 6am. The rocks he finds, he sells to middle men, for approximately £1.50 per shift, who crush them to extract the gold. He explained: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my family. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.” The money Chacha earns he uses to purchase clothes for himself and his siblings, the remainder he gives to his mother to contribute to food costs. When he returns home from his 12-hour shift, he tends to the family cattle.Owen, 16, has been enrolled in Buremba Primary School since 2007 and is one of eight siblings. Now in older years at school, he must pay more money. His parents are peasant farmers and work the land digging and picking tea, this means they must work most days to be able to keep up the payments. Buremba School is one of 60 new schools constructed under the Building Tomorrow and Educate A Child programme in Uganda.Afat, 12, left his home in Deir ez-Zor, Syria six years ago, forced out by the civil war which displaced millions of people, in his case to the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon. He is one of the thousands of Syrian refugee children sat in doorways of Lebanon’s many tents, shelters and makeshift homes dreaming of an education. Instead, he works 11 hours a day collecting scrap metal which he sells for around £2.50. He knows he has a right to education, but he is concerned to help provide for his family. He dreams of one day being able to return home to Syria with his family, to a better life.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school. Abandoned by her biological parents along with her eight siblings, she now lives with her grandmother in the village of Kuriyah. She grazes cattle six hours a day for her grandmother in return for her keep. She was registered for school but never enrolled. Her grandmother and  is unable to afford the voluntary parental contribution fees. Mamoke describes her household as poor, her grandmother unable to provide more than one meal per day for her. Mamoke added: “There are many days where we do not eat at all.” She dreams of becoming a teacher, if she was able to go to school, so she can help others in her current situation.Ikiriza, 5, Kamwenge District, Uganda. Ikiriza who is five years old lives in a small house with his nine brothers and sisters. His parents can’t afford school tuition fees for all the children, leaving Ikiriza with little choice but to fund his own education by working weekends carrying plastic jerry cans of water from the lake for various households of the neighbourhood in Kamwenge district. For this, he earns the equivalent of 5 US cents a day, which helps contribute towards his school fees at Bisozi Primary. He dreams of one day becoming a doctor so that he can help his father who suffers from ill health.Rami, six, lives at Beach Camp, on the sea front amongst the heart of the fishing community al-Shati in the northern Gaza Strip. Rami walks amongst the rubble of shelled buildings, a reminder of past and present conflicts. Restriction to employment and travel have meant many Palestinians are confined in Gaza. Some bright lights still shine as Rami attends grade P1 in school and dreams of becoming a footballer one day.Abdul 10, with his gaze to the floor, wrapped in blankets, huddles by the family stove. His father, Muhammad, emerges from the black of the adjoining room clutching an armful of medical documents written in French, a language he cannot read. His son is two years overdue a heart operation that would save his life. Srey, three, lives in a small dark room with her parents, siblings and relatives. A total of eight people live in a cramped, damp space in a makeshift barn of corrugated metal on the edge of the railroad tracks in the urban slums. The CYMCA Facility drop-in centre, funded in partnership between EAA and Aide et Action, provides emergency education to around 80 children in the area.Joender, six, from Maracaibo in Venezuela arrived in Ipiales, Colombia, after a 33-day journey mainly on foot. He is one of 3.5 million Venezuelan refugees that have left their homes following a catastrophic economic meltdown of his country leaving its citizens starving with no access to food, employment, medical services or education. He holds a packet of crackers, a kind donation from one of the many generous Colombians offering support to the Venezuelan people.Kennedy, 13, displaced to Uganda. He is another statistic of the 2.3 million South Sudanese refugees that fled the outbreak of civil war. Uganda alone shouldering 800,000 refugees. Kennedy was denied a normal childhood and instead became a witness to violence, torture and death in war. Not surprisingly, Kennedy’s family were unwilling to send him to school with threat of armed attack, abduction or recruitment by militias.

I feel torn – from the joy at returning to my\u0026nbsploved ones and the heartache for those I\u0026nbsphad to leave behind. I am staring at my canvas camera bags, which sat beside me in the dust of countries around the world.\u0026nbspNow they sit on the polished floor of my room, zipped up. I need them closer, to feel their weight on my shoulders again, I need to be away…Here I have compiled a collection of photographs and memories, comprising the stories of some of the most marginalised children in the world.Winter: Abdul, a Syrian refugee aged 10, is seated in a makeshift shelter, perched high among\u0026nbspthe rugged snowy mountain caps of Arsal, Lebanon. He holds his father’s hand as they both huddle\u0026nbspby the stove for warmth. He has the haunting stare of a boy who knows he is\u0026nbspgoing to die, an expression that cuts through the paraffin haze of the dark room as temperatures fall below zero. Mohammed, his father, gaunt from grief, explains\u0026nbsphis son is two years overdue for an operation that could save his life.\u0026nbspWith no means to finance it, he raises\u0026nbsphis hands to the sky in hope that his prayers would be answered.\u0026nbspI remember waiting to see my doctor as a child. I knew my turn would come Abdul knew his would not.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSpring:\u0026nbspVenezuelan refugees who once ate together as families around their own tables\u0026nbspnow eat from rubbish bins on their hands and knees to survive the crisis in their country. All the while, their president publicly feasts\u0026nbspin lavish establishments. Roughly 3.5 million Venezuelans, among them doctors, lawyers and teachers, have left their country, out of starvation and fear.Joender, aged six, from Maracaibo in Venezuela, arrived in\u0026nbspIpiales, Colombia, exhausted and hungry. He was offloaded with his family from a galvanised lorry like cattle, after a 33-day journey, mostly on foot, where they were forced to beg for food to survive. His cupped hands are\u0026nbsprewarded with a packet of biscuits donated by a local in the town. He clutches\u0026nbspthe packet like a prize. Having never begged for food myself as a child, I could not begin to understand the internal dialogue in doing so. I knew I could simply open a fridge door\u0026nbspJoender\u0026nbspcan’t.Summer:\u0026nbspEsperence, aged 10, is a Haitian “restavek” or child slave. He was\u0026nbspgiven away by his biological parents to a more affluent household and\u0026nbspforced into a life of domestic servitude. The feeling of being abandoned proves\u0026nbspto be too much for him. Standing in the kitchen and washing dishes, he simply shrugs his small shoulders, and one by one the tears roll\u0026nbspdown his face. Hours each day are spent cleaning, sweeping and washing.\u0026nbsp“I can never go out and play with my friends as my house family always call me back inside to do more jobs,”\u0026nbsphe says.\u0026nbspNearly 260 million children aren’t in school – do we care?

Abandoned by her parents along with her siblings, she now lives with her grandmother at the mercy of abject poverty. In a dark room in remote north western Tanzania, she explains\u0026nbsphow not going to school saddens\u0026nbspher. But she nonetheless still dreams that somehow she could become a teacher to help others like her with no access to education. I didn\u0027t have a choice.\u0026nbspI had to go to school. Mamoke didn’t have a choice, but that was because the right of education was unavailable to her. I realise I have taken so much\u0026nbspfor granted in my life. Children around the world live with no access to healthcare, displaced from their home, going to sleep hungry, growing up in conflict and with no\u0026nbspeducation.I did not choose my career any more than I chose my life. It chose me, and it is the greatest privilege, a blessing and a burden in the same breath.

And then he also didn’t notice when the car span round and hit the front of his lorry again.And finally he didn’t notice when he was ­actually pushing the car SIDEWAYS along the busy dual carriageway.The man in the Golf was presumably leaning on his horn as hard as he was leaning on his brakes. Everyone in every other car on the road was also leaning on their horn and gesticulating.But still, chummy in the cab kept rolling along. I have spoken to lorry drivers about how this could be possible and they say that in the Daf truck that our friend was driving, it isn’t.They say that in a Volvo you sit so high up, your view of the road ahead is obscured by clouds and solar flares. But the seating ­position in a Daf is ­famously low down.So he MUST have noticed that instead of a teddy tied to his radiator grille, he had a full-sized Golf. Me though  I have another suggestion.Yes, the Golf’s tyres would have been making a right old din buthe’d had the radio on, maybe he didn’t hear them.And sure, it takes quite of lot of effort to push a Golf sideways along the road. But the engine in that Daf is designed to haul tonnes, and at the time of the incident no trailer was attached.Now that I’m a farmer, I understand the problem here. All my neighbouring farmers say that my new tractor is far too large.To which I say that tractors are like penises. And therefore cannot be too large. They also say the  horsepower it develops is too much.And on that, I sort of know what they mean. In a less powerful tractor you can sense when the ground is soft or the load is too heavy.But in mine, I just sit there listening to the radio, not noticing that my cultivator on the back has become entangled in a hedge and is ripping the whole thing out of the ground.Once, I turned round after I’d done a nice straight line across a field, to find I’d been pulling a whole postcode behind me.There were houses, schools and even a ­couple of churches in the mountain of mud I’d been dragging along.If I somehow hit a Volkswagen in my tractor, and I couldn’t see it out of the window, I definitely wouldn’t notice.Any more than I’d noticea baby wren landed on the roof. I’m sure that for the Golf driver on the A, it must have been a pretty scary moment. I sympathise with him.But I also sympathise with the lorry driver who set off to work as a man and arrived as an internet sensation with no one to sympathise with him except me and an eye-witness called Ellie Goulding.WE were told on Wednesday that Australia had endured its hottest day EVER.But that’s not strictly accurate. Yes, the average temperature across the whole of the country was .Cand that’s pretty toasty.But several million years ago, the world was around ten times hotter than that.And back in the days when rock was still liquid and the continents were sorting themselves out, temperatures hovered round the clock at around ,C.So when scientists say Australia has had its hottest day ever, what they mean is: “Australia has had its ­hottest day since records began.”Which in geological time is about . of a second.Big headlines in Buenos Aires, for sure. And maybe a fleet heading off to the Falklands again.WHEREVER my late mother is right now, she’ll be very happy, because Nicky Henson has died. She adored him.He was best known as the lothario from Fawlty Towers, but she loved him best for his stage performance in Noises Off.She loved him so much, in fact, thatmemory serves, she went to see him every night for about a year.Because it was so sweaty and horrid in there, I walked through the door, turned round and walked straight out again.IF you are wondering what to watch on TV over Christmas, may I suggest The Last Ship, on Amazon Prime.The executive producer is Michael Bay, which means everything blows up all the time.It features a really cool destroyer, some really bad baddies and some really cool goodies who say: “Secure the perimeter” every five minutes.Best of all, though, it stars the incomparable Rhona Mitra, whose work, and face, I’ve admired for years.THE Labourites squabbling over who will be their next party leader are all saying they’ll keep Jeremy Corbyn’s policies alive.This is excellent news because, in five years, we will get yet another chance to keep them out of Downing Street.SO, there’s a -year-old man in Norway who’s won  elite games of chess on the trot and is now the World Champion.That’s pretty impressive, but for Magnus Carlsen it’s just an aside, because in his local football league he’s a bit of a star as well.In fact, last time out, he scored  goals. At two, he could solve -piece jigsaw puzzles. By five he could recall the size, population and flag of every country on Earth.And by  he’d become a chess grandmaster. You’d imagine, then, that with such a mind he could do anything with his le. Unwrap the secrets of cold fusion.Conquer the problems of faster-than-light travel. Work out how you can open the wrapping of a Gillette razor using only your hands. But no.Instead, Magnus turned his attention to fantasy football, where, inevitably, he’s thrashed seven million other players to become the best in the world.As I write, he’s about to beat the all-time record of  undefeated games. And why did he do this, when he could have achieved so much more Well, it might have something to do with the fact he’s Norwegian. The Norse don’t like to make a fuss.They don’t like to stand out. Which is why, in the country’s entire history, all they’ve ever invented is the cheese kne.FINALLY, may I just take a moment to wish everyone in the whole world a very happy Christmas.Except Diane Abbott and Jeremy Corbyn.

But not quite.Even we, though, didn’t dare to dream that a proper Brexit — no customs union, no single market, fully taking back control — would pass by a thumping margin under a Boris Johnson Government beginning five years in power.The Remainer wreckers are gone. Yet, incredibly, Brexit was STILL opposed by the twitching corpse of the Labour Party in a last, spiteful two-fingered gesture to its former voters.What don’t these MPs get  They bet the house on a “people’s vote” and lost. And yet they still witter on about second referendums, customs unions or otherwise tying ourselves to the EU.One voice seemed to speak sense. “We recognise the clear message from the public,” said Jeremy Corbyn. “We have to respect that and move on.”Then, ridiculously, he led his rabble through the lobby to vote against Brexit one last time.A historic day, with Labour yet again on the wrong side of it. And for Corbyn, a dismal end to his inglorious week of sullen silence and door-slamming petulance.WE’RE confused.One minute Corbyn takes responsibility for his defeat. The next he blames hostility from “billionaire Press barons”.He cannot grasp a simple reality about The Sun. If we fear a wannabe Government will wreck the economy and destroy our readers’ jobs, we oppose it.But the Left think anyone not devoted to socialist purity must have corrupt motives. And for these zealots the answer is an even more left-wing leader. Maybe contender Clive Lewis, who makes Corbyn look like Norman Tebbit.Unless they grow out of this, they will spend their lives in impotent opposition.IT is high time to end voter fraud, using compulsory photo ID. We are delighted the Tories aim to do it.The Left always protests it is so rare it is not worth the fuss. Whatever could they be worried about  Surely not that the poorest will be deprived of their vote, since photo IDs will be free. What other motive could they have There is a wealth of first-hand or anecdotal evidence of people voting multiple times in dferent constituencies, stealing someone ’s vote, voting by post AND in person and so on.Conviction rates are low only because the system is so wide open it is hard to spot and catch offenders. But this is a serious crime meriting jail every time.And when so many routine tasks now require ID, one as vital to our democracy as casting your ballot certainly should.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Because who wants to sit there being sold to Those were simpler days.So much has changed, including a new profession coming into existence: The influencer.The problem with influencers is that it’s impossible to tell whether they are enthusiastically mentioning products because they love them or because they are being paid to.Eventhey really love a certain cream or tea, when money changes hands, the water is muddied.We like to believe people would only promote products that make their lives better.But the clue is in the name. Anyone whose job title is “influencer” is being paid to sway their followers into buying things they otherwise would not.As a result, we don’t know who to trust.This was illustrated this week by Lauren Goodger being caught on camera for a BBC show agreeing to promote a drink containing hydrogen cyanide.The reality TV star was secretly filmed during a meeting where she was asked to promote a fake diet drink named Cyanora — said to contain the deadly chemical hydrogen cyanide — on Instagram.It was part of an investigation by the documentary into whether celebrities consume the products which they are paid to promote.The alacrity with which Goodger agreed to promote this fake product was alarming.Similarly worrying, to demonstrate her willingness to promote a product she had never tried, she talked about how she promoted another product, Skinny Coffee, which in January she claimed helped her lose lb in three weeks.“I never tried Skinny Coffee,” she admitted.To drive the point home, she added: “I’ve even had my own friends message me, ‘Laur, can you get me some of that Skinny Coffee, does it work ’ . . . I’m like, ‘Do you not know this by now ’ And they’re actually going and buying it and I’m like, ‘You know how this works’.”At least she is honest. When she doesn’t realise she is being recorded.By way of explanation, a representative for Goodger said: “Lauren was asked to . . . appear in an advert for a new water.“There was no mention of what the water contained before the meeting. The money on the table was quite a large sum.”Goodger herself said: “As with any audition, you people-please and say what they want to hear.“They asked me, ‘Would I promote the drink without using it ’ In the heat of the moment, I said yes and also said I hadn’t tried Skinny Coffee — in the hope of getting the job.“I would never promote anything on my Instagram that I don’t feel is right for my followers and that I haven’t used. The sit-down meeting after the audition was filmed undercover without my knowledge.”So I guess we take this to mean that had she known she was being filmed, she wouldn’t have been so up-front about the real role of an influencer.It is easy to forget that influencers are paid to promote products.Even those who start off promising to recommend only things they like are probably susceptible,the price is right. Andthat is the case, how can we believe anything is a genuine endorsement So, who can we trust  Let’s start with ourselves. Instead of handing our likes and values over to be decided by so-called influencers, we should remember our own sense of self and what we like and dislike.And let’s go back to another thing from the good old days: Trusting real friends instead of Instagram ones.FALLON SHERROCK made history this week as the first woman to beat a man at the PDC World Darts Championships.She was so surprised to beat Ted Evetts - at Alexandra Palace on Tuesday she wept tears of joy, saying: “I have proved we can play the men and we can beat them!”Fallon, , who until four years ago was a professional hairdresser, first picked up darts at the age of .She later added: “I can’t believe what I achieved. I’m so happy.I always had the game but us women have never had the opportunity to prove it.”Very true. But isn’t it mad  There is no reason why a woman can’t play darts as well as a man.But it also needs people to stop treating it like a service for plasters, reassurance and insignicant ailments.Take the man on C’s  Hours In AE who turned up at hospital with a stf neck.Issuing fines to time-wasters is the only way people will start to realise how valuable our NHS is – and how we need to treat it with the respect it deserves or risk losing it.I AM pleased the judge’s decision to impose two le sentences on “Black Cab Rapist” John Worboys could see him die behind bars.Mrs Justice Gowan handed Worboys, , a minimum term of six years for attacking four women and he will have no chance of parole before .Worboys, one of Britain’s worst sexual predators, now goes by the name John Derek Radford and has been in jail since  for abusing  other victims.It is believed he plied more than  women with drink laced with sedatives from a “rape kit” kept in his cab.The judge told him he may never be released, branding him “still dangerous”.For once, in this case le really does mean le. It is likely he will die in prison.And just think: Last year, the idiots on the Parole Board were actually going to let him out.PHOTOS of Beyonce at rapper Diddy’s th birthday party are jaw-dropping.She looked a million dollars in that dress .But also, who knew Alexis Carrington’s  Dynasty fashion was back  I guess we do now.JUSTIN Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, has been on the receiving end of some unfair bashing of late.Firstly he was accused by some of being a “leftie Remainer”. Then others called him a Tory. Obviously he can’t be both.To be called a racist by voices on the Left for defending the Chief Rabbi was outrageous.The Archbishop was criticised when he effectively backed the Chief Rabbi’s comments about the Labour leadership’s record on anti-Semitism with a tweet highlighting the “deep sense of insecurity and fear felt by many British Jews”.Welby has done some great stuff lately, including going to ebola zones against all advice.Not only that, his voice is vital at this time of year as the country needs to come together post-election and at the start of a new decade.He was right to defend the Chief Rabbi and we should come together to support him as the leader of the Church of England.It is a tad violent, but it is great.Ben Hardy plays a guy who is an expert in extreme sport parkour .I met Ben when I was on ITV’s Lorraine this week.He is a lovely man and a great actor.I ADMIRE Sharon Osborne’s honesty about what she has done to look the way she does.Namely, she has spent £, on a facelt, tummy tuck, eye lt, abdominoplasty, liposuction and Botox, breast surgery, vaginal cosmetic surgery, and lost more than lb after gastric surgery.In the past, she has said: “There’s not much I haven’t had tweaked, stretched, peeled, lasered, veneered, enhanced or removed altogether.”Live and let live, I always say. Clearly Sharon is happy with the work she has had done and she looks great.Some people, we would say, grow old gracefully.

Decades of seeing the innocent robbed of their lives while the guilty were free to grow old.Years of knowing that those who planned the slaughter were lucky recipients of one of Tony Blair’s “letters of comfort” — meaning that under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, known ­terrorists would never be prosecuted.And so got away with murder. Until this week.Mrs Justice Yip ruled in the High Court that the IRA’s John Downey was an “active participant” and “knowingly involved” in the Hyde Park slaughter.“We’ve got justice,” says Sarahjane Young, who was four years old when she watched from the window of her nursery as her -year-old father, Corporal Jeffrey Young, was blown up. “We can call John Downey what he really is at last — a terrorist ­murderer.”The images of that terrible carnage are seared into the memory of anyone old enough to remember.The broken bodies of seven dead horses strewn across the park. The crumpled row of cars destroyed by a lb nail bomb that was built to tear apart flesh and blood and ­families, designed to break hearts and lives and inflict unimaginable human misery.And the heartbreakingly smiling faces of the dead seen earlier as they posed proudly in their Household Caly unorms.Lieutenant Anthony Daly, . ­Corporal Roy Bright, . And two teenagers who were already men.Trooper Simon Tipper, , just back from his honeymoon. And ­Lance Corporal Jeffrey Young, also , whose tiny daughter Sarahjane watched her daddy ride by, and then watched him die.John Downey’s fingerprints were found on car park tickets for the vehicle containing the nail bomb. So why has it taken so long to bring the guilty man to justice Because the families of the victims were forced to take out a civil action after the courts failed them.Criminal proceedings against Downey collapsed at the Old Bailey in  because he was one of  IRA members who secretly received one of Tony Blair’s “letters of comfort”.Blair bought peace with the IRA by assuring the men of violence they were no longer wanted for crimes committed during the Troubles.It is a bitter truth that you make peace with your enemies and not your friends. But for far too long the peace brokered by Blair has seemed wickedly, unforgivably one-sided.Hundreds of IRA men were free to live their lives while it took until THIS THURSDAY for Boris Johnson to promise in the Queen’s Speech that former veterans of the British Army who served in the Troubles would finally be free from witch hunts.That Downey has been brought to book at long last is thanks to the fierce determination of the bereaved families and to the generosity of the public, including Sun readers who raised £, to help fund their cause.“I want to thank all of you,” says Mark Tipper, brother of -year-old Trooper Simon Tipper. “You have no idea what this day means to all of us. My brother can sleep easy at last.”The verdict paves the way for the families to pursue Downey— currently on remand in Northern ­Ireland for the murder of two ­soldiers at Enniskillen — for damages of up to half a million pounds. But their success is inevitably tinged with bitter regret.Because it is a shameful stain on our justice system that the families of murdered soldiers were forced to wait  long years for justice.And it is a disgrace that these families were refused legal aid four times while Downey was awarded £, of taxpayers’ money to defend himself against criminal proceedings.And it is mind-boggling — is it not  — that the Labour Party just went into a General Election led by Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell, two failed politicians who have never made any secret of their ­puerile hero worship of the IRA.McDonnell had a plaque commemorating the “martyrs” of the IRA and INLA on the wall of his constituency office.In , Corbyn caused outrage when he invited Gerry Adams and other members of Sinn Fein to Westminster when there was still blood on the streets of Brighton after the IRA bombed the Grand Hotel.If Labour is ever again going to be a serious opposition party — let alone worthy of government — then the party must never again chose leaders who have spent their careers licking the boots of terrorists.And isn’t it a national disgrace that Tony Blair never sent his “letters of comfort” to OUR boys We all love Sir Paul. But when it comes to Christmas records, give me Bing Crosby, Noddy Holder or The Pogues.In fact, give me anybody but the man who thought “simply having a wonderful Christmastime!” sums up the magic of the season.SUDDENLY the national paralysis is over.You can feel it in the air. You can see it in Boris Johnson’s grin – especially when Jeremy Corbyn is by his side.How quickly the world moves on. How suddenly the new day breaks. How abruptly a catchphrase passes its best-by date.John Bercow’s “ORDER! ORDER!” seems as quaintly ancient as Larry Grayson’s “Oooh, shut that door!” or Dick Emery’s “Oooh, you are awful – but I like you!”Bercow is reduced to bellowing “ORDER! ORDER!” to the baffled viewers of Italian TV.He has even been spied shouting his hackneyed catchphrase at his fellow travellers on a south London bus.It seems like only last week that Bercow took enormous preening delight in bellowing, “ORDER! ORDER!” at the mother of all Parliaments.Now yesterday’s Speaker is shouting it on the number  to Catford.He should have borrowed one of Ken Livingstone’s newts.IT has been a bad year for boxing when your favourite fistic moment is Kate Beckinsale demonstrating her stf right cross for Women’s Health magazine.At the start of , it seemed inevitable that Anthony Joshua, Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder would have a series of fights to match the glory days of Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier and George Foreman.They somehow all avoided each other.With the Fury-Wilder rematch allegedly about to be announced for February, perhaps  will be better for boxing.Andit’s not – well, fight fans have always got Kate Beckinsale’s right hander.AFTER Mathew Horne’s late-night trolling of the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg, I am giving the Gavin  Stacey Christmas special a miss.You can watch performers you don’t care for.For example, I can’t stand Benedict Cumberbatch – the eco-activist who advertises cars in China – but I will watch Cumberbatch in Sam Mendes’ World War One film  next year because it sounds unmissable.But Gavin, Stacey and Mathew  I can live without it.Horne tweeted: “I really wish I loved myself as much as you, Laura . . . your ‘journalism’ knows no bounds . . . Resign, you disingenuous plopcarpet.”And plenty more of the same spiteful, semi-literate garbage.It is mind-blowing how totally lost these right-on Rada revolutionaries are when someone doesn’t write them a script.And voters really, REALLY don’t like it.EVERY one of the candidates who Hugh Grant campaigned for at the General Election lost. Lib Dem, Labour, male, female, anti-Brexit or . . .  actually, they were all anti-Brexit.It didn’t work – just as Steve Coogan telling Brexit supporters that we are ignorant did not make us rush out to vote to stop Brexit.I have come to believe that luvvie endorsements are totally counter-productive.They quite literally have the opposite effect that the smug, self-important thespians hope.The public take one look at Grant and Coogan – then vote exactly the opposite way. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord.

It will have done the main thing that it was put in power to do within two months of taking office.The danger for the Tories is that their new electoral ­coalition was held together by a desire to Get Brexit Done and fear of Jeremy Corbyn, and both of those issues will soon be resolved.As the party’s campaign director, Isaac Levido, pointed out to Tory MPs on Wednesday afternoon, Brexit and Corbyn won this election for the Tories and both of them will be gone by the time of the next ­election, so the Tories have to deliver for their new voters or risk defeat.No  is acutely ­conscious of this risk. They know they need a new glue for their coalition — and fast.At Political Cabinet on Tuesday morning, this point was rammed home to ministers by both the PM and Levido.Levido, a clear-sighted Australian, warned the assembled secretaries of state that the Tories have “not won the domestic policy fight” yet.He stressed that this election had been about Getting Brexit Done more than any other issue.Tory support among Leave voters went from  per cent in  to  per cent, and that was key to the victory.Ministers were told that the party’s polling showed the positive things voters associated with the Tories were about sorting Brexit, while the negative things about Labour were to do with Corbyn or Brexit.Levido was clear that voters were backing the Tories to finish Brexit — not because they had suddenly become Conservatives. Another danger for the Tories is that Labour’s fundamental brand is nowhere near as damaged as many at Westminster think.With Corbyn gone and Brexit removed as an issue, the party may well be able to bounce back much faster than expected.Levido pointed out that the Tories’ own polling of  marginal seats had seen the gap between the two parties narrow to just four points in the aftermath of the manestos, as Labour briefly succeeded in turning the conversation away from Brexit.Boris Johnson and the Tory campaign pushed Brexit back to the top of the agenda.Levido was clear that for this reason the election could not be seen as a categorical rejection of Labour’s policies. The challenge for the Tories is to move fast to deliver change, so that people do not feel tempted to go back to Labour again.Do this right and, over the next decade, Darlington, West Bromwich and Wrexham will become Tory heartlands. Get it wrong and these places will turn red once again.Boris told cabinet ministers that voters needed to see and feel change in their local AE and on their roads and high streets.He said there needed to be a clear reduction in homelessness and voters must know that they and their family have a better chance of owning a home. This election made the Tories a national party again.Now they must show these new voters that their cares are Conservative concerns — and that the party knows how to fix the problems. They must deliver for the whole nation.Now it is South Yorkshire, where the Tories hold three seats – Rother Valley, Don Valley and Penistone And Stocksbridge.James Cleverly, the ebullient Tory chairman, has relished telling colleagues this fact. I understand that to reflect this new reality, the Tories are planning to move a large chunk of their party headquarters up north.The thinking is that by getting a chunk of the party operation out of London and into the North, it will make the party less London-centric and more attuned to the concerns of the rest of the country.BORIS JOHNSON is determined that next year must not be as dominated by Brexit as this year has been. He told Cabinet this week that once the UK leaves the EU on January , they should stop talking about Brexit.The PM argued that while the EU would try to create new clf edges and fresh moments of drama, the Government should resist being drawn into this dynamic.He argued that ministers should instead approach it as a normal trade negotiation rather than as some epoch-defining event.I am told that as part of the Government’s effort to de-dramatise things, they intend to resist going to Brussels for every negotiation – something which only adds to the tension and drama.I understand they want negotiations on both sides of the Channel rather than the UK always looking like a supplicant in heading to Europe to be told what it can and cannot have.As part of the effort to lower the profile of these trade talks, I am informed that David Frost – Boris’s understated but effective EU sherpa – will carry on conducting the negotiations.Frost, who is trusted totally by the PM and his inner circle, secured the changes to the withdrawal agreement that made it acceptable to Tory MPs. Having Frost conduct the negotiations rather than a cabinet minister will make them less likely to dominate the news.But there is no getting away from the importance of these talks to the UK. The deal will be the first trade deal the nation has done in -odd years and will be hugely important in determining the future economic direction of this country.Rebecca Long-Bailey is not regarded as having the demonstrable competence that voters are yearning for from Labour.The Tories calculate that, for his part, Sir Keir Starmer, the strongest Shadow Cabinet advocate of a second referendum, would deepen Labour’s problem in Leave-voting seats.The only candidate currently causing some concern is Jess Phillips – regarded as the high-risk, high-reward option for Labour.But given her low standing with the Corbyn-backing membership, she is not currently looking like a top- tier candidate.WHEN two or three ministers are gathered together, they start to nervously whisper about the February reshuffle.It is expected that this reshuffle will be big and coincide with the changes to Whitehall that Boris Johnson is keen to introduce. He wants to create some new departments, merge others and even shutter some.Boris’s old allies, though, are warning against a shake-up that sees too many of them replaced.One confidant of this group tells me Boris’s new support base in the party is “a mile wide and an inch deep” and that he needs to keep close those who have been loyal to him through thick and thin.One person who is certain to be rewarded in the reshuffle is Brandon Lewis, the Security Minister.Johnson’s team were impressed by his work during the campaign and want to use him more in the media.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

New data released shows December was the busiest month for foodbanks last year - and that trend is expected to be mirrored this year. And new figures showing demand in Birmingham, West Midlands has rocketed by %. Jane Haynes , politics  people editor at Birmingham Live met the people in crisis who desperately rely on Sparkhill Foodbank in Birmingham.Young mum Courtney, , is one of hundreds people across Birmingham in the West Midlands to visit a foodbank. She has to take three buses and travelled for more than an hour to get to Sparkhill Foodbank with her toddler son after running out of food. Cash she set aside for food shopping has to be spent on electricity to heat the freezing cold council flat she lives in, after her little lad fell ill. She said: Usually I donapost have the heating on much, itaposs electric heaters so itaposs really expensive. But my babyaposs not been well, so Iaposve had to keep it on for longer than I should have. She also revealed how the extra cost of feeding the meter has wiped her out of an extra £, and sheaposs got two weeks to wait until her next benefits payment. “That’s all my money, gone. The flat is so cold. I was worried about my baby, heaposs been poorly. I couldnapost let him get cold. I had to have the heating on constantly. “If it was just me I’d manage, I don’t mind going without food. But I’ve got him to think of.”  Nadia is another person who is forced to visit a foodbank who is financially struggling. Despite the extra expense, she runs a car so she can get her kids to three dferent schools across the other side of the city from her temporary home. She said: If I didnapost drive them there is no way they would make it into school on time. Itaposs the only way. Education is really important - I donapost want them to miss school just because we are struggling. Sheaposs also terried that when the schools break up for Christmas her children will no longer get the free breakfasts and lunches provided at school. Itaposs really hard. Some people have no idea, she said. Sitting nearby is Tina. Pain is etched on her face as she confides that she’s too ashamed to let her teenage kids, aged  and , know that their food is coming from the foodbank.  “I don’t want them to know how bad it’s got, I don’t want them to worry. But I honestly don’t know what  to do, or where  to go. It’s so hard.” Jodie is a young mum of six, and when her relationship with their dad broke down in October she found her benefits were slashed almost before her partner’s retreating back had disappeared. “As soon as I told the benefits people what had happened that was it, my benefits were cut right back to a single claim. It’s a dference of £, a month. I’ve still got the same bills, same rent, and arrears but no money.”  Her six kids, boys and girls aged four to , share a room in the two bed council flat the family have lived for a decade. “We got the flat when we just had two kids. I’ve been asking for a bigger house but the council kept saying they have nothing and tell us to keep bidding.” The are not alone in their despair. During a two hour visit to Sparkhill Foodbank, there’s a steady stream of people needing help. There are hugs, smiles, prayers and sympathy, and tea by the load, as foodbank boss Les Allen, his assistant Emma Gowers and a team of dedicated volunteers work hard to raise spirits and give help.  They will feed around  people this week during the four hours they are open. There will be be more than this next week, people driven to seek help by the cold and Christmas. “The colder it gets the more people we see,” says Les.Itaposs a despairing situation.

Lukas Wojciechowski, two, has suffered with eczema since he was two weeks old, and it got so bad he could barely be touched. He couldn’t be near tinsel, cuddly toys or even Santa’s coat because synthetic materials produced painful rashes on his hands. Last Christmas Day a flare up meant he woke up with weeping, angry, open sores on his legs and spent the day in tears. But earlier this year his mum heard about a cream on Facebook and within a month his skin had started to clear up. This year for the first time he has been able to enjoy the festive season, and has already been to see Santa in his grotto THREE times. Mum Shannon Harle, , from Kettering, Northants., said: “It stopped the itch, healed the wounds and moisturised his dry skin. “It’s definitely a magic cream. “I posted in one of groups on Facebook about my sonaposs skin and someone who works for Balmonds messaged me about sending me a sample to seeit would help him. “This time last year he was allergic to Father Christmas but this year, we’ve already taken him to see him three times. “I’m looking forward to Christmas Eve and him being able to cuddle up on the sofa in his pyjamas, without squirming in pain. “He used to cry in pain every time he tried to take a step. Now he’s running around the house singing Christmas songs - it’s absolutely wonderful.”  Lukasapos eczema began when he was two weeks old as a small patch of dry skin on his ankles and quickly became severe. By the time he was a month old, his legs and ankles were covered in scaly, rough skin and he needed to wear tights to go outside - even in summer - as grass and the sunshine made it worse. The tips of his toes were so raw and peeling that he looked ashe had sunburn and Lukas would scratch the weeping skin on his legs until it bled. It meant the toddler held back from learning to walk as even smooth laminate flooring in the family’s home would break the already sore skin on the soles of his feet. Steroids prescribed by the toddler’s GP initially worked but then pain ed. Christmas  was one of the toughest times, as the cold weather makes his skin worse.Shannon said: “He couldn’t eat chocolate from his advent calendar or wear the fluffy pyjamas his grandma bought him to cuddle up in at Christmas. “While most two year-olds are getting excited about the twinkly lights on the Christmas tree, we had to keep him away in case his skin reacted to the decorations. “Christmas Eve wasn’t magical for him as he spent most of the night rubbing his legs together in bed, like usual. So on Christmas Day, he woke up with weeping, angry, open sores on his legs.” Stay-at-home mum of four Shannon discovered Balmonds Skin Salvation cream, which costs £. for a ml tub, in March. She puts it on every day before bedtime. Within a month of using the cream the painful skin on Lukas’ legs had cleared.

As a result, we’ve told our children not to expect much at Christmas in the way of expensive presents. However, I know when we go to my parents’ house, they’ll make a huge fuss of them, buy lots of gts, and so will my brother and his we – in fact, their kids will no doubt show up with iPhones and games consoles, and so on.   I feel embarrassed by our situation and I know the whole thing will stress my husband out, too. He’s quite a proud guy and I know my brother winds him up sometimes because he’s quite flash. Do you think I should speak to my parents in advance and ask them to tone down the present giving  I’m especially worried about our kids seeing their cousins with expensive things from their parents, when we can’t do the same for them. It’s the first time I haven’t looked forward to Christmas and it’s ruining the thought of the holidays for me. Coleen says The whole point of Christmasis to be kind and enjoy the chance to spend some time with the people we love. Having said that, I obviously know the pressure of pester power from children. Look, I don’t think you should stop your mum and dad spoiling the kidsthey can do it – that’s what grandparents are for and it should take some pressure off you. I think it’s good you’ve explained to your kids that money is tight – ­understanding the value of things and why you can’t always get what you want is an important le lesson. My nieces went through a similar thing when their parents split up and my sister told them to expect one present that Christmas. And of course the rest of the family pitched in and spoiled them.

She was rushed for a gruelling seven-hour operation. Since the operation, brave Sian has been in and out of hospital due to complications. Derbyshire Live says the girl still took her GCSEs and now, at , is studying health and social care at college and plans to do paramedic science at university.It was a blur. From the minute I was diagnosed to within  hours later I was having a seven-hour operation to remove the tumour, Sian said. I just did my best to put on a brave face. Of course, it had a massive effect on my le. It came to a bit of a standstill. But I thought it was important to stay positive. There were obviously down days because it was hard to deal with but I didn’t want people to worry. If I was struggling to cope I didn’t want to show it. One of the hardest parts was being on the paediatric ward. I saw some not very nice things which made me realise how lucky I really am. When you see a baby who has had no le and is constantly poorly it is heartbreaking. Sianaposs headaches became worse during a family holiday in Devon in April .She was violently sick and had a brain scan at a hospital in the county. They sat down and told me I had a condition called Neurofibromatosis and that I had a tumour the size of a grapefruit. It had been growing for two years and was le threatening, Sian, of Overseal, Derbyshire, added. It was really hard to hear that because I knew it was serious. I am the kind of person that doesn’t like to be negative. I just thought what can I do about it  what can be done and I just wanted to get it over and done with.During her initial time in hospital, Sian made friends with children who died while she was there. Due to an increase in cranial pressure in her head, the teenager was fitted with an internal lumber shunt, which is a plastic tube that drains away the excess fluid around her brain, which was a huge threat to Sian’s eyesight. Since then, Sian has endured multiple operations, after her shunt maled and she had to have it removed, replaced and then altered, to control the pressure levels in her head. She said: When it came to my exams I knew I wanted to give them a go. I said to mum and dad that I have been at school for seven years learning and preparing for them. I wanted to sit all of them but my parents and the school decided I could sit four and I passed all of them.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPrince Harry and his we Meghan Markle always appear very much in love when they appear at public engagements.But friends of Prince Harry have reportedly stopped inviting the royal couple to dinner parties because of their PDAs.Here, body language expert Judi James, reveals what the Duke and Duchess of Sussexaposs touchy-feely relationship really means, and why it can makes others uncomfortable... The couple have always been very tactile but their touch and eye contact rituals show no sign of diminishing, meaning their body language rituals seem to place them in an on-going ‘Honeymoon phase’ of their relationship. This means they appear to want to illustrate and act out their love in public. This is the kind of exclusivity and intimacy rituals that can make other people feel excluded around them. It’s hard to see how a couple so openly in love could cause any offence but presumably the dinner party set expect open and active sociability rather than a couple appearing to send affectionate tie-signs to one another that suggest they are carrying on some secret and often flirty silent conversations in public. aposFlirty and playful Meghan’s few appearances since Archie was born seem to register an increase of these intimacy ‘in love’ signals that involve even more mutual eye-gazing and celebratory smiles to suggest their relationship has intensied with their new role as parents. In this photothese very flirty and playful signals show a mutually tactile couple keen to share jokes and silent communication. Harry looks very protective here and Meghan flatters him by looking down and laughing as they wind their arms round one another’s waists and lean in together. aposBonding and touch are important, especially to Meghanapos  This pose suggests a more open sociability, with both smiling outward and looking relaxed. These smiles look prompted by the cameras and audience rather than just one another, which would normally be a stage a couple deeply in love would go through as they move out of the obsessional, passionate stage and into something more relaxed, happy and confident. The entwined hands show how important bonding and touch are to the couple, especially to Meghan, who placed her right hand onto their clasped hands to make the loving connection gesture even more emphatic. aposThey are lost to the worldapos  In this image Harry and Meghan turned this simple, congratulatory kiss at polo into a romantic and intimate moment. Meghan threw her head back, baring her neck and the couple used mutual eye gaze to suggest they were lost to the world at that moment. This could have just been a smiling kiss on the cheek but the couple appeared to want to use the moment to reinforce their love for one another. aposTheir bonds are stronger than everaposIn both these photos there’s no change in their tie-signs now Archie has been born, with the linked hands and the excited-looking smiles suggesting their bonds might be stronger than ever. The romance comes from the way Harry gazes adoringly at Meghan and their pinging smiles seem to bounce off one another. aposMeghan gazing up adoringly at Harryapos "},{"url":null,"title":"health games casino offer promotion","story":"Advertorial£ bonus offer from Health Games casino - with £million jackpots to be wonHave fun and give back to charities across the UK playing more than  exciting gamesShareByDave Masters:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC Advertorial\" to FREE daily email alerts from mirror - daily newsSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

ZSL London Zoo , one of the worldaposs oldest scientic zoos, dates back to aposs, and as it turns out they are prepping for December th just as much as you are.The zoo will even be opening to the public on boxing day , but will close to visitors on Christmas day itself. The reason for the closure will melt your heart, itaposs so the animals can get some quality one on one time with their keepers. But how do you make Christmas day for a tiger, how do you pull a cracker with no thumbs, and is catering for a zoo more or less effort than for our own relatives  Ahead of Christmas day,got a sneaky glimpse behind the scenes at ZSL London Zoo, to see just how the animals like to party. Place setting We first stopped off at the Coati enclosure for a lesson in place setting.  Rob Harland, team leader of the Zooaposs animal activity section, is tasked with looking after his very own Mystery Inc this Christmas, as he introduced us to two of the adorable group aposVelmaapos and aposShaggyapos. Rob is one of many members of the team who will be on sht Christmas day, but he explained why that was really no bad thing.  ‘It’s a treat to have the place to ourselves as we get to spend even more one-on-one time with the animals we look after. ‘We like to make it a festive day for all, by placing the animals’ breakfast or lunch in a brightly wrapped box, or a tube wrapped to look like a cracker: it’s great for them to use their natural skills to ‘open’ their presents - like kids do on Christmas morning!’  Passing us over a cracker, Rob was keen for us to get stuck in by stuffing a cracker with wood wool and the natural cracker prize of choice- live worms. Yes thereaposs not a fortune telling fish or pack of watchmakers screwdrivers in sight, just some tasty grub[s] and the element of competition. Rob explained that for the Coatis, who have an incredible sense of smell owing to their large noses, this was the ultimate challenge and that the adorable creatures often worked together to pull them apart just like humans. In short when it comes to Christmas with the Coatis, Rob will still be watching two absolute animals fighting over the long end of the cracker just like the rest of us. Gts and stocking fillers  Much like Christmas in your own home, the key to pleasing even the most dficult to buy for is generally food. But itaposs not all about being spoiled rotten, as keepers like to challenge their animals with fun enrichment activities, designed to hone their curious nature. For Asim the Sumatran tiger, keepers wrapped his favourite Turkey wings in bright red parcels, meaning heaposd have to fight tooth and claw to get into his delicious present . A tigers claws are capable of some serious damage, so he definitely made short work of the paper, but as soon as he smelt turkey he just had to have it. Turns out a Sumatran tiger might just be the only thing more ferocious than a child running down the stairs to see what Santa has bought.  On the stocking filler front, the lemurs can be rather picky, but it seems those Christmas veg trimmings will make their day .ZSL London Zoo’s Animal Manager, Angela Ryan, said: “It’s the season of giving and our keepers always look forward to sharing the magic of Christmas with the animals at ZSL London Zoo.“Just like children all over the country when they wake up on Christmas morning, Asim loved tearing into his brightly wrapped presents to get at the meaty snacks inside, while our squirrel monkeys and lemurs enjoyed finding the festive treats hidden in their stockings. The stockings for a group of lemurs probably cost a lot less than for a human, but maybe try giving your little monkeys a Clementine and pretty sure youaposll get the same response. Entertainment  If you thought your cat was keen on destroying the baubles, then as scar in the lion king once said aposbe preparedapos. For the big cats itaposs all about keeping them entertained, from giant baubles, to Narnia themed scratching posts, and anything that will bring out their feline side. Asiatic lions are an endangered species, found in the Gir National Park India, and the Zoo recently welcomed a male lion, Bhanuto the pride.  The Bolivian black-capped squirrel monkeys were treated also to a new climbing frame, stocked up with a number of edible treats. And just like the kids, they wasted no time in testing it out, eveneveryone seemed to want a turn at once. The keepers are very selective about their animalaposs enclosures, all gts treats are safe to be given, and designed with engagement in mind. And over at the gorilla enclosure itaposs time for a snowball fight, with plenty of flavoured iced treats being offered. But at penguin beach itaposs all about the high tech gadgets, but since penguins canapost hold smart phonesit was a time for a bubble machine.

But now on the path of recovery and having regained the ability to walk, Freya entered the Miss England pageant on a whim in November and has high hopes of bagging the title when she competes in June next year. Customer advisor and university student Freya, from Rotherham, South Yorks, said: I have suffered from bad headaches for two years, and in April I had a really intense episode.  I was unable to get off the sofa to eat or even go to the toilet, and one day my blood pressure went really low so an ambulance was called and doctors told me that I had a stroke. The doctors have told me itaposs very rare but havenapost said much  which has made me very worried and nervous. In hospital I didnapost realise I was slurring my speech at first, but my friends and family kept telling me I was saying random words when I spoke.  I burst into tears when they told me and I was scared because I didnapost actually know I was doing it. When I was bedbound, I got really frustrated and bored because I was unable to work for four months and had to take a gap year from my human biology degree at university. When I was discharged, my mum and my sisters still had to help me stand up because, after about  or  minutes, I would get a stinging pain in my knees.  I felt silly, but I was glad to have the support and now I still have problems but itaposs slowly getting better - now itaposs a much more bearable pain. Despite the problems with my knees, I want to brave the runways of Miss England and show you can be OK after a stroke. Freya was kept in hospital for two weeks and had slurred speech which lasted for two days after the stroke. She also suffered from knee problems which left her unable to walk for long without support from someone .  Doctors are still investigating the cause of Freyaaposs stroke and check in with her every three months to monitor her progress. Freya, who is studying human biology, said: I was shaken up by it all - Iaposm fit, well and do a lot of sport and there were no other signs of a stroke like facial drooping or speech slurring before it happened. I havenapost got a clue what caused it and I didnapost think it would happen to me so young. I donapost really want to think about what might have caused it because it makes me more worried.

Joey Tildesly-Devine suffered a bleed on the left side of the brain at school when he was aged  in November . Just minutes later he was unable to talk and could only communicate by trying to write down what was happening, after suffering a stroke. His mum Karen Devine, , rushed to the school to help her son after being contacted by his headteacher, and Joey was later taken to hospital by paramedics. Although not fully recovered after being released from hospital earlier this year, his speech has fully ed and he is now able to walk, the Liverpool Echo reports. Karen, of St Helens, Merseyside, said: The headteacher came to get me and said Joey had apostaken a bit of a funny turnapos. When I heard that I certainly didnapost think it would be that he had a stroke. He had told his teacher that he had a tingly tongue and then he yelped and after that he couldnapost speak. He lost his speech. He tried to write down on a bit of paper to tell his teacher what was wrong but he couldnapost use his right hand. Within five minutes he had lost the ability to control the right side of his body. He couldnapost speak but he could understand everything. We initially called an ambulance for him but it didnapost arrive and he was deteriorating quickly so I made the decision to drive him to Whiston Hospital.When they arrived at Whiston Hospital Karen said that doctors were worried about sepsis but a scan confirmed that her son had suffered a bleed on the brain. It had been caused by a condition called arteriovenous malformation when blood vessels in the brain are tangled. He was immediately transferred from Whiston to Alder Hey in an ambulance to undergo le saving surgery. Karen said doctors told her there was a risk her son wouldnapost survive the surgery to remove the clot from his brain.  She said: To start with they were worried about sepsis but he had a scan it showed he had a bleed on the brain. But a scan showed he had a massive bleed on the left side of his brain. We were told he would need immediate live saving surgery so he was rushed to Alder Hey. I remember the consultant came to see us said there was a chance that Joey wouldnapost survive the surgery. That was a horrible moment. I had to sign a consent form that acknowledged my son might die from the surgery he needed. However, thankfully, the surgery was successful and Joey, began his long road to recovery, spending a further four months recovering at Alder Hey.  The hemorrhage affected the mobility of the right side of his body and his speech which left Joey needing speech therapy and physiotherapy. Karen described how she and her husband spent months rotating daily visits to the hospital so that Joey was never alone. She added: After the surgery, he was in Alder Hey for four and a half months. I was off work for six months. My husband and I would alternate shts with Joey so he was never there on his own. My husband slept at Alder Hey by his side every night that he was there. It was a really hard time for the family but our friends and family were so supportive.Since embarking on his road to recovery after his release from Alder Hey earlier this year he is making further progress through his physiotherapy. His mum also paid tribute to Joeyaposs determination during the recovery process, recalling that even when he was unable to talk he was determined to fight his way to receovery.

to league leaders Celtic in a clash where leading scorer Sam Cosgrove netted his th goal of the season and was also controversially red carded.The Dons were reduced to  men in the second half when referee Euan Anderson dismissed Cosgrove for a challenge on Kris Ajer.Cosgrove went into the challenge near the Celts# by-line with pace but appeared to win the ball.Celtic players were up in arms and surrounded the referee in the immediate aftermath of Cosgrove#s challenge and the whistler raised a straight red.It was a harsh decision on the Dons.Cosgrove had earlier equalised with a header for his th goal of the season after Celtic had grabbed the lead through Christopher Jullien.Moments before Cosgrove was dismissed league leaders Celtic had gone ahead through an Odsonne Edouard strike.Aberdeen made two changes to the starting line-up that defeated Hamilton - at the weekend with on loan NAC Breda defender Greg Leigh ruled out with an ankle injury.Welsh international winger Ryan Hedges dropped to the bench with Andy Considine and Zak Vyner ing to Derek McInnes# starting team.Celtic were denied the opener after only four minutes when an inswinging corner kick from Ryan Christie on the right found Jullien  yards out.As Jullien turned the ball came off his shoulder and cracked against the cross-bar with keeper Joe Lewis stranded.Moments later the same combination did deliver a goal when Christie#s corner found JULLIEN at the far post.His left footed shot from eight yards bounced on the ground and  Lewis got a touch to it but was helpless to keep it out in the seventh minute.It was an ominous and concerning start for Aberdeen and immediately brought back memories of the first half capitulation to the Hoops in the - defeat at Pittodrie earlier this season.Moments later Cosgrove shot wide from eight yards at the far post after Niall McGinn picked the prolic striker out with a free kick.In the th minute Lewis was called into action when ing low to block a  yard drive from Olivier Ntcham.Celtic were completely dominating against a Dons side who on the rare occasion they got possession struggled to retain it as there were limited out balls.Against the run of play Aberdeen equalised when Niall McGinn crossed into the box from the right and COSGROVE rose high above the Celtic defence to nod home into the top corner from eight yards for his th goal of the season.It was a quality goal from Aberdeen both in the set up and execution.Celtic claimed for a penalty soon after when Edouard went down in the box but James Wilson looked to have won the ball when tackling.In the th minute Callum McGregor fired in a -yard drive but keeper Lewis easily saved.Aberdeen were still primarily defending and hitting on the break but looked far more comfortable in the aftermath of the opener.However, the league leaders regained the lead when Christie fed in EDOUARD who raced in front of Taylor and fired a low shot beyond Lewis in the th minute.Aberdeen#s hopes of salvaging something from Parkhead suffered another heavy blow when Cosgrove was given a straight red card for a challenge on Ajer who had seconds earlier produced a perfectly-timed tackle on Jon Gallagher to win the ball.Cosgrove slid into the tackle and appeared to win the ball.As Cosgrove went to leave the pitch after being dismissed, Celtic skipper Scott Brown got involved and wound up the striker, who pushed him away.Aberdeen: Lewis, Logan, Considine, McKenna, McGInn, Taylor, Cosgrove, FergusonSubs: McLennan , Gallagher , Main .Subs not used: Cerny, Devlin,  Hedges, Campbell.CELTIC: Forster, Jullien, Brown, Christie, Ntcham, Edouard, Bolingoli, Frimpong, Ajer, McGregor, Forrest.Subs: Johnston , Grfiths , Rogic Subs not used:  Gordon, Taylor, Bitton, Issouf Bayo,Referee: Euan Anderson"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor november 1 2019","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,It is time for Remembrance again and many people will be wearing a red poppy in support of the allied servicemen and women who suffered during the last century.White poppies have been on sale since  to support and remember all victims of all wars, be they civilian or military and regardless of race or gender.

Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"negotiating the modern world","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhy is it so hard to negotiate the modern world That is the question asked by Dame Helen Mirren in the Radio Times.

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each.

Not only did this save a great deal of money but the board  also earned considerable extra income by selling their products to other health boards, including Dumbarton and Argyll.All in all, the costs of building and equipping the Hillhead factory proved to be a very sound investment indeed.Duncan I Macdougall, TarbertSir,I write following last week#s open letter by SNP politicians Mike Russell and Brendan O#Hara in which they attempted to evade responsibility for the budget problems facing Argyll and Bute Council.These comments display extraordinary hypocrisy, revealing how out-of-touch these SNP politicians are with the realities of the challenges facing Argyll and Bute Council.The financial pressures on this council are a direct consequence of the repeated unfair financial settlements imposed on the council by the SNP government over the last  years.Brendan O#Hara should get on the phone to Nicola Sturgeon and demand a fair deal for Argyll and Bute instead of blaming everyone .Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters human impact on climate change then and now","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHuman activity from the industrial revolution onwards is causing global warming which,not halted, will have catastrophic consequences.Now scientists suggest that human activity several centuries earlier also caused climate change*.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban. He was just starting on the incline out of Kilmore so the black tarmac was his background.It was his moving right foot on the pedal I noticed. At first I thought it was a dog on the road until my headlights picked him up.Tom Cullen, Dunskeig, Ardfern.We would like to invite readers to nominate a deserving carer for a chance of going on a free holiday, while the person they care for comes on a free break with us, Revitalise, through our new Grace Award for Caring.Carers save the economy £ billion per year, which is more than the NHS budget. The Grace Award for Caring was named not only because it takes grace to care for someone, but because it takes grace to accept care from someone.To nominate a carer visit www.revitalise.org.uk graceawards or call  .Abby Kessock-Philip, Revitalise.Sir,From October to December, deer are more likely to be on the road as they move down to lower ground to find food and shelter.The majority of collisions take place in early evening through to midnight, with another peak from am to am.Particularly in these peak times, we advise motorists to slow down and watch for deer crossing roads.Deer can suddenly appear before you have time to brake. If you do hit a deer, report it to the police, evenyou are uninjured and your car is not damaged, as the deer may be fatally injured and suffering.Jamie Hammond, SNH management officer."},{"url":null,"title":"christmas is coming","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowPlenty of festive events are happening all across Mid Argyll, Tarbert and surrounding areas as we enter December.From craft fairs, unique and local shops opening late and joyous carol services to breathtaking charity Christmas tree displays and festive switch-ons # it#s all happening.You#ll find plenty of these covered in your Argyllshire Advertiser.Tell us about your events and send plenty of pics # we love to publish them."},{"url":null,"title":"kilmory claim development trophy","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThis year’s U shinty development trophy took place at Mossfield Stadium, Oban, on Sunday November .It was guaranteed there would be a new name on the trophy this year as Kilmory and Ardnamurchan competed in this competition to see who would take home the silverware.Alec MacVicar was the man in charge of proceedings and got the game underway at pm.Within five minutes, Euan Gilmour had netted for the Mid Argyll side and at that point it looked as though Kilmory may have the firepower to take the game away from the Ardnamurchan team.Ardnamurchan then started to find a foothold in the game and were awarded a penalty for a late swing in the box.

The games were well contested, and the Argyll boys could have won both games. Two lapses of concentration against Lomond let them in for easy tries and only two points separated the teams in the Shawlands game at the end, when SAS had been in the lead for large parts of the match.The whole team thought it was important to finish the group with a good home win.The boys set out their stall early at MacRae Park when a contested ruck ended with a good turnover from SAS number seven McLean and a great pass out to winger Gritten from number eight McColl-Smith, who then released MacKay. The full back ran  yards to score under the posts and then convert his own try.SAS were next on the score sheet when Captain Donald Self went over the whitewash. MacKay converted and SAS were  –  up.Some good play from both teams was making for a great game, enjoyed by a large home crowd. Pupils were given the chance to watch the game and they made their voices heard and, spurred on by the crowd, Euan MacArthur was next on the score sheet and once again MacKay converted the try.The first half finished - to the home team.The second half started with Boclair coming back at SAS and, after some good running, they pulled a try back.SAS found themselves under sustained pressure and soon Boclair had a second try. Only one try was converted, and the score was -. Another try, this one converted, for Boclair and the pressure was really on.South Argyll thought they had secured the game when Ellis went over and grounded the ball only to realise he had gone over the dead ball line. No try and the pressure was on again. Minutes later, after some great forward work to turn the ball over, McArthur again went over for South Argyll#s fourth try. Another two points from MacKay made the score -.After the restart Boclair went all out to get another score. Great defensive work from the SA backs kept Boclair out for a sustained period of attack until, with only seconds to go, the scored their fourth try.As the conversion attempt fell short the final whistle blew and South Argyll celebrated a hard-fought win.While South Argyll didn not get out of the group stages they can be very pleased with third place,only one point behind second spot."},{"url":null,"title":"a garden of festive delight","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNot your common or garden evening of entertainment, a special festive concert will be held next week near Minard.Friends of Crarae will present their annual carol concert at Crarae Garden on Thursday December .The evening will feature Cumlodden choir and guests and the audience is welcome to sing along.Festive refreshments and a raffle will be available at the concert, which opens at .pm for a .pm start.Tickets will cost £ on the door, and the National Trust for Scotland shop will be open for those last-minute gts."},{"url":null,"title":"an ardrishaig piano recital to remember","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSaturday November  was a cold and frosty day and, whilst the audience had the luxury of warm hats and coats to fend off the chill of a  degrees centigrade hall, this was not afforded to soloist of the day, the -year-old Ukrainian Russian pianist Vitaly Pisarenko.When many would, however, have struggled with the cold, from his first entry he appeared unphased by it and indeed gave us a memorable exhibition of astonishing virtuosity and musicianship.Each half of his well-balanced programme started with early Beethoven sonatas, beginning with his first, Op. No. . Dedicated to his hero, Haydn, this was delivered with the reverence it deserved and the clarity and drive of the final Prestissimo would have pleased the dedicatee no end.The first half ended with two Chopin Polonaises # Op.  Nos.  and  # and his third Ballade. The second Polonaise was particularly impressive with its menacing opening figure and Vitaly#s judicious use of the sustaining pedal lent great clarity to all three pieces and indeed to all his recital.After the intermission came Beethoven#s Sonata Op.  No. . By this time Beethoven had developed his own inidual persona and the three contrasting movements of this work were beautully executed, particularly the Adagio with its slow melody and stuttering accompaniment and the contrasting fluidity of the final Allegretto.Next we heard Bela Bartok#s Suite Op. . This was typical Bartok from beginning to end, spikey, angular and generally very speedy and played with incredible precision. When I said to Vitaly that it sounded fiendishly dficult he retorted: # It#s actually quite easy I learned it in three days.#While not normal fare for our audience this, hopefully, was an interestingFirebird is probably Stravinsky#s best known work apart from, maybe, his #Rite of Spring#, and both were originally written as ballet scores. However, due to their popularity, over time these and other works of his have been transcribed by ious people for all sorts of instrumental combinations, and the Agosti transcription of Firebird for piano solo that Vitaly played as his finale is probably the most well known. It makes huge demands on the soloist as Agosti endeavoured to encapsulate Stravinsky#s rich orchestration into a work for only two hands it only works in the correct hands and Vitaly#s were just such hands.This was an electrying rendition and not just for the sheer virtuosity as there were gorgeous quiet sections as well. The thunderous applause at the end said it all.Virtuosity is a given nowadays and over the years we have heard some fine pianists at Ardrishaig, but it was Vitaly#s musical integrity and attention to detail which was a cut above and truly inspirational. This was indeed a recital to remember.The concert, in Ardrishaig Public Hall, was staged by Mid Argyll Arts Association in association with Argyll and Bute Concert tours."},{"url":null,"title":"no need for stress shop local in festive lochgilphead","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNow there is need to rush out on your lunch break, or even break your neck heading into town before the Big Day # Lochgilphead retailers are opening late, so you can relax while getting your Christmas shopping finished.A #shop local# initiative is being promoted around town, encouraging shoppers to support local businesses by purchasing their Christmas gts and festive feasts locally.On Thursday December  many of Lochgilphead#s shops will be open late, including The Square Peg Marmalade Deli Danny#s Ironmongers Fyne Tackle Argyll Book Centre Breagha R  S Stovecraft Love Dove Studio The Sweetie Jar West Coast Home Fyne Living Bluestone Argyll Pharmacy Mary#s Meals Argyll Gt Company The Archway D  D Wool and Crafts and The Mail Box, including the post office, will also be offering the usual postal servicesyou have any gts still to send off.Rumour has it that some shops will also be offering festive nibbles and drinks, plus promotional offers and discounts."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 5 the nineteenth hole","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWelcome to Episode Season  Finale # Join presenters Stephen Day, George Graham and Keith McIntyre for more golfing chat about Bob and other golfing fun # with additional material from David McPhee, Bruce McNab, Neil Armour, and Charles Spreadburry.This week they discuss more golfing terminology, look at some stats and even answer a listener#s question.You can listen and or download all Episodes of The BOBcast below"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 13 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsNever mind the general election, with its deep isions and rancour, let alone the circumstances which brought it about.

Anyone who knows me or has worked alongside me will recognise my absolute commitment to local government.#I have been fortunate to get the opportunity to build recognition of Argyll and Bute Council as a creative, innovative, forward thinking and high performing organisation. I look forward to continuing that journey with South Lanarkshire.#Mr Sneddon was executive director for community services on his arrival in Argyll and Bute before taking up the chief executive#s post in .There have been positive aspects and challenges along the way and financial issues remain a big obstacle.Asked for the biggest challenges of his time with the council, Mr Sneddon continued: #Undoubtedly, the financial cuts that have been made to local government since . For Argyll and Bute that means savings of £m.#It angers and saddens me what has happened to our funding. We provide services that are crucial every day to everyone, from educating our children, to looking after the vulnerable in our society and a million other activities that support our communities. It leaves us annually considering the most unwelcome of cuts.#It further angers me there are those who deny the truth of this position. I am not a politician – it is for others to argue about where the cause of this situation rests – but let’s not insult the public by suggesting these financial challenges are not real.#On the highlights of his time, he said: #The creative, committed and skilled people I work with.#Councils can’t do everything communities want and public comments often focus most on what we’re not in a position to do.#I know, however, just how hard our employees work for Argyll and Bute and the huge dference they are making in what are times of unprecedented challenge for local government.#Everyone in Argyll and Bute knows or is related to someone who works for the council. They recognise the efforts and commitment that is shown. I am immensely proud of this council and those who work for it.#Looking to the future, with Ms Milne set to move into the chief executive’s chair, Mr Sneddon talked about the potential for Argyll and Bute to develop.He added: #Attracting the people and jobs Argyll and Bute needs to have a successful, sustainable future will take time, investment and effort from everyone who has influence and impact on le in the area.#There is massive economic potential in this area. The Rural Growth Deal has the potential to take Argyll and Bute further along the road to economic growth and repopulation.#Reversing the population decline that threatens Argyll and Bute’s future has to continue to be the key priority.#There is a solid  for my successor to take up the reins and drive forward progress, putting into action Rural Growth Deal investment the maritime change programme at HM Naval Base Clyde delivering new housing across the area attracting new business investment further closing education attainment gaps developing new models of care improving public protection services – I could go on and on. The agenda is enormous, driven by a focus on continuous improvement.#I wish my successor and the colleagues and friends I leave behind every success. I will forever be an ambassador for this wonderful area and council.#"},{"url":null,"title":"excitement galore when santa came to lochgilphead","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowElves happily worked while Santa handed out gts to excited children.Lochgilphead Parish Church Hall was packed for Santa#s visit to the Mid Argyll Rotary Christmas Fayre on Saturday December .Elves from th Argyll Scouts were on hand to assist the Rotary, preparing refreshments and serving delicious home baking to people seated on one side of the hall.The other side was take up with Santa#s grotto, where eager children queued with frazzled adults for their turn to see the jolly man with the white beard and red suit.Stalls around the hall boosted funds, and the total raised on the day came to almost £, which Mid Argyll Rotary will distribute to local good causes.The Scouts were busy, too, raising money for a trip to an outdoor centre to mark the group#s th anniversary."},{"url":null,"title":"meet the 2019 mojo lineup the blue moon travellers","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSheila McWhirter from The Blue Moon Travellers was tasked with answering on behalf of the duo..

Most made the measure and on average spurs hit the -cm mark with a couple of decent ones coming in at cm tipping the scales at lbs oz.As the day progressed the weather deteriorated with heavy showers, hail and really strong gusts spinning the boat leading to the inevitable Etive tangles.A decision was made to cut the day short and lines up was called at pm.Given the conditions everyone coped well and at the end of the day four species, spurs, whiting, lsd and pouting, added to the tally of  counting fish.Highlight of the day were the two sea eagles that flew in quite close on the hunt for food but they had their work cut out with so many greedy gulls around.

Social care, mental health and primary care services are all crying out for more support, and better resourcing them would take the pressure off the accident and emergency service.The SNP government have failed to meet the AE target time every month for over two years.

Yet, inspite of the unique dficulties in delivering superfast broadband in rural Scotland, which BT described as the ‘most signicant geographic challenge in the UK, and arguably Europe’, the latest Ofcom ‘Connected Nations’  report shows that Scotland outperforms the UK as a whole when it comes to new broadband deployment.There remains work to be done and the Scottish government is committed to delivering the best possible value and completing the roll out by  .Mr Reid is right to say that contracts have not been finalised yet, but with telecommunications and broadband reserved to Westminster, the changes in contracts imposed by UK ministers mean that bidders require additional time to recalibrate their bids.It is up to Mr Reid to carp from the sidelines, but readers can be confident that this SNP Scottish government will deliver a future proof network that will make Scotland one of the best connected places in Europe.Yours,Ron Wilson,Secretary Kintyre SNP.Coffee thanksSir,This year our World’s Biggest Coffee Morning fundraiser entered its th year.In community centres, schools and workplaces, thousands of coffee mornings were held across Scotland to raise money and help us support people affected by cancer.I would like to offer a huge and heartfelt thanks to every single one of your readers who held or attended a coffee morning – your energy and generosity never ceases to amaze us.Whether it’s specialist cancer nurses, support workers or benefit advisors, we can only offer the support that people with cancer need thanks to the tireless fundraising efforts of our supporters.The number of people who need our help is growing, and we want to offer support to everyone who needs it.

Anyone who knows me or has worked alongside me will recognise my absolute commitment to local government.#I have been fortunate to get the opportunity to build recognition of Argyll and Bute Council as a creative, innovative, forward thinking and high performing organisation. I look forward to continuing that journey with South Lanarkshire.#Mr Sneddon was executive director for community services on his arrival in Argyll and Bute before taking up the chief executive#s post in .There have been positive aspects and challenges along the way and financial issues remain a big obstacle.Asked for the biggest challenges of his time with the council, Mr Sneddon continued: #Undoubtedly, the financial cuts that have been made to local government since . For Argyll and Bute that means savings of £m.#It angers and saddens me what has happened to our funding. We provide services that are crucial every day to everyone, from educating our children, to looking after the vulnerable in our society and a million other activities that support our communities. It leaves us annually considering the most unwelcome of cuts.#It further angers me there are those who deny the truth of this position. I am not a politician – it is for others to argue about where the cause of this situation rests – but let’s not insult the public by suggesting these financial challenges are not real.#On the highlights of his time, he said: #The creative, committed and skilled people I work with.#Councils can’t do everything communities want and public comments often focus most on what we’re not in a position to do.#I know, however, just how hard our employees work for Argyll and Bute and the huge dference they are making in what are times of unprecedented challenge for local government.#Everyone in Argyll and Bute knows or is related to someone who works for the council. They recognise the efforts and commitment that is shown. I am immensely proud of this council and those who work for it.#Looking to the future, with Ms Milne set to move into the chief executive’s chair, Mr Sneddon talked about the potential for Argyll and Bute to develop.He added: #Attracting the people and jobs Argyll and Bute needs to have a successful, sustainable future will take time, investment and effort from everyone who has influence and impact on le in the area.#There is massive economic potential in this area. The Rural Growth Deal has the potential to take Argyll and Bute further along the road to economic growth and repopulation.#Reversing the population decline that threatens Argyll and Bute’s future has to continue to be the key priority.#There is a solid  for my successor to take up the reins and drive forward progress, putting into action Rural Growth Deal investment the maritime change programme at HM Naval Base Clyde delivering new housing across the area attracting new business investment further closing education attainment gaps developing new models of care improving public protection services – I could go on and on. The agenda is enormous, driven by a focus on continuous improvement.#I wish my successor and the colleagues and friends I leave behind every success. I will forever be an ambassador for this wonderful area and council.#"},{"url":null,"title":"festive fun at social club party","story":"Shortly after the Courier popped into the event, which ran from -pm on Monday, at the Tin Roof Diner, Sound of Kintyre, Santa made a special appearance, as a rendition of Jingle Bells was performed, bringing gts for all.Before that, many of the group had enjoyed a dance or two, with accordionist Alec MacKinnon providing the soundtrack.Earlier, the club enjoyed a #delicious# lunch of soup, a cocktail and some sandwiches, followed by a  choice of dessert, and tea, coffee and cakes.Cathie Duncan who organised the event thanked the Gilbert family at the Tin Roof Diner, Alec for attending every year with his accordion and Archie Mathieson, who transported members to and from the party.A fantastic afternoon was had by all!"},{"url":null,"title":"from our files december 20 2019","story":"Clachan’s green ChristmasClachan Primary School children have a green Christmas tree # not just the colour of the pine needles but the environmentally-friendly way it is being lit.The school has a wind turbine and solar  linked to a control  that shows the children how much electricity is being generated and stored on car batteries.Usually this electricity is used to charge the school#s laptops but now the power is being used to light-up their floor-to-ceiling Christmas tree.The turbine,  and equipment have been provided thanks to a grant from the West Kintyre Wind Farm Trust.Clachan#s pupils are enjoying a green Christmas.

It came after representatives of the local industries which discharge their waste effluents into the main sewage system indicated that they would be willing to co-operate in the neutralising of the acids in their effluents.Without neutralising the acid would prove damaging to the pumps envisaged for the new scheme.The motion calling on the council to give the go-ahead on the project was made by Dean of Guild William Stevenson, and seconded by Councillor N. S. McCallum, who said: #I think health comes before money in this respect.#Fears were expressed about the effect the scheme would have on the rates. Councillor Alastair McKinlay said: #It might be that in years to come we, as a council, will be blamed for putting the rates up.#Provost Daniel McKinven said that the efforts made in the past to secure the new sewage system for Campbeltown were #joint efforts#. The Provost said that the council had #done this for the good of Campbeltown# and that they would #see to it# that local labour is employed on the actual scheme.Mr W. P. Scott, the representative at the meeting of Messrs. Crouch and Hogg, the firm of consulting engineers who will be employed on the project, said that the pumping main would probably be laid along under the Low Askomel road.Mr Scott commented that the most expensive part of the scheme will be the actual laying of the pipelines.Hon. Treasurer George Halbert and Town Chamberlain, Mr William B. Allen, calculated that the rates may have to be increased by s d to cover the cost of the scheme. But Mr Halbert pointed out that the increase may be considerably more.The final calculation will not be made until Messrs. Crouch and Hogg supply a final figure for the cost of the scheme.The town will be eligible for a rates support grant.ONE-HUNDRED YEARS AGOHighland Parish Church ChoirOn Wednesday night the choir of the Highland Parish Church gave a concert in the Kirk Street Hall in aid of the funds of the Women#s Guild.The audience quite filled the hall, and a most enjoyable programme was received with every indication of appreciation.The choir contributed two-part songs which were rendered tunefully and with fine feeling, and the audience responded with particular warmth.The vocal solos by members of the choir were all most successfully rendered.The songs were nicely selected and several singers, heard for the first time, performed with great taste and sweetness.The soloists were Misses Macalpine, L.

But she asked why the young woman was so determined to climb the stairs, even though she was clearly very ill and finding it dficult.This led to me mentioning who Anne Frank was and that people visit the attic because itrsquos the place where she hid.ldquoWhy was she hiding  was the inevitable question, just as bedtime arrived.I was suddenly presented with a dilemma, not so much that bedtime was now delayed, but how to explain to a six-year-old the depth of evil and hatred that was the reason for Anne Frank having to hide in an attic with her family. And then whether to explain what happened to her after she was discovered.I knew that I couldnrsquot just ignore her question. So we searched for images of Anne Frank, which meant she became a real person for my daughter.Skye studied her and said she looked nice and kind, and asked again why she was hiding.I explained that people who didnrsquot even know her hated her just because she was a bit dferent to them. I couldnrsquot explain the horrors of genocide and concentration camps, but she understood that Anne Frank and her family must have been really scared to hide in an attic.ldquoWhat happened to her  asked Skye as she dressed for bed.This was not a bedtime story I wanted to tell. Indeed, for a child so young, it was not a story I wanted to tell at all. She knows there are bad people and staying safe is important, but we feel the need to protect our children from the evil and hatred that is sadly so deep-seated.But it is at this young age that the seeds of intolerance and hatred can be plantedthey are not encouraged and helped to feel empathy to others, including those who are dferent in fact, especially those who are dferent.So I told her a lsquochild-friendlyrsquo version of Anne Frankrsquos story,there can be such a thing. I gave no details of the horror of the Holocaust but we imagined how she must have missed her family when they were split up, and how sad it was that she died not long before the war ended.She wanted to look at Anne Frankrsquos photo again and say goodnight to her.ldquoThank goodness that could never happen to us here, could it dad ldquoNo, that is not going to happen, and we have to make sure it doesnrsquot happen to anyone  either, I reassured her.I felt quite emotional as I went downstairs with my kids sleeping safely in their cosy beds. I thought of the families in Syria who cannot keep their children safe from hatred and violence. I knew that such horrors could happen anywhere, at any time yes, even here yes, maybe even to us or our neighbours or friends. In fact, hatred of dference is indeed amongst us.A friend of mine was on a bus heading from East Lothian into Edinburgh last week and witnessed a horrible racist verbal assault on a Polish family. The horric murders in London are also part of the same hatred of dference ndash a man so full of hatred for people who think dferently that he randomly killed two amazing young people.Hatred is a virus that can infect any society and any inidual in it. History has taught us that fanning its flames can be an easy way for politicians to win power. But like real fire, once itrsquos released it can spread and destroy uncontrollably.People say fight fire with fire, but here the comparison ends, for we cannot fight hatred with hatred. Hatred only spawns more of it.And so I searched for words of that remarkable young woman Anne Frank, who left her diary behind, unknowing that it would be her gt to the world. Words I could share with my daughter, from one young thinking child to another. Despite writing at a time of unimaginable fear and horror, in her diary she has left us a timeless message of hope that comes from her rejection of hate:ldquoItrsquos dficult in times like these ideals, dreams and cherished hopes rise within us, only to be crushed by grim reality. Itrsquos a wonder I havenrsquot abandoned all my ideals, they seem so absurd and impractical. Yet I cling to them because I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart.It is our responsibility to live up to that inspiring message from a young woman who was a victim of the hate she rejected utterly to show our children, our family and friends, our colleagues and those we meet on a bus, that love, tolerance, empathy and respect of dference is the counter to hate.And we should expect no less from all our politicians."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-replace-old-boxing-gym-housing","story":"REM Associates have lodged planning applications seeking to replace the th century former Tranent Methodist Church building on Bridge Street with four two-bedroom flats.They submitted the applications on behalf of businessman and premises owner Alex Brown, who founded Bronx Boxing Gym, which was based at the old church, a decade ago.In recent years, Mr Brown had no involvement in the running of the boxing club but still let its boxers use the building.However, costly repairs were needed to make the former church safe, which led to the boxing club vacating the premises.Earlier this year, the club moved to the newly established Fit-in Fitness Gym on High Street, Musselburgh.A planning application has been submitted for the former church building and the east wall which faces the car park on Coal Neuk to be demolished.Drawings included within a second planning application show designs for erecting four two-bedroom flats with a basement car park with space for four cars."},{"url":null,"title":"familys-spectacular-christmas-lights-display","story":"The Woods family open their very own Santarsquos grotto and decorate their home each year to raise money for Mission Christmas and Cash for Kids.This year, there are more than , lights at their family home and in their garden.Dad Stevie Woods said the family ldquojust love Christmas and hope the stream of visitors theyrsquore expecting will leave donations for charity, either cash or a toy.They raised pound on their opening night.The lights were switched on for visitors on Sunday at pm and will be on from .pm to pm daily until Christmas.The grotto is open for visitors, who can enjoy the Disney characters painted on the inside and the Christmas films playing.There is also a Santa Sleigh where children can get their photograph taken, and this year there will be the addition of a Santa train, which Stevie made himself out of whisky barrels.He said: ldquoLast year we raised about pound so wersquore hoping to beat that.

It is a scary premonition.ldquoYoursquore just getting old, was a recent diagnosis from a family member! It was said with affection, of course, yet the ring of truth gave it an unhelpful sting. Age, of course, is just a number and state of mind and I have much to keep me youthful.What did help was meeting up with an old friend last week. As we sat together sharing memories of our youth and the shenanigans we got up to  years ago, I had a disorientating sense of time. It seemed impossible that so many years had passed since the moments we remembered had taken place. Those moments were so present for us. As another clicheacute says, it was asit was yesterday.We both complimented each other on how young we looked but I think this was because we both saw the younger person underneath the wrapping made by time. Society judges so much by appearance, we all do. But when we meet an old friend, even when we have not been in touch for many years, we see the person we knew, eventhe exterior has changed. As the philosopher Henry David Thoreau once said: ldquoItrsquos not what you look at that matters, itrsquos what you see.Who can say honestly they have not judged someone because of what they look like  I am as guilty as anyone . As I said, we all do it on the bus, in the queue at the supermarket while we wait our turn, everywhere. We glimpse at people, avoiding eye contact, but making immediate judgement on the way they look. Sometimes itrsquos negative, sometimes envious, sometimes positive and admiring but always superficial. And I know, like everyone , I too am likewise judged.Itrsquos a human habit, perhaps a primeval instinct in which we must quickly judge people for our safety. But of course outward appearance gives no clue to someonersquos character and real qualities. We must know something of that person first before we can judge on that.And this means seeing beyond what we look at. And to do this we need eye contact, a smile, a friendly gesture and the exchange of some words. We need to connect to the person inside. And the irony is, while there are more of us than ever sharing ever-bigger spaces, we are ever more disconnected from each other.The truth Irsquove come to realise is that you donrsquot have to be an old friend with someone to see their inner self, you just need to see beyond what appears to you. We have another primeval instinct and that is to detect the warmth of a character. But we cannot do thatwe only see what we look at and make no attempt to connect.My resolution, even before New Year, is to do this more often. To smile, say some friendly words and not judge or assume things. I think we actually all need more of this, with people we donrsquot know as much as those we do.As someone once said, a stranger is a friend you havenrsquot met yet. Well maybe you have, but you just havenrsquot spoken to them or really seen them for who they are."},{"url":null,"title":"hometown-clubs-special-honour-golf-star-catriona-matthew","story":"They gave Catriona, who is from the town, the membership in celebration of her victorious Solheim Cup captaincy at this yearrsquos competition, which was held at Gleneagles in September.Stuart Martin, golf operations manager at North Berwick Golf Club, said: ldquoThe club was absolutely delighted when she was given the [Solheim Cup] captaincy.ldquoEveryone was delighted for her when she won the Solheim Cup, especially since she has been related to North Berwick Golf Club for so many years.ldquoGiving her the honorary le membership was a no-brainer ndash everyone was delighted for it to go through.Catriona has been a member of North Berwick Golf Club since , when she was just  years old.On Catrionarsquos reaction to being given the honorary le membership, Stuart added: ldquoShe was just delighted and thanked everyone for being there.ldquoShe talked a little bit about her history growing up playing on the West Links, which led to her going on to do bigger and better things on the European Tour and her experience at the Solheim Cup.The club also announced it was renaming its East Lounge, located on the top floor of the clubhouse, the Catriona Matthew Lounge.Mr Martin added: ldquoShe was a little bit shocked to hear we were renaming the lounge after her.ldquoShersquos quite a private person and keeps herself to herself but she was delighted to receive both of these recognitions."},{"url":null,"title":"consultation-proposed-transport-hub-haddington-branded-shambolic","story":"Protests are expected to take place outside Haddington Town House on Monday evening when the proposals are put to the public.And angry business owners are also planning to place banners outside the townrsquos General Election polling station at the Aubigny Centre today .In recent weeks, East Lothian Council has repeatedly changed plans for a public consultation on a controversial proposal for a new car park east of the town centre. One business owner accused the local authority of trying to ide and confuse people so they did not attend.It comes after the council:Haddington Business Community Partnership had asked the council to postpone the public consultation until the start of the new year because it believes the local authority has breached Scottish Government guidelines stating that consultation exercises should not be launched during local or national election periods.A spokesperson for the council has denied this is the case and insisted it is a normal part of pre-consultation process.Community councillor Pat Lemmon said the decisions of the council were disappointing.She said: ldquoIt does not encourage feelings of trust for everyone working together. The ground rules change by the day.And she said the councilrsquos handling of the proposals had caused major distrust among residents, particularly when it came to the independently produced Haddington Vision document officials use to support their case.She said: ldquoThe Haddington Vision strongly said any changes had to be looked at by all the stakeholders, by everyone concerned, to avoid any ill feeling, to make everyone feel they had been consulted as part of proposed plans.ldquoThe statement made that East Lothian Council hopes to be in a position to implement a decision by March  indicates to me that there appears to be a race on to secure funding for the transportation hub.ldquoIf this is the case, is this the right decision given the strong views for and against any proposed hub in the town and the proposed town centre plans currently being discussed by the steering group ldquoTo have such a meeting so close to Christmas, and the stakeholder consultation at a time when many people are working, seems to me to be a bad decision.ldquoI am very disappointed that such a decision has been made.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council previously confirmed that the drop-in event would run -pm, with a public notice in the Courier of November  confirming that was the case.The event was to give local residents and businesses ldquothe opportunity to discover more about the proposals for a transport hub in Haddington.She said: ldquoThey will also be able to see the progress and history of the project to date, including the consideration of  dferent sites across the town.ldquoComments can be recorded as part of this consultation which will help inform the future development of the proposal and will be followed by another consultation in the New Year.However, the public section of the event has been reduced to just  minutes.When asked why the format of the event had been changed, the spokeswoman said: ldquoDue to a combination of level of interest and availability of staff, a stakeholders meeting will be held at pm and invitees include local business owners, schools, community council, sports clubs, transport companies and accessibility and active travel interests. [The] public event will start at pm.Other sites considered for the car park and dropped for ldquoious reasons include the field between West Road, Park Lane, Pencaitland Road and Letham Drive, and the site of the former Haddington Nursery School Annexe, off Meadowpark, which has also been earmarked for a housing development.The plans for Whittingehame Drive, which were drawn up following a series of closed door meetings, came under fire from a number of Haddington residents.Concerns ranged from the loss of green space on the site, which is beside the townrsquos skate park and G sports pitches, to the potential for accidents with youngsters playing next to the car park.The transport hub, which would include a car park with somewhere between  and  spaces, could also include ldquobus connections, bike hire opportunities and new pathways.According to East Lothian Council, the facility,approved, has ldquothe potential to free up parking spaces in the town for short-stay use, making it easier for people to access local businesses, essential services and tourist attractions.However, business owners were among those raising concerns about the proposals.George James, who runs the East Lothian TV and Video Repair Centre on High Street, felt that the last-minute changes were an attempt by the council to ide people.He said: ldquoIt is clearly isive and an effort to stop people attending the public consultations.ldquoWe are a local business and have been told we cannot attend the stakeholdersrsquo meeting as we are not considered stakeholders.ldquoWe are encouraging as many people as possible to join a protest at the Town House on Monday evening we are determined to ensure they do not get away with this approach, which appears shambolic.Karla Green from the shop is handing out leaflets advising people about the public meeting but the times have changed so much even her leaflets are now out of date.She said: ldquoThey still have pm on them so we have to tell everyone that the time has changed ndash again.Project consultants WYG will be in attendance on Monday and will have a number of display boards showing the extent of proposals.Council transport officers will also be in the Town House and people will have the opportunity to ask questions.A council spokesperson said: ldquoThe public lsquodrop-inrsquo part is now -.pm and it has been extended due to securing availability of key members of the project team being available to answer public questions.ldquoInvitations to the stakeholdersrsquo meeting are for two representatives from a range of

It has also previously been identied that the Coastguard site could potentially provide parking for any new flats in the Assembly Rooms.A metal staircase linking the car park to the adjacent Church Street and the town centre is also included as part of the proposals.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, had mixed thoughts on the scheme.She said: ldquoLargely, there is a demand for parking.ldquoHowever, these car parking spaces would require traffic to move past a very small group of cottages that have enjoyed a degree of privacy in effectively a cul-de-sac all the time they have been there.ldquoInitial messages I have had from residents are of horror.ldquoThe prospect is that green space will be tarmacked over and become a pretty signicant car parking lot.The spokeswoman for the local authority highlighted the proposed car park was part of a wider project surrounding parking in the town.She said: ldquoThe project that transportation is considering has nothing to do with the Assembly Rooms but rather a straight forward look at available space to act as long stay and to change Abbeylands parking to short stay.ldquoThe council is currently negotiating with Transport Scotland and Network Rail to increase the capacity of the rail station car park to stop indiscriminate parking on local streets. This site provides an opportunity to add some additional supply into the town to encourage parking behaviour that is more appropriate.Councillor Norman Hampshire, who represents the Dunbar and East Linton ward, was unable to comment on the specics of the proposals as he is convener of the councilrsquos planning committee. But he said but said there was a need to address parking problems in the town.He said: ldquoThe old part of the town, the narrow streets around Church Street and Castle Street, is very congested with the number of cars parked there because of the restrictions on the High Street.

Her wee brother Pavel was having lots of fun. She waved at him and he waved back, throwing a snowball at the window, then rejoining his friends.Marcela ed to her book. She loved reading, it was her escape into other worlds. She could not enjoy the snow like her wee brother, for she had been in a wheelchair for all her le and the chair would stick in the snow.It was possible to go outside with help, especially when her father was home, butshe tried it herself the front wheels would stick in the snow and ice.It was humiliating so she preferred to stay inside with her books and imagination. But she read by the window, watching her brother and class mates having fun.Then a robin landed on the window sill. It seemed to stare at Marcela.

As he unwrapped it his eyes gleamed with excitement.ldquoYes! he called out, hugging his mother and father. It was a huge bottle of ketchup, the real stuff! That may not sound such a present, but it was not easy to get this kind of ketchup in the village and he had always had to use it sparingly. Now he had this bottle all to himself.Then Marcela open her unusual present. She smiled as she held two unusual looking carved short planks of wood, unsure initially what they were.

He connected them to the front wheels of the chair.ldquoThey are wheelchair skis, he said, ldquoI made them. Marcela was overwhelmed.Within ten minutes, Marcela was wrapped up and ready to go out. She nervously wheeled her chair onto the snow covered front path. Usually the wheels would stick within seconds, but this time her chair slid effortlessly along the path.Soon she had got the hang of manoeuvring the chair in the snow. She had snow ball fight and was able to spin around and chase her schoolmates while storing lots of ammunition on her lap.Then she decided she wanted to sledge down the hill.

She edged forward and then reached the point of no . The wheelchair slid down the slope, faster and faster.

A bank of snow toppled the chair throwing Marcela out and she fell face first into the snow, arms outstretched.Her brother ran to her and helped her back into the chair.

No windows, no roof, no mirrors, not even a steering wheel and with brakes that were optional, signicantly raising the risk should the driver suddenly find themselves heading rapidly downhill.There was a high chance of breaking your wrist on the tiller and the wire wheels had a rather disturbing habit of buckling on corners, throwing the unfortunate occupants on to the road.Scotlandrsquos early motor cars may only have reached a less than hair-raising mph, but those who dared to climb into the rickety horseless carriage of an Argyll Voiturette were almost certainly in for the ride of their lives.It was early , and Scots were about to fall deeply in love with the thrills but hopefully not the spills of motoring, in vehicles carefully hand-built using the best of Scottish engineering skill and technology.Scottish car manufacturing ndash a stop-start affair at the best of times ndash ground to an emergency stop in  when the sprawling Linwood car plant, created in the sixties to churn out countless Hillman Imps, finally closed.Now, a group of Dundee-based motoring enthusiasts is set to relaunch Scottish car manufacturing, with the unveiling of a new sports car designed and built in the city.The lightweight fibreglass-bodied ADO Coupe takes its retro style from a  design for a sporty model intended to replace the iconic MG Midget but which never made it into production.Designed as a modern ldquogreen machine with plans for an electric engine and recycled structure ndash with options to upgrade the engine power for racing enthusiasts ndash the ADO Coupe is thought to be the first car to be made from scratch in Scotland since production halted at the Linwood site.The brainchild of car enthusiast Douglas Anderson, designer Richard Oakes and former Jaguar designer Clark Dawson, it will also become the first vehicle manufactured in Dundee.ldquoI think it is a work of art and pretty sensational, says Anderson, who dreamed of being a car designer since his youth but was thwarted by a lack of opportunities in the Scottish motor manufacturing sector.While the price hasnrsquot been revealed, each ADO Coupe will be built to order ndash not unlike the early Argyll, Albion and Arrol-Johnston horseless carriages which first introduced Scotland to the convenience, relative ldquocomfort and ease of motor car travel.It was, according to Bob James, a guide and research volunteer at Glasgowrsquos Riverside Museum, a fairly bumpy start and one which, unfortunately for those working in the sector, would struggle to really hit top gear.ldquoGlasgow was awash with great engineers, he says. ldquoBut Scotland was probably too far away from the main centres for car manufacturing to make much senseldquoEventually we were losing steel works, aluminium works and engineering skills.ldquoThere was the prospect of lorries having to drive  miles to deliver components to build a car here and the costs increased to a point where it didnrsquot make financial sense.And yet Scottish car manufacturing had set off at a roaring pace at the dawn of the th century when, inspired by the French motor vehicle market, the first all-Scottish cars slowly rolled off the production line.ldquoUntil then, government legislation had protected the toll road owners, the canals and railways which had lobbied strongly saying they couldnrsquot have cars on the road.ldquoThe French were well ahead of us, and there came a point when the British couldnrsquot ignore what was happening any longer, he adds.The change saw a mini-boom in Scottish car-making, led by the ldquoAs ndash Argyll, Arrol-Johnston and Albion, all Glasgow-based manufacturers which brought motorised vehicles to the nationrsquos streets.Leading the way was Springburn locomotive engineer George Johnston, and Forth Bridge engineer Sir William Arrol, who had the first British-built motor car ready to hit the road as the century drew to a close.The Arrol-Johnston six-seater ldquoDogcart, a wood-bodied vehicle started by the pull of a rope, rolled off the production line at a factory at Camlachie on a site close to Celtic Park in Glasgowrsquos east end.Arrol-Johnston vehicles were eventually found on roads around Britain. However, an unfortunate episode which saw its  Victory model sold to the Prince of Wales only to break down during a royal tour brought unwelcome publicity, and the firm folded in .Meanwhile, competition had come from rival Albion, formed in  by two former Arrol-Johnston engineers and with production beginning in a first-floor factory in Glasgowrsquos Finnieston Street. By , however, the business had shted to Scotstoun to cater for emerging demand for lorries and delivery vehicles.A more chequered future, meanwhile, awaited Argyll Motors.Launched in , its Argyll Voiturette was an almost identical copy of a Louis Renault motor car, painstakingly handmade at a former bicycle factory in Hozier Street, Bridgeton.ldquoIt was very basic and looked like a big pram on giant wheels with a very light metal chassis, adds Bob James.ldquoThe gear box, engine and wheels would be built and then it would be a case of finding a body to fit on it. That meant going to old carriage coachbuilders who would adapt horse-drawn coach and carriages to fit on top of the body.The result was a vehicle that occupants didnrsquot so much sit ldquoin but sit perched on top of, he adds.Not surprisingly, there were accidents. ldquoThe Western Infirmary archives have descriptions of ious injuries inflicted on people who had crashes in their cars, he continues.ldquoIt was very common for people to get badly hurt or killed when they were lsquoejectedrsquo from their car.ldquoThe wire wheels would bucklethe driver took a corner too hard and the passengers would be flipped out. Another common injury was caused by the tiller.Two upright rods which were used to steer, the tiller could easily sht suddenly and snap the unfortunate driverrsquos wrist.Argyll Motorsrsquo demise followed the decision to lavish money on the construction of a new factory in Alexandria. ldquoIt was a vast, palatial factory where they planned to build the best cars in the world, he adds.ldquoThey went all-out but while Argyll sold cars in Russia, Japan and Australia, they focused too much on the world market and didnrsquot look after their money.Eventually the expense of constructing the showpiece factory and a sht in demand saw the business stutter and close in .While other smaller manufacturers sprang up around the central belt, including the Madelvic Motor Carriage Company in Edinburgh ndash a specialist in electric vehicles, the derelict factory still stands today ndash none survived.And it would be decades before vehicle manufacturing on a signicant scale ed to Scotland.The pound million Rootes factory in Linwood began production of the Hillman Imp in  and employed over , people at the plant and surrounding suppliers.However, production of the rear-engine Imp ended in . The factoryrsquos new owners, Peugeot-Citroen, ordered its closure in .While a handful of kit car businesses exist, the ADO Coupe is thought to be the first Scottish-designed and manufactured vehicle for a generation.ldquoWe are starting small but we have already got a few customers and the first one should be on the road in early summer next year, adds Anderson. ldquoIt is a bit of a dream come true.The ADO Coupe is being developed at a workshop on the outskirts of Dundee with ious specialist elements of its manufacture to be sub-contracted to local and national suppliers.Its retro body is based on a  prototype sports car developed by BMC as a possible new style of MG Midget. However, the car, which featured a distinctive sloping back end, was never made.Prospective buyers of the Dundee-made ADO Coupe will be able to specy certain design elements, including interior, suspension and engine specications.The vehicle will be available as a road-going vehicle, or as a shell which can be adapted for the race-track. As well as being supplied ready-built, there are also plans to offer it in kit form for car-lovers to build themselves.The designers also have plans to explore using recycled materials to create the bodywork, and electric engines."},{"url":null,"title":"How Britain   39 woke  39  up in 2019     and what we saw wasn  39 t nice","story":"ldquoWoke only entered the Oxford English Dictionary last year as meaning ldquoalert to racial or social discrimination and injustice.

Thankfully, Emu wasnrsquot with me at the time. They are flightless birds and the fall would undoubtedly have killed us both.God, however, had a plan. Upon my rather abrupt arrival in Heaven, he honoured my sacrice ndash making me the UKrsquos patron saint of football. Yes, I may have missed the match that fateful night, but Irsquove seen every game thatrsquos taken place on British soil since. For my omnipresent transdimensional essence now hovers over every UK fixture ndash reporting any trouble back to God.The Scottish leagues may not always fall under my remit, however. According to God, independence is inevitable ndash and I admit I wouldnrsquot feel comfortable working in a country thatrsquos rejected the hierarchic dominance of your English superiors. And also ungratefully turned its back on Her Majestyrsquos matriarchal devotion to this great nationrsquos wellbeing ndash an unconditional love which exceeds that of our own mothers.God only knowsOF course, your nationrsquos lack of reverence for the authoritative tiers of privilege and inherited wealth isnrsquot the only reason I hope to be relived of my duties in Scotland.You Jocks have no idea how embarrassing it is for an English gentleman like myself to report back to God and have to repeat the colourful language favoured by your supporters ndash particularly at ldquoOld Firm matches. Itrsquos also exhausting having to google all the countless references to religious sects, ancient battles and subsequent grievances to understand what the hell is going on.For the record, I can confirm God is especially displeased at how His favourite song ndash Neil Diamondrsquos Sweet Caroline ndash has been reborn as a blasphemous hate anthem by aggrieved Presbyterians. Hersquos particularly infuriated at never being able to listen to the chorusrsquo sweet descending horn melody again without hearing a suggestion of illicit fornication with the spiritual leader of Catholicism.Yet, thatrsquos nothing compared to how infuriated He is over a rather unsavoury incident which took place last Sunday afternoon at Parkhead. As usual, I was idly floating over the stadium, keeping a particularly close eye on the famous North Curve section, when I spotted a large banner which boldly exclaimed ldquoF*** off Rod in a strange retro-futuristic font.Now, I was under the impression that I was carrying out these duties under the auspices of anonymity. Surely God would have told methe Pope had announced to the world that I had been canonised And evensupporters knew the Eurosceptic spirit of Rod Hull was watching over them, I was under the impression Celtic was a club which took pride in its historic ldquoopen for all stance. So I looked again. No, there it was ndash ldquoF*** off Rod. And to add insult to injury, a second banner pronounced, in the same queasily homespun Blakes  font: ldquoTories not welcome.Now, thatrsquos taking it too far. Sturgeon did well last week whipping up your ingrained inferiority complex but for the moment, Scotland is still just a whipping boy bleeding oil to grease the wheels of the English Treasury.It seems the SNPrsquos failed education policies have left you with a generation unfit to shove their hand up Emursquos a*** never mind run a country. I mean, these days the Clydersquos last remaining shipyard struggles to make rubber ducks float and you even had to get the Germans in to bring trams back to Edinburgh. Winston Churchill would bloody weep.Rod the prod NOW, I was a much-loved entertainer in le ndash so did not immediately assume it was me being told to ldquoF*** off when I saw the Celtic supportersrsquo banner. Yet, what other Rod could it possibly be The only other famous Rod ndash apart from Jane and Freddiersquos pal ndash is Rod Stewart. And it certainly couldnrsquot be him that the Green Brigade were telling to f*** off!I mean, theyrsquove known for decades that Rodrsquos a shameless unionist who almost broke his knees with the speed he got down on the palace floor to accept a knighthood. And letrsquos not forget Maggie May explicitly described a young Rodrsquos erotic liaison with The Iron Lady above her parentsrsquo shop.So, of course, it had to be me they were telling to f*** off ndash because the fans who held that disgusting banner aloft have historically had little issue with Rod Stewartrsquos multarious affiliations. And, I mean, they themselves have indirectly supported the Tory party through purchases of season tickets, strips, scarves and Bovril ndash with Celticrsquos majority shareholder billionaire Dermot Desmond being a generous Conservative donor. And then therersquos former director Lord Ian Livingston, who voted in favour of Tory tax credit cuts.The fans were certainly raging at Ian at the time, with a , strong petition urging him to f*** off, so surely any cancellation of Rod Stewart would have happened years ago too  The bagpipe solo in Rhythm Of My Heart alone justies lelong exile, but what about the time Rod shamelessly performed at Sun City in South Africa during apartheid  Or the countless times hersquos played Israel  Or persevering with hairspray and straighteners at  Blonde ambitionNO, I donrsquot believe Celtic fans were at all shocked that Rod would favourBoris Johnson over Jeremy Corbyn.Theyrsquove surely grown used to Rodrsquos non-partisan personality and wouldnrsquot be surprised when he congratulated Borison his electoral landslide. Yet, wecanrsquot judge a man by the company he keeps, can we We all have our flaws and Rod likely has a word when this fellow millionaire Londoner skewers the Scots, Irish, the working class, the Muslims, the disabled, the LGBT, the hairdressers and the people of Liverpool.And Celtic fans were certainly aware that Rod was also an acquaintance oftoxic insanity bucket Donald Trump. Of course, he says he doesnrsquot really see eye to eye with him on politics, but surely that just leaves two other sides of his personality ndash misogyny and madness. Still, Irsquom sure Rod is disgusted when his pal mocks, demonises and locks up societyrsquos most vulnerable in the relentless pursuit of the almighty dollar and elevated societal status among fellow demons.So it seems pretty clear to me that it couldnrsquot have been Rod Stewart who invoked the Green Brigadersquos wrath. It begs the question, however ndash of both Rods, why choose Rod Hull to f*** off  I mean, the only thing we have in common is that we both like having a bird on our arm.Hierarchy of hateAT LEAST the Tories arent as bad as Trump ndash I mean, they refused to let UKIPrsquos former token Jock MEP David Coburn join them last week - with their Scottishleader Jackson Carlaw essentially telling him to ldquof*** off Parkhead-style by revoking his shiny new membership card.Like Rod, David congratulated Boris and assumed his assimilation to the Tory hive mind was a mere formality. Carlaw, however, stressed that historical comments made by Coburn were \"incompatible with membership and red-carded him. Unlike career antagonist Tommy Robinson, who claims he was enthusiastically welcomed to the fold last week, along with thousands of Britain First members who were urged to join up ndash by their own party.Itrsquos fortunate for Carlaw that hersquos never put a foot wrong himself and can make such character judgements without hypocrisy. Unless yoursquore counting such trivial discrepancies such as his support for the \"rape clause\" policy on child tax credits, that time he made fun of Chinese accents, his singling out of Muslim MSPs to demand they condemn anti-Semitism and, famously, his loathing of Gaelic road signs.Of course, it could be said that he is a minor, inconsequential Tory henchman in comparison to his boss Boris, a congealed blockage in Billy Idolrsquos drain who himself has left no minority group unmocked.So,Coburn was deemed morally unfit to join Team Boris, surely that means he must be some kind of irredeemable puddle demon  Then again, perhaps not. We must remember this is a man who quit UKIP over extremism ndash reminds me of how Ken Livingston was thrown out of Labour for being anti-Semitic!And finally...WITH all those photos taken of him in Rangers strips, Rod Stewart clearly wise enough to understand le offers more than binary choices.And although it would put a few of his establishment palsrsquo noses out of joint, maybe only a non-partisan luminary like Rod could inspire harmonious mass solidarity to overcome the oppressive rule of a small minority of parasites who have spent centuries cultivating power and fortune by feasting on our blood, sweat and toil.But is Rod destined to be the Ghandi-esquefigure who unites all disparate tribes as one  Likely not. I thought theyd maybe just heard Rods American Classics ballad album, but God assures me itrsquos near impossible to wake folk up to the real enemy when binary ision is all theyrsquove known since they were dressed in a football strip as a baby in the cot.Yet, God has also informed me that any historical religious hijacking of sport has always been a manufactured polarisation of the proletariat ndash and that Scotlandrsquos hard-won independence will be pointlessit fails to tackle the issue decisively. Perhaps a more valid target of any fans suggestion to \"f*** off\" should be the billionaires who pay millionaires to kick sheep stomachs around rival temples to ide, conquer and profiteer from their lucrative monetisation of manufactured hate.Merry Christmas!"},{"url":null,"title":"india-awakens","story":"Every day more and more people pour onto the streets, for they know whatrsquos at stake.The worldrsquos biggest democracy is awakening, fearful of bigotry stoked by an increasingly authoritarian government so at odds with Indiarsquos founding principles.ldquoYou just needed a trigger, said Jasbir Singh, a Sikh information technology worker who joined the protests in Bangalore this past week. ldquoIn India, religion never decided your citizenship, and it should not in the future, he told the New York Times, expressing the concerns of a growing number of Indians.That, unfortunately, is not how the Hindu nationalist government of prime minister Narendra Modi sees it. Ever since coming into power in , Modirsquos ruling Bharatiya Janata Partyhas persistently introduced measures to further marginalise the countryrsquos Muslim population.To an increasing number of Indians such moves, they warn, are part of an unspoken agenda to ide the country along communal lines.ldquoIt is not a fight only for Muslims, Mohammad Hamza, an -year-old university student was quoted by the Washington Post as saying. ldquoIt is a fight to save our country. Modi is trying to break us.At the heart of these potentially incendiary moves by the government lies a new citizenship law.It was on December  that Indiarsquos parliament passed an amendment to its Citizenship Actof , which sets out guidelines for becoming a citizen in the country.The CAA that was then signed into law by Indiarsquos president allows persecuted minorities a fast-track route to Indian citizenship. The law applies to immigrants from nearby Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh who are Hindu, Christian, Sikh, Jain, Zoroastrian, or Buddhist.Muslims, however, are not included eventhey are Ahmadis, members of a sect of Islam that Pakistan considers heretical.The law also ignores what the UN has deemed the worldrsquos most persecuted minority, the Rohingya Muslims, who suffered ethnic and religious cleansing at the hands of the Burmese military in Myanmar. The authorities in India have reportedly pledged to deport the estimated , Rohingya refugees residing in the country, even though theyrsquore thought to face danger in their home state.Those opposed to the law say the exclusion of Muslims betrays a deep-seated bias against the community, which makes up % of the countryrsquos . billion people. They argue rightly that the new law would violate Article  of the Indian Constitution, which promises equality as a fundamental right. In prior cases, the Indian Supreme Court has ruled that such fundamental rights are not subject to parliamentary amendment.These opponents are now taking a stand and making their rejection of the law clear. On the streets of  cities across  states, students supported by ordinary citizens came out in huge numbers to protest. Most were undeterred by a brutal police response that took the lives of protesters in the state of Assam, and the cities of Lucknow and Mangalore. At least  people have been killed in violent clashes and the seriousness of the situation was underlined on Friday when six people died and dozens were injured in Uttar Pradesh.In recent days, Indiarsquos government has sought to clamp down on the protests. Yesterday, in response to the escalating crisis, Modi called a meeting with his council of ministers to discuss security measures. Previously, in an attempt to reassure citizens, Modi had taken to social media to deliver his message.ldquoI want to assure my brothers and sisters of Assam that they have nothing to worry after the passing of the Citizenship Amendment Bill. I want to assure them ndash no-one can take away your rights, unique identity and beautul culture. It will continue to flourish and grow, Modi tweeted on December  amid violent protests in the north-eastern state following the passing of the bill.The only problem in delivering such a message was that the internet was shut down in Assam that day, making it unclear just how many citizens would have had the opportunity to read Modirsquos rather duplicitous reassurance.Time and again as part of its security crackdown the government has arbitrarily turned off the internet across wide swathes of India.Muslim-majority Kashmir has been offline since August, when the Indian government universally revoked Article  of Indiarsquos constitution that guaranteed special rights to the Muslim-majority state, including the right to its own constitution and autonomy to make laws on all matters except defence, communications and foreign affairs.In all, the latest internet shutdown last week marked the th time the it had been shut down in India this year, a measure of Modirsquos increasingly authoritarian rule. In many states and cities, gatherings of four or more people have been prohibited ndash these include parts of Delhi, the software hub of Bengaluru, and the entire state of Uttar Pradesh, home to  million people.Hundreds have been arbitrarily detained, including some of Indiarsquos prominent public intellectuals.ldquoThis piece of legislation strikes at the heart of the Constitution, seeking to make India another country altogether, prominent historian Ramachandra Guha wrote in an Indian newspaper, The .ldquoIt is thus that so many people from so many dferent walks of le have raised their voices against it, he added. Guha made his comments just after his release from police custody after being detained for protesting against the law in the southern city of Bengaluru.Given the prevailing uneasiness that has existed over some of Modirsquos policies for some time, just why did he decide to introduce such controversial and provocative legislation right now According to Sumit Ganguly, professor of political science at Indiana University and a specialist on India, the answer is more complex than it might first appear.Superficially he says it can be argued that the BJP, as a right-wing Hindu nationalist party with a clear-cut parliamentary majority, is simply implementing its ideological agenda and enacting the very proposals it included in its campaign manesto.But this, Ganguly adds, fails to fully recognise the extent to which the party has evolved into ldquoa radical entity bent on transforming the ideological foundations of the Indian state.ldquoAfter five years in office as a majority party from  to , it has promoted the steady rise of a virulent, all-consuming iant of Hindu zealotry in its midst, Ganguly observed, writing recently for the US based magazine Foreign PolicyldquoThis has taken place under the tutelage of Modi and his ideological alter ego Amit Shah, the current minister of home affairs and the principal architect of the citizenship amendment bill, he added.Therersquos no doubt that time and again the top leaders of the BJP have made clear their determination to crack down on Muslim immigrants as part of their wider strategy of discrimination.ldquoA Bharatiya Janata Party government will pick up infiltrators one by one and throw them into the Bay of Bengal, Amit Shah is reported to have said in a speech in April, referring to Muslim immigrants from Bangladesh as ldquotermites.Speaking just this month he repeated such threats, saying: ldquoI assure you that before the national election in , I will throw them all out.One of many tools at the governmentrsquos disposal to act on such threats is the National Register of Citizens . In September, . million residents of north-eastern Assam state learned their names were excluded from the register, putting them at risk of becoming stateless.The NRC is meant to track Indian nationals living in Assam, which experienced waves of mass migration in  when India became independent and in  when East Pakistan became Bangladesh.Many of those excluded from Assamrsquos register were Hindus. But as journalist and writer Ravi Agrawal, author of India Connected recently pointed out, with the new citizenship act Hindus can potentially claim they are immigrants from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan and gain a route to citizenship.Muslims, on the other hand, could be at risk of being declared foreignersthey canrsquot produce documentation.Not surprisingly, such blatantly discriminatory moves have created the current backlash against Modirsquos government and BJP rule eventhe party continues to have substantial support across India.Faced with the escalating unrest, some politicians have begun distancing themselves from the next part of the governmentrsquos agenda.The governing parties in two Indian states which both voted in favour of the citizenship law have since indicated that they will not implement a national register of citizens in their states.The government should ldquopause, take corrective measures and retract in light of public anger, Pavan Varma, a spokesman for a regional party in the state of Bihar and an ally of Modirsquos ruling BJP told the Washington Post.While in the past right-wing ideologues have gleefully declared that Modirsquos party had ldquodemolished the theory of a Muslim veto on who ruled in India, backtracking like this suggests attitudes might just be changing.It was bestselling Indian author and columnist Chetan Bhagat, once a staunch supporter of Modirsquos government who perhaps best caught the current shting mood when he wrote on Twitter recently: ldquoThose who fantasise about India with a Hindu king and his subservient subjects, remember thisthinsp ... you canrsquot wish m Muslims away. Last week, following the escalating protests, Bhagat was even more succinct: ldquoLooks like Revolution  is coming after all.Both Modi and Shah, however, are unlikely to cower in the face of such dissent. But while the government for now shows few signs of compromising let alone giving way, analysts say the current protests remain unparalleled in recent Indian history and therefore continue to pose a real political challenge.ldquoThis is the first time we have such widespread, nationwide protests that are not against corruption, but essentially protests against discrimination, said Zoya Hasan, a retired political scientist at Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi.For Muslims, the citizenship law is ldquothe thin edge of the wedge, Hasan told the Washington Post. ldquoThis is the first time that they think they are actually being subordinated.So what then is likely to happen next  No official public opinion polls have been carried out on the citizenship law, which makes it dficult to gauge just how much support there actually is for the measure.In addition Modirsquos support base should never be underestimated given that he was ed with a landslide majority for another five-year term just last May.That said, there is little doubt that the citizenship law has rankled many Indians even among his supporters.Recently, Neerja Chowdhury, a political commentator and regular columnist for The Times of India, perhaps spoke for many Indians when she observed that ldquoone gets the sense that Modi, in his second term, is overreaching in some way.While petitions challenging the new citizenship act have already been filed in Indiarsquos Supreme Court, it may take months before hearings begin, and itrsquos anyonersquos guess which way the court may rule.Meantime, Modirsquos hold on power remains firm, but the protests at home and abroad have demonstrated limits to how far Indians will allow him to go in pursuit of his Hindu-nationalist agenda.At the moment the most pressing question is the extent and for how long protesters will continues to risk their lives and livelihoods to demonstrate against the law.Many, however, remain convinced that what is happening on the streets from the city of Srinagar in the north to Thiruvananthapuram on Indiarsquos southern tip marks a political watershed.ldquoThese protests represent a turning point in the Indian publicrsquos relationship with the Modi regime, Pratap Bhanu Mehta, a political scientist at Ashoka University, told the Financial Times on Friday as unrest flared.ldquoUp until now it oscillated between aggressive adulation or frankly fear. The protests have broken that fear.India, it seems, has at last woken up to the threat posed by the government of Narendra Modi.In the best tradition of its founders, Indians today, it seems, will not rest easy until they know that the democratic values held dear remain secure."},{"url":null,"title":"rail-renationalisation-end-vote-loser","story":"Long-suffering commuters have waited forever for these improvements, of course. And since I donrsquot have to make the journey every day, I donrsquot have insight into whether my journey was representative . But credit where itrsquos due.There was a sense of irony, then, when later that same day Transport Secretary Michael Matheson announced he will end ScotRail operator Abelliorsquos contract three years early, in . The Dutch operator, which took over the ScotRail franchise in , made big promises about train and service improvements up and down the network, from the West Highlands to the Borders. But its performance record has been woeful, with staffing issues in particular seemingly crippling the network, leading to delays, cancellations and overcrowding.Read more:ScotRail franchise cut short as SNP ministers strip Abellio of contractNot all of these things were Abelliorsquos fault, however. The fragmented nature of the network since privatisation in , which sees the tracks owned by one company, the trains by another, leased to a third to operate, means ScotRail takes the blame for problems ndash signalling, bad weather, leaves on the line etc ndash it has no control over. But thatrsquos the way it goes. Understandably. frustrated passengers hit out at whoever is closest to hand, and that tends to be ScotRail and its staff.The blame game is an increasingly important part of running or overseeing a railway network, especially when passengers can take to social media social and complain in real time. So, although Abellio clearly failed to meet many of its targets, I donrsquot doubt that public pressure also played a part in the decision to end the contract early.And thatrsquos why Irsquom surprised Mr Matheson seems so keen on bringing ScotRail back into public hands, having already mooted setting up a public operator to bid against private sector rivals for the ScotRail contract. What makes him think the public sector will automatically do a better job than the likes of Abellio, which is itself owned by the Dutch state  Especially when itrsquos clear having control of the franchise is only part of the equation. Without control over the tracks , and the sort of eye-watering multi-billion pound investment that would probably require tax increases, European-style railways are a pipe dream.And at least under the current system the Scottish Government has a private sector enemy to blame and sack when things go wrong. Does the SNP really want to deal with the potential fallout at the ballot box when angry commuters turn their ire on ministers rather than Abellio or whichever private firm comes next  Mr Matheson should be careful what he wishes for. With building support independence the main partyrsquos main priority, taking over a potentially vote-losing train franchise is surely an unnecessary risk that could lead to dire consequences.Read more:ScotRail franchise cut short as SNP ministers strip Abellio of contractHe is not alone in being tempted up the nationalisation track, of course. The re-nationalisation of the UKrsquos railways was one of the few policies in the recent Labour manesto that seemed to be popular on the doorstep. And taking into consideration recent events in Englandand Scotland, one can understand the demands for change.But we hark back to the old days of British Rail with rose-tinted nostalgia when even a cursory glance at some of the realities tells you this is largely misplaced. We appear to have conveniently forgotten cold, dirty old rolling stock in thes taking us on deadly slow journeys. Passenger numbers speak for themselves, having more than doubled in the  years since privatisation. Lest we forget, too, it was a drastic programme of line closures in the sthat led to many communities in Scotland ndash including the entire Borders region ndash having their railway lines closed, with terrible economic and social consequences.Put simply, what matters to passengers is having modern trains with good facilities that arenrsquot too expensive and run on time.

It became the hit of the season, and went on to become one of the longest running musicals on both sides of the Atlantic.Sir Cameron was interviewed by three pupils from Mallaig High School - Finn Jobson, Kate Biddulph and Ellie MacPherson - to mark the th anniversary of local community newspaper West Word.He said he was just six when he first set foot in Mallaig on a family holiday and ldquofell in love with the area, but had to be taken out of a performance at the old village hall because he could not stop laughing at traditional unaccompanied singing, known as Mouth Music, which is often performed in Gaelic.Sir Cameron owes his vast fortune to the spectacular success of musicals such as Les Miseacuterables, Cats, The Phantom of the Opera and Miss Saigon.But he said that among the earliest shows he was taken to were in Mallaig - where he has owned an estate for  years.He said that his aunt and grandmother first brought him to the area in  and in the evening he would often be taken by the family to concerts at the Old Village Hall.ldquoThey often featured traditional unaccompanied Mouth Music, the sound of which Irsquom ashamed to admit, used to send me off into fits of giggles which caused my auntrsquos hand to to firmly clamp over my mouth to stle noise and embarrassment, said Sir Cameron, who grew up in Enfield, London.But he wanted to be a producer ever since his Aunt Jean took him to see Salad Days when he was eight.When he left school he became a stage hand and a cleaner at Londonrsquos Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, and worked his way up.ldquoI then plunged into my career, putting on numerous productions, during the s, often getting into considerable debt when shows didnrsquot work, until Andrew Lloyd Webber and I met up in  and created a musical everyone  had turned down based on TS Eliotrsquos poets, Practical Cats, he revealed.ldquoCats was to change the le of everyone who worked on it, and for me paid off my considerable debts and allowed me for the rest of my le, to produce the shows I really wanted to do.\"Luckily for me the public have continued to mostly like the same shows I do.Sir Cameron said Mallaig however has changed hugely and mostly for the better.ldquoMallaig may have lost most of its great fishing fleet, but it now boasts many other attractions and amenities the village could only have dreamt of years ago, he said.Referring to how the lsquoHogwartrsquos Expressrsquo and Harry Potter have boosted the area, Sir Cameron added: \"It is ironic that one of the oldest forms of transport, mostly obsolete around the world, the steam train, would actually both forge and safeguard Mallaigrsquos destiny.ldquoI feel most at home in the country, which is why I love the Mallaig area.\"Irsquove never been one for the glamorous le, though I do throw a good first night party.ldquoBeing surrounded by nature is one of the most relaxing things for me to do as it is the perfect antidote to the metropolitan way of le which doesnrsquot really understand that outside the cities, people in the country often think dferently and hold dferent values.Sir Cameron said he was optimistic over Mallaigrsquos future and ldquofor all its remoteness, is a very special place and there is no place like it.According to the Sunday Times Rich List this year, Sir Cameronrsquos personal wealth increased to pound.bn.Through his company, Sir Cameron owns eight London theatres -

But referendums arenrsquot won on seats won, they are won on the number of votes won across the country.Pro-independence votes seem to struggle to get beyond  per cent. Even with a record turnout in , the number was five per cent short.To me this is the SNPrsquos biggest stumbling block.Willie Towers, Alford.IN an otherwise excellent article Alison Rowatappears to accept at face value the assertion that Tony Blair is accurate in his analysis of why Labour lost the  General Election. In fact Labour gained signicantly more votes in  than it did in  , , and . In  Jeremy Corbyn managed to attract ,, votes whereas in  Mr Blair got ,, votes.The problem for the Labour Party and indeed all of the opposition parties is that under the first past the post electoral system the Tories managed to hold on to their share of the vote from  and slightly increase this by entering into an electoral pact with the Brexit Party. The Brexit Party stood down all of their candidates in Tory-held seats which ensured that they held on to these despite a four per cent increase in vote share by the LibDems.The fact is that had Labour, the LibDems, and SNP agreed a similar electoral pact with each other by standing down candidates in their respective target seats they would undoubtedly have reversed the result of this election. In this scenario the Tories would have lost  seats to the combined opposition resulting in another hung parliament. In Scotland such an electoral pact would probably have resulted in the SNP taking three further seats from the Tories, including the seats of Alister Jack and David Mundell. Instead of ruminating over the consequences of a Tory-hard Brexit we would now be discussing how the coalition Labour LibDem SNP government was about to bring forward plans to hold a second EU referendum.All of the opposition partiesneed to learn from this defeat that in politics as in le cooperation against a common enemy is essentialvictory is to be achieved.John Smith, Dunblane.FOR some Christians the Christmas story is a myth, what matters being not that it is a factual account of historical events, but that it is a telling of the truths of the human condition. We believe it to be the very human story of a child born into the squalid conditions of poverty and homelessness, into a family of migrants. There are seemingly deliberate reminders of those at the margins of society with the presence of the shepherds, impoverished outcasts of their day.Our st century story is one of increasing homelessness, of more children growing up in poverty, of migrants made to feel unwelcome in spite of their contribution to our society and refugees fleeing hunger, destruction and persecution being shown insufficient compassion. And of course globally the story is one of relentless suffering exacerbated by the impact of climate change.The Gospel accounts tell the story of a man revealing to us what it means to be fully human, dedicating our lives to the underprivileged and challenging those who abuse their power.In fact democratic politics have been seriously damaged recently by such abuse. So we Christians must remember that our role is to ldquospeak truth to power on behalf of the powerless.John Milne, Uddingston.Read more: Scottish Government should get to grips with fight for local services"},{"url":null,"title":"mark-smith-happy-christmas-first-minister---questions-think-answer","story":"Do you really want a referendum in  The ldquoScotlandrsquos Right to Choose document says it is the Governmentrsquos position that a referendum should be held before the end of . But do they really mean it First, we can all see the polls. Support for independence hasnrsquot changed much, but neither has support for remaining in the UK and that means therersquos a good risk of Yes losing in . In private, many senior figures in the Scottish Government accept the only comfortable referendum will be when the polls are showing around % for Yes for at least a year. And many unionists would agree with that: % would be a ldquosettled will ndash   is not.There are other reasons to doubt the SNPrsquos insistence on . We know some of their strategists think allowing Brexit to bite for a few years could drive middle-class Remainers to Yes. We also know the FM is asking for a  referendumin the knowledge a Tory No will be sent up from London, England, and in the hope the Tory No will build resentment in time for a referendum she has a better chance of winning.Question two: Do you honestly think the election result is a mandate for the referendum Here is what ldquoScotlandrsquos Right to Choose says about the SNPrsquos mandate: ldquothe people of Scotland have voted on manestos containing pledges on an independence referendum, and have elected a Scottish Parliament where a majority of the MSPs support such a referendum. It also says the current mandate was reinforced by the recent General Election.But is anyone buying that, particularly from a party that has always objected to the flaws in the UKrsquos electoral system  The Scottish Government says that ldquofor  of the  years since  hellip Scotland has been ruled by governments elected by fewer than half of Scottish constituencies. True. But you could just as easily say Scotland is ruled by an SNP government thatrsquos supported by less than half the Scottish electorate. You could also say the SNP won % of the Scottish constituencies at the general election even though they attracted only % of the vote.The point is that our flawed system is usually an inaccurate reflection of opinion, and yet the Scottish Government is behaving asitrsquos Gospel. As I said last week, thousands of unionist Scots voted SNP at the general election because they wanted Brexit stopped and their votes do not count as support for a second referendum .The bottom line  I think most Scots would accept a referendumthere was evidence of a settled will, as there was in the s for devolution. But the number of constituencies a party has in a flawed system is not a good or definitive measure of public opinion, especially on something as important as the constitution. A flawed system produces a flawed mandate.Question three: Do you accept that Scotland leaving the UK could be harder than the UK leaving the EU The Scottish Governmentrsquos document says a vote for independence in  would allow the smoothest transition to an independent Scotland taking its place as a member of the EU. Ah yes. Smooth transitions. Open borders. The easiest trade deal in human history. See how easily the slogans of Brexiters become the slogans of Scottish nationalists.The reality is that Scexit looks way trickier than Brexit. The UK is a sovereign state which means it can leave the EU without having to decide its currency it also doesnrsquot have to apply to join other international organisations or sort out its foreign or defence policies.The same does not apply to Scotland ndash after voting for independence, it would be leaving a state rather than an organisation made up of states and would therefore have to make many choices from scratch that the UK isnrsquot facing with Brexit ndash on shared assets and debts for instance. All of this means Scotland leaving the UK would be more complicated than the UK leaving the European Union.And thatrsquos before we talk about the border. The UK is going to be out of the single market and may restrict EU immigration. An independent Scotland, on the other hand, would be in the EU and would follow the four freedoms, including freedom of movement. Therefore, there would have to be checks at the Scottish border and no amount of Brexit-style reassurance from the Scottish Government is going to change that.And finally: do you believe a close result in a second independence referendum would be accepted as legitimate in Scotland A little bit more from Scotlandrsquos Right to Choose: ldquoWe are committed to an agreed, legal process hellip which will be accepted as legitimate in Scotland, the UK as a whole, and by the international community.Fair enough. Whatrsquos more, the First Minister seems to have demonstrated her commitment to an agreed, legal process by ruling out wheezes like an indicative referendum.However, the important phrase here is ldquoaccepted as legitimate. Brexit has taught us what happens when referendums are won by a slim margin ndash ision, bitterness, chaos, anger, and the losers push for another vote ndash and thatrsquos surely what would happen after a Scottish referendum next year, especially with the polls as they are. The result would be close. It would be contested and resisted and fought over.And answer me this, First Minister.

Indeed, Ministers have stopped even referring to the deadline,” Mr McArthur said.“It is all the more important, therefore, that priority is given to connecting those communities who have been waiting longest for any sort of service. Good quality, affordable broadband is increasingly critical in accessing services, allowing businesses to compete and enable people to go about their daily lives.#The Orkney MSP added: #Mr Matheson seems happy that Orkney continues to languish signicantly behind the level of coverage achieved nationally. As an MSP representing a central belt constituency, perhaps Mr Matheson believes this is just the ‘price you pay’ for living in an island or rural area.“Whatever the reason, it is unacceptable, the Scottish Government needs to re-commit to prioritising future broadband investment in Orkney and other communities who continue to lag behind when it comes to coverage.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Unfortunately the indications from the EU-Norway talks are that this did not happen and our fishing communities are going to feel the consequences.“Sustainability is important but we must remember that no one has more incentive to ensure sustainable fisheries than family-owned businesses and fishing communities. These groups depend on having reliable stocks now and for future generations.”He continued: “Amongst all the technical discussions and ideological debates, the direct impact on local communities who are reliant on fishing and the surrounding industries is being forgotten. Sustainable fisheries should protect the long-term success of our distinct fishing communities. I hope that the key players in these talks, and our Government, can set aside ideology and reflect on the social impact of quota changes.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

According to the SNP version of events, nationalists and unionists alike entered into the constitutional debate with joy in their hearts. It didn’t matter what side of the debate we were on, we just glad to be involved.The truth is that the independence referendum campaign was an entirely miserable process for anyone who believes in the maintenance of the United Kingdom. For the majority of Scots, the prospect of victory for the nationalists was a source of anxiety, the prospect of Alex Salmond leading a newly independent Scotland a source of grave concern.Of course, the SNP had to spin a version of events which glossed over the uncomfortable truth that ’s vote on the constitution did nothing but create ision.I regret to report that the nationalists are at it again.Since the result of the general election, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon has told a story of a Scotland united against a common enemy in the shape of Prime Minister Boris Johnson. So deep is our loathing for the Conservative PM that we demand another referendum on independence. This is a truth against which nobody can argue.Except, that is, for anybody who cares to look at the election result.It is undoubtedly the case that the majority of Scots did not vote for Johnson’s party. Only a quarter of us backed the Conservatives. But it is also the case that only a minority –  per cent of us – backed the SNP. Evenwe include the vote for the party’s fellow nationalists, the Scottish Greens, the vote for pro-independence parties on  December reaches only  per cent.Despite this, Sturgeon and her fellow SNP politicians have spent the past week arguing that she has a mandate to hold a second referendum.This is something of a leap. And it comes with the claim that the people of Scotland – whether they are in favour of independence or not – wish to have the right to decide on the matter again.Even though it is nothing of the sort, the election result is, says Sturgeon, evidence that Scots would like the Scottish Government to have the power to call a second independence referendum. Currently, it is the case that the right to permit a referendum on independence resides in Westminster. Sturgeon would like to see that power transferred to Holyroodand she now argues that the nation is firmly behind her.It may well be the case that there exists a substantial number of pro-UK Scots who hanker for the stressful experience of a second independence referendum, but I sincerely doubt this.Sturgeon – who succeeded Salmond promising to be a unying figure in  and has spent the past five years being every bit as monomaniacal as her mentor – will not, I think, win many converts to the cause using the sort of rhetoric she’s deployed in recent days.She has talked of Scotland being held in the Union against its will. You can’t, she says, “lock us in a cupboard and turn the keys and hope everything goes away”.This nonsense might play well with those fully converted to the nationalist cause, but it is, I think, a little shrill \u2028for those yet to be convinced that Scotland’s best future lies in breaking from the UK.If Scots felt, as Sturgeon claims we do, imprisoned in the Union against our will, surely the great majority of us would have backed nationalist parties last week  For the past five years, the First Minister has spun a yarn of unstoppable growing support for independence. Each and every political development has been hailed as proof that increasing numbers of Scots are leaping on the independence charabanc. But the truth is that the numbers remain broadly where they were five years ago. The SNP may have the majority of MPs and MSPs but they have only a minority of voters on their side.During election campaigns, Sturgeon and her team can usually be heard talking about the need to protect the NHS. This is always a policy priority. In the aftermath of votes, however, the only subject deemed worthy of discussion is the constitution.This is hardly surprising, because the fact is that, while the SNP obsesses over a referendum that the majority don’t want, the NHS in Scotland remains in a parlous state.And then there’s the education system which continues to fail large numbers of children who leave school without even the most basic skills in literacy and numeracy. And then there’s Police Scotland, an organisation that lurches from crisis to crisis.There is no shortage of issues which the SNP would rather not discuss while it continues to argue that independence is a panacea.It is, quite simply, the case that, for all her talk of wishing to hold a referendum in , the First Minister remains powerless to do so. She has neither the right to call a referendum nor the numbers required to win one.And so, I suspect, that her language in recent days has been less about bringing the country together behind her nationalist project and more about throwing raw meat to those who are already on board.These have been a frustrating few years for the ardent Scottish nationalists. Promises of a second referendum have come to naught. The momentum described by the First Minister has not materialised.Of course, committed Yes voters will argue that the mandate Sturgeon describes is real. But it is not and no amount of magical thinking can change that reality.Sure, Sturgeon may yet change the minds that must be changedindependence is to become the preference of a majority of Scots. And, yes, the presence of Johnson in Downing Street may assist in that process. But, right now, the independence project remains stuck in the mud and no amount of nonsense about a Scotland imprisoned is likely to change that.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"gail hurley glasgow pivotal to building a finance system to slow climate change","story":"This year#s UN Climate Change Conference in Madrid has wrapped up, and all eyes will now focus on Scotland as next year#s host of what is arguably the world#s most important international conference.The COP climate change conference will mark five years since the historic Paris Climate Agreement, which committed countries to strengthening actions to combat climate change and limit the global temperature rise this century to below  degrees Celsius. We know, however, that the world is not on track to cut carbon emissions, which must be halved from today’s levels to restrain temperature increases to just . degrees Celsius, the upper limit advised by climate scientists. Progress will need to be ratcheted up by next year.The spotlight is expected to shine on the thorny issue of how to pay for climate damage, and how to mobilise the trillions needed for international climate financing programmes.Financing needed to tackle the climate crisis is estimated to add up to trillions worldwide, and is especially high in the poorest countries and those particularly vulnerable to climate change, such as small island states. The UN estimates a  trillion annual shortfall in investments needed to meet internationally agreed climate and sustainable development goals.A decade ago, industrialised countries pledged to jointly mobilise  billion annually in climate finance by  to address their needs. Yet only bn was raised in , mostly from public sector aid budgets . There is a consensus that more resources need to be mobilised from private markets for climate-friendly investments and to support a “just transition” to net-zero.This is where our work to promote Scotland as a leading international centre for ethical and responsible finance comes in. The climate emergency has underscored the urgency of building a financial system that has better outcomes for people and planet at its heart. The work at the Global Ethical Finance Initiative , headquartered in Edinburgh, builds on Scotland’s proud heritage in ethical finance and financial services, to convene the world’s foremost political, business and civic leaders to define and shape the transition to a sustainable financial system.Within the financial services sector, interest has increased signicantly over recent years in the ways it can look beyond short-term profit and shareholder value towards how it can drive positive social, economic and environmental impact. This has led to a plethora of new initiatives and financial products, such as ethical investment funds, sustainability bonds , and the development of UN-led Principles for Responsible Investment. Globally, the impact investment market is increasingly popular and is now estimated at over bn .At this year’s climate conference, the European Union unveiled its “Green New Deal” intended to transform Europe’s economy and eliminate its contributions to climate change by . Scotland is even more ambitious: this year it adopted landmark legislation to become a net zero society by , and to reduce emissions by  per cent by . Delivering a green transformation that will support employment creation, build skills, boost wages and trigger technological advances will require building a new generation of infrastructure and industries. In addition to well-planned public expenditure that can crowd-in private investment, banks will need to ensure they are able to provide the kinds of financing needed to support this transformation. Aligning their business strategies with society’s goals will in turn help them leverage new business opportunities and remain competitive with the emergence of the sustainable development economy.Finance can be a positive force for change. As we enter a “decade of action” on climate and sustainable development, COP in Glasgow in  provides an opportunity for Scotland to showcase its important work to accelerate the transformation towards a socially responsible and inclusive financial system – one that serves both people and planet.Gail Hurley is Senior Consultant, Global Ethical Finance Initiative, and former senior adviser to the UN©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"gary rhodes a pioneer who inspired so many young cooks tributes pour in for tv chef","story":"Described as a pioneer who \"inpsired many young cooks\" and the man who \"almost single handedly put British food on the world stage\", Rhodes was one of the best known ambassadors for British cuisine and inspired a generation of Brits to enjoy cooking. window.twttr The top chef, who received five Michelin stars during his career, he is best known for his work on MasterChef, Ready Steady Cook and Hells Kitchen.

At the time his decision was said to have left moderate Labour colleagues “stunned and furious in equal measure”.Since the result of the election, Jeremy Corbyn has also said he will stand down as leader in the New Year and, as a result, the contest for both positions will run at the same time.While no candidates have yet officially declared, a number have been rumoured to want to stand, notably Angela Rayner, Dawn Butler and Richard Burgon – all shadow ministers on the Corbynite wing of the party. Conor McGinn, Khalid Mahmood and Barry Gardiner are also likely to stand.However, Scotland on Sunday has learned that party members are urging Murray, who retained his Edinburgh South seat and for the second time in four years is the sole Labour MP in Scotland, to also run for the role.McDougall said: “There’s a feeling after the Scottish party was thrown under a bus by the UK leadership, that someone needs to educate the UK party of the reality of Scottish politics.“The general election was extraordinary –we had spent the entire time talking about a hung parliament and what we would give the LibDems, people would have thought we were mad, but that’s what we’ve done with the SNP in the last two elections.“Ian would be brilliant. He knows how to win and is a great politician. It would also be good to have someone there reminding people we were the party that saved the Union.”A party source said it would make sense for Murray to stand. “Labour’s position in Scotland has never been worse, so to ensure that Scotland is at the forefront of Labour thinking as we face another battle over independence, this would be a sensible thing to do.“Ian represents Scots with Labour values who want to remain in the Union and are pro-European. There is no doubt about where he stands on these issues, so it would remove the idea that the party is too weak on the biggest matters facing Scotland. He’s also a proven winner.”Another party source added: “It’s essential that there is a Scottish voice in the leadership debate. The only way our party will ever be back in power iswe can win seats from the south of England to the north of Scotland.“Some of the biggest questions the Labour Party will face in the coming years will relate to Scotland, and having a Scot as part of the leadership team would show that we are serious when we talk about working for the whole of the UK.” It is understood Murray had no desire to be made the shadow Scottish Secretary by Corbyn– he had previously resigned from the role in  at the same time as a number of others quite Corbyn’s front bench in light of his stance after the EU referendum in . He was also a supporter of Owen Smith in the previous leadership election.For the second time Corbyn has an English MP serving as the party’s shadow Scottish secretary, with Tony Lloyd, MP for Rochdale, replacing Lesley Laird who lost her Kirkcaldy seat at the election.It is not knownCorbyn consulted Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard before appointing Lloyd, but Scotland on Sunday understands that Leonard has still not spoken directly with Murray in the two years since he became leader.A former Labour strategist said: “It is vitalwe are to become electable again that we have moderate people at the top of the party, certainly at least in one of the main leadership positions. Ian Murray is definitely that, and he has the skills required. “Of course he would need the backing of members and unions – and we saw Unite try and have him de-selected during the election, so he could forget any support from that direction, so it will be interesting to see who he does gain support from.”Murray was unavailable for comment.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad ","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

She followed Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn#s position, stating she would like to see a new Brexit deal negotiated with the EU and put to the British people in a referendum, with no Brexit the other option.Jenner Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, said her priority was to #uphold democracy# and to see Brexit through #as soon as possible#.The SNP#s Robert Leslie said that Orkney and Shetland had not voted for Brexit yet #we could suffer most# from the country leaving the EU. He added he would like to remain in the EU and help reform it from within as part of an independent Scotland.The Brexit Party#s Robert Smith did not attend, but his stance of a #clean-break Brexit# with a free trade deal with the EU was announced to the room.Unsurprisingly, Brexit proved the hottest topic of the evening with several questions based around that subject.Ms Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, surprised most in attendance by repeatedly going against party policy # firstly by saying she supported the actions of Gina Miller, who took the Conservative government to court over Brexit, because she was #upholding democracy# and secondly by saying that the government#s #settled status# scheme for EU citizens needed a #total overhaul#.So it would seem the only candidate willing to represent the more than nine and a half thousand brexit voters in Orkney and Shetland is working fisherman Robert Smith of the Brexit party. It would seem Boris promise that all tories elected in this election would back his brexit plan was a bit of the mark. Or maybe it shows that his brexit plan is not brexit at alltheir candidate For the isles is willing to back it.Good to see that the Brexit Party is not drawn into this level of debate. I am sure Robert Smith was absent because he was busy getting Brexit Done. Too right that a clean-break Brexit is what we need. Like was said before, a free trade deal will be the #easiest in human history#. Wise words from Liam Fox, and still yet to be disproved by the #facts#.Robert Leslie, SNP, is obviously unaware ofthe impact of independence. The EU has stated repeatedly that , wewill be automatically out of the EU on Independence Day # with #No Deal#.#When part of the territory of a Member State ceases to be a part of that State, e.g. because that territory becomes an independent state, the treaties will no longer apply #Westminster will no longer fund our #notional budget deficit#. It will become real. Nicola Sturgeon#s Scottish Growth Commission proposed a multi-year plan to reduce it to EU-acceptable levels. We must also have our own, independent central bank and therefore, our own currency. That will take nine yearsand will require tens of billions in foreign reserves.If Britain #remains# there would be a #hard UK border# with EU tarfs . Negotiations will be with Brussels, not Westminster.It will take at least  years, with austerity,to rejoin.And  when we do we shall join the euro and pass control of our economy trade and fishing agriculture to the EU.SNP EU Brexit policy is nonsense. Scots are shrewd people and will not buy it.No, I was absent because I was at sea.#with Rees-Mogg hiding below decks I think she was campaigning in the SW of England.Not surprising. The Brexit party are all at sea.At least you were at sea doing an honest days work Robert, unlike the other candidates. Nobody will know more about the negative effects of European Union membership than you!I#m a bit baffled. I read tonight that Jo Swinson has apologised that she and her Lib Dems backed the Tories# austerity policies. But last night I saw Willie Rennie backing those policies to the hilt. What a party.Jo was talking about the past.Willie was thinking about the future.Now  have quit, including Rees Mogg. Like what Robert did there though, referring to Jacob#s sister, formerly of the Brexit Party, and no longer campaigning for them in the South East of England. You#ve got to ask how a spare bedroom tax would impact on that family# including in their second and third homes and any additional properties in their portfolios.WHY SOCIALIST SNP MEMBERS SHOULD VOTE LABOUR TOMORROW:For the first time in forty years and possibly for the last time during my le, we have the chance to support a manesto that includes widespread nationalisation and the restoration of worker’s rights.These are policies that any self-respecting socialist would have regarded as red lines before Thatcher came along and “modernised” British politics.After Brexit and Scottish independence, we willto the natural battle between left and right. It will even take place within the SNP itself, once the phoney pre-independence “party of national unity” approach falls apart.During these debates, the left will highlight support for Corbyn’s radical policies as evidence that these are still relevant and can still win votes.Meanwhile, the right will highlight the lack of support for Labour as evidence that strong unions and public ownership are no longer winning policies and should be abandoned forever.If you can’t use your vote to get your candidate elected tomorrow, at lease use it to make a statement.The ideas behind Labour’s bold policies need to be kept alive.They will be as relevant in an independent Scotland as they will anywhere .Absolutely.Absolutely not, Johan. I am old enough to remember the Winter of Discontent. Comrade Corbyn, Comrade Scargill. First Secretary Sturgeon! Reach for the rusty tin, self-castration before I would vote Socialist or Nationalist.I am almost old enough to remember the s also. I went missing from hom when I wis about , because I was busy helping a couple of older folk collect fire wood in the absence of coal during the Tories  day week I think.We are not going back to the s, with what we know now we can run things much better under Corbyn.The absence of coal was due to Socialist and le long Soviet supporterMick McGahey#s miners strike. Hardly down to the Tories. Just the Unions holding the country to ransom. Thank God the Maggie neutered that bunch.It#s almost like you are saying Shetland needs a vocal and united local Labour Party willing to take a stand on environmental and equality issues and prepared to ensure people#s concerns are properly considered.Will the local branch make a start to rebuilding by considering whether it isn#t time to call an end to Sullom Voe Yes, it would be goodmembers stopped voting for other partiesIt#s almost like you are trying to change the subject. Which of the parties that plan to close Sullom Voe did you vote for It’s important that unions be strong but not omnipotent, as in the s when many major industries were still nationalised. We meed balance.Combining the two is all very fine for those who, like me, benefited from working in the public sector however it leads to a two-tier workforce, with those in the private sector footing the bill, in taxes or high product prices, for the privileged ones in the public sector. That also hits private sector pay as employers must maintain viability with their increased costs.Having said that, re-nationalisation of electricity would be hilariously apt because government would become directly accountable totaxpayers and or bill-payers for the soaring costs of energy arising from “decarbonisation”, associated with the lunacy of unilateral “declarations of climate emergency” and policies like Labour’s “net zero ”.The IPCC does not call for that and condemns unilateral action as being unhelpful in achieving international agreement.I voted for Blair when sanity prevailed,now Corbyn takes us all back, well he is trying to, but the result empowers Boris!!! So now we have a Boris   Sturgeon catfight. Interesting times ahead, perhaps an Independent Shetland is the way forward, history repeating.When Boris replies to the letter requesting an independence referendum for Shetland, I hope the recipient will share it on this forum.We could all do with a laugh.Don#t make us laugh IanI wouldn#t trust this council to run a bath never mind having full autonomy of all the finances!Are you going to be King Ian Just a jest, George, but many a true word!If Sturgeon goes Indy I would rather stay with the UK or go for autonomy. . Think about it.Agreed Johan, and Labour has had my vote this time, but when there is a chance of turffing out an austerity backing LibDem# The main thing is people are being offered a chance to take back control of the vital services they depend on that should never have been privatised in the first place.New management systems will mean these can in future serve the people rather than serving corporate greed.Whether we get there this election or not, Corbin#s bold ideas have reignited the debate and energised thousands more activists than the Tories have active members. Hope remains for a fairer society in which the economy works for the good of the people as well as the environment they depend on.The LibDems on the other hand remain forever compromised between the freedom of business to exploit people and the freedom of people not to be exploited. Some wonderful handwringing from Carmichael on Viking Energy this election.Well done for your stand there and on UHA.Particularly pleasing to see Friends of the Earth saying Labour#s manesto was better for the environment than that of the Greens.O dear, poor Peter.On the wrong side again.#Labour#s worst performance since #. #Corbin’s bold ideas have reignited the debate and energised thousands more activists than the Tories have active members.# What the Socialist left did for Labour, just imagine what the would do to the UK and shudder!!! Momentumare the new Militant Tendency, no wonder they are heading to the dust bin of history.No, I am agreeing with you Malcolm, and also saying there is a conversation to be had locally about how long Shetland should continue to host the oil industry.The biggest benefit would have been in stable local employment, but that is not what we have seen.If the oil industry honours its original promises there will be years of work in ing the terminal site to nature.Some will say the sooner that begins the better.If that thinking can#t happen on the left where  will it happen Apparently % voted for political parties that wanted a second Brexit referendum, but now we#ve got the blues.What hope now for the  in  bairns born into poverty Thank goodness we avoided Corbyn#s, Socialism Peter. Look to Socialism in Venasuallia what that would do for us. That whole country is in poverty.Over  million scots voted to remain in the uk nowhere near that amount of scots voted to remain in the eu or for the snp. What is it about democracy you don#t understand  You seem to think you just change the question to suit the answer you claim to have got to a question that was never asked. And then have the gall to say that brexiteers didn#t know what they were voting for.Think about this George. If two years ago I had said Boris would be PM with a landslide every one would have laughed. The phrase is #He who has the last laugh#, Ho, Ho, Ho. Now everyone calm down. The die is cast for Brexit, at last.Not that long ago the Tories and LibDems opposed the minimum wage, so it will be interesting to see which of Labour#s bold ideas become mainstream next..."},{"url":null,"title":"carmichael holds onto his seat ","story":"Alistair Carmichael has been ed as the MP for Shetland and Orkney for a sixth time.The longstanding isles MP won with over , votes, as the SNP were pipped to second place.SNP candidate Robert Leslie garnered , votes compared to Mr Carmichael#s ,.Meanwhile, the Scottish Conservatives came third, Labour fourth and Brexit Party fth, with independent candidate David Barnard coming last.Tory candidate Jenny Fairbairn polled , votes, Labour#s Coilla Drake ,, Robert Smith and anti-monarchy candidate David Barnard garnered  votes.There were  spoiled ballot papers, some of which may have been influenced by campaign by activist Stuart Hill, who called on voters to write #no thanx# across the paper.The result in this constituency is perhaps unsurprising.

They did well because of the absence of credible opposition, notably, from the Labour Party, with its incompetent leadership both nationally and in Scotland.

In response to Ofgem’s decision, SSEN is also promising to progress preparation of the Shetland #standby arrangements# which will complement the transmission link.It is hoped the decision will provide Shetland’s renewable developers clarity about future network charges, helping them make investment decisions and provide the evidence required by Ofgem for the regulator to approve the proposed transmission link to the Shetland Isles. Commenting on today’s decision, Colin Nicol, Managing Director for Networks, said: “We welcome today’s decision by Ofgem to approve our whole system solution for Shetland, which is a positive step toward meeting Shetland’s electricity needs at a much lower cost to energy consumers than alternative options.“The proposal will support future security of supply as well as unlocking Shetland’s renewable potential.Once built, the transmission link and the low carbon output from renewable generators on Shetland will also help support the electricity needs of Shetland’s oil and gas industry and its wider economy.“Our transmission business will shortly re-submit to Ofgem an updated Needs Case for the Shetland link and we look forward to working with Ofgem and Shetland developers to progress this proposal in a timely manner.”Funny how things like this are announced during the few days between the General Election and Christmas.Last we heard was renewable energy developers crying their eyes out that the proposed MW cable was inadequate for all the wind farms they want to build on Shetland.#Follow the money#. So-called #contributions# from SSEN#s customers and bigger cables with more generation lead to a reduction in the price of VE#s next bid in a renewable energy auction.Who would bet against SSEN#s revised #final needs case# proposing an even bigger capacity cable, enabling even more and bigger wind farms to be built Commenting on today’s decision, Colin Nicol, Managing Director for Networks, said: “We welcome today’s decision by Ofgem to approve our whole system solution for Shetland, which is a positive step toward meeting Shetland’s electricity needs at a much lower cost to energy consumers than alternative options.Does this statement mean that the average shetland family would be able to obtain electricity cheaper on the commissioning of the project  Would it be possiblethe turbines were commissioned prior to the connector cable being commissioned then could the power be made available locally at reduced pricing  This looks like so much greenwash and so many weasel words to a community whose council has a vested interest in rolling over and playing dead. What exactly are we to read into #meeting Shetland#s energy needs at a much lower cost to energy consumers# There is an implied promise there, and even a threat, but no actual guarantee of cheaper bills for local residents.As for #unlocking Shetland#s renewable potential#, this looks like code for unlocking their potential to exploit the landscape and the people through environmentally harmful proposals the people will get no say in.Shetland remains in thrall to the notion that all potential economic activity is necessarily a positive development.Some developments however represent an approach to development that dlsempowers, robs folk of a say and foists solutions onto them that do not address their problems or needs.There will be opportunities for some to profit no doubt, but is is hard for the council to dispassionately manage partnership with these far larger players when they are so wowed by the prospect of cash flowing into the reserves through ground rent to the Busta estate.The SIC will do diddlysquat to ensure local concerns are considered..."},{"url":null,"title":"development officer at shetland tourism association 2 ","story":"A unique opportunity to work with and support tourism businesses throughout Shetland.The STA is seeking a motivated inidual with a passion for tourism for a fixed term  year post.The postholder will work  hours per week on a self-employed basis.Tasks will include website updates, liaising with members and industry bodies, arranging member events, overseeing the implementation of the Tourism Strategy and producing reports as required."},{"url":null,"title":"hjaltland housing association ","story":"HAS AVAILABLE TO REGISTERED APPLICANTSpayable £. p.c.m.

The Colin area representative has replaced newly elected MP for North Belfast John Finucane.Co-opted to Belfast City Council in Janaury , the -year-old told the Andersonstown News that it will be a “huge honour” to represent the people of Belfast.“What can I say, it’s amazing,” he said. “I’m honoured to have been asked by Sinn Féin to be the next Ard Mhéara of Belfast. “I have been an activist in the Colin area since I was . I’m very much about grassroots politics and that theme is something I want to continue. “I want to use the office of Mayor to bring politics from the ground up.” Having topped the council election poll in May, Danny spoke of how he will be continuing the civic work of party colleague John Finucane. “The role of Mayor is city-wide, I want to be a Mayor for all communities and to represent everybody. I want to champion the need for improvements to our mental health services. It’s something that has really impacted the Colin area. I want to use the office of Mayor to help in whatever way I can. I will work with our young people to ensure that they are included in decision-making that they have a brighter future and better quality of le.”The Lagmore father-of-three said he will be straight into Mayor business when he takes over the ‘chain’ today.“I want to do this for my family.  has been a dficult year for our family with the loss of our mother Edna. Mum was probably my biggest supporter and I want to do her, my we and children proud. I want to show my kids that there is nothing you can’t achieve through hard work and doing your best.”Sinn Féin group leader on the Council, Ciarán Beattie, described Mr Baker as a “well-respected and grounded community activist in the Colin area”.He added: “He has also been a vocal campaigner for LGBT and Irish language rights, climate action, community empowerment and for mental health awareness. “Danny will take this grassroot style of representation into the role of Mayor and ensure that all the needs of the citizens of this city are reflected in Belfast City Council. I want to pay tribute to outgoing Ard Mhéara John Finucane. He placed human rights social justice, environmentalism and defending Belfast against Brexit at the heart of his term.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"health workers begin 12 hour","story":"THOUSANDS of health workers across the north have begun -hour strike action in a dispute over pay and patient safety.The Royal College of Nursing, who represent around , nurses, are taking strike action for the first time in its -year history.About , other nurses, who are members of Unison have also walked out.On Tuesday night, leaders of the five main parties met the head of the NI Civil Service, David Sterling, and Health Department Permanent Secretary, Richard Pengelly, in a th-hour bid to avert the strike action and state their “collective support for the restoration of pay parity”.The Northern Ireland Office later said that Health was a devolved matter and Mr Sterling rejected the idea of restoring pay parity on the grounds of public interest.UNISON Regional Secretary Patricia McKeown said: “Everyone with power and authority in this society has conceded that our cause is just. We have had ‘sympathy’ from the UK Government through the Secretary of State, from all political parties that stood on our picket lines and from the leadership of the health service. But we have no resolution.“UNISON has agreed emergency cover and our members have volunteered to provide it. We have never seen such determination in health workers who have been devalued and disrespected for almost  years. For  weeks they have stood up for their rights and have now put the health service at the top of the political agenda.“Despite their sacrice there is still no action from those in power. It would appear that health workers, patients and the public at large are being used as pawns in a political game.“As we enter this signicant period in the industrial struggle the consequences lay firmly on the shoulders of the UK Government, our elected politicians and the leadership of the civil service.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"welcome organisation be kind to those living on the street","story":"I meet with Welcome Organisation CEO Sandra Moore in a room stacked from floor to almost ceiling of sleeping bags, which I’m told, have been donated by the Marine Society and Sea Cadets. Most,not all, of these will be gone over the coming nights to those sleeping rough in the city centre. Offering tea and coffee on tap from am until pm at their Townsend Street HQ, Sandra told the Andersonstown News that the need for their service is very much “ days a year”. “We have service users coming to us with ious needs, whether it’s clothes, a cup of tea or somewhere to have a bit of refuge. We do make targeted appeals throughout the year via our Facebook page and we do have people ringing to ask is there anything in particular we need. We always need decent trainers, sturdy, durable. We can’t hold out to jeans, in smaller sizes of waist, new underwear on which there is a massive demand all year round, socks and toiletries. “We can’t hold out to coffee, tea, sugar, washing powder, toilet roll, those things make a big dference to us,” she said.“We would ask for those who are donating that there is a reasonable le left in the items they want to give. We always have a need for sleeping bags and we don’t distribute tents on the streets as they would pose a danger.”Established  years ago, the Welcome Organisation has provided a vital shelter for those sleeping rough and who are experiencing homelessness. Sandra spoke of how the need for the service has “changed dramatically” in that time.“We are dealing with a greater number of people, people with more signicant issues, drug, alcohol, mental health, not all the people we work with do, its some, not all. What we are finding is that the age profile of those seeking the service is much younger, and there are more women coming to the Organisation. When I came  years ago we had six women in service. Now a third of our service users are female.”She continued: “We are working with homelessness in its most chronic form. We can’t forget that there is hidden homelessness. By that I mean people sleeping on sofas, moving from pillar to post. Nobody has a handle on that. One in  people within their le in Northern Ireland will experience homelessness. Le expectancy of someone who has had periods of continuous homelessness is  for a woman and  for a man.”Sandra said that currently those service users at the centre are predominantly young males from North and West Belfast.As  comes to a close, Sandra said that the issue of homelessness is facing a constant struggle in the New Year.“All services are facing pressure, lack of mental health services, lack of drug and alcohol support service and not just in Belfast, right across the North. We do not have detox or rehab facilities here, what services are there, due to severe pressures, aren’t responsive enough. We are trying to bridge that gap. It’s quite evident right across the city that there is a growing drug problem, there is a real need for education in communities. “People have to bear in mind that there is a back story to each and every person who is homeless. This is someone’s son, somebody’s daughter. Nobody has ever set out on that path. What child do you ask and they say ‘I want to be ill’, ‘I want to be struggling with addiction’, ‘I want to be homeless’. It’s not an aspiration but unfortunately it’s were we are. In Belfast I think we have a chance to not end up like Dublin, like London, the big cities. We still have a chance of doing something to contain it, but the agencies need to work together.”“No-one knows what the budget is for Ireland next year. How can you possibly plan while we have no minister for finance or minster for health  We, along with others, are highly dependent on the good will of the public, we couldn’t survive without the public,” she said. “I’ve been here  years and every year I am still overwhelmed by the generosity of people, people are very kind, however homelessness is an issue  days of the year.”Sandra said the levels of increased poverty within households job losses and the impact of Universal Credit are contributing factors to homelessness. “Regardless of whatever way Brexit goes, the economy is shrinking again, there is higher unemployment. “As my grandmother always said ‘when poverty comes in the door, love goes out the window’. We see so many times relationships breaking down because of the stresses of poverty linked to job losses. Statistics show that children growing up in poverty that their le chances are much worse. Someone who experiences homelessness as a child is much more likely to experience it as an adult – we need more preventive services going forward.”With the Organisation’s core team of staff, Sandra said that they couldn’t provide their service without their “ volunteers”. “We had  for Christmas dinner last year and so far we have wrapped over  Christmas presents,  of those bespoke for our regular users. We are inundated with people wanting to volunteer with us on Christmas Day – it’s a lovely day but it’s a hard day for a lot of people as you can imagine. We try to keep familiar faces around for the people that are coming in.“We just want to thank everyone for their continued support, we couldn’t do our work without it. We have a fantastic team of staff, of volunteers and the support of the public and the community. All I would ask is that people continue to be kind. That’s all I ask, is for people to be kind to those on the street. We don’t always know the story of how or why it has come to that.”For more information on the Welcome Organisation or to donate visit www.homelessbelfast.org"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"young people saying yes to yeha project","story":"ESTABLISHED over ten years ago, the YEHA Project has gone from strength to strength in helping young people in North Belfast.Based in the Flax Centre and the Houben Centre in Ardoyne, YEHA stands for Youth, Education, Health and Advice.The YEHA Project is made up of a small dedicated team of five full-time staff, sessional workers and a team of volunteers. One such youth worker is -year-old Cara O’Kane, who has been involved with YEHA Project for four years.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Cara explained more about the work of YEHA Project.“The YEHA Project supports young people in North Belfast aged  to  to tackle issues affecting their health and emotional well being,” she said.“Our work with young people embraces the core principles of youth work with therapeutic approaches.“Basically, we were set up over ten years ago to tackle health inequalities in North Belfast.“Our focus is on trying to get young people to focus on healthy lestyles and make positive and healthy choices regarding their wellbeing.“We do a lot of mentoring and support work where a young person would work with a youth worker informally centered around mental health and wellbeing. This may involve building coping skills and strategies for any dficulties they are facing in their le and looking at their interests and skills.“We want young people more involved in the community and activities instead of just going home after school as well.“It is about getting them out and about and giving them opportunities to try dferent things“We have had fantastic feedback from the young people themselves about the work that we do. They are testament to the work that they do themselves with our projects.“Our projects are all voluntary and everything is in the young person’s hands. Sometimes you have to step out of your comfort zone but the benefits are massive.The YEHA Project is also involved with cross-community work, alongside an organisation based on the Woodvale called Streetbeat Youth Project.Another successful project is the Carezone in Schools project, a pilot programme which is currently into its second year, based at Mercy College.Cara explained: “It is a model where we run one-to-one support within the school and have someone from YEHA project in the school daily to work with students in school.“After running a research programme, we found that over  per cent of young people would be more likely to speak to another young person about their problems rather than an adult.“We run the one-to-one mentoring service alongside a Peer Mentor programme where young people are trained up in Peer Mentoring to help support other young people on issues affecting their mental health and enables them to signpost to relevant support agencies.“It was a successful first year and last year we delivered  sessions to  pupils covering a range of issues including building coping skills and resilience, relationships, communication and social skills, health and well-being and anxiety.“We have a nice room in Mercy College where young people can come and relax and they are more likely to open up in such an environment.“It is all voluntary too, of course.”One young person, who took part in the programme, Jodie Shevlin, praised the benefits of it during the pressures of school exams.“The Carezone in Schools project is a way for pupils to distress and escape from the pressure of school work and exam,” she said.“The one-to-one work the project does is a chance for us to get worries or problems off our chest and be able to just have a more relaxed chat where we are really listened to.“It has really helped me get through my last few years of school.”YEHA ProjectFlax CentreArdoyne AvenueBelfast BT DATel:    "},{"url":null,"title":"church leaders call on ni politicians to focus on restoring devolution","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We can’t apply it to former deputies or former senators, which is definitely an anomaly in the law.“Paschal Donohoe will do an initiative on a review of the expense regime.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Paschal Donohoe TDs currently receive two sets of expenses, a parliamentary allowance, which is for office spending, for example printing leaflets for their constituency.TDs are expected keep receipts and are regularly audited.The other allowance is for travel and accommodation, which does not require the production of receipts.However it is required that TDs fob in, with an electronic device on a certain number of days a year to prove that they have travelled to Dublin.“That one, I think, is lax and wide open to abuse, and that’s the one that we need to review, “Mr Varadkar added.“Paschal, the Public Expenditure Minister, is going to lead the reform of that, although we need the cooperation of the Oireachtas as well, because they’re the ones who do compliance. They’re not part of government.”Mr Murphy has been asked to present himself to the Dail Ethics Committee for investigation.Such an inquiry can only happenMr Murphy agrees, however the Taoiseach says that Mr Murphy, so far, has not.“In terms of Dara himself, when he resigned from the Dail, ne said that he would agree to cooperate with a statutory inquiry,” he said.“It seems the only way that we can have a statutory inquiry ishe refers himself to the ethics committee, or the ethics and public office act.“I have asked him to do so. As of now, he’s not willing to do so.“I’m annoyed about that, quite frankly, and a lot of people in Fine Gael are annoyed about that too. And I’d be calling on him to reconsider that decision.“When he took the job, with the EPP, he took it on the basis that he would continue to discharge his s as a constituency TD and as a parliamentarian, and you know, there are lots of TDs and senators who have a second job.“A lot of them have other roles, like with the Council of Europe, but we expect at the bare minimum that they continue to do their job representing their constituents, that they continue to do their job as parliamentarians.“If Dara hasn’t done that, well then I think he has let us all down, those of us in Fine Gael, his constituents and the general public.”He’ll say he has evidence to show that he was present for more than only  days a year. Butthat’s the case, that’s why there should be a proper inquiry and in order for there to be a statutory inquiry and the only way we can do that at the moment is for him to refer himself to the ethics committee. “And despite a number of conversations in the last couple of days, as of today, he’s unwilling to do that, and that to me is wrong.”"},{"url":null,"title":"what the papers say december","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Many children and young people in the district will unfortunately not wake up to lots of presents under the tree or enjoy a full tummy after the much anticipated Christmas dinner. While I wholly appreciate that Christmas can be a very financially challenging time for most, I would strongly encourage anyone who is in a position to do so, to make a donation, no matter how small, to a local food bank or toy appeal to help give these children and young people the Christmas they dream of, and deserve.”He continued: “Christmas can also be an extremely dficult and sad time of the year for many, including those who have lost loved ones, are in poor health, or are living alone. I would ask that we all give a little extra consideration to the plight of others this Christmas and carry out one small act of kindness, whether it’s just stopping in on an elderly neighbour, or inviting someone living alone to dinner. This small act will mean a great deal to them and could just make their Christmas.“I have really enjoyed my first six months as Chair of Mid Ulster District Council and I would like to sincerely thank everyone in the district for making me feel so welcome and for involving me in their community events and indeed in their communities. It was an absolute privilege to attend all of the Christmas Lights Switch On events, it was a total joy to see so many smiley, happy young faces absorbing it all and to me that’s what it’s all about. Thank you to all the community organisations in Mid Ulster who work so tirelessly and selflessly all year round for the betterment of the district. Your hard work and unwavering commitment is greatly appreciated and admired.”“I wish you all a very happy, safe and peaceful Christmas and look forward to seeing and working with you all again in the New Year.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Around  people attended the dinner last year and the church is expecting a similar number again. The meal and entertainment will be provided by church volunteers who will dine with their guests.The special dinner will be prepared by volunteers at the church hall, and the event is being supported by donations of food and money from the local community and businesses.“It’s a big thing for someone to admit they are by themselves,” Melanie Boyce who is coordinating the event for the church said.“It was a lovely event last year, it was really successful. It is sad that we have demand. I would love to be saying we have zero demand. Unfortunately, a number of people who attended last year have passed away.” A Syrian family are expected to join the gathering so that they can join in with their community, Melanie said.“It’s a lovely range of people and we have loads of people who volunteer on the day and just give up their day. People who came last year really loved it and that is just why we are doing it again.”The people who attend are not there all there because of financial reasons, she said. “The demand is coming from elderly people who are by themselves and middle-aged people who for one reason or another, the family has broken down and they find themselves on their own. These people are coming because they are on their own and they just want company. We are saying, ‘look, we are having our Christmas day dinner and we would love you to join us’. We don’t careyou bring your whole family or you are by yourself. It’s simply a day where we want people to come together.”The event was inspired by a similar event held in recent years in Cookstown.“Christmas is a special time of year for all Christians and for us it is about giving back as well. We want to show that we care about people.“Magherafelt is the sort of place where you could be quite affluent but you could still be alone. There are people who don’t have as much and I don’t want the thought of anyone sitting by themselves on Christmas Day. We didn’t knowanyone was going to turn up last year but people did come and those who did really enjoyed it and therefore we are trying it again. For us, it’s about getting the message out that there is nothing shameful in this and that is one of our biggest barriers. There are people who perhaps their families are living away and they are on their own and they are alone on Christmas and it is a huge deal for someone to say, ‘I am alone and I have no one  to share this festive time with’.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He attended St. Peters from  - and left with one O Level in English. This week he was awarded a PhD for a thesis assessing the readiness of domestically violent men to engage in domestic violence rehabilitation programmes. In the midst of the Troubles it was a dficult time for young people to focus on their studies.Maurice said: “For me, leaving school with one O Level and thinking I was stupid, to get into such a prestigious course and successfully completing it is a proud moment.”The Derry man is proof that le is about learning as despite leaving school with few qualications he immersed himself in study and has used it to help others through decades of social and community work.After spending some time on the dole, at -years-old Maurice began voluntary work as a youth worker and enrolled in an Addiction Studies course at Ulster University Magee.This coincided with work at Northlands Addiction Treatment Centre. Maurice believes alcohol was, and still is, the single biggest issue facing Derry. “The problem is that people don’t even view it as a drug, but it’s more powerful than most and one of the few drugs that actually damages the body just by taking it.”The heavy binge drinking culture that exists in Ireland is the source of many social ills, he said. “The main reason children are taken into care, neglect, is often down to parents having a drink problem.” googletag.cmd.push Treatment projects In January  he moved to London to work in a residential alcohol treatment project where he attained a diploma in alcohol counselling at the University of Kent. The following year he got a job as manager at the alcohol treatment centre, a post he held for four years.When planning toto live in Derry he believed that with a social work qualication he could secure a steady job and therefore applied for the professional social work training course at the University of Ulster.“The best thing about it was that it gave me an academic qualication and also a professional qualication which would allow me to be employed.“I graduated in  and started working right away with the Foyle Health and Social Services Trust in the Leaving and After Care Team, supporting young people who are leaving care and preparing to live independently in the community.”In  he, and local community worker, Frankie McMenamin, established the local charity, Zest, an organisation providing supportive care and counselling to young people struggling with suicidal ideation and self-harm. Maurice managed Zest for  years before leaving to pursue other interests.At the turn of the millennium until  he was part of the first Drug Arrest Referral scheme in Northern Ireland. The scheme was managed by the Western Health and Social Care TrustAlcohol and Dug Service and required daily attendance at the Strand Road Police Station. It was an innovative project through which all persons detained at the police station were offered support to address alcohol and drug problems. googletag.cmd.push PhD studies  In  he was grant aided by the Public Health Agency to undertake a fellowship at Queens University Belfast.His PhD involved “assessing the readiness of domestically violent men to engage in domestic violence rehabilitation programmes” in Northern Ireland. “A lot of men drop out of these rehabilitation programmes and what research has found is that when these men drop out they actually present as a greater risk to victims compared tothey had never been referred. “Amongst other things, the research established the men who completed the programme stopped drinking before or at the start of the programme, whereas the men who dropped out of the programme had continued to drink alcohol.“Because of the way alcohol affects the brain,you’re not drinking you’re far more alert and your brain can make connections and you can develop insight to understand yourself.“Butyou’re drinking during the week then it slows the brain’s ability to make sense of things.”He is now working to rehabilitate men who have been domestically violent. “We know prison doesn’t work and most of the men never receive the help that they need,” Maurice said. ‘Compassion’ When he ed to the WHSCT from his secondment at Queens University Belfast, Maurice began working as part of the Domestic Violence Team. Here he set up the first group-based and inidualised domestic violence treatment programmes run by the WHSCT. The demands entailed in establishing the new programme meant that it took longer than initially anticipated to finish the PhD.However, this year he successfully completed the PhD which is the culmination of eight and a half years of hard work.Sadly, his parents aren’t alive to share what is a high point on le’s journey but his children and other family members attended the graduation ceremony. “I’m really looking forward to the event, my daughter and son are going with me,” he said.Asked about the lessons he’s learned through his studies and decades of paid and voluntary work, he said: “No matter what sort of problems a person has, human beings have a massive capacity to change but you have to have the right support and help, which has to be provided in a non-judgemental and compassionate manner.“You can condemn behaviour, but not the person. You have to believe in the persons inherent worth and in their ability to bring about the change they need. Change is possible but people need the right support network in place.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I knew him from gigs and as a customer of Cool Discs when I worked there. More than that though I felt I knew him more through other people’s recollections of him and to deliver the eulogy I give you me and Mickey’s friends.Joe Brown said: “Derry sadly lost a man you don’t meet every day. There was nothing lying beneath, no agendas, no jagged edges. “A rock solid partner to Breige and an inspirational man of music, art and literature. I saw his band Idol Threat with The Undertones a number of times and became friends with him in the early s, going to gigs. “People were drawn to him and the inspirational effect he had on them. I heard so many bands for the first time through his record collection. I’ll always remember Mickey as a man who embraced le and had an incredible gt of bringing people together, loved a party and kept me from going sane Derry feels like a dferent place without him, every now and then nature conjures up someone very unique and special, who so many had barrels of affection for and who’ll be sadly missed by us all”.Mickey Rooney said: “His flat was always open to the outsiders, his heart was open to all no matter what creed or colour and his mind was always open to whatever experiences came his way”.Raymond Gorman said: “There was definitely no one like him, it took real guts to dress as a punk back in the day, it was a very violent time, Mickey was fearless and hated bullies. The last time I spoke to him he was enthusing about his latest music pourchases and gigs he’d been to. I think he’d be annoyed with everyone being too sad about his passing, remember him with the smile he put on your face when you met him”.Louise McIntyre said: “I first knew Mickey as a teenager growing up in the Brandywell, he was in my older brother’s class in school, I never actually got to talk to him back then as he was a quiet sort. “My earliest memory is looking across at Mickey’s backyard flat roof extension roof and seeing him lying up there with a small radio to his ear listening to his music, even then I knew he was dferent   cool. Several years later we crossed paths again and became a true friend he was doing best man at our wedding. He always remembered birthdays and special occasions. “Mickey stood head and shoulders above everyone  in more ways than one. He was an inspiration and a Derry legend. I somehow hope that he knew this, and that Derry will be an emptier place without him. Thanks for the memories Mickey xx”.Liz Brown said: “One of lasting memories Ill carry of Mickey was his genuine love and kindness towards his friends and loved ones. Like gravity, Mickey had an unseen force that pulled people together and kept their feet on the ground”.Paul McCartney paid a touching tribute in the Journal the day of Mickey’s funeral. “As the s began, you’d usually touch base with Mickey in the town centre on a Saturday. He had a band called The Idol Threats and soon the band I played in, Graffiti, ended up regularly supporting them. I don’t think I saw a local group as musically adventurous until That Petrol Emotion came along. It was a million miles apart from The Undertones and The Moondogs and Mickey was crucial to this process. He wasn’t just the drummer - he was the lyricist also. Just as the music was very involving and mysterious, so, too, were the words and song titles - ‘Lonely Beach Now, ‘Postcard from Abroad’ and the legendary ‘Little Green Men on The Moon.Mickey was a kind and generous guy, but also grateful and reciprocal for everything he received. He remembered everyone’s birthday and was always there with a card or gt. He constantly exuded a spirit of fun and that amazing sense of humour of his was just non-stop and incredible - you simply didn’t know what would come next.“Politics  He didn’t do them, and they did not happen in the many get-togethers in his legendary Abercorn Place flat. I think I can genuinely describe him as an “Enemy of Sectarianism”. When Mickey was cruelly affected by ill health in recent years, this sense of civility never eroded. So lucky are many of us for having this wonderful and inspirational human being around for many years”. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Since I began practising it, I have never been in better shape physically and mentally.“I found the method two years ago after suffering from chronic adrenal fatigue and depression. I wasnt finding answers from the doctors or the medication and I was fearing that this was the way things were going to be from then on.“But, then I came across the Wim Hof method and after just one session I got the first indication that something had worked in my body. After a week, I felt completely dferent and after a month, I’d never felt as good in my le.”So convinced is he of the benefits of the Wim Hof method, Deane is determined to ensure it is available locally. “I travelled back and forth to the Netherlands learning directly from Wim Hof and now I am one of only a handful of qualied instructors in Ireland. “I believe this can be a game changer for athletes and anyone of any age who is looking to make a positive intervention in their own health and well-being. It will also be hugely beneficial to singers, public speakers and anyone in need of boosting their self-confidence.“The Wim Hof method has been subject to a number of major scientic studies and the conclusions are clear regarding the improvements on general well-being, mood, anxiety and panic disorders, depression, heart health, inflammation diseases, respiratory system and even athletic performance.” He concluded: “It’s a simple method but the results are truly amazing.”Deane, who is also a human blueprint coach yoga teacher and breathing coach, now runs a company called PrimalEire offering instruction in the Wim Hof method. Every Sunday morning he invites people to the beach to explore the cold water under professional supervision and to explain its many benefits. He will be running a day’s funda- mentals workshop at DQ Fitness in Newtown- cunningham on December th, further details of which can be found through Facebook at PrimalEire or Aaron Deane. He added: “I have had the benefit of learning from the Dutch master himself but anyone can grasp the fundamentals of the Wim Hof method so why not come along, embrace the cold and change your le for the better.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A new PSNI recruitment drive is to be launched in January. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The origin tale of the lake, known as ‘The Death of Eochaidh son of Mairid” is over a thousand years old in oral tradition, but has now been brought up to date in a new telling by children’s author, Maacuteire Zepf.Liacute Ban’s story is tale bursting with colour, from giant horses and ancient gods to mermaids and monks. It tells of a young girl who is transformed into a mermaid when a magical curse floods their ringfort, creating Lough Neagh Six Irish-medium primary schools in the Mid-Ulster area have been working on the story with Maacuteire Zepf over the past months, writing their own creative responses and drawing original illustrations for the story.The young writers and illustrators from Dungannon, Coalisland, Magherafelt, Ballinascreen, Cookstown and Tirkane then came together at the Seamus Heaney HomePlace in Bellaghy earlier this month for a collaborative showcase performance of their work, to celebrate the project and to hear the story told in its entirety. The story of Liacute Ban is deeply rooted in the locality of the area, mentioning local places by name. References to the legend can also be spotted in many local place names.The project has been funded by a partnership between the Irish Writers’ Centre in Dublin and Mid-Ulster District Council.Martin Kearney, chairperson of Mid-Ulster District Council, attended the event. He said: “The story of Eochaidh and Liacute Ban shows just how rich and deep our local culture really is.

The X Box, the Playstation and Nintendo Wii offer an almost limitless choice of gaming s to enjoy inter-connectivity in a high definition world of colour.However,  years ago in , the new world of home video game consoles was a new monochrome phenomenon.  Atari launched the first home video games console in . The first company to launch a home video game console was the Calornia based form Atari. Founded in , the firm initially concentrated on designing arcade games. But as the decade progressed it became clear that the huge appetite for computer-based games was readily transferrable to the home.By , one of Atari’s founders, Nolan Bushell, employed an engineering company that constructed a console capable of playing the original games designed by the pioneering firm for arcades. The result was the Atari Video Computer System .Released in September , the VCS was priced at the hefty sum of around pound – the equivalent of approximately pound today. The first incarnation of the system included a console, two joysticks, a pair of paddles and the Combat game cartridge.There were, however, eight other games available to be sold separately that included – Air-Sea Battle, Star Ship and Street Racer and Breakout. Perhaps the most memorable of all the games of this era was Pong - the two-dimensional table tennis simulator. The game, originally developed as a training exercise in programming for an Atari employee, was one of the earliest arcade video games back in  and proved hugely commercially successful. A separate home version that could be played on a TV was released in .Players controlled game paddles by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen to hit a ball back and forth. The aim was to win by amassing eleven points. A point was won when one failed tothe ball to the other. The game was then included in the games for the Atari VCS two years later.Despite the obvious huge advances in gaming technology in the ensuing four decades the enduring appeal of Atari for people of a certain age remains. The Atari Flashback with the original games can still be bought today for around pound.But what other toys enthralled the children of the s  Launched in , the Nerf Ball was billed as the “world’s first official indoor ball.” googletag.cmd.push  The Nerf Ball sold in its millions after its launch in . The marketing team charged with selling what was essentially a large foam sphere, emphasised the safety aspect of the product by stating: “You can’t damage lamps or break windows. You can’t hurt babies or old people.” This simple message was very effective because four million Nerf Balls were sold in its first year in existence.  The Evel Knievel Stunt Bike was one of the most popular toys of the decade. Undoubtedly, another of the favourite and best toys of the era was the Evel Knievel Stunt Cycle.Ideal Toys launched its popular line of toy bikes in  and zoned in on the antics of the crazy American stuntman to boost their sales. Knievel made a total of  jumps on his Harley Davidson that year, including a leap over  vans at the start of that year. Whilst Evel is probably best remembered for his spectacular crashes rather than his successes, the sales of the toy did not crash and sold in millions.One of the few toys that made a full-blownto the commercial market  years after its original launch was Stretch Armstrong. googletag.cmd.push  Stretch Armstrong was relaunched  years after his debut in .  Introduced to the world by the Kenner toy company in , the muscular male figure made of laytex rubber and filled with gelled corn syrup allows it to be stretched from its original size of  inches up to around five foot before reverting back to its normal shape.If a tear developed it could be repaired with an adhesive bandage and instructions on how to fix Stretch were included inside the box. Hasbro who bought the brand, very successfully brought Stretch Armstrong back to the market at the New York Toy Fair in . Christmas, of course, sees us all indulge in sweets and the s was no exception. Cadbury’s honed in on a novel way of enticing children to want their products even more. The Dairy Milk dispenser spat out inidual squares of the world-famous confectionery for the princely sum of p. The mini machines were replenished by refill packs sold at stores such as the now long-gone Woolworth’s chain.  Cadburys honed in on a novel way of selling more chocolate in the s. The dispenser was also marketed on the basis that it had an added attraction of doubling up as a money box. But it’s suspectedthat after a while the chocolate refill packs were consumed without ever having seen the inside of the dispenser with the “saved” two-pence pieces retrieved and spent quickly on something .  Ideals Crossfire table top game was also extremely popular.  First to three goals was the aim in the table top game Crossfire in the s. The object was to push one of the pucks through the opposing player’s goal by firing small metal ball bearings at them using the attached guns.  Star Wars toys are still selling in their millions  years on.  The effect of the Star Wars film series on popular culture has been immense. But with the filmmakers initially dubious about the success of the first film in , manufacturers were seemingly reluctant to launch a toy franchise based on the film.As a result, Star Wars toys were slow to hit the shelves  years ago. When they did, the Kenner company found the demand was enormous and to begin with launched four figures. They expanded the range in  and effectively became a license to print money. But still demand often exceeded supply and the range was often hard to come by. As filming began for The Empire Strikes Back in spring  children were screaming for new merchandise that Christmas. And nothing has changed since.  CHECK OUT THE TOYS WE ALL GOT FOR CHRISTMAS IN THE s All that’s left to ponder about this range is the fate of the executive of the American toy company Mego who took the decision to turn down the chance to manufacture the Star Wars toy range. The firm established in , specialised in making toy figures and promptly folded in .  Girls World allowed aspiring hairdressers and make-up artists to practice their skills.  If you want to buy an original s Girl’s Word made by Palitoy in good condition, it’ll cost you around pound on vintage toy sellers website. The original cost was pound – roughly the equivalent of what a vintage version will cost you now. Launched in the mid-s, Girl’s World was a brunette or blonde model hair and make-up styling head. She had suction caps on the base so the toy could be attached to a table top whilst hair styling and make-up techniques could be practised.She also had an extraof hair inside the head, a small handle on the side of the base was turned to either make the hair grow or shrink back into the head, allowing her “stylist” to change her hair style orwithout resulting to a pair of scissors. It could also be washed and styled using “human products” without much damage to the hair itself.  Tiny Tears won a Toy of the Year Award in the s.  Tiny Tears was the must- have “hi-tech’ doll of the s. No other toy possessed the ability to wet itself or cry ‘real-le’ tears, nor a baby’s bottle from which the liquid disappeared to produce the aforementioned seepage. Such was the level of innovation of the toy that Palitoy won the toy of the year award for it. Sexual equality has never been an issue for the toy manufacturing industry with its dedicated adherence to commercial gain based on pandering to the pockets of the parents of boys and girls.In the s, The Bionic Woman and The Six Million Dollar Man covered these markets perfectly and won equally huge financial success which was ensured by the importation of the American TV series to these shores.  The Bionic Woman doll cashed in on the success of the hit American TV show of the era.  Starring Lindsay Wagner the show aired between  and . The Bionic Woman series featured Jaime Sommers, who took on special high-risk government missions using her superhuman bionic powers. The Bionic Woman series was a spin-off from the s Six Million Dollar Man television science fiction action series.Like its parent programme, The Bionic Woman spawned its own line of toys. Kenner produced a -inch doll of the character, with similar features to the Steve Austin version , except instead of a bionic eye the dolls head would click when turned, simulating the sound of Jaimes bionic ear. Accessories for the doll released by Kenner included additional fashions, and a Bionic Beauty Salon playset.A metal lunchbox for children was available, as was a vinyl story record produced by Wonderland Records. Kenner produced a series of stickers and temporary tattoos featuring Jaime Sommers inidually and with Steve Austin.  The Space Hopper was invented in Italy in the s.  Considered as much a symbol of the s as much as any other item, the space hopper was actually invented in Italy by a company called Ledragomma which special- ised in manufacturing rubber balls. Essentially, the hugely popular toy was a large heavy rubber balloon with two handles sticking out of the top and was inflated by a bicycle or car tyre pump. Children sat on the top of the hopper, held the two handles and bounced about to their hearts content.

Local writers, Ben Dillon and Liam Diver, took their spot in the limelight reading a few of their own poems that reflect the challenges le can bring. This reading may be a stepping stone to further writing and more performances from both Liam and Ben.Julieann Campbellread from her Guildhall Press publication, “Milk Teeth,” and graced those in attendance with a number of new poems she is currently working on.Damian Gorman is a quietly compelling performance poet and his rendering of his poignant autobiographical poem, “The Giant Basket,” touched hearts in An Cro Mor. Undoubtedly though, the evening’s youngest performer, Caitlin Browne, was the star of the night. The audience hollered their appreciation after her lively reading. Her father, Jim, in the audience, was a proud and delighted man.An audience member from Linsfort Drive offered this feedback: Why can’t we have nights like this more often ” Creggan Community Collective deserve both thanks and praise for opening their dwoors to this “Christmas Cracker.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The new community hub represents an investment of pound. million stemming from both Council and the Department for Com- munities through its Neigh- bourhood Renewal Invest- ment fund. A second com- munity centre is also at an advanced stage of procure- ment for the neighbouring Galliagh estate, providing much needed facilities in the Outer North Neighbourhood Renew-al Area, signicantly improving the community infrastructure and available shared space in the area. The community centre in Galliagh will be the first purpose-built major facility of its kind at this location in the heart of one of Derry’s largest housing communities.Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District, Councillor Michaela Boyle, said the new centres would play an important role in the delivery of community services in both the Shantallow and Galliagh areas.She said: “Investment in local communities is a major priority for Council and that commitment is evident in the signicant capital investment in new facilities in recent years,” she stressed. “The new centres will become vibrant and busy community hubs, facilitating new activities and the delivery of vital services within Shantallow and Galliagh.“There are great ambitions for the transformation of the city’s community areas as outlined in both the Strategic Growth Plan and the Local Development Plans and we need the infrastructure and facilities in place to realise these aspirations. I really look forward to seeing the plans move now to the next stage as quickly as possible.”The Department for Communities is contributing pound.m towards the two new community facilities.Sharon McCullagh, deputy director, Community Empowerment Division of the Department for Com- munities, said: “After many years of partnership working with Council and the local community in respect of both Shantallow and Galliagh community centres I am delighted the aspirations of the community can now progress to reality. “I welcome the appointment of the contractor for the Shantallow Community Centre and the progression of the procurement process for the Galliagh Community Centre project.“The Department for Communities through the Neighbourhood Renewal Investment Fund has com- mitted pound million to Shantallow Community Centre and pound. million to Galliagh Community Centre. Both these projects will signicantly improve com- munity infrastructure and space in the Outer North Neighbourhood Renewal Area. “They will facilitate continued delivery of community-based pro- grammes and services and an improved environment that will contribute to more confident and sustainable communities. “I really look forward to the development of both these projects on the ground.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The new community hub represents an investment of pound. million stemming from both Council and the Department for Com- munities through its Neigh- bourhood Renewal Invest- ment fund. A second com- munity centre is also at an advanced stage of procure- ment for the neighbouring Galliagh estate, providing much needed facilities in the Outer North Neighbourhood Renew-al Area, signicantly improving the community infrastructure and available shared space in the area. The community centre in Galliagh will be the first purpose-built major facility of its kind at this location in the heart of one of Derry’s largest housing communities.Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District, Councillor Michaela Boyle, said the new centres would play an important role in the delivery of community services in both the Shantallow and Galliagh areas.She said: “Investment in local communities is a major priority for Council and that commitment is evident in the signicant capital investment in new facilities in recent years,” she stressed. “The new centres will become vibrant and busy community hubs, facilitating new activities and the delivery of vital services within Shantallow and Galliagh.“There are great ambitions for the transformation of the city’s community areas as outlined in both the Strategic Growth Plan and the Local Development Plans and we need the infrastructure and facilities in place to realise these aspirations. I really look forward to seeing the plans move now to the next stage as quickly as possible.”The Department for Communities is contributing pound.m towards the two new community facilities.Sharon McCullagh, deputy director, Community Empowerment Division of the Department for Com- munities, said: “After many years of partnership working with Council and the local community in respect of both Shantallow and Galliagh community centres I am delighted the aspirations of the community can now progress to reality. “I welcome the appointment of the contractor for the Shantallow Community Centre and the progression of the procurement process for the Galliagh Community Centre project.“The Department for Communities through the Neighbourhood Renewal Investment Fund has com- mitted pound million to Shantallow Community Centre and pound. million to Galliagh Community Centre. Both these projects will signicantly improve com- munity infrastructure and space in the Outer North Neighbourhood Renewal Area. “They will facilitate continued delivery of community-based pro- grammes and services and an improved environment that will contribute to more confident and sustainable communities. “I really look forward to the development of both these projects on the ground.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The principal cast performed like seasoned professionals, bringing the iconic characters to le with flair and panache.Eoin McGuinness and Ellen McGurnaghan were outstanding in their comic portrayals of Gomez and Morticia Addams, while Annie Haughey and Eoin Moore were superb as the sinister siblings, Wednesday and Pugsley.The hilariously embarrassing grandmother was played by Aisha Oladipupo, and Year  student Conaire Laverty brought endless laughs as the grunting Lurch. Conn Murnin, as Uncle Fester, was a particular audience favourite and his departure on a rocket to seek the love of his le mdash the Moon mdash was a highlight of the show.The ever present long dead Addams ancestors were a tight and focused chorus including a stunning range of costumes from cavemen to flappers. All-American family, the Beinekes, played by Malachy McGrady, Elisha Tumelty and Tomaacutes Harkinleft the audience in stitches as they struggled to deal with ways of the weird and wonderful Addams family. All ended happily ever after, however, as both families moved towards the darkness and embraced who they really were.Featuring an exceptional live orchestra led by Head of Music Celeste McEvoy and music teacher Ciara Coleman, and with magnicent set, costume, lighting and sound complementing the breathtaking musical and dramatic talent of these students, it really was a show not to be missed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Ballynahinch.jpg","title":"Ballynahich Post Office remains  ","story":"RESIDENTS in Ballynahinch will continue to have access to a first class Post Office service in the New Year after all.Days after it was suggested that the current office in Lisburn Street would close temporarily on January , it was confirmed this week that there will be no break in service.The current postmistress will vacate her position on January  with M Retail Ltd taking over the service the following day.Mrs Donna Carlisle mdash who is the current postmistress mdash said everything will continue as normal in the New Year and that there will be no interruption to services.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker, who said last week that it was his understanding that the Ballynahinch Post Office was to close temporarily, is delighted that normal service is to continue.He said post offices are at the heart of communities and are used by a wide range of people, in particular the elderly, who enjoy the face-to-face contact with staff.ldquoBallynahinch is the districtrsquos third largest town and I am pleased that there will be no interruption to postal services, he continued.ldquoMany elderly people prefer to conduct their business at post offices rather than banks.

The boys are all training hard and we are working on a few dferent permutations for the decider, but it will definitely be horses for courses.ldquoTony McIlhone, Jack McLaughlin and Adam and Gareth George will be key for us in the final. Their experience should stand us in good stead, but I have absolutely no doubt that our young players will rise to the occasion, he added.Fitzsimmons paid tribute to Gerard Kelly, who led the team, to Harry Clarke Cup success last season with Kieran Sharvin and who is still in the management team.ldquoIt is a pleasure and honour to work alongside Gerard, who puts so much effort into keeping the club going. We have been friends for many years and work so well together, he said.ldquoWe have come up with a few ideas on how to get at Ballynahinch Olympic, but we will leave that information to the changing rooms in Meadowvale.Barry McGoran and Marty Sloan have moulded Ballynahinch Olympic Town into a force to be reckoned with, despite the fact that they rarely field with the same  every week due to first team call-ups.As a reserve team, people tend to write them off in the big games, but theyrsquove consistently proved that theyrsquore good enough to compete with anyone.The squad has done exceptionally well to get to another final, but they wont be happy until they get our hands on the cup.McGoran and Sloan like to play the same way as Killough and use the tactic of attack being the best means of defence and Barry feels that Olympic arenrsquot far away from lting the trophy.ldquoWersquore only half way there and need to stay focused. We got a bit carried away last year, but wersquove learnt from that. We need calm heads now, hesaid.ldquoKillough will go into the final as favourites. Theyrsquore a good side with some quality players, especially in midfield and can be lethal going forward, but so can we. We showed that in the semi-final and we have plenty of quality players ourselves.In lsquokeeper John McMenamin Olympic have an experienced custodian, who is a great shot-stopper and as brave as they come.A mixture of Niall McGlew, Mick Rice, Gavin McMullan, Thomas Rodgers Reece McConnell, Darryl Russell and Liam Sloan will make up a formidable defensive barrier with Simon Marmion handed the playmakerrsquos role in the middle of midfield.Shane Rodgers, Simon Marmion, Jack Roddy, Josh Fennell, Gary Wilson, Daniel Rice, Stephen King, Dylan McCartan and Connor Reid will vie for starting places alongside Marmion leaving the twin threat of Darren Lyons and Aaron McCaffrey up front.This pair compliment one and other perfectly.Both are comfortable on the ball and both are workaholics. Defenders canrsquot take an eye off either one as they will destroy you in a flash.McGoran believes his side are ready to cash in on the success of the clubrsquos first team.ldquo The club has come a long way in recent years and when you see the success that our first team is having its incredible, McGoran beamed.ldquoThe professionalism and dedication they show in training has filtered down through the club and it has inspired the younger players to put the work in to try and get to that level mdash and thatrsquos a big part of why our seconds team is doing so well.ldquoLast year ended up being a disappointing Christmas for the club, so itrsquos up to us all to make sure we put things right this time around..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Department.jpg","title":"Department ‘has just 8 staff members’ to fix all streets lights in province  ","story":"A LEADING government department has warned that it is not able to operate a full street lighting repair service across the district due to cutbacks.The Department of Infrastructure has revealed that its repair budget has been slashed by two thirds, down from just over poundm to around poundm. In addition, roads officials only have eight electricians to repair faulty street lights across the Province, with just five of these working full-time.The crisis facing street lighting repairs has been highlighted this week by South Down MLA Colin McGrath who has been contacted by many concerned residents across the constituency.He said that the government departmentrsquos failure to sanction work to repair street lights mdash which includes replacing faulty wiring and defective bulbs mdash is a major concern for many, in particular, the vulnerable and elderly.Mr McGrath said that while the issue may appear trivial and mundane to some, to a signicant number of others, itrsquos literally is a matter of personal safety.He said many are fearful of injuring themselves due to faulty street lights which plunge areas around their home into darkness.The MLA declared: ldquoThere is barely a street or road in South Down that does not have street lights which are not working. When there are several defective lights in a row, this creates problems.Mr McGrath said that he and his colleagues have been ldquoinundated with repair requests which are passed on to the departmentrsquos street lighting team.He said that while he is full of admiration for the local team who work tirelessly to resolve faulty streetlights in a professional and courteous way, they can only work with the budget they have been given, one which he said falls well short of what is required.ldquoI have written to the Department for Infrastructure and have found out that the budget for street lighting should be poundm a year. It is currently a mere poundm which is totally inadequate and falls well short of what the public expect, declared Mr McGrath.ldquoApparently, there are only eight full time staff managing the work of replacing and fixing street lights across the whole of North and this is wholly unacceptable. Eight staff from Derry toNewry, and Enniskillen to Ballycastle is not enough and represents a situation that demands action.The MLA confirmed that he has also raised his concerns with the permanent secretary at the helm of the government department asking that in the depths of winter and reduced daylight hours, additional funding will be made to address the issue.Mr McGrath added: ldquoWe are literally in the dark over what will happen next and need to see some solution to this problem.A spokeswoman for the Department for Infrastructure has confirmed that officials have discussed the street lighting situation with Mr McGrath.ldquoWhilst we appreciate his concerns, we have explained that in common with many other parts of the public service, the Department continues to face budget challenges and resources are not available to provide for a full street lighting repair service, she continued.ldquoThe Departmentrsquos current budget for street lighting repairs is approximately poundm, which is much lower than the pound.m that would be required to provide a full street lighting repair service.The spokeswoman explained that repairs are now generally limited to those that can be carried out by the departmentrsquos internal street lighting workforce, which consists of five full time and three part time electricians.She added: ldquoDue to the restricted service, outages may take much longer than usual to be repaired, with priority being given to hazardous electrical defects and group outages..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Devaney.jpg","title":"Devaney elected as new chairman of Down GAA  ","story":"DOWN GAA elected a new chairman at the annual convention in Newry last Wednesday evening.

But it is only the only project.ldquoThere is quite a lot we can achieve in other areas, on and off the fields of play. Coaching, refereeing, administration, club development and fundraising will also require our attention, he added.ldquoAnd we also want to have the ambition for our teams to reach their potential and challenge for honours. So, the future has real potential for us, but it will require a lot of support, goodwill and a unity of purpose across the county.

Like many other couples of that era, the wedding was a small affair and they spent a welcome few days honeymooning in Dublin.Alan worked as a writer in the Supply and Secretariat branch of the Royal Navy and soon needed to leave his new bride at home toto his posting. Muriel worked in the office of the now defunct Ulster Transport company.They met on a bus from Belfast to Portaferry and the rest, as they say, is history.ldquoI think we were both on the bus from Belfast and my mother, who knew Muriel, sat beside her and they began to talk and then we were introduced, said Alan. ldquoI was sitting behind and my mother then invited her down for supper the next night.Muriel interjected jokingly: ldquoI was supposed to be going to a shorthand class, which would have made my dear father much happier, but I mitched off and went to the Ritz pictures instead.ldquoHis mother had already spotted me and approved me as a likely candidate for her son as she believed that I knew how to keep house since I was doing it at home as my mother died when I was very young.Alan said that his motherrsquos approval of Muriel very much matched his own.ldquoI had clapped eyes on her before and I thought she will do very nicely for me. It was a private thought, but my mother must have picked up on it and had some insight, he added.Muriel did come for supper the next night and an invitation to a dance was given by Alan. They courted for over a year and more whenever he was home on leave.Alanrsquos parents, Rachel and Ian, were in the next room when Alan later asked Muriel to marry him and they celebrated with tea and supper again.ldquoI was completely flabbergasted but I would say that it was a romantic proposal, recalled Muriel. ldquoAlanrsquos father was great at tending to an open fire in the sitting room and his mother was a great hostess in making scones and cake for supper, so I think just after his father tended the fire, Alan turned tome and asked me to marry me. I think I said yes with a laugh as it was so unexpected.The couple spent the early years of their marriage in Malta where Alan was stationed and where the eldest two sons where born.While the family spent a short time living in Bangor, they have spent the last  years living Downpatrick where Alan went on to work for Radio Rentals in the town, and later in the British Red Cross Society in Belfast, while Muriel worked for the Saul playgroup and later in Downpatrick Library.The couplersquos love of music and going to the theatre, both in Belfast, and at the former Theatre Upstairs, in Irish Street, Downpatrick, was a shared passion over the years.Even today, they both love to watch or listen to concerts on the radio or TV, with performances perking up them up from a trying day or calling on their Alexa to play some Glen Miller music.Muriel said: ldquoWe both love the theatre and we both absolutely love music of all sorts. If therersquos anything that doesnrsquot suit us, we have a wee word with Alexa and say itrsquos your turn to chose.Alan added: ldquoIrsquove often said isnrsquot it wonderful that we have the same tastes in common and thatrsquos a great start to a marriage as well as a good sense of humour and a short memory.Muriel said: ldquoI think it did help that we did like the same things but I would say donrsquot leave it too long before you say sorry for whatever may have happened or been said between you.

Cllr Enrightrsquos assertion has been rejected by council officials.ldquoThe long-standing plans to publicly finance the redevelopment of public lands in Downpatrick town centre have been abandoned, he claimed.Cllr Enright said business representatives who attended the meeting in Downpatrick were not informed that a proposed road linking Irish Street with St Patrickrsquos Avenue as part of a new one-way system was not proceeding.He said such a scheme mdash which roads officials have said is not viable given the cost and the small impact that it would have on congestion mdash would have eliminated the need for traffic lights on all the main junctions and ldquomassively reduced congestion around the centre of town.Cllr Enright claimed that when he queried the decision, he was informed that the councilrsquos priorities are the Ballynahinch bypass and Newryrsquos southern relief road.He added: ldquoAll this comes hot on the heels of the scandalous proposed closure of Downpatrickrsquos visitor information centre in favour of Newry, progressing greenways around Newry but not Downpatrick and the abandonment of the promised Edward Street one-way system, which was supposed to have been delivered on a short-term basis in  until the new council revisited the roads priority list.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman said the local authority has allocated poundm to the Newry City Centre regenerationproject, with poundm secured from the Belfast Regional City Deal, not the poundm quoted by Cllr Enright.She continued: ldquoIt has been proposed that the development of Downpatrick town centre and the old PSNI station should be done collaboratively between local and central government with intervention from other public sector bodies.ldquoThis remains the case. However, the one-way system for Downpatrick town centre was considered by Transport NI who have advised that this is not viable.The spokeswoman also confirmed that a report was tabled to the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourismlast month which considered the future opportunities for visitor information centres within the district.She added: ldquo This report was held lsquoin committeersquo and no decisions have been made by Newry, Mourne and Down Council with regards to the closures of existing visitor information centres.

And while almost , people cast their vote, just over , eligible voters across the constituency chose not to go the polls.While Mr Hazzard was viewed by many as the runaway favourite, he admitted that he took nothing for granted and worked hard to ensure that republicans retained their grip on the Westminster seat for another term.Mr Hazzard said Sinn Feinrsquos commitment to stand up for people when it came to Brexit and give them a voice was a message that resonated with the South Down electorate. He said that in the light of the ldquoBrexit catastrophe, people stood up and put the interests of people in the constituency to the fore.Conceding that he expected his vote to decease, the ing MP said that he was delighted to top the poll, highlighting the need to get Stormont up and running again.ldquoIt is important that we have locally devolved institutions. There was a deal on the table last year which I thought was a good compromise. No deal is going to be perfect and all parties need to realise that we are going to have to give a wee bit to get back in, he said. ldquoWe want locally elected ministers involved in decision making.ldquoWe want to restore Stormont and are very keen to get a deal to move forward to restore the institutions to tackle the issues around health, education and infrastructure.The SDLPrsquos Michael Savage said the gap between nationalists and republicans across the constituency was ldquonarrowing and believed his party had a solid  on which to plan for future electoral success.ldquoI will sit down with the team to assess how the election went, looking at the missed opportunities and the things we did well and build on those, he said.ldquoThere was an opportunity tonight in South Down and some voters may reflect on that and sayonly we had done this or that. In the end, it just wasnrsquot to be. I have been around a long time and just have to accept that that is democracy and politics can be cruel at times, but I enjoyed every minute of it.Mr Savage added: ldquoA lot of people wrote us off in  and said the SDLP was finished. We have a lot of very good, talented young people coming through and, as far as I am concerned, we have a bright future ahead of us. I think what our results have shown tonight is that people have realised that stalemate politics and power splitting, rather than power-sharing, is not working for the people of Northern Ireland.The DUPrsquos Glyn Hanna, who saw his party vote decrease by just over two per cent mdash down from , in  to , mdash said he was pleased the DUP remained ldquothe voice of unionism in South Down on what had been a disappointing night for his party where, particularly in North and South Belfast.He said that the election count had been a ldquotough night for unionism explaining that he was not disappointed with his own performance in an ldquounforeseen election.Mr Hanna added: ldquoIt is important that the DUP remains the voice of unionism in South Down and it is going to stay that way as we have a solid voice and a firm Assembly seat. On the doorstep, people said they wanted the Assembly up and running and I think that that is going to happen.Alliancersquos Patrick Brown was delighted to increase the partyrsquos vote by over  per cent.In  the party polled , votes which Brown increase to , votes last week, placing Alliance fourth in the South Down pecking order, just  votes behind the DUP.The Alliance man believes that the only way to unite people in South Down is toa cross-community candidate to Westminster, suggesting that the surge in support for his party was because people are ldquofed up with the current situation at Stormont.Brown also believes that Alliance is potentially edging towards a South Down Assembly seat given the strong constituency base that it now has and that he would be up for contesting any future election.Ulster Unionist Jill Macauley mdash who was delighted to increase the party vote by just over three percent mdash rising from , votes two years ago to , this time out, was one of bright lights of her partyrsquos Westminster campaign.She was delighted to increase the vote at what she described as ldquoturbulent political times and said it was clear on the doorstep that voters are angry with the conduct of the DUP and Sinn Fein and their lack of delivery.ldquoThe clear message from the electorate was that they want local politicians to get back to work and restore the Assembly and the Executive. The current health crisis was also a major concern and the impending emergency that faces our strangled education system, she said.ldquoWith the UUP share of the vote increasing in such a toxic environment, it encourages me that we must be doing something right. I hope voters will continue to put their faith in the Ulster Unionist Party as a vehicle in which unionism can move forward as an inclusive and modern movement, instead of the politics of fear we have all come to know.Aontuacute, which was contesting its first Westminster election, polled , votes,  less than the collective performance of its three candidates at the recent Newry, Mourne and Down Council election..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Im.jpg","title":"I’m here to serve you%2C says Shannon  ","story":"STRANGFORD MP Jim Shannon secured another convincing victory mdash albeit with a reduced vote mdash for the third time in last weekrsquos general election.The overall Strangford turnout vote was also down, just .% of the eligible electorate compared to .% turnout in .While Mr Shannon topped the poll with , votes out of , valid votes, it was a %on his last thumping win when he was the DUP MP with the biggest majority.This year that honour went to Ian Paisley in North Antrim, who was nearly , votes clear of his nearest rival.A committed Christian and a pro-le advocate, Mr Shannon appealed to nearly half of the Strangford voters, earning a . % share of the vote in what was always a one-horse race.However, as he and his election team stood while Stephen Farryrsquos North Down win for Alliance was announced at Bangorrsquos Aurora Centre around am on Friday morning, there was an air of sombreness and distinct lack of celebration mdash perhaps due to news which had filtered through that party colleagues Nigel Dodds and Emma Little-Pengelly were in danger of losing their seats.The ing officer seemed to be in a rush to make the Strangford announcement as Dr Farry was unable to make his acceptance speech until after Mr Shannonrsquos victory was announced.Mr Shannonrsquos  year-old mother, Mona, who lives near Kircubbin, was there to support him, as was his we, Sandra.

As was that of SDLP runner-up Michael Savage.They were the only two South Down candidates who made their way to the podium to thank those who voted for them on a night when Northern Irelandrsquos political environment changed signicantly.With voters across the province electing a majority of nationalist MPs for the first time, it truly was a night of edge-of-the-seat political drama. Itrsquos often said that first itrsquos news then its history, but at the Belfast county centre news and history were inextricably intertwined.Minutes after the South Down result had been declared, the glare of the media spotlight was on official confirmation that the DUP had lost South Belfast.As SDLP supporters and the party faithful cheered loudly for Claire Hanna, the Sinn Fein contingent took a moment out of celebrating Mr Hazzardrsquos victory to watch proceedings.Hazzard was always the favourite for the South Down seat and used a sporting analogy to explain how he felt about the contest. He said favourites donrsquot always win, pointing out how hard he worked on the ground, emphasising that the was never complacent about the challenge he faced from the SDLP.From early in the count, SDLP members said that it looked as though their man was in with a real fighting chance and from the boxes which had been opened, the duo were neck and neck.While some of the Sinn Fein contingent appeared to be sporting furrowed brows early into the counting process, they were always confident that their man would emerge victorious and that he did, albeit with a reduced majority.There were suggestions that unionist voters in the Crossgar area had backed Mr Savage, who was clear throughout his campaign that he would not only be an MP for all, but one who would take his seat in the House of Commons.And while it was reported close between him and Mr Hazzard at one stage, the Sinn Fein man eased ahead in the race to cross the winning line, with the SDLP man left wondering what might have been.He had been given a relatively short lead-in time to last weekrsquos parliamentary pole and while pleased with his performance, he clearly felt he could have done even better and pushed the Sinn Fein man all the way to the line.Elsewhere, Alliancersquos Patrick Brown was one of a number of his partyrsquos candidates who built on their recent success at the EU and local council elections.The Westminster poll was viewed as a key litmus test that would rigorously challenge Alliancersquos recent election surge in a first past the post electoral system which did not rely on the votes of other parties.Mr Brown, who in May trebled his Newry, Mourne and Down Council vote in Rowallane, was at it again. His election agent and fellow councillor, Andrew McMurray, stood for Alliance in  and polled , votes, but Brown more than trebled the Alliance vote, a performance which helped his party leapfrog the Ulster Unionists to become the third largest in the province. Overall, Alliancersquos vote in South Down increased by an impressive . per cent, marking a remarkable performance by Brown.Most signicantly, Alliance now has its eyes focused firmly on securing an Assembly seat and while Mr Brown refused to be drawn on whether he would like his name to go forward should such a contest arise, there is no doubt that he will be the partyrsquos preferred candidate. He left the count centre a happy man his stock within his party continues to rise.Elsewhere, the DUPrsquos Glyn Hanna was pleased with his performance, despite his vote decreasing, and he didnrsquot rule out being the partyrsquos flag bearer in a future Assembly electionthis weekrsquos talks at Stormont fail to restore the power-sharing executive.Ulster Unionist, Jill Macauley, defied pundits suggestions that her party would not do well in South Down, by increasing the UUP vote by almost three per cent.Province-wide, the UUP polled , votes but with a new leader in charge the party did not produce the performance it had been hoping for.

He will need to take it twice daily from now as well as taking his antibiotics and being nebulised several times a day.However, Jen says that studies have shown that children with CF who take Orkambi from the age of six can live with the condition for an extra  years.ldquoThis is not just a Christmas present for this year, but for all the extra years we hope to have with Lorcaacuten, said Jen.ldquoWhilst I love Lorcaacuten to the bottom of my heart, these past three years have been very dficult.

As a result, my time was split between South Down and helping out in other areas including North Down and East Belfast.ldquoI know that working full time on an election campaign in South Down we can achieve an even better result. I also know that a lot of our voters did vote tactically and respect their decision to do so. Some of my friends voted SDLP this time which wonrsquot happen in an Assembly election.Mr Brown said many would have suggested that Alliance hit its electoral ceiling in  and firmly believes there is much more to come from his party locally. He said hisof , votes is not the ceiling and that in a next election, Alliance should be be aiming to hit the , mark in South Down.Mr Brown added: ldquoThe only way is up. The election results across Northern Ireland are a complete game changer.

David McConville‘‘I was born at home, my big brother was three and my sister was six,’’ said David.‘‘My mother came down the stairs and said ‘Look what Santa brought you’. My brother burst into tears and said ‘I wanted an Action Man!’.’’.ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button It may not have been David’s brother’s idea of a dream present, but for many parents a Christmas Day baby is the ultimate gt. According to an old superstition, ‘The child born on Christmas Day will have a special fortune’ .Christmas is all about one man’s birthday - and David, from Lurgan, is one of a very small number of people who share the auspicious date with Jesus Christ. So does it mean double the parties, double the celebrations and, most importantly, double the presents  It does for David. ‘‘I got my presents in the morning from Santa and I got my birthday present and a wee cake in the afternoon. I never felt like I was missing out.’’David, who works as a window cleaner, is one of six children, and every December  each of his siblings gives him a birthday card withmoney.‘‘They still buy me something for Christmas too,’’ he said. The largesse extends to his children, who make sure to spoil their dad. ‘‘My son Mark brought me to Sunderland for a Sunderland and Arsenal match for my th birthday. He paid for the flights, hotel and tickets. It was brilliant.Number of affordable homes at Corbys Priors Hall will reduceSam McBride: Stormont couldeven weaker and less accountable than before Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"‘‘My other son Luke makes me a CD for Father’s Day and a CD for my birthday. He’s been doing it for me since he was about seven. He’s now .’’David said he’s never thought about holding his birthday on a dferent day from Christmas. ‘‘It has never even come into my head because I’m happy enough.’’Being born on Christmas Day means there will doubtless be plenty of bad jokes like, ‘are you and Jesus twins are you actually Jesus Christ ’. It also means plenty of funny stories.David said: ‘‘Before the christening, when I was only three or four days old, my mum wanted to call me Gabriel, after the angel Gabriel. My dad and my godfather had been out for a drink to celebrate and they came back home and my dad said to me, ‘What about you wee Gabby’ and my ma said ‘That’s it, he’s being called after you’ - my da is called David.’’Many hold the view that Christmas could well be the most advantageous day on which to be born, asit comes with a guaranteed jollity, lots of feasting and a party atmosphere.But, of course, it could also be used by Scrooge-like loved ones as an excuse to halve your annual allowance of presents.Most of us enjoy being the centre of attention on our birthday, but those born on Christmas Day may struggle for the limelight.Instead of being the most wonderful, sparkly, tinsel-filled day ever, both celebrations may be diluted. It couldalso be a tad lonely - December  is the rarest birthday , despite being perhaps the world’s most famous day.Given its rarity, it is most unusual then to discover that the two most exciting days of the calendar year fall together for two brothers - who are not twins. David Murphy and his brother Noel were both born on Christmas Day, exactly six years apart. Noel, who was born in  and lives in Dungannon, said he felt a ‘wee bit annoyed’ that he wasn’t born on a dferent date. ‘‘Obviously you miss out on a birthday present and a birthday party because I got the both of them as Christmas. ‘‘Then as I got a bit older I realised that there was a fair good chance that I was going to be off school on my birthday and off work, so that evened it out a bit. Once I was old enough to realise birthdays and Christmases were just the same, I just accepted it and got on with it.’’ There mayhave been a lack of fanfare over his birthday, but Noel said his late grandfather never forgot to mark the occasion. ‘‘He lived with us for a long time and used to make a wee point and give me a few shillings or a p and he would say to me ‘that’s for your birthday’.’’ Noel added: ‘‘December was a busy month for us all. Obviously with my brother David being on Christmas Day as well, and our middle brother was born on December  which was also my mother and father’s wedding anniversary.’’Like many Christmas Day babies, Noel was bestowed witha Christmassy name. ‘‘My mother tells the story, I’m not sureit’s true or not, that whenever I was born and being carried out of the delivery room down to the ward, there were three of four nurses waiting there andthey all starting singing ‘Noelle, Noelle’, and that’s how I got named,’’ said Noel. ‘‘I was born in South Tyrone Hospital and in those days being born on Christmas Day was a big thing. The nurses had been waiting all day on somebody giving birth.

It boasts a unique approach to teaching vocational skills, as well as academic and sports facilities.In particular, one alleyway on the school site had seen sheds transformed into small businesses, which the pupils ran - earning qualications and gathering valuable work experience, with staff and students hoping to open it up to the public soon.ldquoItrsquos a bit like Diagon Alley, isnrsquot it  said Ms Wood. Here the school hosts its own bike repair shop, in the form of Spokes, a cafe, its own radio station - The Voice - and plans for a zero-waste food shop are well under way.Robin Hackett, head of KS, showed me around some of the buildings.ldquoThe cafe opened to our students around July time, and was fully operational and officially in September, for the new academic year, he said.ldquoIt opened at the same time as our radio station, with money generously donated from the Postcode Community Trust.ldquoNext on the agenda is our plan to open a fully zero-waste food shop. Wersquove been having talks with other similar shops around Cardf and here in Penarth, like Foxyrsquos, about how to do it.ldquoThe idea is that, because wersquore a residential school, it will give our pupils a place to shop for things like cereal, fruit, biscuits and so on without plastic wrappers or other waste.ldquoOur initial, short-term plan is to reduce our own, internal impact on the environment, butwe can get it up and running to the extent we want, we may as well open it to the local community. Imagine - popping over to the school, grab a tea or a coffee, do your food shop and get your bike serviced, all by our pupils.The pupils I spoke to were enthusiastic about opening their school to the community, and plenty of them had applied for shts in the shop and cafe.One proudly told me he had secured shts in the cafe, and while we peered through the window into the future site of the zero-waste shop, he made sure I noticed the poster for the Lego club. He was the president of it.ldquoWersquore hoping to open the shop in January, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore just waiting on the builders now.ldquoA lot of kids here struggle in academic settings, so this is all building good skills for the future. Our philosophy is, one percent change at a time adds up to a lot.We moved across the alleyway to the schoolrsquos music room.It was well-stocked with plenty of high-tech equipment, from first-class ampliers to cutting-edge keyboards. Excitingly, the school also has a state-of-the-art soundbooth on the way from Germany.ldquoWersquore looking to rent it out to local bands and others as a rehearsal and recording space, once wersquove built it up to the second floor, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore investing in better equipment, and wersquoll be holding radio production workshops with the local primaries, like Victoria Road.The school doesnrsquot just offer vocational opportunities, either.ldquoRecently a lot of pupils went to Belgium, to Ypres, said principal Matthew Burns. ldquoThe best part is they cycled most of the way there!ldquoOver five days, they would cycle a huge distance, and then ride a coach or the Eurostar partway. That way, they got all the way to Ypres, to hear the Last Post and lay a wreath.ldquoWe also put a lot of emphasis on sport, with a state of the art Astroturf we rent out to the community, and a great football team - we recently attended a tournament at Heronsbridge and only narrowly lost to the overall winners.ldquoOutside of that, our KS group are putting together a foodbox raiser for Christmas for those in need, and wersquove just had our drama and music department invited to put on a production for the Senedd.With IT suites, science labs and gymnasiums, this barely scratched the surface of what the school had to offer. Itrsquos no surprise the school has been so successful, with such close attention from its staff. As a school focussing on children with learning dficulties, the pupil number is kept low, with around  pupils attending at any one time. The largest class has eight pupils, with most having fewer.ldquoWe have around  day pupils and  at the moment in residential, staying in one of our four homes on and off the site, said Ms Wood. ldquoFor those children, we offer a  week-a-year provision.ldquoThe houses are lovely - we really want it to feel like their own home, their own bedroom, with their belongings.ldquoIt forms part of our relational approach - how we talk to our children and how we talk to each other. If we have a new pupil arrive here, the first thing to focus on is building a positive relationship with them.ldquoThe conversations are all about recognising whatrsquos going on and supporting them, in their own time.Judging by the smiles on the faces of staff and students alike, itrsquos an approach to be emulated the world over. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club. He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191106_8525_web.jpg","title":"leading from the front kpmgs johnny hanna","story":"Posted on Wednesday December  by Ulster Business Fresh from a three month sabbatical travelling with his family, KPMG’s new partner in charge, Johnny Hanna, sits down with Ulster Business to discuss growing an already-strong local professional services firm with global reach, developing the next generation and what’s needed to set Northern Ireland apart on the world stage Johnny Hanna’s new role as partner in charge at KPMG in Northern Ireland sees him take the helm of an organisation already in a strong position, but also one which is very much in growth mode.And with more than  years under his belt working across KPMG, he’s now been tasked with taking the next leap forward – building on its strong client base, tackling the new business landscape which lies around the corner, and growing the next generation of top talent.While a global firm, KPMG works with a host of Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes – having le-long relationships with indigenous success stories such as First Derivatives and Norbrook – while also working with global businesses with connections to the UK and Ireland.TALENTKPMG now boasts a Belfast workforce of nearly  staff. But as the intake of top new graduates and experienced hires grows, that number looks set to expand and develop further still. Johnny’s confident that the company will continue to grow at its offices at the Soloist building in Belfast city centre. He points to the benefits for KPMG staff of signicant collaboration and shared working opportunities with Dublin as part a successful all-island business now employing over  people. The firm’s Corporate Finance team, for example, led by Russell Smyth are the go-to advisors in the renewables sector when it comes to fundraising for new assets north and south.“It’s an exciting time for the firm,” Johnny says. “We have done a lot in the last few years, working with many new clients, investing in our new office and increasing our graduate numbers. In addition there has been a record number of promotions. I’ve been working closely with our previous partner in charge John Hansen on all of that as well as continuing to grow and drive our large tax team, an area of expertise which we’ve always been renowned for.“My focus will be about maintaining this momentum and ensuring we continue to offer the expertise and solutions which our clients need, which will drive our growth. That means being alive to changing trading conditions, increased regulation and a business environment increasingly uncertain, disruptive and complex”.A law graduate from Queen’s University Belfast, Johnny’s also a fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland, and a Chartered Tax Adviser– starting his career in Dublin with the former Arthur Andersen, which was later merged with KPMG.The Newry man became a partner with KPMG in  and has been head of tax in Northern Ireland since . The tax practice boasts around  tax professionals, most of which are dual qualied in tax and accountancy. “It’s a key dferentiator for us,” he says.“And while tax and audit represent the more traditional strands of business, KPMG has invested signicantly in new skills, specialisms and services arising from technological advances such as articical intelligence and cyber-security.”Johnny takes over his role at a time when Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK and Ireland, is undergoing arguably its biggest business and economic sht in a generation.“Brexit is just one part of it. We have been working closely with companies to prepare for Brexit, whether there is a ‘no deal’ or some sort of deal here.“We have had a lot of engagement with business groups and other stakeholders over the last three years to highlight our concerns and those of our clients. Wherever we end up on Brexit will definitely dictate the future trading conditions. Our role will be to help clients navigate their way around any new barriers they could face, as well as examining the potential opportunities which may arise from the UK’s exit from the EU.” ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Attracting foreign direct investmentis something which cannot be ignored here, and a dferentiator for Northern Ireland could help bolster that – whether it’s a deal which moulds Northern Ireland as a unique business destination in the UK and Ireland, finally introducing a lower devolved rate of corporation tax or ideally a package of measures.“Not long after I took over the head of Tax role in  we co-hosted a breakfast in our KPMG New York office with ious international businesses. At that time there was a lot of talk around the reduced corporation tax rate. There was a lot of positivity and enthusiasm in the room that morning around the opportunity for Northern Ireland, and I’m looking forward to getting back to those types of discussions.“Northern Ireland requires a range of tools to help drive economic success in the post-Brexit era. It’s investment in infrastructure and skills, initiatives on export-led growth, delivering a .% tax rate and some sort of devolution of income tax powers – we need step change initiatives which can really turbocharge the private sector.”COMMUNITYGetting the right talent is also key for KPMG, building and developing a workforce which is increasingly erse, as well as giving back to the community. That includes a range of initiatives, including the recent launch of a skills-based scheme which has seen KPMG staff volunteering to help children, from a wide iety of backgrounds, with their literacy and numeracy skills.“Our graduates want to do more than get their qualications and service clients. They want to know that what they are doing has a broader purpose and objective. They want to know about our commitment to the local community and on environmental issues and be proud to work for KPMG”.  “We are ambitious to keep growing the practice and have a fantastic pool of talent in Belfast at all levels to help us realise those ambitions.“Ensuring we maintain the right culture within the firm for our people to reach their full potential and achieve their career aspirations is incredibly important. I was delighted we were able to add to our already strong team with the recent addition of four new partners in Ashleen Feeney, Paddy Doherty, Neil O’Hare and Dominic Mudge within our Deal Advisory, Tax and Audit teams.  “My role is to ensure that when I hand over to the next partner in charge, we are in an even stronger position than we are today. That’s the challenge and the goal but given the strong team and our market position, I know that I will relish the opportunity”.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
