He is grinning mischievously and clutching a beloved Jumelle box camera that had recently been given to him by his father. In the next few years, Jacques will constantly record the world around him, photographing his bedroom, making portraits of uncles and cousins, and framing his older brother, Zissou, as he leaps into the air from a boat.Another 60 years will pass, however, before the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York hosts the first exhibition of his work, belatedly bestowing on Jacques Henri Lartigue the recognition he deserves as one of the great innovators of 20th-century photography.When the celebrated American photographer Richard Avedon saw Jacques Henri Lartigue’s work for the first time on the eve of the MoMA show in 1963, he wrote to his compatriot to express his gratitude: “It was one of the most moving experiences of my life… You brought me into your world and isn’t that, after all, the purpose of art?”The world Lartigue created with his camera was a reflection of the one he was brought up in as a privileged, pampered boy in a family environment that was both bourgeois and carefree. His father Henri, a self-made businessman, insisted that neither Jacques nor Zissou attend school, instead recruiting private tutors whose main aim was to keep Henri’s offspring amused. He once said: “I have plenty of money. My children should learn how to spend it.”Later, Lartigue’s name would become synonymous with a certain kind of ritzy glamour and elegance, epitomised in his countless images of his lover, Renee Perle, whose sultry beauty captivated him. In the 1920s and early 1930s, he was known primarily as a society photographer, shooting the rich and beautiful in the resorts along the Côte d’Azur, where he felt effortlessly at home. The life he lived seems to have been as gilded as the lifestyles of the film stars, models, socialites and playboys he photographed.In her new book, The Boy and the Belle Époque, Louise Baring concentrates on Lartigue’s childhood and teenage years, the majority of the photographs included having been taken before he turned 18. She traces a formative journey that begins in the early 1900s, when the Lartigue family lived in opulence in Paris and their country retreat in the Auvergne, and continues until 1914, when the outbreak of the first world war signalled the end of the belle époque.Lartigue’s life during this period pertains to the arc of a classic French coming-of-age novel. He was an instinctively gifted, voraciously curious prodigy who found his creative medium as a child, and was sustained by it throughout his formative years and into his adult life.From the start, it seems, Lartigue had one eye on posterity, creating photo-albums and journals of the things he witnessed. Aged 11, he photographed his bedroom from ground level, furniture and a mirror looming over his toy racing cars.More often, as the array of model racing cars suggests, he was drawn to movement, and, as a child, often photographed relatives and servants jumping off walls and over tables to his instructions. In one memorable image, he captured his cousin Simone taking a tumble from a homemade scooter. His most intriguing early subject, however, was Zissou, a daredevil and a dandy, who built and raced his own go-karts, tearing around the grounds of Chateau de Rouzat, the family’s country retreat, in goggles and a tailored suit. Zissou was the eccentric action man, while Jacques, as Baring puts it, was “a sensitive child who became a lifelong spectator”.Later, he would photograph speeding racing cars in a blur of motion and beautiful socialite women framed like exotic creatures in closely cropped compositions. When these images were belatedly discovered and exhibited decades later, they attested to Lartigue’s instinctive embrace of what later became known as the snapshot aesthetic, a term loosely applied to 60s iconoclasts such as Garry Winogrand and Lee Friedlander, who disregarded the rules of formal composition. Back in the early 1900s, when Lartigue embraced blur and movement, his approach was so singular that it amounted to what Baring calls “a new visual language of the 20th century”.On 29 May 1910, Lartigue, then 15, began a new adventure in a new setting, arriving at the Avenue du Bois de Boulogne in Paris with an unwieldy folding plate camera. His aim was “to photograph the ladies in the most outrageous and beautiful hats”. Back then, the Bois de Boulogne in early summer was an open-air promenade, where society women paraded their style. They often crossed paths on the Allée des Acacias with the more bohemian and even more fashionable women of the Parisian demimonde: actors, dancers, musical hall stars and “grand cocottes” – courtesans like Liane de Pougy, a friend of the novelist Colette, and Émilienne d’Alençon, a great beauty who would later become Edward VII’s lover.Although cold-shouldered in public by respectable members of Parisian high society, these demimondaines, writes Baring, “set the style, deciding which couture creations would rise or fall in the coming season”. Lartigue captured them all, often startling his exotic subjects with the loud click of his camera’s shutter. The results are fascinating, a record of a time and place when this sartorial exhibitionism was simply another ersion in, as Colette scathingly put it, “the bustling lives of people with nothing to do”.At times, Lartigue inevitably comes across as a proto-paparazzo. More often, though, he captures vignettes that speak volumes about the elastic social mores of the belle époque. His snatched portraits, for all the period detail they capture, seem, like his previous images of speed and movement, oddly contemporary. The blur, the often fantastical silhouettes, the sideways glances, the way he crops his images so that his subjects loom large – and even more exotic looking – in the frame, point to a singular sensibility that was at odds with traditional composition.Throughout this period, his love of speed and movement remained. He photographed the early French pioneers of flight, Gabriel Voisin and Louis Blériot, as they risked life and limb in an aerodrome near Paris. At the 1912 Grand Prix in Dieppe, he made one of his most famous early photographs, freeze-framing the rear of a Delage racing car as it sped past him at close range. The driver clutches the wheel as observers on the other side of the track appear as leaning shadows, their blurred outlines evincing the sense of motion that Lartigue set out to capture. In retrospect, all those childhood days snapping Zissou on his go-karts and his cousins leaping through the air seem to lead to this defining moment.If Lartigue was a photographer of the age of speed and modernity, he was not a man of action when it came to the war, which, for the main part, seemed to pass him by as if happening elsewhere. As France ordered general mobilisation, he retreated with his family from Paris to the Auvergne and the sanctuary that was Chateau Rouzat.“The war inevitably made us unhappy,” he wrote in a secret diary, “but it was happy all the same… I played sports and we still amused ourselves.” There is a single image in the book that suggests the unfolding horror: a platoon of marching soldiers silhouetted against a grey sky as a spindly aeroplane flies overhead. The war inevitably curtailed his carefree life, writes Baring, but “Lartigue emerged intact, plunging into life with the passions of a child, refusing ever to grow up”. That childlike optimism would fuel his life and his photography for decades to come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0814345af234de0659b1083e7836a90d04294451/0_1513_4253_2551/master/4253.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8a5fabf6d550a6bfea908be1bf52ccf","title":"the big picture on the road in post ceaucescu romania","story":"An odyssey around remote parts of central and eastern Europe led Fabio Ponzio to this incongruous sightBefore the collapse of the Soviet Union, Italian photographer Fabio Ponzio would look at a map of Europe and find his eyes always drawn to the east, to its “mysterious names, inscrutable frontiers and roads that ran on into unknown, prohibited lands”. It seemed to him that the iron curtain was “the ision between the conscious and the unconscious mind of Europe”.He first travelled across that dreamlike frontier in 1987, two years before revolutions reunited the continent. After the wall came down, over the course of a couple of decades, he drove determinedly through all the remote territories from which he had been excluded, with a tent and a stove and a sleeping bag in the back of his car, along with three Nikon cameras and 100 rolls of film. He slept in woods or in the homes of people he met. Once, in the mountains of Albania, the villagers told him that he was the first foreigner they had seen since two Italian soldiers fleeing the armistice of 1943.His pictures from those years – of weddings and funerals, of drunks and pilgrims, the homeless of the cities and the rural poor – caught cultures in the hinterland after communism and before consumerism. That period, as the hope of liberation gave way to endemic uncertainty, is the subject of his book East of Nowhere. Ponzio’s camera was drawn to incongruity. He took this picture in Romania in 1997, eight years on from the fall of Ceaușescu. The international licence plates and the open road stretching out beyond the mountains might promise new freedoms, but the sheep in the back of the car root this image in a stranger, older more unstable kind of reality.

I thought that if I built a circuit that could detect the magnetic field, and we wore magnets on our wrists, then it could set off an alarm if you brought it too close to your face. A bit of boredom in isolation made me think of that.”However, the academic realised the electronic part he had did the opposite – and would only complete a circuit when there was no magnetic field present.“I accidentally invented a necklace that buzzes continuously unless you move your hand close to your face,” he said.“After scrapping that idea, I was still a bit bored, playing with the magnets. It’s the same logic as clipping pegs to your ears – I clipped them to my earlobes and then clipped them to my nostril and things went downhill pretty quickly when I clipped the magnets to my other nostril.”Reardon said he placed two magnets inside his nostrils, and two on the outside. When he removed the magnets from the outside of his nose, the two inside stuck together. Unfortunately, the researcher then attempted to use his remaining magnets to remove them.“At this point, my partner who works at a hospital was laughing at me,” he said. “I was trying to pull them out but there is a ridge at the bottom of my nose you can’t get past.“After struggling for 20 minutes, I decided to Google the problem and found an article about an 11-year-old boy who had the same problem. The solution in that was more magnets. To put on the outside to offset the pull from the ones inside.“As I was pulling downwards to try and remove the magnets, they clipped on to each other and I lost my grip. And those two magnets ended up in my left nostril while the other one was in my right. At this point I ran out of magnets.”Before attending the hospital, Reardon attempted to use pliers to pull them out, but they became magnetised by the magnets inside his nose.“Every time I brought the pliers close to my nose, my entire nose would shift towards the pliers and then the pliers would stick to the magnet,” he said. “It was a little bit painful at this point.“My partner took me to the hospital that she works in because she wanted all her colleagues to laugh at me. The doctors thought it was quite funny, making comments like ‘This is an injury due to self-isolation and boredom.’”At the hospital, a team of two doctors applied an anaesthetic spray and manually removed the magnets from Reardon’s nose.“When they got the three out from the left nostril, the last one fell down my throat,” he said. “That could have been a bit of a problem if I swallowed or breathed it in, but I was thankfully able to lean forward and cough it out … Needless to say I am not going to play with the magnets any more.”Medical records from the emergency department said that Reardon did not have difficulty breathing, and denied the presence of further magnets up his nose.The astrophysicist told  Australia he had ruled out further experiments with the magnets and face-touching, and would find other ways to pass the time while at home.“I’m actually getting a lot of work done,” he said. “Working remotely is not that bad. We are also renovating our house, so I am building shelves, making furniture and doing some tiling.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43fb9676301d36a5a956870cff16158b91e30124/0_158_750_450/master/750.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1dc9773c4dd893c3bf4337193c7f3d9","title":"kids at home the books you should read to keep everyone entertained","story":"Timeless classics, hilarious capers and new adventures: a tots to teens reading list that even parents can enjoyOf course, good parents would have already compiled a reading list ready for the day when they are holed up for an unspecified number of weeks with their beloved offspring in the face of a global pandemic unprecedented in modern times. The rest of us, however, will need to play a little catch-up once we’ve finished setting up our makeshift home offices, explaining to aged parents that now is the time to keep calm but not carry on, shopping for immunocompromised neighbours, preparing slipshod lesson plans and secretly sobbing in abject terror under the stairs every two hours or so. So – blow your nose, wipe your eyes, wash your hands and let’s get to work!The suggestions and lists that have proliferated with adult readers in mind have so far tended to fall into two broad categories. There is apocalyptic fare those for people who want to lean in to the situation (everything from Camus’s The Plague to Stephen King’s The Stand, usually via a few more contemporary takes such as Ling Ma’s Severance and Emily St John Mandel’s Station Eleven), and there is escapism (generally meaning either crime fiction that brings the comfort of neat resolution, or books rooted firmly in pre-Covid-19 reality, rather than fantasy worlds).Children being almost like people, the resonantescapist ide makes an equally good starting point for their lists, too. In the former category, readers old enough to be aware of the current situation but not of an age or temperament to be frightened by it have plenty of dystopian fiction to devour. Beyond the primarily action-based likes of Suzanne Collins’s The Hunger Games series there are more thoughtful, nuanced portrayals of life under altered circumstances such as Meg Rosoff’s How I Live Now, Polly Ho-Yen’s Boy in the Tower or Gillian Cross’s overlooked After Tomorrow.The escapist list encompasses so much else that of course you’ll be able to construct it to cater as minutely to your own children’s tastes as you wish – though if ever there was a time to make sure The Lost Book of Adventure, with its mixture of stories and survival tips, was included, it’s now, and I would further note that Laura Ingalls Wilder’s Little House on the Prairie series also functions very well as a juvenile prepper manual.But one often overlooked provision must be made – funny books. Comic material for children has historically been rare (one of the reasons the now alas withdrawn Roald Dahl Funny prize was set up) but things are improving. BJ Novak’s The Book With No Pictures and The Day the Crayons Quit (plus sequel) will withstand multiple rereadings at multiple ages with no diminution of laughter, as will Daddy’s Sandwich by Pip Jones and Laura Hughes. Elys Dolan has been a failsafe in this house from picture book age – our favourite is Weasels, in which certain members of the family Mustelidae are bent on world domination – up to about eight or nine, well-served by the (WizardingKnighthoodRoyalty) For Beginners trio. The Dave Pigeon series by Swapna Haddow is a winner with that age group, too. Once children are into double figures I would be almost as frightened to recommend something to them collectively as “funny” as I would to an adult audience, but I must note that in this house Maz Evans’s Who Let the Gods Out? series can do no wrong, and that a book that has kept me laughing from the age of 10 and throughout the three and a half decades since, Private – Keep Out by Gwen Grant, was republished last year by Vintage Children’s Classics. I’m grinning as I type. A special shout out must be given, however, to Frank Cottrell Boyce’s The Astounding Broccoli Boy, which is a funny book … about a pandemic! It may yet become the Covid generation’s Decameron.It would also be sensible, of course, to sneak in a few books that approach the subject of anxiety and how to cope with it. Standout titles for the very young include Ruby’s Worry (part of Tom Percival’s Big Bright Feelings series), After the Fall by Dan Santat (with the irresistible subtitle How Humpty Dumpty Got Back Up Again), The Koala Who Could by Rachel Bright and Jim Field (about Kevin, my spirit animal, who cannot cope with change and prefers to keep clinging to his tree). Those a little older have the Sam Wu Is Not Afraid of … collection by Katie and Kevin Tsang to work through (the comfort of having a series, in any genre, to immerse yourself in is a particular bonus in stressful times). Charlie Changes Into a Chicken by Sam Copeland and illustrated by Sarah Horne falls under the “funny as heck” heading too.For children a little older than that there is the stunning wordless graphic novel Small Things by the late Mel Tregonning, about a small boy whose self is being eaten away by strange shapes. It was completed, after Tregonning died, by Shaun Tan, whose own book, The Arrival, about the dislocation felt by a refugee coming to a strange land, offers its own pertinent message. For the YA crowd, Am I Normal Yet? by Holly Bourne has a protagonist who lives her life with OCD and Boys Don’t Cry by Malorie Blackman has a valuable subplot about his brother having to grapple with anxiety. This is also a chance to encourage children to try new things, broaden their tastes, venture out of their comfort zones. And of course, reading aloud means that you can introduce them to more sophisticated books than they would be able to handle independently, which is both a pleasure in itself and a useful way of planting seeds of interest for the future. You could read them complex, evocative narratives such as Frances Hardinge’s The Lie Tree, or introduce them to the childhood books that shaped you, both classics and glorious oddities.In the midst of chaos, reading to a child can create a small oasis of calm, for both of you, so try not to think of it as just another task. It’s not about powering through the book as quickly as possible. It’s about exploring the highways and byways as you go. If the one thing this awful crisis has given us, it’s time. Books and children respond well to that. So let’s all take a breath, crack a spine and try to read through these very strangest of days together.Bookworm: a Memoir of Childhood Reading by Lucy Mangan is published by Vintage paperback, £8.99"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1956ea97fc40ad57a1edb07310ef7f8c0c709e78/635_700_3250_1950/master/3250.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29d6b6973dab8cf63b04d286ae41c8e1","title":"barclays sets net zero carbon target for 2050 after investor pressure climate","story":"Bank pledges to align all of its financing activities with goals of Paris climate agreementBarclays has bowed to investor pressure over its climate track record and announced plans to shrink its carbon footprint to net zero by 2050.The bank, which has its headquarters in London, has pledged to align all of its financing activities with the goals and timelines of the Paris agreement, starting with the energy and power sectors, and to publish “transparent targets” to track its progress.The proposal will be put to an investor vote at its annual general meeting on 7 May and is part of the response to a separate shareholder resolution urging the bank to phase out all lending and services to energy and fossil fuel companies that fail to align with Paris climate goals.The campaign group ShareAction – which spearheaded the shareholder vote – said the net zero commitment was a “milestone announcement” for the lender. However, ShareAction is calling on investors to back both resolutions, to ensure the bank actually pulls its services from the largest carbon emitters, rather than just offsetting them with alternative investments or services to other sectors.Barclays has been the top European financier of fossil fuels in the last four years and is the seventh largest globally, according to a recent report by the Rainforest Action Network. The bank has provided more than $118bn (£95.2bn) worth of financial services to carbon-intensive companies and projects since the Paris agreement was signed in 2016 and was the largest financier of Arctic oil and gas last year.Natasha Landell-Mills, the head of stewardship at the asset manager Sarasin \u0026amp Partners, a co-filer of ShareAction’s resolution, said: “The message is powerful: continuing to finance activities that undermine planet stability is not in anyone’s interests – and certainly not shareholders. This is groundbreaking and the board deserves to be commended. Other banks should follow suit.“What matters now is that the board sets robust nearer-term targets that leave no doubt about its determination to deliver net zero emissions by 2050. Shareholders should underline their support for this by supporting not just Barclays’ resolution but also the shareholder-initiated resolution at Barclays’ forthcoming AGM.”Barclays is expected to consult with groups including ShareAction before it releases detailed targets by the end of the year and will release its first set of reports on its progress in 2021.The lender had come under mounting pressure in recent months after a number of high-profile investors publicly backed the ShareAction vote. The resolution – which was filed by a group of investment and pension funds managing more than £130bn of assets – gained the support of the top 25 shareholder Jupiter Asset Management, Europe’s largest asset manager Amundi, the Church of England’s investment arm and Nest – the largest UK pension fund by members.In an interim update to its climate policy, Barclays said it would restrict financing for companies that benefit from thermal coal activities but would continue funding some companies involved in controversial tar sands projects in Canada that aim to cut their emissions. Barclays will no longer support new Arctic drilling and will not finance fracking in the UK or Europe but will consider other global projects.Greenpeace UK’s senior climate adviser, Charlie Kronick, criticised the policy, which he said contradicted Barclays climate announcements. “The whole thing stinks of hypocrisy. It’s nothing but an attempt to pull the wool over the eyes of shareholders, who rightly want the bank to end its contribution to catastrophic climate breakdown.“Barclays remains Europe’s largest financier of these planet-heating industries and refuses to face up to the reality of the climate emergency and their role in fuelling it. Until it realises that getting to net zero means ambitious action to phase out support for all fossil fuels, this newly proposed resolution is absolutely meaningless.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9860d5819beecc7efa43a47185556716ae4f156f/21_23_3461_2076/master/3461.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0fb8a28c3b655bc62907ad9dceca3d0","title":"coronavirus forces economics profession to leave comfort zone","story":"For years there has been a stubborn reluctance to adopt a more multidisciplinary approachWith the coronavirus devastating one economy after another, the economics profession – and thus the analytical underpinnings for sound policymaking and crisis management – is having to play catchup. Of particular concern are the economics of viral contagion, of fear and of “circuit breakers”. The more that economic thinking advances to meet changing realities, the better will be the analysis that informs the policy response.That response is set to be both novel and inevitably costly. Governments and central banks are pursuing unprecedented measures to mitigate the global downturn, lest a now-certain global recession gives way to a depression (already an uncomfortably high risk). As they do, we will likely see a further erosion of the distinction between mainstream economics in advanced economies and in developing economies.Such a change is sorely needed. With overwhelming evidence of massive declines in consumption and production across countries, analysts in advanced economies must reckon, first and foremost, with a phenomenon that was hitherto familiar only to fragilefailed states and communities devastated by natural disasters: an economic sudden stop, together with the cascade of devastation that can follow from it. They will then face other challenges that are more familiar to developing countries.Consider the nature of the pandemic economy. Regardless of their desire to spend, consumers are unable to do so because they have been urged or ordered to stay at home. And regardless of their willingness to sell, stores cannot reach their customers and many are cut off from their suppliers.The immediate priority, of course, is the public health response, which calls for physical distancing, self-isolation and other measures that are fundamentally inconsistent with how modern economies are wired. As a result, there has been a rapid contraction of economic activity (and therefore economic wellbeing).As for the severity and duration of the coming recession, all will depend on the success of the health policy response, particularly on efforts to identify and contain the spread of the virus, treat the ill and enhance immunity. While waiting for progress on these three fronts, fear and uncertainty will deepen, with adverse implications for financial stability and prospects for economic recovery.When thrust out of our comfort zones in such a sudden and violent fashion, most of us will succumb to some degree of paralysis, overreaction or both. Our tendency to panic lends itself to still deeper economic disruptions. As liquidity constraints kick in, market participants rush to cash out, selling not only what is desirable to sell but whatever can feasibly be sold.When this happens, the predictable result is high risk of wholesale financial liquidation, which, in the absence of smart emergency policy interventions, will threaten the functioning of markets. In the case of the current crisis, the risk that the financial system will reverse-infect the real economy and cause a depression is too big to ignore.That brings us to the third analytical priority: the economics of circuit breakers. Here, the question is not just what emergency policy interventions can achieve but also what lies beyond their reach – and when.To be sure, given that simultaneous economic and financial deleveraging would have disastrous implications for societal wellbeing, the current moment clearly demands a “whatever-it-takes”, “all-in” and “whole-of-government” policy approach. The immediate priority is to establish circuit breakers that can limit the scope of dangerous economic and financial feedback loops. This effort is being led by central banks but also involves fiscal authorities and others.But there will be tricky trade-offs to navigate. For example, there is significant momentum behind proposals for cash transfers and interest-free lending to protect vulnerable segments of the population, keep companies afloat and safeguard strategic economic sectors. Rightly so. The idea is to minimise the risk that liquidity problems will become solvency problems. And yet, a cash- and loan-infusion programme will face immediate implementation challenges. Aside from the unintended consequences and collateral damage that come with all blanket measures, flooding the entire system in today’s crisis would require the creation of new distribution channels. The question of how to get cash to the intended recipients is not as straightforward as it seems.There are even more difficulties when it comes to implementing direct bailout programmes, which have become increasingly likely. Far from being outliers, airlines, cruise lines and other severely affected sectors are leading indicators of what is yet to come. From multinational industrial companies to family restaurants and other small businesses, the line for government bailouts will be very long.Without clearly stated principles as to why, how, when and under what terms government assistance will be offered, there is a high chance that the bailouts will be politicised, ill-designed and co-opted by special interests. That would undermine the exit strategies for putting firms back on their own feet and risk repeating the post-2008 experience, when the crisis was brought to heel but without laying the groundwork for strong, sustainable and inclusive growth thereafter.Given how extensive government interventions are likely to be this time around, it is critical that policymakers also recognise the limits of their interventions. No tax rebate, low-interest loan or cheap mortgage refinancing will convince people to resume normal economic activity if they still fear for their own health. Besides, as long as the public health emphasis is on social distancing as a means of quashing community transmission, governments won’t want people venturing out anyway.All the issues raised above are ripe for more economic research. In pursuing these avenues of inquiry, many researchers in advanced economies will find themselves inevitably rubbing up against development economics – from crisis management and market failures to overcoming adjustment fatigue and putting in place better foundations for structurally sound, sustainable and inclusive growth. Insofar as they adopt insights from both domains, economics will be better for it. Until recently, the profession has been far too resistant to eliminating artificial distinctions, let alone embracing a more multidisciplinary approach.These self-imposed limits have persisted despite abundant evidence that, particularly since the early 2000s, advanced economies are saddled with structural and institutional impediments that have stifled growth in a manner quite familiar to developing economies. In the years since the global financial crisis in 2008, these problems have deepened political and societal isions, undermined financial stability and made it more difficult to confront the unprecedented crisis that is now knocking down our door.• Mohamed El-Erian is chief economic adviser at Allianz.

The supply of oil is increasing. The result – as even those with only the scantiest understanding of economics knows – is that the price of oil must be falling.And some. The cost of Brent crude – one of the market benchmarks – fell to below $23 a barrel in early trading, the lowest it has been since the US and the UK were making preparations for the invasion of Iraq in November 2002.What’s happening to supply requires a bit more of an explanation, because with demand collapsing the normal response of the big producers would be to limit output in the hope that would stabilise the price.This time it is different. Saudi Arabia has responded by turning the taps full on even though its own government finances will suffer from a lower oil price. Why? Because the Saudis are in a power struggle with the world’s other two major producers – the US and Russia – and is convinced it can endure the pain of a low oil price for longer than they can.In this global game of chicken, Riyadh is gambling that it can eliminate competition from the US shale oil sector – much of which is unviable at $20 barrel – and force Moscow into accepting the need to get serious about production curbs. The Saudis ramped up the pressure at the weekend by making it clear that they were not close to a deal with the Russians.That announcement was the trigger for the latest price fall, and all the signs are that the cost of crude will go still lower. With Donald Trump accepting the need to keep tough Covid-19 restrictions in place until the end of April, it is clear that the crisis is going to last for longer than originally expected. It won’t be long before storage capacity runs out.The current weakness of oil prices will not last for ever. Supply will go down as a result of US shale producers going out of business and an eventual deal between Riyadh and Moscow. Demand will go up, in part stimulated by falling oil prices, which lower business costs and boost consumer spending power.But for the tide to turn one of two things need to happen. The Saudis need to stop flooding the market and consumers need to be able to spend their windfalls. Neither looks imminent."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4efaaef554cae987f77ca43542930642c310238/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4fd941d00ae619c75a3b0c82595ef108","title":"coronavirus means we really are finally all in this together","story":"The realities of this crisis have punctured the isive myth of strivers and shirkers. If it returns, it will cause even more damageI saw a coronavirus banner the other day that said “Check in on your five nearest neighbours”, and I thought about Errol Graham.Back in January, just as China’s Covid-19 outbreak was turning critical, the story broke of how Graham, a grandfather of two and lover of football, had died aged 57. In June 2018, bailiffs pursuing him for nonpayment of his rent had found Graham’s body, which weighed just four and a half stone. A coroner’s report said he suffered from severe social anxiety, and had isolated himself from even family and friends. His flat in Nottingham had no gas or electricity, and there was no food in his fridge apart from two cans of fish that were four years out of date.Eight months before Graham’s body was discovered, his benefits had been stopped after he didn’t attend a fitness for work assessment. Among the items found in his home was a letter addressed to what news reports called “welfare officials”, pleading with them to “judge me fairly”.Graham’s case received a lot of attention, not least in the . But for all the awfulness of his story, it never really caught the popular imagination: at the time it was covered, the media was still aflame with controversy about the opinionated actor Laurence Fox and the fate of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. Graham was one particularly tragic example of something that 21st-century Britain has long been in danger of accepting as a given: a nasty, punitive benefits system seemingly run according to the inhuman rhetoric we have regularly heard from politicians – and still might be hearing, had Covid-19 not arrived.For about a decade now, the cruelties of that system and their consequences have existed in plain sight. We all know the basics: a population ided into “skivers” and “strivers”, people either ill or disabled summarily judged fit for work, joblessness usually assumed to be the fault of the jobless person, and the endless cruelties of the “sanctions” that mean many people have had their benefits arbitrarily suspended, leaving them barely able to survive. In February it was revealed that the National Audit Office had linked at least 69 suicides to the workings of the benefits system, and this number was probably an underestimate.Six weeks later, the fact that people in charge are suddenly speaking a language of solidarity and accepting that unemployment is a consequence of economics rather than character failure is something to behold. Whatever its caveats, Rishi Sunak’s “plan for people’s jobs and incomes” is welcome so is hearing him talk about people “not being able to pay the rent or the mortgage” and “not having enough set by for food and bills”. There is a truly astral irony in Sunak’s efforts being saluted by that well-known Tory sympathiser Bernie Sanders. Nonetheless, just about every part of the benefits machine that has ruined so many lives is, inevitably, still in place. We will sooner or later find out if it can survive this huge undermining of its basic logic – and either grind on or at last be changed.As my colleague Polly Toynbee pointed out last week, there will be a very large gap between the communitarian words of politicians and the reality that people new to benefits will discover when they begin trying to access universal credit. This is already becoming clear in the stories of day-long waits on helplines and the mounting sense of a new segment of the population finding that supposed “welfare” falls far short of what is required to avoid debt, bad housing, ill health and all the rest. Yes, the government has loosened some aspects of universal credit, working tax credits and payments for housing. The Department for Work and Pensions has announced that people receiving benefits will not have to attend the usually compulsory jobcentre appointments for at least three months – a move that, in theory at least, suspends the sanctions regime. But even these things could sooner or later revert to normal, with consequences that this crisis and its aftershocks will inevitably make worse.Outside of major cities, I have heard these things so many times that they have often seemed as unremarkable as the weather. In many cases, they are a dysfunctional sign of the resentments and frustrations sown by insecurity and want. They have been repeatedly stoked by politicians – most obviously by Conservatives, though rifling through the news archives throws up such memorable headlines as “Gordon Brown to crack down on benefit cheats in Queen’s speech” (from 2008). But to some extent, people in Westminster were merely seizing on malign views already present in the culture. The most pitiful thing to see was the acceptance of these opinions by people whose experiences showed how misplaced they were. I remember going to the Cheshire town of Warrington eight years ago and, watched by press officers from the Department of Work and Pensions, interviewing a 27-year-old man who had just endured nine months of unemployment. He said he had been averaging 25 to 30 job applications a week, most of which had not even got a reply. “I think I should have applied for more,” he said. “I should have tried more. When you’re feeling down, you start blaming the world for your mistakes … You feel the world owes you. And it doesn’t.”If millions of people are suddenly staring into the most uncertain future imaginable, and 500,000 people are suddenly applying for universal credit, will those ideas survive? Put another way, what will happen to the beliefs and prejudices that have defined so much of the last 10 to 15 years, encouraged by politicians chasing votes: mutual suspicion, a manic belief in “personal responsibility”, and the very British tendency to focus your furies on the people down the street?In his capacity as a newspaper editor, the former chancellor George Osborne last week commissioned a special back page of London’s Evening Standard emblazoned with the slogan “London stands together”. God knows, in times as dreadful as these our capital city could do with as much solidarity and mutual care as it can get. But I also wonder about the infamous speech he made in 2012, all cheap misanthropy and cynicism: “Where is the fairness, we ask, for the shift worker, leaving home in the dark hours of the early morning, who looks up at the closed blinds of their next-door neighbour sleeping off a life on benefits?” While imploring the young and strong to stay in their homes in the interests of the old, infirm and vulnerable, we now want those same neighbours to be embracing their common humanity, and checking on each other’s welfare. We had better hope they will."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b7ad9bccf690f487d67b3bfd5135dc1ea385dee/0_164_5780_3468/master/5780.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b27f5737c49b3b0d2f0702e66a7cfca","title":"the guardian view on covid 19 and politics institutionally vulnerable","story":"British government and parliamentary democracy are trapped in outdated buildings and habits. The coronavirus has exposed the need to rethink how they workLots of things about modern politics would surprise William Gladstone if the 19th-century Liberal prime minister was unexpectedly reincarnated into the Britain of 2020. Things like press conferences, video links and female MPs would all catch him out. Gladstone would, though, be reassured by one thing. He would easily be able to find his way around Westminster. That’s because the corridors of power in which politics, parliament and government are conducted in 2020 are remarkably unchanged since he died in 1898. The warren of staircases and rooms in 10 Downing Street and the cramped Commons chamber, with MPs jostling through the ision lobbies, would all be familiar to him.Whether Britain benefits or suffers from its traditionalised habits and settings of politics is a recurrent question. But the Covid-19 pandemic poses it in a new way. Parliament went on sitting through world wars and financial crises. Gladstone himself sat through the Great Stink of the summer of 1858, when the Thames became a sewer. But a modern pandemic that has made human proximity unsafe has meant that parliament cannot sit at all, and that MPs cannot do their fundamental job. Business in the chamber became a ghostly charade. Voting by crowding into the aye and no lobbies was deemed too dangerous to attempt. At the height of a national crisis, therefore, many of the checks and balances on government, and parliamentary democracy itself, have effectively collapsed. These issues must be addressed before parliament returns on 21 April.Now the Covid-19 virus has penetrated to the heart of government too. Last Friday, the three most important people leading the fight against the pandemic all went into self-isolation. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, and the chief medical officer for England, Chris Whitty, have all been put out of action. So has the Scottish secretary, Alister Jack. We wish them all well and a full recovery. But the disruption at the top of government is huge. The virus has done what the Luftwaffe and the IRA could not. It has made the work of leading the nation in an emergency significantly harder than it was already. When a government has just taken extraordinary powers to impose its rule, this is a particularly bad time to suffer that sort of hit.None of this is to imply that all would be well if only Britain’s government and parliament conducted their business in airy modern buildings with wider corridors, state-of-the-art health and safety provisions, and better designed workspaces. Berlin has spacious, modern government buildings of this kind, but Angela Merkel is having to self-isolate nevertheless. Prime ministers have also been stricken in past emergencies. In the first world war, David Lloyd George spent nine days with influenza in a temporary hospital inside Manchester town hall during the 1918 epidemic. In the second, Winston Churchill had a heart attack in late 1941 and serious pneumonia 15 months later. The reality is that the world cannot be designed, or politics conducted, without risk.Nevertheless, there are lessons to consider and apply. Politics, like the health service, needs the best possible circumstances for it to do its job. The buildings should be more suitable. New ways, like electronic voting, must be prioritised. Before the pandemic, there was already widespread discussion about the adequacy of the institutions of British government and democracy, including their centralisation in London. Spurning a more imaginative modern approach, plans are under way to move parliament into a recreation of the existing chamber while the crumbling Palace of Westminster is refurbished at a cost of at least £4bn, starting in 2025. The Covid-19 pandemic poses questions about that strategy which have to be examined. Many other aspects of public policy will have to be reconsidered when this crisis is over. The ways – and the places – in which we do politics must be part of that rethink too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5c1e47a88fee212a0549644ee678a6417b94209/2_0_1352_811/master/1352.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=e0e8489404e1d1cf8638b917e5f026ef","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of ambience","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘ambience’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘ambience’.Share your photos of what ambience means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 1 April at 10am.

If you have picked 2020 as the year to get hooked on cryptic crosswords, we are here for you.For beginners: I have been asked to collect in one place all of the friendly explainers we have done on how cryptic clues work – and here it is. stable has two puzzles that aim to let beginners win after a small and enjoyable struggle: the quiptic and Everyman.Next, allow me to show you around.We usually kick off with some topical clues from across the broadsheets, often wry observations about what is going on in the rest of the paper.We won’t be doing that today.Instead, hereare a couple of clues from recent themed puzzles. And for each, there is an explanation of both halves of the clue (cryptic clues offer, in either order, a definition of the answer and a little recipe for its letters).The setter Picaroon (whom we interviewed here) has a recent prize puzzle in the  – you can also peer at its annotated solution – which announced its theme in the entry down the middle:There you have a definition of GUEST BEERS and some wordplay to get you to the same phrase. And knowing that 10 of the other entries are also the names of beers is a little extra help. Picaroon is also a novelist – that won’t help with the solve, but it’s good to know.(Incidentally, the  – among, I suspect, other newspapers – is pausing the arguably non-essential business of sending out prizes for prize puzzles such as this one.)And here’s a clue from the Financial Times’ Gozo (whom we interview here):The wordplay is based on MESSI the entry is MESSIAH. That is not part of the theme if you print the puzzle out, you will see that all the across entries are examples of … something. I’ll leave it at that. Incidentally, Gozo is also the Spectator’s puzzle editor. Again, you don’t need to know that, but it’s nice to be able to picture these people as … actual people.Around these parts on a Monday, we next tend to find some entry or part of a clue that is an interesting or pleasing word. For example, here’s Qaos (whom we interviewed here) with a clue in the :… for the entry RAT. It’s no great mystery why an informer might be called a rat, but grass? First, there was “shop”, in the 16th-century sense of having someone imprisoned. Then a person who might cause that imprisonment to happen was a “shopper”. Next comes our old friend Cockney rhyming slang, changing “shopper” to “grasshopper”, finally shortened to “grass”.Now, this is not quite as interesting or pleasing as the story of “Lord and Master”, which, as we discovered, is rhyming slang for “plaster”, short for “plaster of Paris”, rhyming slang for “Aris”, short for “Aristotle”, rhyming slang for “bottle”, short for “bottle and glass”, rhyming slang for “arse”. But it’s nevertheless always pleasing to find Cockney slang unmoored and in disguise. “Syrup” for wig (“syrup of fig”), for example – or “loaf” for head (“loaf of bread”).And at this point, we turn our attention to our cluing competition. This time, we are looking for clues for another piece of unmoored Cockney slang. Apparently from “plinkety-plonk” for “vin blanc”, reader, how would you clue PLONK?Thanks for your clues for TORTILLA. Thank you also for the reasons as to why “tortilla” means so many different things. Beginners, feel free to skip this section otherwise know that we semi-seriously give out an audacity award for such clues as PeterMooreFuller’s “Cómo el señor Carroll cocinó Tortuga de Sevilla, frita con papas y huevos”.The runners-up this time are Dunnart, who hid the answer in “Means to keep beans – in refrigerator ’til later” and Alberyalbery, who uses initial letters in “From the front’s the only reason that I look like a bit of a dish” the winner is Phitonelly, who explains the working of “In the outskirts of Tijuana men work in the fields to provide the bread on the table”.Kludos to Phiton please leave entries for this fortnight’s competition, and your picks from the broadsheet cryptics, below.Add BRAN to DISH and you get BRANDISH from a neat little three-word clue.

I wanted to know what I didn’t know about movies in 1940. I wanted an adventure. I feel alive when I’m discovering something new.My first try was Son of Ingagi, a schlocky African American horror flick about a woman who keeps an ape-man in her basement. It is inept and visually flat, and I got a kick out of it as a predecessor of blaxploitation.Next was a Russian family film, Vasilisa the Beautiful, which starts bucolic then spirals off into the magic realms of a gnarly forest, backward walking cows, a rat man and a massive three headed dragon. It’s naively, fantastically charming and extravagant.My third choice from 1940 is a masterpiece: Mikio Naruse’s Travelling Actors, a poetic comedy about two kabuki performers playing the front and back of a horse. The fourth was even more of a discovery, a beautiful film about a little girl who gets lost in Moscow. Streets ahead of the Shirley Temple films of the same period, it was directed by one of the first female film-makers, Tatyana Lukashevich, and ends with the line: “Mama, let’s get lost together tomorrow.” Wow.Next up for me is the Austrian musical Operetta, directed by Willi Forst. I love getting lost in 1940. Mexico, Japan, the US, Britain, France, Russia, India – so many countries were making films then. Often they were comedies, or utopian stories about everyday life. I feel I’m travelling the world from my sofa, just as I did as a boy when the movie magic casement first opened up to me on TV.If these discoveries continue, if my picture of 1940 builds, then I think I know what tattoo I’ll get when the crisis ends: “40.” This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

But to be honest, I think the real reason that I never saw 2001 is that I’m just not very science-y. The thought of infinite space does not fill me with a sense of awe. I did keep meaning to see it, but then well, I never did. And the funny thing is, I understood the pop culture parodies without having watched it.I wouldn’t say I’ve ever lied about it. But I’ve definitely nodded along as someone banged on about the psychotic computer HAL 9000 or tripping off their nut while watching 2001. My partner doesn’t know I haven’t seen it. If I’d told him on the night we met and talked non-stop for two hours about films, would he still have asked for my number?Anyway, thank you  for making me watch 2001: A Space Odyssey. Going to the cinema was not an option so I rented it on Google Play and watched on an ancient projector. And, what can I say? It’s a bloody masterpiece. I watched the opening Dawn of Man sequence in wonder at this perfect image of the spark of human consciousness. What fun Kubrick would have had, I thought, with Andy Serkis’s motion capture technology. Yet his society of human ancestors (played by mimes in furry suits) is perfect. The colour, the extravagance of all those beautiful space sets, what a vision of a future. I still have the imagination of a potato when it comes to space but I loved this movie.What I will say is that 2001 does not work as escapism. I usually like a film with big long expanses of silence to get lost in. I’m quite partial to a bit of uncompromising slowness. But right now, my brain is 50 miles a minute. Concentrating on anything for more than 43 seconds is impossible. The film’s sense of emptiness made me edgy. But I’ll be back, when cinemas reopen.Funnily enough, I watched 2001 with headphones on while my toddler napped with a fever in bed next to me. She woke up right at the end, at the bit where the freaky big baby in a bubble hovers next to the moon. She was transfixed – the moon and babies are two of her favourite things. So, who knows, maybe for her it will be a film she remembers watching at an impressionable age."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00651cab8a5718c08580a49d2282a36c97de98e7/0_590_8031_4820/master/8031.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a78a48611a875791a7913158c2eb5f9","title":"rachel roddy recipe for spaghetti with lemon basil and breadcrumbs","story":"A surfeit of citrus leads to a classic Sicilian pasta dish that’s easy to rustle up at homeThere were grapefruits the size of small footballs and limequats like acorns smooth-skinned, sweet oranges and bitter ones with bumps four types of mandarin, each with more seeds than the next pale and pendulous pomelo ...In all, there were 133 fruits and 28 varieties of citrus, all windfalls from the botanical garden in Palermo that had been sent to a cookery school for a taste workshop. Fabrizia Lanza, who was in charge at the school, reminded us that while it was a sensory session, not a lesson in citrus taxonomy, it was worth keeping in mind that most modern varieties are hybrids of three ancestral fruits: mandarin, pomelo and citron. We stood next to a huge table, each of the 28 varieties on one plate, one fruit cut open, the plates spread all over the table for what felt like a mad, aromatic tea party.We pressed, sniffed, scratched, squeezed, tasted and winced. I was reminded of being eight years old in the John Lewis perfume department, and while Mum talked intently to a heavenly assistant, I would spray myself and my clothes with as many samples as possible, and then feel as if I was going to keel over. What was interesting, though, was how quickly we acclimatised to the collective tornado of citrus scent, after a while finding it hard to smell anything, never mind define it. The solution was to go outside. Five minutes in the fresh air was all that was needed to recalibrate and appreciate the tidal wave of essential oils when you walked back in.At the end of the session we pushed the plates to one end of the table, ready to be sorted into piles: one for marmalade, one for preserving in sugar, one for the pigs – or we could take as much as we wanted. I was flying back to Rome the next morning, with hand luggage, which meant I had to resist my hoarding desire and pick just five.On the plane I pushed my bag under the seat in front. It was close and warm, so a few minutes later, I took my jumper off, and leant down to unzip my bag and shove my coat in it. The scent of the citrus rushed up at my face, and the woman’s next to me, too – she was delighted. So I pulled out my pompia fruit to show her. I had grabbed the fruit quickly the day before, noticing a strange ridge on it, but not taking it in completely. Now I did – we did. The cricket ball-sized fruit, with its yellowy-orange skin and wide open pores, had not just a ridge, but a sort of split, and a swelling, a tiny growth. There were no two ways about it even the shyest could not deny it – and especially not the delightful Sicilian octogenarian next to me: my citrus had a vagina.Back home, it sat for three days in pride of place on the top of the fruit bowl, and every day I took more delight in my fruit. On the fourth day, one side felt soft – it was too beautiful to waste, so that night we had a slice in our gin and tonic. The next day, with the rest, I made one one of my favourite dishes: spaghetti with lemon, basil and breadcrumbs for everyday grit.Serves 41 large lemon100ml olive oil120g parmesan, gratedSalt and black pepper1 handful basil leaves40g fine dry breadcrumbs400g spaghettiPut a large pan of salted water on to boil for the spaghetti. Prepare the breadcrumbs: heat a little olive oil in a pan and add the crumbs, along with a pinch of salt, pushing them around so they are toasted and smell like a digestive biscuit. Pull from the heat and tip into a bowl.Once the water boils, add the pasta and cook until al dente.Meanwhile, grate the zest from the lemon and then squeeze the juice from it – you want four tablespoons. Tear the basil into little pieces.In a large warm bowl, whisk together the juice and zest with the olive oil, parmesan, and salt and pepper to taste.Either drain the pasta, saving some of the cooking water, or use tongs to lift the spaghetti directly into the lemon bowl. Toss thoroughly, add the basil, toss again, then serve immediately, passing around the crumbs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c7ebbbcbbd90dec01a762570a4b057e660e650b/0_2606_5792_3475/master/5792.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1c08605fdf90373cd92420e6a7fed57","title":"thomasina miers recipe for sprouting broccoli tagliatelle","story":"Hot pasta dressed with broccoli in a carbonara-style cheese and anchovy sauce If ever there was a need for simple food, the time is now. Sprouting broccoli is bang in season, so all over the shops and markets right now. It is full of essential nutrients, making it perfect for feeding a nation of children who face home-schooling for the foreseeable future. Here I cut the broccoli into ribbons so it folds and disappears into the piles of similarly shaped pasta. That, and the insanely silky, cheesy sauce, should win over many a picky child and get them eating their greens.This beautiful sauce needs a little time on the stove, but children can help stir while you prepare the broccoli.2 garlic cloves, crushed with a little salt300g creme fraiche, or soured cream or double cream with a small squeeze of lemon6 anchovy fillets, finely chopped2 egg yolks140g pecorino or parmesan, plus extra to serve500g tagliatelle or other long pasta200g purple sprouting broccoli spears, trimmed and cut into lengthways strips, or normal broccoli or even cauliflowerTo make the sauce, you will need to make a bain marie with a bowl that can comfortably fit on top of a saucepan.Rub the crushed garlic around the bowl, then add the creme fraiche, anchovies, egg yolks and cheese. Fill the saucepan with a few inches of water and sit the bowl on top, making sure the water doesn’t touch the bottom of the bowl. Bring the water to a simmer and stir the ingredients for 15-20 minutes, until the sauce thickens – it will loosen first and then become thicker, but it does need a little patience. Taste and season with a salt and lots of freshly ground black pepper, and keep warm.While you are making the sauce, prep the broccoli. Trim the ends and peel any of the tougher stalks, then slice the rest into slender strips to mimic the shape of the tagliatelle.Bring a large pan of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta according to the packet instructions, adding the broccoli for the last three minutes until it’s completely tender. Drain both, keeping back half a cup of the pasta water, then tip both pasta and broccoli into the sauce bowl, and stir well so that every strand is covered. Wait for a minute and then add a splash of the pasta water if necessary, to loosen things up. Check for seasoning again and serve on hot plates with a little extra cheese.The sauce is great folded into leftover risotto to make cheesy arancini balls.

He was a source of joy in an era of severe decline, one which saw the club relegated twice in two years and left amid the muck and nettles of England’s third tier. They were the worst of times but from 1995-1998 the fans at least had ‘the Georgian Maradona’, a midfielder whose impact was such that when he departed to Ajax, some of those who had watched him light up Maine Road simply could not let go. They had to see him, to speak to him, to sing about him, at least one more time.“The Prestwich and Whitefield City supporters club branch had organised a trip over to Amsterdam to take in an Ajax game and invited Kinkladze to meet them in a bar on the Damstraat, which to everyone’s surprise he did,” remembers the football writer and City fan Simon Curtis. “He turned up as casual as you like and spent the night playing pool and signing everything from clogs to beer bellies.“I was living in Alkmaar at the time and remember sitting with Georgi on one of the pool tables chatting away about how much he missed City. He’d had various problems settling in at Ajax and things weren’t working out for him very well. Meanwhile, the whole place was swamped by deafening songs of praise. It was a great night and showed the humility of the guy.”Life at Ajax indeed proved difficult for Kinkladze. He joined for £4.9m in the summer of 1998 and appeared a perfect fit for a club whose reputation was built around highly technical, creative footballers. But Kinkladze was unable to settle and flourish in his new surroundings. As David Winner outlines in Brilliant Orange: The Neurotic Genius of Dutch Football: “Kinkladze didn’t understand the Ajax system. He was baffled and alienated by the Dutch and their ugly, incomprehensible guttural language. Within a year he was utterly depressed, his only comfort watching videos with his countryman Shota Arveladze.”It was all a far cry from the sense of belonging Kinkladze felt at City having arrived in July 1995 during the first modern wave of deliciously talented foreign players into English football. Six months earlier Tony Yeboah had joined Leeds, while three months later Middlesbrough welcomed Juninho. Meanwhile at Tottenham, it had not been long since Ilie Dumitrescu and Jürgen Klinsmann had arrived and helped form Ossie Ardiles’s wild and ultimately doomed ‘famous five’. Then, of course, there was Dennis Bergkamp, who joined Arsenal in June 1995, and Eric Cantona, who by then was the king of Old Trafford. They were exciting, they were new, they had unusual sounding names and in the case of Kinkladze, appeared to have come out of nowhere.He actually arrived from Dinamo Tbilisi for £2m – via loan spells at FC Saarbrücken in Germany and Boca Juniors in Argentina – after being spotted by City’s then-chairman Francis Lee. Given Kinkladze only left Tbilisi in the first place due to the civil war that ravaged Georgia after independence from the Soviet Union, it was perhaps no surprise he suffered homesickness after moving to Manchester. But the arrival of his mother, Khatuna, just before Christmas 1995 helped him settle in the city and thrive for his new team.He was unspectacular in appearance – small and squat, baggy in shirt and scruffy in hair – but the signs that Kinkladze was a player blessed with incredible balance, skill, pace and purpose, had been evident before his mum landed, most consistently during a run of four wins and a draw in November. But it was what Kinkladze did against Southampton at Maine Road four months later that secured his status as a creative talent of the highest order and the new darling of the Kippax.It is 16 March 1996, and in the 37th minute of a crucial encounter between two teams fighting for survival, City’s No7 collects a pass from Steve Lomas just inside the opposition’s half. He is close to the right-hand touchline and up against Simon Charlton. The Southampton full-back’s body shape makes it clear that he wants to push Kinkladze wide, but the man in possession has other ideas and with a drop of the shoulder and a rapid shift in weight, he drives infield.The home crowd roar in anticipation they can feel something special is on. It doesn’t appear that way, however, when Kinkladze reaches the edge of the area and as well as having to deal with Charlton grappling with his right shoulder in a desperate attempt to rescue the situation, is faced by two more players, not to mention the towering presence of Dave Beasant in the goal.Cue the sexy bit.Kinkladze skips past Ken Monkou with the ease of a man avoiding a piece of litter on the street and then once inside the Southampton area, does the same to the sprawling David Hughes, who rather strangely had run across Kinkladze in his initial attempt to halt the Georgian. With Beasant only to beat, he then dinks the ball over the goalkeeper and into the back of the net with his left foot.Nine seconds from start to finish, four players beaten and one beautiful goal scored. “It was impossibly impudent, impossibly cool headed,” says Curtis, who was at Maine Road that Saturday afternoon. “I remember the euphoria at seeing such a breathtaking goal and watching the little man run to the Platt Lane end beckoning, as if to say, ‘come and join the celebrations’. It was a magical moment.”Two things in particular stand out about the goal. The first is the command of possession Kinkladze displayed. It’s a cliché to say the ball appeared stuck to his feet, but not once does it drift or deviate as he dribbles forward, holds off Charlton, glides inside Monkou and then around Hughes’s legs. The control is magnetic and utterly remarkable.The second is the finish. One-on-one with Beasant, it would have been easy for Kinkladze to simply smash the ball past the keeper, but instead he dummies to shoot twice and waits for the man in front of him to collapse on to his knees so he can lift the ball over him. His message to Beasant was clear: “I’m going to make a dickhead out of you here, son.”It’s often forgotten that Kinkladze beat the former England goalkeeper twice that day, with his first goal coming five minutes before the second via a tap-in from close range after Beasant had failed to hold on to Nigel Clough’s shot. Paul Tisdale pulled one back for Southampton on 64 minutes but it proved to be a consolation and City ultimately secured victory in a match their manager, Alan Ball, had described prior to kick-off as the most important since his arrival from Southampton the previous summer.The win moved City up to 15th but they still ended up going down in bizarre circumstances following a 2-2 draw with Liverpool on the final day of the season. In truth the campaign had been a disaster from the start, with the team failing to win any of their opening 11 fixtures and failing to convince thereafter. The only real highlight was Kinkladze, who in terms of raw talent was several levels above his team-mates. Quite frankly, seeing him play alongside the likes of Lomas, Garry Flitcroft and Ian Brightwell was akin to seeing Jimi Hendrix jam with Toploader.“It didn’t take long after Georgi arrived for us to recognise we had a naturally gifted footballer in our ranks. He was an out and out match winner,” remembers Keith Curle, City’s captain at the time. “Off the pitch he was very shy, very unassuming, and someone who didn’t enjoy the limelight. But on it he came alive. We used to call him ‘Happy Feet’ because he always seemed happiest when he had a ball at his feet.“The goal against Southampton didn’t surprise me because I’d seen Georgi do that type of thing in training all the time. In fact, he did it so regularly that after a while our defenders stopped committing to a challenge when he had the ball because they knew he could and would make a fool out of them. He had an ability to quickly change direction, exceptional vision and a wand of a left foot. And you saw all of that in that goal.”Curle’s affection for Kinkladze is obvious but he says there was also resentment within City’s ranks regarding how the player was excused by Ball of any defensive duties, something which “disrupted the ethos of a team built around 10 outfield players working hard for 90 minutes”.“I remember losing away to Arsenal that season and one of the goals we conceded came because Georgi hadn’t tracked a runner,” adds Curle, currently the manager at Carlisle. “The lads were not happy and some said as much to the manager after the game. In reply, he told them that if they were as talented as Georgi they wouldn’t have to track back either.“Alan adored Georgi and gave him the responsibility of being our matchwinner. He told him to not worry about defending and instead concentrate on finding space when the opposition had the ball and being prepared to attack once we won it back. He’d had a similar approach with Matt Le Tissier at Southampton and Matt flourished. Alan’s feeling was that Georgi could do the same at City.”And that he did, providing heavenly moments during a season of hell for City’s supporters –as well as seeing their side relegated they also had to endure the sight of Manchester United winning a second Premier League and FA Cup double in two years. And their love for ‘Kinky’ was cemented after he decided to stay at the club, only leaving once they had endured yet another drop down the isions.“Kinkladze produced the same level of brilliance at the lower level, scoring marvellous goals at Oxford and Southend and a giant end to end slalom verses Leicester in the Cup that is still etched on the memory,” adds Curtis. “If only he had been around in today’s City side. People would have recognised the true genius of Giorgi Kinkladze.”It is something of travesty that the midfielder’s career tailed off after he left Maine Road. After struggling at Ajax he joined Derby County, first on loan and then on a long-term deal. But back in England Kinkladze could not recreate the magic of old, and following a spell at Rubin Kazan he retired in 2006.Kinkladze could have become a great of European football. Ball, for one, was in doubt of his talents, describing him as “the best player to ever come out of Eastern Europe”. But the Georgian will always have those three years at City, and in particular that goal against Southampton, when he gave a club on its knees a reason to stand tall and feel good about itself.As Joe Royle, the City manager who sold Kinkladze to Ajax, put it in his autobiography: “I wasn’t blind to what lay behind our supporters’ worship at the throne of King Kinky. In the long dark days at Maine Road he was a shining beacon who lit up the gloom with his flashes of genius.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54d968da8e73715925e04e203f0ee22dbf9b8f63/0_160_3088_1853/master/3088.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6677b931f1ab3d42c6803b76db1c1fb","title":"kely nascimento deluca if theres a time to use peles name its for something like this","story":"Pelé’s daughter on how she came to make a documentary on women’s football, racism in Brazil and the fight for equality“There are no words,” says Kely Nascimento-DeLuca, the eldest daughter of Pelé, when I ask about her journey from women’s football novice to documentary maker on the subject. “I’ve always been very into football. I love football. It’s like Christmas, every game in Brazil. It’s hard to explain the feeling, the electricity during a game.”Sitting in a cafe in downtown Manhattan, Nascimento-DeLuca is buzzing. Following this interview she will head off to celebrate with her co-director Justin Noto, having just dropped off the footage for Warriors of a Beautiful Game, their feature-length documentary on women’s football, at Rock Paper Scissors, the editors of the acclaimed Netflix documentary Icarus among many other productions.It has been a long and gruelling journey, one that, in January, had Nascimento-DeLuca seriously wondering if she would even finish the film given the money had run dry and she and Noto were running out of options. “But it’s a movie about women’s football” became the all-too-familiar caveat to the praise they would initially receive for the project.“You know what gets me about it?” says an exasperated Nascimento-DeLuca. “Here in the US, in terms of branding and marketing, we’re pretty good. I would sit in these rooms and I would be like: ‘Dude, we sold people a pet rock. Hundreds of thousands of people bought it, but you cannot fathom a cheeky slogan you could make up to get people to go and watch this movie, which is really not just about sport but is about passion?’ It’s people’s stories. It’s women’s stories – which is problematic because people aren’t used to that. My favourite stories in the world are about women, but they are men’s stories about women.”There are some huge names in the film. US women’s national team players past and present such as Alex Morgan and Abby Wambach, tennis and equality hero Billie Jean King, England’s Nikita Parris, as well as the Brazil superstars Marta, Formiga and Neymar are all interviewed. But at thedocumentary’s heart, is the story of the Brazilian Lais Araujo, now 24, who was spotted in a favela eight years ago by Wilson Egidio, Nascimento-DeLuca’s brother-in-law and coach of Manhattan Soccer Club, a youth side based in New York.“There’s this girl who I just saw, Kely, we have to try and get her here,” said Egidio in a text to Nascimento-DeLuca on his return to the city. “There’s no future for her there, she was playing with all the boys, she’s super skinny, she’s 16, she was playing with no shoes on and she’s phenomenal.”Nascimento-DeLuca wanted to help but was also hesitant given she worked as a creative director and, her father aside, had no connection with football. But then while working on a series of T-shirts for a fledgling brand, which included tops with images of Pelé on them, she had an idea. “Listen, I want to shoot this on a girl player,” she pitched to the CEO of the company. “I think we need to change the narrative a little and I know the girl.”It marked the beginnings of a relationship in which Nascimento-DeLuca would grow as much as Araujo. “I have four kids and a job and so our conversations were very much on the side,” says Nascimento‑DeLuca of the early period of their contact after the t-shirt shoot. “She would send me a WhatsApp message excited because she had heard that in a month a scout from the national team would be coming to her town and she was going to work extra hard. In the two years we chatted it happened several times and they never came, ever. Those things started to lodge themselves in the back of my head.”Then, however, Araujo’s life began to change. She got to the US, invested in a good camera phone and with the help of friends made a showreel. It worked – she was soon in the orbit of the University of Florida, having impressed at junior college level, and after impressing for them she caught the eye of those in charge of selecting players for Brazil’s under-20s team. By 2016, she was her country’s No 10 at the U20s World Cup in Papua New Guinea, playing alongside four players who are now senior Brazil internationals.As Nascimento-DeLuca followed Araujo’s journey, her eyes were opened to the struggles of women footballers. “I thought that this was a) an amazing story and b) truly fucked up. That this girl comes from a country that literally breeds talent and had to go through this journey to get to our U20 national team.”That led to Nascimento-DeLuca researching women’s football. “I was really shocked by so many things. I knew nothing,” she says. “I wasn’t necessarily shocked at the systemic sexism, because I’m South American, and a woman, and alive. But I was shocked at some of the statements that were being made in 2015 by those in charge of promoting the team and sport in Brazil.”For someone who has grown up with a global superstar as a father, Nascimento-DeLuca’s social consciousness is striking. “I’ve had a very profoundly unique experience being the daughter of Pelé in a country that is as systemically racist as Brazil. I was always very aware that everywhere we went nobody looked like me, and definitely not my father.“It was interesting because my father is the type of person who treats everyone that works for him like family. I don’t mean altruistically, I mean that he doesn’t know how to have staff. That sounds horrible, I don’t mean to sound uppity, he just doesn’t make that distinction. If you’re standing there and I’m eating? Sit down. It’s because he doesn’t know how to be wealthy.“You become very aware that if it wasn’t for one magical bit of genius, your life could be completely different because of the way you look. That’s huge. There were many painful things about moving to the US at that time. There was no FaceTime. It was like moving to Mars. But they put us in the United Nations school, so we weren’t aliens. And they moved us to a city where no one gave a fuck. Like truly. He was the least famous person here by a mile.”That has meant Nascimento-DeLuca never attempting to capitalise on her connection, partly because in the arts it wouldn’t have helped much anyway. But it certainly helped as she sought to make her documentary. It took a year to raise the money required for Warriors of a Beautiful Game to become a reality, with the first investor being Stéphane Mbia, the former Cameroon international who Nascimento-DeLuca met at a Paris Saint-Germain game.“It’s really interesting to see that it’s all the same emotions, it’s all the same strings it pulls on. And yet one has been allowed to thrive and been allowed to reach incredible parts of society and culture and the other one hasn’t to nearly the same extent.”For Araujo, it has not been easy. She graduated in 2018 and went to Norway, then to Adelaide. Now she is back in Brazil having fallen off the radar after she prioritised her diploma over the NWSL draft and staying in the pool for the under-20s team. For Nascimento-DeLuca, the hope is that she has done her story justice.“I feel a lot of pressure to make the women in the film proud and to tell the story that they want told. I want it to be a love letter to the sport that makes other people fall in love with it.”And perhaps a rather obvious question – has Pelé seen the documentary? “He’s seen the teaser. He said it’s good,” she says with a laugh. “But he’s always like: ‘I’ll reserve my judgment, let’s see the whole thing first’.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f58e296d68e4f891286d9651ed850fcc94116b5b/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bfd8642e29074ad07f9525ea62649a49","title":"were not ready coronavirus looms over the fragile afghan health system","story":"As Western NGOs remove staff and the US strips support, an influx of Afghans from Iran could add pressure on an already depleted medical systemIn the Guzargah reception centre for returnees and repatriates in Herat, Afghanistan, 17-year-old Yunos rests on a thin mattress in a small, empty room.The previous night fatigued him. He spent it sleeping rough in the desert along with thousands of other Afghans, awaiting the opening of the Iran-Afghanistan border. The frigid desert air froze him to the bone and hunger disturbed his sleep.Yunos moved to Iran one year ago. He crossed the border illegally under the cover of night and made his way to Tehran, where he found a job as an electrician. Last week, however, he decided to return to Afghanistan. The Covid-19 pandemic in Iran has already infected more than 30,000 people, killing nearly 2,400.Many of the 2 million Afghan workers there have lost their jobs, falling into despair. “In Tehran all shops and companies have closed, the costs of living rocketed. If you do not work in necessary services, you can’t go outside,” Yunos says. “All Afghans are returning home from Iran these days due to the coronavirus. We are terrified. We don’t want to die in a strange land.”Since late February, more than 115,000 Afghans have returned home through the border crossing in Herat province in what has been the biggest inwards migration wave in Afghanistan’s recent history. Herat’s governor, Abdul Qayum Rahimi, estimated that close to half of the returnees “might be virus carriers”, raising fears that the influx will place greater strain on Afghanistan’s fragile health system.While Afghanistan has so far reported only 123 Covid-19 cases – including 80 in Herat – and four deaths, officials believe that the real number of infections could be much higher. In a few weeks, the cash-strapped Afghan healthcare system will be put through a test of resilience. Western NGOs have rushed to evacuate their foreign staff and this week the US stripped Afghanistan of $1bn (£801m) worth of support, leaving Afghan health workers as the country’s only defence in the the fight against the pandemic.Jawad*, is bracing for what is to come. The infectious diseases department where he works has been responsible for diagnosing patients before they are transferred to a new 100-bed Covid-19 hospital.In his ward, three doctors, three nurses and one specialist are tending to 200 patients. The lack of equipment such as protective masks, hand sterilisers and medical ventilators is the norm. According to Jawad, the hospital doctors have only one or two masks a day at their disposal.“I have to keep my mood well, but I’m worried about my family,” Jawad says, before he returns to the hospital for a 24-hour shift. “We haven’t tested ourselves for Covid-19 yet. If someone in our department tests positive, the hospital will be paralysed and there will be no one to provide the services.”According to Ali*, another doctor from Herat, the new Covid-19 hospital is ready to admit roughly 150 patients. But once the number of infections passes 1,000, Ali believes, the situation will get out of control. And the predictions have been grim. According to the Afghan ministry of health, the coronavirus could infect 25 million of the country’s 35.5 million people.“Afghanistan is a country that has been affected by gross conflict for the past 40 years. There has been a lot of internal displacement, a lot of people who don’t have access to services and education, water, basic healthcare. The situation in hospitals is very daunting, especially with the increasing arrivals from Iran,” says Nicholas Bishop, the emergency response officer at the International Organization for Migration.In the main Covid-19 hospital in Herat, only ten doctors, one specialist and twenty nurses tend to all patients. Even though the province recently received 400m afghanis (£4.2m) from the central government to fight the pandemic, supplies are scarce.A countrywide awareness campaign designed to improve levels of understanding of the signs and symptoms of the virus has been in full swing. In Herat alone, 2,000 volunteers are going door to door to inform people.But this may prove insufficient to tame the spread of the disease.“We are facing problems with compliance, because of the lack of awareness, people’s religious beliefs, and because we went through very difficult times in the past 40 years”, says Rahimi. “Until Afghans do not see things physically right in front of their eyes they do not get alarmed.

Without knowing it, I probably saw some of the greatest musicians in the world come and go through that house.I remember sitting on the roof of that house with my dad making a balsawood aeroplane. There was a great view from up there. As a kid, I thought my dad was pretty happy – with the family, the family home and his place in the world. Who could have predicted that everything was about to change?At Kenwood, my father and I were close. So close, in fact, that though my first name is also John, I started to get called Julian or Jules since when my mum would shout, “John, your dinner’s ready!” both my dad and I would react.Then suddenly my dad literally disappeared off the face of the planet. At least, that’s how it seemed to me. He and Yoko Ono were deeply and publicly in love. And I felt as if my mum and I had been cast aside. Not everyone forgot about us, though. Paul wrote Hey Jules after dropping in to check how my mum and I were doing. (Obviously, the title of the song changed to Hey Jude).Maybe 10 years passed during which my dad and I barely spoke. I was very angry about how he left the family. It was thanks to my mum that we started having conversations again. She was such a gentle soul, never vindictive in any way, shape or form. She always wanted me to have a relationship with him.I was scared the first time I went to visit him in the US after my parents’ orce. I was becoming more aware of the magnitude of this man. Much to my relief, the visit was a success. My dad was charming and funny and warm. From that trip on, I remember us getting along better. I hesitated to enter the music business because of who Dad was. I would send him the odd cassette of me playing live, or song ideas I had recorded on a little Sony Walkman he had given me.He warmly encouraged me to continue playing, but sadly, he never really got to see my career unfold, as he passed when I was just 17. When I did finally become a professional musician a few years later, I felt like I understood him better.I try to remember my dad as fondly as possible. I strive for forgiveness and understanding in that area of my life, for the difficult times he put my mum and me through. I loved her more than anything and can’t forget how poorly he treated her. But our relationship was getting better before he died. He was in a happier place. He wanted to reconnect, not just with me but with the rest of his family. He never got a chance to do so. Even now, almost 40 years after he died, I hold my father’s memory dear.Julian Lennon is a musician and photographer and the founder of the White Feather FoundationMy father spent the first 65 years of her life trying to avoid answering the question “How are you doing?” And because of that, she didn’t ask it often, either. And, though, I understand that she avoided the question because the answer would have laid bare too many struggles, it made my relationship with her challenging. People connect with each other through vulnerability, and you can only get someone to open up to you if you are willing to be vulnerable yourself. Because she was shielding something so important from herself, Dad remained distant for much of my life.I don’t have many memories from before my parents split up and my father moved out. I was four at the time. They got orced because my dad had decided to start transitioning to female. I, of course, was too young then to have any idea what was behind their decision.I do, however, remember a few details from my early childhood that only made sense much later. For instance, when I was very young, I used to love to fiddle with people’s ears. Once when I reached out to touch my dad’s ears, he said: “Don’t do that. I just had surgery.” He pointed to a thin line of small black stitches behind his ear, grinned, and said: “They took my ear off, peeled my face back, and then stitched it back on.” For the first few years after their orce, my parents were amicable. Mom started dating David Foster, whom she later married. I never called him dad, but he was the one who lived with us, who told me to pick up my clothes and turn off the lights – all the typical dad things. So even though this is about Caitlyn, I could write just as easily about David. He was a wonderful father figure.A few years after my parents orced, Dad apparently decided that it wasn’t the right time to transition and had many of his surgeries reversed. After that, his relationship with my mother grew more hostile. She had worked hard to accept that the reason he couldn’t be with her was because he was working towards transitioning. When he started dating Kris Jenner, whom he would go on to marry, that line of reasoning fell apart. It was tremendously painful. The effect of my parents’ souring relationship was that I didn’t see my father more than half a dozen times between ages eight and 25.Because of this, most of the memories I have of my dad are from the narrow slice of time before I was eight. I remember him betting my brother Brody and me $20 that he could beat us to the top of these insanely high giant sand dunes in Malibu and then just smoking us. He ran a flat-out decathlete sprint. He didn’t even pretend to let us win.After Dad met and married Kris, family became a business for him, and I stayed away for most of my teenage years. I didn’t want to be a part of their dynamic. When I was in my 20s and his daughters with Kris – Kendall and Kylie – were teenagers, Dad and I began to re-establish a relationship. He wasn’t as needed around the house and, I think, was looking for someone to talk to. Although, to be honest, instead of talking, we did things. We worked on my car or flew radio-controlled planes in the park near his house. But even then, it always seemed Dad had his guard up.Once he decided to go through with the transition, I was the first of her children she confided in. As soon as Dad said it herself, I was so happy for her.As her son, I wish my dad had been able to transition sooner, not only because I think she would have been happier, but because I think we could have built a stronger relationship earlier. Now, I’m making up for lost time. I speak to my dad almost every day, and every time, she asks me, “How are you doing?”Brandon Jenner is a singer and songwriter My dad came from a family of actors. His father, Lloyd, was an actor. His mother, Dorothy, was an actor. His brother Beau is an actor, too. He knows firsthand how weird and challenging it could be to have an actor as a parent, which means he is very good at being a famous actor father.When I was growing up, my dad was really hitting his stride. He made many of his greatest films, from The Fabulous Baker Boys to The Fisher King to Fearless, before I was 10 years old. He was often away shooting for weeks at a time, leaving my mother to look after me and my two sisters. She likes to say she takes care of the empire – and she does.But when my dad was at home, it was like having the greatest, most imaginative friend in the world. What makes him such a wonderful actor is the same thing that makes him a wonderful playmate: he’s a great pretender. He relished opening up his rich inner life to share with me and my sisters, and he was always happy to be part of ours, too. My sisters and I loved to dress him up, put flowers in his hair – he’s always had a nice head of hair – and decorate his face with makeup. When Dad was around, we’d draw or paint or just play pretend for hours. He has such a playful spirit. The only time he ever brought his work home with him was the day he returned from shooting Blown Away still in makeup, his face appearing all bloodied and bruised. I think he wanted to scare us, but we just loved peeling off the stretchy plastic fake blood from his face. It was really satisfying.But, of course, he couldn’t always be at home. When he was away, Dad made sure we stayed connected. He’d call every night. He’d say something like, “Isabelle, when you’re asleep tonight, you’ll see a building. Go through the front door and climb up to the attic. What do you see?”“I see the branch of an oak tree by the window,” I’d reply. Then he’d ask, “Do you see the tree house nestled in the crook of the branch?” I’d laugh and say I did. “Let’s meet there tonight,” he’d say. “What are we going to do?” “We’ll jump on our horses and ride to the mountains.” “Sounds like a plan,” he’d say. In the morning, he’d call again, and we’d go over the adventures we’d had in our dreams the night before.I always knew my father was loving and sweet and playful, but it’s still funny to me that he’s become so closely identified with the Dude. By the time The Big Lebowski came out, I was in high school, and, just like a typical teenager, I had zero interest in my father’s work. (I still haven’t seen some of his films from that period.) What I remember most is that around that time, we were on vacation in Hawaii, and my dad was wearing those hideous Sun Jellies from the movie. They’re one of the most well-known parts of his costume, but they were actually my dad’s own shoes. Anyway, my sister and I were so embarrassed by those godawful jellies, we threw them into the ocean. Today, they’d probably be worth a lot of money.Another funny thing about people conflating Dad with the Dude is that he’s not really a laid-back guy. He gets anxious. He experiences stress. Before he goes onstage, he always says he doesn’t want to do it, and afterward, he is critical of himself. Though he describes himself as “Buddhish”, he doesn’t project Zen calm. He is, however, extremely present. Even more so now that he’s older and a grandfather. I have two kids of my own, and he is very focused on being in their lives. We live in Oakland, but he and my mom visit often. And when he’s not able to be with his grandkids, he calls to plan dream meetings with them, too.Daddy Daughter Day by Isabelle Bridges Boesch and Jeff Bridges (Penguin Random House) is due to be published in OctoberMy father is a big nerd, in the best way possible. He is completely different from his cool-guy persona. When I was 10 we would go to the comic store every week religiously. They even kept a pull box for my dad (the store pulls the new comics on a customer’s list and keeps them behind the counter). Dad’s pull box was full of weird and really violent comics that I wasn’t allowed to read. He and I didn’t start exchanging comic books until I got to college, and when I was there, whenever I went to the comic book store alone, I was sad. I wanted my dad to be there.Though I was largely shielded from it at as a child, my dad was struggling with addiction during much of my childhood. When I was eight, he entered rehab. He was gone for 60 days, which was a confusing time for me. I had no idea anything was wrong. I never saw him drunk that I know of. I just thought he was a dude who slept a lot.We moved to Los Angeles for my mum, LaTanya Richardson: she got a role in a shortlived TV series. But soon my dad’s career really took off, and my mum stopped working as much to take care of me. It’s funny that my father is the better-known actor, because my mum was the one who pushed him to act in the first place. They met in a teacher’s office (They went to different colleges but the teacher taught at both places.) Mum was doing some makeup work. She said, “You need to be in my play. Do you act?” Dad said, “Actually, I don’t,” and my mum replied, “Well, you do now.” And that’s how it went, and how it has gone ever since. My mum turns the key and sends Dad out into the world.I do think it was very hard for my mum to give up her career to raise me for as long as she did, though. She’s happy for my dad, of course, but it’s complicated. There’s a sadness there.I was 12 years old when Pulp Fiction came out. After that, my dad became cool. Or, he thought he did. And though much of the world agrees, he’s still just a big nerd to me. He goes through phases. Once, he gave me a sweatshirt he got from working on Django Unchained. He said, “I signed it for you!” I was like, “Dad, thanks. Now I can’t wear it!” It’s up to my mum and me to pull him back down to earth. I mean, isn’t that what family’s for?Zoe Jackson is an Emmy Award–nominated television producer and director I was born in 1962, at the height of my father’s career. He named me after Ethan Edwards, his character in The Searchers, which many consider to be his best role. My father was tough, but very loving. He was old school. I don’t know how else to describe it. He didn’t talk much, but he could make his few words very, very impactful and meaningful. Other actors fight for lines my dad tried to remove as many words as possible. His friends called him Duke, his childhood nickname. It was the name of his dog, an Airedale. Dad used to deliver papers with Duke. The local firemen called the pair Big Duke and Little Duke. The name stuck. He told me, “Now when someone calls me John, I don’t even turn my head.”In his free time, his life was centred on the ocean. We had a converted Second World War minesweeper called Wild Goose and every summer, we would sail up to British Columbia and Alaska. Every winter, we would take it down to Mexico.When he wasn’t on the boat, Dad was working. So I was raised on movie sets. They were rugged in those days. Our family would stay either in a small rented house or in a little motel. I had a tutor three hours a day, but I learned a lot from my father, too. He never told me “do this” or “do that”, but led by example. You never wanted to disappoint him. Once when we were at a friend’s ranch, he asked me to drive to the house in an old pick-up truck and grab some things for him. I was 12. I got the truck stuck and I had to go tell him. He was in the middle of a card game. He didn’t get up or offer to help. It was clear that I was expected to figure out how to get the truck out on my own.Some of my proudest moments came from living up to my father’s straight-ahead toughness. When we were in Cabo or La Paz, Mexico, we’d anchor the boat far from the shore and swim in. It was about a 25-minute swim. I remember once, when I was seven or eight, swimming into a bunch of sea snakes and saying, “Holy crap. There are sea snakes here, Dad!” He replied, “Yeah, just keep swimming, kid.”Once we made it to shore, we walked around until our clothes dried. He gave me a big hug and said, “Good job, Big Stuff.” I was just so proud to have made it through, proud to be my father’s son.My father died on 11 June 1979. I was 17. At the time, it was just him and me alone in the house my mother had moved out. That day, he said he wasn’t feeling well, so I drove him to the hospital. As we pulled up, there was a crowd of photographers waiting for him so we had to go through the back. I was worried, but I was also a naive teenager and thought he was going to be OK. He just always got through things. I didn’t know it at the time, but that was the last ride I would ever take with my dad.Ethan Wayne is the chairman of the John Wayne Cancer Foundation and president of John Wayne EnterprisesPeople think of my dad as the prince of darkness (the name of his 1967 album), a moody performer who turned his back on the audience out of disregard for them. That wasn’t him at all. But this wasn’t something I truly realised until I stood onstage with him as part of his legendary band: Dad wasn’t turning away from the audience he was turning toward the band. It wasn’t a sign of disrespect for those there to hear him it was a sign of respect for those there to play. And I was lucky enough to be there to play.I knew he was a famous musician, but didn’t quite understand how famous. As a kid, I was always telling him I wanted to be a musician. Finally, when I was 14, he asked if I wanted to go on the road with him in the summer. Of course, I said yes.I learned a lot, not only about music, but about my father, during those summer tours. As I stood in the wings, I saw that playing the music live was the most important thing to him. Those tours were the first sustained amount of time I spent with my father. What I discovered about him was how he could break down what was going on in any musical performance – and find something to take away from it. I remember once watching a heavy metal show on MTV, and when Slayer came on, I thought, “Dad’s going to hate this.” He watched for a bit and then said, “Huh. That drummer is really laying it down, isn’t he?” Then he just walked away.He finally asked me onstage for a tour in 1990. He was giving me a chance and I was terrified of blowing it. I played electronic percussion, which was a genre my dad kind of invented. I didn’t even get any rehearsals. I watched the guy who did it before me for a couple of shows, then I was just kind of on it, in the seat. It was nerve-racking for me, but at the same time, it felt wonderful to have my father turn toward me, to listen to me and to play with me as an equal.Erin Davis, along with his sister and cousin, is an executor of the Miles Davis estateTo Me, He Was Just Dad by Joshua David Stein is published by Artisan at £17.99.

Here we try to answer the most common questions.No. But that hasn’t stopped a number of airlines doing exactly that. All flights on EU carriers within, or into the EU, and all flights leaving from an EU airport, are protected by the EU’s “denied boarding” rules, which requires refunds or rerouting when flights are cancelled.The problem for consumers is that enforcing these rights is proving very difficult. Not to pick on them particularly, but easyJet has pushed cancelled customers towards its “manage booking” option. With this, they can only switch a booking to a future flight. Refunds are only being processed by customer services which, of course, is impossible to contact.Note: the EU cancellation rules do not apply to non-EU carriers where the flight started outside the EU. For example, a Korean Air flight from Seoul to London.Taking the offer of replacement vouchers in the current climate is highly risky given the airline may not be around in six months. While some will think vouchers are better than nothing, we would advise readers to insist on a refund. Tell the airline that you want one, and see how things develop. Remember, if your flight cost more than £100 and was booked using a credit card, you can hold the card provider jointly liable.When things calm down we suspect many passengers will be forced down this route. If the airline fails, only about half of travel insurance policies include scheduled airline failure insurance.The fact that the government has advised against all but essential travel means that most travel insurance policies should pay foreign trip cancellation claims. You will need to have bought your policy before the pandemic was declared on 11 March. Those whose flight ran before the Foreign Office advised against travelling will have to hope their insurance had travel disruption cover.Note: travel policies bought after 11 March will probably not cover any coronavirus-based claims.If you booked a holiday in the UK, and a cottage owner is refusing to give you a refund or move the booking, there is sadly not a great deal you can do. The fact that the cottage exists and is still being offered, has allowed owners to deny refunds. Several Scottish firms are refusing to refund bookings, even though ferries are not open to non-residents.Two lawyers have said that if a contract becomes impossible to perform, or can only be performed illegally, it is considered “frustrated”. The threat of legal action to reclaim denied payments, may be enough to force a refund. Ultimately, you may have to go to court to get the money back, but who knows when that will possible.Some more expensive travel insurance polices will cover UK trips, so it is worth checking.Contact your card provider and file a claim – if you can get through. Claims usually have to be filed within a certain timeframe, although these deadlines could be extended given bank staff are all at home too.The site has been offering both owners and those with reservations the chance to cancel without incurring fees. It applies to bookings made on, or before, 14 March, with a check-in date up until 14 April 2020, although this will most likely be extended.You are much better placed. If your holiday has been cancelled you should get a full refund. If the tour operator collapses before it is able to compensate you, the government-backed Atol scheme is there to step in.Several readers have asked about trips booked for July onwards. We would wait and see. There is little to be gained by cancelling now.Compiled this week by Miles Brignall This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Next up: influential funk and soul singer-songwriter Curtis MayfieldCurtis Mayfield was an odd choice to write a blaxploitation soundtrack. His reputation was built on the protest songs with which he documented the 60s civil rights movement – Keep on Pushing, People Get Ready, Choice of Colours, We’re a Winner. His writing was characterised by open-heartedness, empathy and nuance for all its importance in bringing black experience to mainstream cinema, blaxploitation films were frequently violent, cartoonish and shocking.Moreover, Mayfield’s songwriting powers went into overdrive, dredging his own childhood memories for the opening Little Child Running Wild, writing music that wasn’t just supremely funky, but troubled and haunting: the skeletal, insistent Pusherman Eddie You Should Know Better and No Thing on Me, where the starkness of the lyrics snags against the lush orchestration the simultaneously hooky and unflinching Freddie’s Dead. The title track, meanwhile, was the negative image of Isaac Hayes’ laudatory blaxploitation theme Shaft. Where Hayes lavished praise on his film’s “sex machine” hero, Mayfield depicted Youngblood Priest filled with “weakness”: “Ask him his dream … he wouldn’t know … time’s running out and there’s no happiness.” The dark mood even seeped into the beautiful Give Me Your Love, its shimmer of strings failing to mask an air of bleak resignation in the lyrics.The result wasn’t a soundtrack so much as a concept album inspired by a film. It wasn’t just Mayfield’s best album, but one of the high watermarks of arguably the most fertile and creative era in soul music’s history. It vastly outgrossed the film, although the latter was a box-office success. Infinitely more people have heard Mayfield’s songs than have seen the movie that inspired them: his plan worked far better than he could have imagined.Mayfield had covered an incredible amount of ground over the course of the 60s with the Impressions – the band singing Check Out Your Mind or Mighty Mighty (Spade and Whitey) at the decade’s end were unrecognisable as the post-doo-wop combo of the early 60s. Even so, his first solo album came as a shock, not least its opening: what was placid, sympathetic Curtis Mayfield doing bellowing racist epithets, screaming and telling people they were going to hell? But from that point on, Curtis never lets up: its sound pitched somewhere between the psychedelic soul experiments of Norman Whitfield and the genre’s heavily orchestrated future its ballads extraordinarily beautiful even when the subject matter turned grim: “Shall we commit our own genocide before you check out your mind?” Mayfield sang on We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue, a track that lurched between string-laden gorgeousness and tough, conga-driven funk the nine minutes of life-affirming joy that is the full-length version of Move on Up undimmed despite the song’s subsequent familiarity. Predating the moment when Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder wrested control of their work from Motown, it was the first of 70s soul music’s great auteur-driven albums: the sound of a new era that still sounds fresh 50 years on.Mayfield’s writing had always been distinguished by its optimism, but it finally seemed to desert him on There’s No Place Like America Today, as stark and harrowing a depiction of life in the US as the mid-70s produced. America was still suffering the after-effects of the oil crisis and the 70s recession, unemployment at its highest rate since 1941: “Scufflin’ times,” as Mayfield put it on the astonishing When Seasons Change. “Look around and see yourself so weak and so vulnerable.” He slowed the tempo of his songs to an agonised crawl, stripped the arrangements back until they felt sparse and sombre, shifted his songwriting so that there seemed to be no peaks, no breakdowns: for all the music’s delicacy and nuance, there’s something oddly unrelenting about it. The opener Billy Jack detailed the kind of drug-related ghetto murder that he’d depicted in Freddie’s Dead, but this time treated it with a sad, fatalistic shrug: “It’s a wonder he lived this long”. There’s No Place Like America Today is tough, but powerful listening.In 1990, Curtis Mayfield was paralysed from the neck down after a lighting rig collapsed during a gig in Brooklyn. But he continued to write and marshalled his energies for one last album. It arrived filled with poignant moments, among them Aretha Franklin’s appearance on Back to Living Again, where she appears to be urging him on: “Right on, go ahead Mayfield”. But New World Order isn’t an album interested in eliciting the listener’s sympathy: it succeeds entirely on its own musical merits. Remarkably, given that his vocals had to be recorded line-by-line, Mayfield singing while lying on his back, his voice sounds incredible. His songwriting still had bite, as evidenced by Here But I’m Gone’s portrayal of a crack addict. And while he worked with TLC and Outkast production team Organized Noise, he didn’t have to chase new trends: his influence over contemporary R\u0026ampB and hip hop was so vast that his sound required only a cosmetic makeover to sound current.The traditional narrative suggests disco harmed Mayfield’s career, not least because his kind of social commentary fell out of fashion in favour of something more escapist. That’s an overly simplistic reading: artistically at least, Mayfield was more than equipped to cope with changing trends. His label Curtom Records released a string of fantastic disco tracks – Linda Clifford’s Runaway Love, Mystique’s What Would the World Be Without Music, Barbara Mason and Bunny Sigler’s admittedly obscure Locked in This Position – and his own work in the era is worth far more than a cursory listen. From 1979’s overlooked Heartbeat, What Is My Woman For? is a very Mayfield take on the genre – a beautifully wrought hymn not to a one-stand or dancefloor delirium, but the pleasures of a long, stable relationship and parenthood: “Never changing, she’s as solid as that wall.”Travelling Soul: The Life of Curtis Mayfield – Todd Mayfield and Travis Atria (2016)A more clear-eyed and comprehensive work than you might expect from the subject’s son, Travelling Soul is about as definitive a Mayfield biography as there is.Chicago Soul – Robert Pruter (1992)If you want local context for Mayfield’s career, this is the place: there’s a chapter devoted to his Curtom label, and Pruter’s research into the everything from the city’s stylistic shifts – from doo-wop to the early 80s – to prevalent dance crazes is exemplary.Curtis Mayfield: People Never Give Up – Peter Burns (2003)Not the biography it claims to be, more a Mayfield nerdcollector’s paradise that does a good job of unravelling his labyrinthine work as artist, songwriter and producer.

A decision will be made by the highest level of Iran’s multi-layered government. There is no guarantee that clemency will be granted, or that she will be allowed to return to the UK.Zaghari-Ratcliffe, seen by some as a bargaining chip in the wider diplomatic dispute between the UK and Iran, was given a temporary fortnight’s release from Evin prison, Tehran, on 17 March along with 85,000 other prisoners at risk from the coronavirus outbreak. She has been allowed to stay at her parents’ house in Tehran but made to wear an ankle brace that keeps her within 300 metres of her parents’ home.All prisoners sentenced for five years or less were given temporary release, permitting half of all Iran’s political prisoners to be freed.The supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, announced early last week that what had initially been seen as a fortnight’s release for furloughed prisoners had been extended to early April since there was no sign that the coronavirus pandemic was easing. Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s inclusion in that extension was only confirmed to the family by the prison on Saturday.Arrested in April 2016, she was sentenced in September to five years in jail. Her sentence is due to come to an end within 10 months unless new charges are levelled against her - something the Islamic revolutionary guards corps has threatened in the past.The potential offer of clemency, relayed to Nazanin’s father by the prison authorities at the weekend, will be recommended to the Iranian prosecutor general’s office. Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, described the move as “potentially a baby step towards freedom”. “I spoke to her yesterday and her mood was pretty upbeat,” he said.Ratcliffe told the : “The deputy prosecutor can either approve clemency or refer the file back to the supreme leader’s office with a recommendation that she not be granted clemency, or it could just sit on his desk for a bit.“The supreme leader can refuse a recommendation not to grant clemency, or can follow it and specify that Nazanin not be granted. But the default in the process following the supreme leader’s proclamation last week is that the law requires eligible people to be granted clemency.“So it is a good that her file has been put forward – an acknowledgement by the judiciary that she is formally eligible, and she is being treated so far like everyone else.”He and his wife, 41, have suffered painful false dawns before, partly because the Iranian political system has many different centres of decision-making.British officials believe any decision to grant her clemency will be taken at the highest level, including an assessment of the wider political benefits to Iran in winning support for the lifting of sanctions. Zaghari-Ratcliffe has deliberately made no political statement since her release from jail, but the pressure to release other prisoners is intense, with reports of unrest in prisons continuing this weekend.The Iranian foreign ministry has been mounting an increasingly effective international campaign, including with American Democrats, to turn up the diplomatic heat on the US for its refusal to suspend economic sanctions to help Iran purchase medical equipment needed to help fight the pandemic. Britain has been privately urging Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, to see if the US can remove any blocks to a new Swiss channel, the Swiss humanitarian trade arrangement, that is supposed to ease the flow of humanitarian supplies to Iran.International bankers say they still do not have sufficient reassurance from the US Treasury that they will not be sanctioned if they finance the trade. At the same time, Iran has been seeking help in securing a $5bn (£4bn) IMF loan, something the US could block. A reformist MP from Tehran, Alireza Rahimi, tweeted on Sunday that the IMF was going to release “a substantial portion” of the loan.The Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, said: “The US government had moved from sabotage to assassinations to waging an economic war and economic terrorism on Iranians and now to medical terrorism. This even exceeds what is permissible on the battlefield.”However, hardliners are determined to send out a message that the government can ride out the crisis alone, and seem mainly eager to take aim at the failure of Europe and the US to bring the pandemic under control.Pressure has also been mounting on the sometimes incoherent Iranian leadership over its handling of the pandemic. The Iranian health ministry on Sunday announced a further 2,901 new coronavirus cases in the previous 24 hours, taking the total number of cases to 38,309. The 24-hour total of new infections has ballooned in the past five days from below 900 new infections in a week.The official total death toll is only 2,640, and the daily recorded deaths are broadly static, something that is hard to reconcile with the higher level of infections. The death toll is a quarter of Spain’s, and may be due to Iran’s decision to classify some deaths as caused by respiratory difficulties rather than coronavirus.Following weeks of pressure to take tougher steps, Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, finally introduced physical distancing and city quarantines. An emergency 2,000-bed hospital has been built in Tehran, reflecting the pressure in the capital. A total of 3,467 patients are described as “in severe condition”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db6ae56067649adb2103a33d4ba91a139a3ad021/2_0_5903_3543/master/5903.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b23c12530242b06f8655c349abf527c","title":"looking for a distraction here are 25 of our favourite long reads","story":"If you feel like reading about something other than coronavirus – and filling some more time during lockdown – then e into a few of these highlights from the long read archiveWhen a drilling platform is scheduled for destruction, it must go on a thousand-mile final journey to the breaker’s yard.

It also concluded that another charge of intent to rape was “not proven”, a Scottish legal formulation which stops short of a not guilty verdict but finds the accused innocent in the eyes of the law.During and since the trial, the nine women who alleged assaults by the former Scottish National party leader have faced an onslaught of abuse online and on Sunday morning released a joint statement in which they described their “devastation” at the verdict. It is understood that they have been issued with personal alarms and have been offered home security checks by police.Gordon Jackson QC was condemned for his “horrifying and completely unacceptable” comments after the Sunday Times reported he had been overheard making the remarks on board an Edinburgh to Glasgow train during the first week of the trial and that his conversation had been filmed by a passenger.Jackson, who is dean of the Faculty of Advocates, appears to name two of the women who alleged sexual assaults by Salmond, in contravention of rules that protect the anonymity of complainers – as they are known in Scotland – in such cases.Sandy Brindley, the chief executive of Rape Crisis Scotland, called for an investigation, saying: “Protecting the anonymity of all people who report sexual crimes is of critical importance and is one of few reassurances that can be offered as part of an otherwise daunting and intimidating process.“For this to be undermined by such a senior lawyer in a public place in such a high-profile trial is horrifying and completely unacceptable. Jackson is dean of the Faculty of Advocates and we cannot see how this behaviour – caught on film – is in keeping with the Faculty of Advocates’ own guidance on conduct. There should be an immediate investigation.”Referring to one complainer, he says: “We thought that eventually people might think she’s a flake and not like her,” and goes on to discusses his defence tactics with another woman, saying: “All I need to do is put a smell on her.”Brindley said: “One of the most chilling aspects of this is Jackson’s statement about his strategy for the cross-examination of one of the women in the trial: ‘All I need to do is put a smell on her.’ This statement alone confirms the fears of many who do not report for fear of what would be done to them in court. We need an urgent overhaul of how these cases are dealt with.”In a statement released on Twitter, Jackson said: “I have decided that the proper course of action is to self-refer this matter to the Scottish Legal Complaints Commission, and that has been done. It will be for the Commission to consider this matter.“I also deeply regret the distress and difficulties which have been caused, but given the reference to the SLCC it would not be appropriate to comment further.”A spokesperson for Salmond: “Mr Salmond … made a statement on the steps of the high court and said that he would make no further public comment on these matters until after the coronavirus crisis was over.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c41a36b9fac84d56462b4771bcd921bbe4f8180d/0_459_2590_1553/master/2590.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c32c18d4fe2529c436af4d153f57ff8c","title":"dominic cummings self isolates after experiencing coronavirus symptoms","story":"Boris Johnson’s key adviser believed to have mild symptoms including a coughDominic Cummings has developed symptoms of coronavirus over the weekend and is self-isolating, a source has confirmed.Boris Johnson’s key adviser, who was last seen running through Downing Street on Friday, is believed to have experienced mild symptoms including a cough.The prime minister and the health secretary, Matt Hancock, are already self-isolating after developing symptoms towards the end of last week.Symptoms are defined by the NHS as either:NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u0026nbspstay at home for at least 7 days.If you live with other people,\u0026nbspthey should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start.\u0026nbspEven if it means they\u0027re at home for longer than 14 days.If you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.If you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.After 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.If you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.If you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.Staying at home means you should:You can use your garden, if you have one. You can also leave the house to exercise – but stay at least 2 metres away from other people.If you have symptoms of coronavirus, use the\u0026nbspNHS 111 coronavirus service\u0026nbspto find out what to do.A Whitehall source confirmed a report by the Daily Mail’s Jason Groves that Cummings was still communicating with No 10.Last week, Downing Street rejected as “a highly defamatory fabrication” a claim that Cummings initially argued against strict measures to contain coronavirus in a view summarised as “if that means some pensioners die, too bad”.The claim, initially made in the Sunday Times, said that at one private event at the end of February, Cummings outlined the government’s strategy at the time in a way that was summarised by some present as “herd immunity, protect the economy, and if that means some pensioners die, too bad.” A Downing Street spokesman said last week: “This is a highly defamatory fabrication which was not put to No 10 by the Sunday Times before publication. The article also includes a series of apparent quotes from meetings which are invented.”Johnson tested positive on Friday for coronavirus and is self-isolating in Downing Street. He said he had experienced mild symptoms over the previous 24 hours, including a temperature and cough, but continues to lead the government.Hancock said he had also tested positive, while England’s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, has shown symptoms.Cummings, 48, who is a father of one, is believed to be recovering in his family home in north London with his wife, Mary Wakefield, an editor at the Spectator.A controversial figure and a self-styled political disruptor who helped lead Britain’s pro-Brexit referendum campaign in 2016, he has been blamed for briefing journalists that the UK was seeking herd immunity against the coronavirus. The government and its scientific advisers deny that was ever their strategy.The government has faced criticism from public health experts for failing to heed their own advice to the public on how to contain the coronavirus through social distancing.The Scotland secretary, Alister Jack, who sat between Johnson and Hancock at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, confirmed at the weekend that he had a cough and a temperature – common symptoms of coronavirus – and would remain at home, making him the third cabinet minister to shut themselves away.Parliament has now closed for four weeks as the start of the planned Easter recess was brought forward over concerns about the spread of the virus.MPs and peers will not return until 21 April at the earliest and even then it night not be business as usual.The Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, said that “virtual parliament and virtual select committees” could be a possibility as he announced the extended recess on Wednesday evening."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12b9e725886d86573dd1c60d0df74e28ef1b8cfc/0_54_5499_3298/master/5499.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff049068c6c7d7111aa0b535ffbaad00","title":"uk coronavirus live rate infection lockdown covid 19","story":"All the day’s new developments in the UK’s Covid-19 crisis, as Prince Charles comes out of self-isolation and Nicola Sturgeon says Glasgow’s SEC Centre will be turned into a temporary hospitalDuring the virtual lobby briefing attended by our deputy political editor, Rowena Mason, the government also continued to rule out any extension of the Brexit transition period. The prime minister’s official spokesman said: “The transition period ends on December 31, 2020. That is enshrined in UK law.”A temporary emergency hospital could open at the Scottish exhibition centre in Glasgow to cope with a surge in critical coronavirus cases in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has announced.The first minister said the so-called Nightingale hospital would be on standby, with a first tranche of 300 beds being installed and a potential total capacity of an extra 1,000 beds if needed.It could be become operational in a fortnight, she said, but they hoped it would not be necessary. “Our focus very much is on ensuring we’re maximising general capacity and critical care capacity within the existing hospital network,” she said.She added that there had been six further deaths overnight, taking Scotland’s total to 47, with 1,563 positive cases detected overall, up by 179 since yesterday, and 108 people in intensive care.Jeane Freeman, the Scottish health secretary, said they had chosen the exhibition centre because of its proximity to the west of Scotland’s other hospitals, its transport links and security needs. She thanked the army for helping the government and NHS set it up. Speaking at her daily coronavirus briefing, Sturgeon said they hoped the NHS would be able to cope with a surge in cases in existing hospitals, by setting aside 3,000 beds for coronavirus cases, and was working to quadruple intensive care beds to 700 places.Sturgeon said that to help free up staff and capacity, NHS Scotland had temporarily paused routine screening for bowel cancer, cervical cancer and breast cancer for up to 12 weeks.Catherine Calderwood, Scotland’s chief medical officer, said they were also temporarily pausing screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm and diabetic eye screening. Pregnancy and newborn baby screening would continue as before.They could restart earlier if feasible. “It’s an important way of allowing the NHS to deal effectively with the impact of covid-19,” Sturgeon said. Calderwood added that the virus outbreak could peak in Scotland in late April but the restrictions on daily life would continue for at least 13 weeks. She was “expecting a peak in the virus in two to three weeks, so I would be pessimistic that there would be any change to those stringent measures.” Sturgeon said that in the four hours since the Scottish government had launched its new “Scotland cares” volunteering programme on Monday morning, 10,000 people had registered their interest in taking part.The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, has given some details of a £1.1bn “fighting fund” to help tackle the Covid-19 crisis.He told a press conference in Cardiff £500m of this was an “economic resilience fund” to help businesses, charities and social enterprises who are going into hibernation or have cashflow problems.Drakeford said the money had come from all areas of government but one specific cut he highlighted was to funding for post-Brexit trade missions. He also said EU funding intended to be spent on projects in Wales would be channelled into the new pot.Drakeford said: “The pace at which the coronavirus pandemic is affecting our economy is extraordinary. Now, more than ever, government needs to do all it can to support the economy and business.”The £500m fund is made up of two main elements:Grants of £10,000 for micro-businesses employing up to nine people.Grants of up to £100,000 for small and medium sized firms with between 10 and 249 employees.The new fund builds on the £1.4bn business support package announced by the Welsh government on March 18, which provides a year-long rate relief holiday for all but the largest premises in the retail, hospitality and leisure sectors and grant-support for more than 70,000 small businesses.Germany has come to the rescue of British holidaymakers stranded in Bali.The British embassy in the Indonesian island revealed today that it had been offered 40 seats on a special flight organised by Germany.“Our German friends have opened 40 places on a flight for European Union \u0026amp United Kingdom citizens leaving Jakarta on Friday 3 April at 17.25, arriving in Frankfurt on Sat 4 April at 05.35,” it said in a tweet. Those who take up the offer will not need to find the cash immediately but can pay after the trip has been completed, the embassy added.While the offer will barely dent the scale of the repatriation needs in Bali, where there are 4,000 Britons stranded, the gesture underlines the pro-active approach the Germans are taking.According to the German embassy in London, 17,000 people have been flown back on more than 70 charter flights organised by the German foreign office to 21 countries including New Zealand, India, Argentina and Tunisia where Britons are stranded. This week it is planning charter flights for 25 more countries. The UK Foreign Office has been heavily criticised by British nationals marooned abroad. Today two more flights from Peru will take off from Lima with the last of the 1,000 British nationals stranded expected to be on board. Consumers are being warned to be extra wary of texts and emails that are arriving in inboxes and on mobile handsets at the moment, as scammers try to exploit the pandemic to catch out the unwary. The body behind Britain’s banks said this morning that there has been a big rise in “smishing” text message scams that claim to be from government departments, banks or other trusted organisations. They typically offer payments related to the coronavirus outbreak or claim to be from bodies issuing fines. UK Finance said that the messages will include a link to a fake website that is designed to trick people into giving away their financial and personal information such as bank details, passwords and credit card numbers.The advice is to never click on such links, but to log into your account from a new browser. Criminals are also using a technique called “spoofing”, which can make a message appear in a chain of texts alongside previous genuine messages from that organisation. Criminals are callously exploiting the coronavirus outbreak to commit fraud, including using scam text messages imitating government departments, banks and other trusted organisations.We are urging consumers to remain vigilant and avoid clicking on links in any unsolicited text messages in case it’s a scam.It’s always safer to log into your bank account directly or contact the organisation on a trusted number or email such as the one on their official website.Councils are warning people to beware scammers pretending to be health officials or offering to pick up food and medicines. The LGA has advised people not to accept help from cold-callers.Prince Charles, who announced last week that he had tested positive for Covid-19, is now out of self-isolation. His spokesperson said: “Clarence House has confirmed today that, having consulted with his doctor, the Prince of Wales is now out of self-isolation.”Charles, 71, who is at Birkhall, his Scottish residence near Balmoral, first reported mild symptoms last weekend, and was tested under NHS criteria in Aberdeenshire, last Monday. It is understood he is in good health, and said to be operating under the current standard government and medical restrictions that apply nationwide. His self-isolation lasted seven days, in accordance with government and medical guidelines.He will continue to hold meetings via phone and video conferencing, and will be able to take exercise while adhering to the medical and government guidelines.The Duchess of Cornwall, 72, who last week tested negative for the virus, has been self-isolating at Birkhall, but apart from Charles. She will be carrying out 14 days self-isolation. It is expected this will last until the end of the week. Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has announced that the SEC Centre in Glasgow will be turned into a temporary hospital to treat Covid-19 patients. The field hospital will provide NHS Scotland with a further 300 beds, although it could ultimately be expanded to accommodate more than 1,000 patients.She also announced that the service would suspend breast, cervical and bowel screening to help it cope with the outbreak. The suspension will be reviewed within the next 12 weeks.As of Monday, 1,563 people in Scotland have tested positive with coronavirus, up by 179 from yesterday. Both Sturgeon and Scottish chief medical officer Dr Catherine Calderwood, emphasised that the figure was likely to be an underestimate.There has also been a further six deaths, taking the total to 47 in Scotland. There are currently 13,000 beds in NHS hospitals across Scotland, with at least 3,000 being made available for patients infected with the virus. Aberlour Child Care Trust said many of the families were struggling to buy essentials and pay for utilities. An urgent appeal to members of the public launched by the charity on 18 March raised more than £88,000. On top of financial difficulties, it said it had also experienced an increase in requests related to domestic abuse.Liz Nolan, deputy director at Aberlour Child Care Trust, said: We’ve received applications from all over Scotland from struggling families telling us that they can’t afford to stock up on essentials, and when they go to the shops there is nothing there because of other people panic buying.We’re also experiencing an increase in domestic abuse-related requests for support where mothers and children have been forced to flee their homes, leaving all belongings behind."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3223667d80362074350e9755aa0c9e5c98bb3d16/0_0_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=248866446a73662606bd89365d0845a4","title":"peace and dignity journeys ultramarathon noe alvarez","story":"When Noé Álvarez joined an extraordinary ultramarathon he tested himself physically and mentally, while also connecting with his heritageWhile jogging on the spot, Mexican-American runner Noé Álvarez showed his passport to the border agent in Nogales, Arizona. Álvarez was participating in the Peace and Dignity Journeys (PDJ), an ultramarathon for runners of indigenous background like himself. His group had run 3,200 miles from the Arctic to the US border with Mexico. They still had miles to go before their destination of the Panama Canal, but for Álvarez, the crossing into Mexico had extra meaning – it was the homeland of his parents before they immigrated to the US. The border agent, a fellow Latino, smirkingly asked if he was running in the wrong direction.It’s an emotional moment in Álvarez’s new memoir, Spirit Run: A 6,000-Mile Marathon Through North America’s Stolen Land. The book chronicles not only that epic run in 2004 but also the background of the author and his immigrant parents.“I feel like I’m still writing it,” Álvarez says. “It continues to inform my life. It took me years to figure out how I was going to tell it.” Ultimately, he decided on uniting the beauty of the journey and the messy moments along the way “through the medium of running.”And what a run it was. The PDJ is a quadrennial event intended to reconnect indigenous participants with their ancestral land, with the latest edition, which had been due to take place this year, cancelled due to the Covid-19 outbreak. In 2004, Álvarez’s group was heading south to rendezvous with another group running north from Argentina.There were unexpected difficulties -- an encounter between Álvarez and a mountain lion in Oregon, stone-throwing motorists in Mexico, and tensions between the author and some of his fellow runners. And he didn’t quite finish the way he intended to. But the first-time author has come to find satisfaction in both the run and his life trajectory.He received a full scholarship to Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington, but says he felt “cultural shock on all sorts of levels. I had difficulties, there was the shame of failing, I could not save my family.” Serendipitously, he learned of the PDJ from “a friend of a friend of a friend.”“I had to do this,” Álvarez explains. “It was part of my escape. I was not connected to college at the time. It was not how I needed to learn. College was joining the run.”He joined one month in, after the group had started its journey from Alaska. Their paths crossed in British Columbia. Fellow runners collectively represented nine indigenous communities.“It was interesting to see how fluid and multilayered our identities were,” he says of his fellow participants, whom he portrays through composite characters in the book. They included runners of Mexican heritage living in Canada, and “an elder, our spiritual guide, from the Arctic.” He noted that there were “some former gang and military members and others completely living off the land,” and women runners committed to “female energy, healing power, balance.”PDJ runners start and end each day with a ceremony, and carry feathered staffs during the run. Daily destinations are indigenous communities across North America. At each stop, community members share an important cultural story with the runners, signifying the story with a feather to add to the staff. Sometimes they also shared running traditions, including running as a group in the Tohono O’odham territory in the Arizona desert.Álvarez, who had never run more than 10 miles in a day, would receive myriad tests. The PDJ takes place relay-style, with each runner committing to a certain amount of mileage each day while others wait their turn while traveling by motor vehicle. He learned to eat on the run, finding that a hard-boiled egg stuffed into his pocket might not be the wisest nourishment with wildlife around. He and his fellow runners slept in all manner of venues, from campgrounds to casinos, and encountered varying terrain, from the forests of Canada to the deserts of Washington and Arizona to the jungles of Mexico.“It was not just running blindly,” Álvarez says. “It’s a story about why land is important to people.” He noted that in the Canadian forests, trees were being cut down for the ski industry and the Winter Olympics, while more arid areas were suffering from drought.“We honored the land that a lot of people depend on,” Álvarez says. “We were physically walking, running and connecting with it every step of the way.”In Oregon, he made an unexpected connection – a mountain lion waiting for him atop a peak.“I was completely unprepared,” Álvarez recalls. “I couldn’t run back. I had to keep moving forward.” He says that when he joined the run, “one guy, a really good friend and spiritual guide, talked about how to be thankful for the presence of an animal that decides to notice you, sort of take it as a message, an opportunity to reflect.”In the book, Álvarez describes the mix of gratitude and footwork that helped him escape the big cat. “Luckily, I’m still here,” he says. “I did some studies on what you’re supposed to do, and they said definitely don’t run. It’s definitely the dumbest thing I probably ever did.”After the group crossed into Mexico, they encountered a different kind of danger: people who threw rocks from cars. Female runners were also at risk of assault Álvarez describes one attempt that left some runners wary of continuing.“We came across situations with real shady encounters, people trying to force you into a vehicle, throw rocks at you, who didn’t want you there,” Álvarez says. “We adjusted, ran in pairs … Some territories were extremely unsafe. If you didn’t want to run, you didn’t have to. Others took on the miles.”Ultimately, it was a familiar runner’s story – injury – that determined Álvarez would finished his run in Guatemala before he could reach the Panama Canal. He calls it “the toughest decision, probably, I ever had to make.”“I didn’t want to quit,” he says. “But knowing when to quit was part of the lesson.”This lesson has stayed with him ever since – as has the border officer’s question about whether he was running in the wrong direction.“I no longer think about the wrong direction,” Álvarez says. “I have a line of inquiry now, a ritual of asking the questions I need to.” And, he says, “Running is the way I process things now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf3f0cc1a2e830e3c0025af06031c208a50f7c1e/0_256_4065_2439/master/4065.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d644c4cb834ebfd3e4cb0667b55d0afe","title":"tokyo olympics to start in july 2021 after coronavirus rescheduling","story":"The Tokyo Olympics will take place between 23 July and 8 August next year.The International Olympic Committee confirmed the news on Monday, which followed a meeting of the Tokyo 2020 organising committee. A decision to postpone the Olympic and Paralympic Games was taken last week by the IOC and the Japanese government because of the accelerating threat posed by the coronavirus pandemic.A statement from the IOC also confirmed the new dates for the Paralympic Games, which will now take place on 24 August to 5 September.“These new dates give the health authorities and all involved in the organisation of the Games the maximum time to deal with the constantly changing landscape and the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic,” the statement read. “The new dates, exactly one year after those originally planned for 2020 also have the added benefit that any disruption that the postponement will cause to the international sports calendar can be kept to a minimum, in the interests of the athletes and the international federations.“Additionally, they will provide sufficient time to finish the qualification process. The same heat mitigation measures as planned for 2020 will be implemented.”The confirmation of the new dates comes less than a week after the forced postponement of the Games. The IOC president, Thomas Bach, said: “I want to thank the international federations for their unanimous support and the Continental Associations of National Olympic Committees for the great partnership and their support in the consultation process over the last few days. I would also like to thank the IOC Athletes’ Commission, with whom we have been in constant contact.“With this announcement, I am confident that, working together with the Tokyo 2020 organising committee, the Tokyo metropolitan government, the Japanese government and all our stakeholders, we can master this unprecedented challenge. Humankind currently finds itself in a dark tunnel. These Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 can be a light at the end of this tunnel.”Tokyo 2020’s organising committee president, Yoshiro Mori, said he had proposed the 23 July to 8 August timeframe to the IOC, and that Bach had agreed following consultations with the international sports federations.“A certain amount of time is required for the selection and qualification of athletes and for their training and preparation, and the consensus was that staging the rescheduled Games during the summer vacation in Japan would be preferable,” Mori said.“In terms of transport, arranging volunteers and the provision of tickets for those in Japan and overseas, as well as allowing for the Covid-19 situation, we think that it would be better to reschedule the Games to one year later than planned, in the summer of 2021.”The International Paralympic Committee president, Andrew Parsons, added: “When the Paralympic Games do take place in Tokyo next year, they will be an extra-special display of humanity uniting as one, a global celebration of human resilience and a sensational showcase of sport.“With the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games 512 days away, the priority for all those involved in the Paralympic Movement must be to focus on staying safe with their friends and family during this unprecedented and difficult time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39c510d50227249488bfe3b804fd0c732d43c17d/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d9697bf85fcdc8d9a01396b869a633b","title":"the breadwinners of barishal how women in bangladesh are starting their own businesses","story":"Women in this flood-hit area are supporting their families through small businesses backed by the British Red Cross. From tailoring to tea making, the success of these enterprises is inspiring other young women to follow suitby  Thaslima Begum in BarishalIn the sprawling urban slums of Barishal, where monsoons and flooding are inescapable, life for women is hard. They are more likely to miss out on getting an education, and without the proper knowledge and skill set, many struggle to make a living. As they are more likely to live in poverty, they are more affected by disasters. But despite these challenges, with the help of livelihood grants from the Red Cross, many women in Barishal are finding innovative ways to eke out a living.Rina, 37, from Palashpur, wakes up early every day to start preparing for work. From a side road of a small slum with heavy foot traffic, she has been running a successful tea stall for the last two years. Brightly coloured crisp packets hang like a banner across her shopfront, where Rina sells roughly 160 cups of tea a day at 5 taka (under 5p) a cup.She uses the money to pay for her children’s education and managed to save enough to buy a small TV, which kept her busy during the World Cup. “Everyone here loves football, so I thought it would be a good investment,” she says proudly. “Not everyone in the slums owns a TV, so when they stop to watch, they also buy tea.”Married at 12, Rina now has five children and is the sole breadwinner of her family. Her husband suffered a stroke seven years ago and is no longer able to work. “I had no money to feed my children. I’d already taken out loans and was worried about our financial situation.” But in 2018, she received a small grant, which enabled her to kickstart her own business.Rina’s customers are mostly men labourers who come to drink chai during their breaks and catch up with their friends. Though they don’t speak to Rina much, she has learned a lot from listening in on their conversations. “They discuss everything – sports, politics, economics and the weather – information I never had access to while sitting at home.”Knowledge about the weather is particularly important for Rina as flooding hampers her business. “When the water comes in, people aren’t interested in sitting around drinking tea.”As she buys her tea wholesale, grown in north-eastern districts such as Sylhet, it’s important for Rina to know of incoming natural disasters that might affect her supply, so that she can plan ahead.Mahmuda, 36, has just had a baby and is making plans on how to balance her tailoring business with motherhood. After receiving a small business loan, Mahmuda was able to establish her tailoring business, which has been going from strength to strength. Dressed in a traditional shalwar kameez she made herself, Mahmuda gently rocks baby Diya back and forth.After going into labour early and losing a lot of blood, the doctors thought both mother and baby wouldn’t make it. Mahmuda was able to use the money she generated from her business to pay for hospital fees and basic necessities for her premature baby.“My business is slowly expanding, and I am able to feed my children,” she says. Mahmuda buys materials and sews clothes for the women in her community. She recently bought a wardrobe to safely store her clothing and protect it from flooding and the smell of the draining system outside her home.Mahmuda lives with her baby and two young sons, sick husband and elderly mother – all of whom she supports financially. Her father left when she was small, so Mahmuda’s mother raised her on her own. She is happy to now be able to take care of her in return. “I am also able to maintain my sons’ educational expenses, which I couldn’t do before – it was a real struggle to pay their tuition fees every month.”Every morning, before the sun rises, Mukhal, 28, sets off on a small dinghy to the local fish market. Dressed in a black burka and face veil so as not to draw attention, Mukhal is one of the few women who can be found in a market mostly dominated by men. Over time she has been able to develop her negotiation skills, so she gets a better price for the catch. She then fills her basket and carries it back to her village, where she sells the fish to her neighbours.Mukhal has led a difficult life. Forced into marriage at the age of 12 when her father died, she became pregnant at 15, and was beaten then abandoned by her husband who took another wife. Her home is on the banks of the river and prone to flooding. “Everything I do is for my son. My only hope is to be the best mother that I can be. I don’t want my son to live this kind of life – I want him to be educated and to have a good job. He wants to be an engineer! I work hard to pay for his education, so he doesn’t have to struggle like me.”Also driven by a strong desire to help her family, Chompa, 15, currently works in an electronics factory. Her father was a rickshaw puller, but because of his old age and the flooding from heavy rain, such arduous work has become difficult. So Chompa is now the main breadwinner in her family, spending all day at a factory where she uses her small hands to put together electronic goods destined for faraway places worlds she catches brief glimpses of through the TV screens that she helps assemble.Chompa earns approximately 4,000 taka (£36.30) a month, which she puts towards rent, food and her parents’ medicines. But a few months ago, while building a fan, it suddenly switched on and the blades sliced off three of her fingers. “There was blood everywhere,” she says. “After a few seconds, I passed out.” Though the factory covered her hospital bill, and at this time she is still receiving her monthly salary, a future without able hands feels uncertain – she says she is likely to be downgraded or dismissed from her role.“What can I expect from this life?” she asks. “I have many dreams, but there are no opportunities.” She wishes she could attend school, but like many young girls from Barishal, this isn’t always an option. One day, when she is old enough, Chompa wants to own a business. She has seen the examples of other women in her community achieving success providing her with glimmers of hope that another reality is not only possible, it is within reach."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d71d20b05f7502215e0057e08765c15c2c14cff2/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91fac71b4d7a256d09937f6d3c64f2bc","title":"destination to revisit in future win 200 pounds sawdays stay coronavirus readers tips travel","story":"Tell us about a destination full of memories for you – that you’d love to return to once the Covid-19 crisis is overFirst of all, many apologies to readers who contributed to last week’s assignment on wildlife reserves, but we’ve had to postpone its publication given the Covid-19 crisis and government warnings on social distancing and travel.

Built in the Andes at 2,430 metres above sea level around AD1450, Machu Picchu was created without wheels or animals to transport the huge stones up the mountainside. A series of 360-degree images on YouVisit’s virtual tour explore various areas of the site. The tour also includes a voiceover guide with information on the architecture, history and resident alpacas. For a bird’s-eye view, head to Air Pano for stunning interactive images, including from the summit of Machu Picchu mountain. •  Travel’s Will Coldwell accompanied the Google Trekker team when they mapped Machu Picchu in 2015On the edge of the desert where the sand ends and modern Cairo begins, the pyramids of Giza were constructed around 4,500 years ago as grand tombs for the pharaohs. With walking routes around the site, this virtual tour shows the magnificent structures from near and far. This includes two of the largest pyramids ever built – the Great Pyramid (147 metres) and the Pyramid of Khafre (136 metres) – plus the Great Sphinx to the east.See one of the world’s most visited monuments on this interactive tour, which takes travellers up to the viewing platform of the 324-metre tower – give or take 18cm, which is how much the iron contracts and expands by – depending on the ambient temperature. Additional immersive digital exhibitions explore its construction, from 1887-89, with photos of the first glamorous Parisian visitors. There are also 360-degree shots showing a helicopter’s view of the tower against the city skyline.Angkor Wat, “the city of temples”, is the largest religious monument in the world, originally built as a Hindu temple complex dedicated to the god Vishnu in the first half of the 12th century, but gradually transformed into the centre of worship for Buddhism in the latter part of the same century. This virtual tour explores several of the magical temples, including the five towers of Angkor Wat itself the pink sandstone Banteay Srei and Ta Prohm (as seen in the 2001 film Lara Croft: Tomb Raider), where nature has reclaimed the ruins. For a glimpse of the living city as it would have been in the 13th century, the Virtual Angkor project includes 360-degree video simulations created collaboratively by archaeologists, historians and CGI artists.Built as the resting place for his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal, by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan, this symbol of eternal love is considered one of the most beautiful buildings ever created. The 17th-century white marble “crown of palaces” in Agra, north India, combines Persian, Islamic and Indian architectural styles and took 22 years to complete. The interactive digital pathways include routes around the mausoleum itself, reflecting pool, paradise gardens and ornate red sandstone mosque. Aerial 360-degree images soar above the lotus-topped dome and minarets for a view over the Yamuna River.The prehistoric site of Stonehenge in Wiltshire dates back 5,000 years. It was originally a simple earth enclosure used for cremations, with the ring of standing stones added around 2500BC. The stones include large sarsen blocks that archaeologists believe were brought to the site from Marlborough Downs (20 miles away) and smaller bluestones from Preseli Hills in Wales, a confounding 140 miles away. The English Heritage virtual tour includes a 360-degree interactive image from the centre of the site, with pop-out videos on its excavation, conservation and design, including as a site for celestial observation. Other interactive CGI images give more information on its construction and the landscape at different periods in its history.Once seating between 50,000 and 80,000 spectators who came through 80 entrances, the Colosseum was the world’s largest amphitheatre when it was built between AD70 and AD80 for sporting events and gladiatorial combat. Around two-thirds of the structure has been destroyed in the 2,000 years since but the remaining ruins are one of Italy’s most popular attractions. Take a walk inside, around the various levels, or fly overhead in these 360-degree images.There are many strange and wonderful architectural features within the ancient city of Chichén Itzá on Mexico’s Yucatán peninsula. El Castillo pyramid (also known as the Temple of Kukulcan, a serpent deity) at the centre has a combined 365 steps ascending its four sides. Twice a year, on the equinox, the steps cast a shadow in the shape of a serpent on the north section, which connects to a snake head sculpture at its base, meant to depict Kukulkan. The 360- aerial images explore several of the Mayan ruins, including the pyramid, the Temple of Warriors, the observatory and the nunnery."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84ab5685b3f3fd6692ff057cde698195ba9e18f8/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1fc9f577fc06760bda63f61dcfa4d98","title":"coronavirus finances working poverty us","story":"Things were looking up for our family, with a new job and a big move. Then coronavirus turned our lives upside downMy husband got a new job a few weeks ago. We moved back to the city from upstate, borrowing money from his mother to put down our security deposit. Great news, life-changing, it was supposed to be.For years, we’ve been looking for a leg up we’ve been broke and barely getting by. I’ve been working between four and six jobs at a time, and my husband had been working toward something more stable and with benefits for years. His new job will provide health insurance in three months. His commute will be 20-30 minutes instead of an hour and a half. We sunk what little money we had into moving, contingent on that new salary, contingent on me continuing to work all four jobs I’ve been working the past couple years, and prepared for our new, more comfortable life.And then the coronavirus hit.My husband’s job is in construction, which means if the economy keeps crashing, especially as he’s the last hire, I assume he’ll be the first to go. It means for him to keep it, he has to commute via New York City transit every day, which is obviously risky now.All my jobs have gone online, so I can stay home to be with our two kids, whose elementary school closed down last Monday. But this has an impact on my work. I already work on weekends and late at night and early in the morning, and also all the hours my kids are in school – I usually read between 700 and 1,000 pages of student work and books in order to teach in any single week. I manage to write as well. It has always been a lot, but I have gotten it done. Now, for maybe the first time, I do not see how I can. There are only so many weekend and early morning hours. How long can I keep this up?I’ve been putting everything on the credit card and trying not to think about it. The panic buying I did a few weeks ago – all that food that I thought would last a month – is already gone. Snacks are perhaps the most reliable distraction when you’re homebound, especially with children. We ate an entire loaf of the six-dollar challah that I’d bought the children as a treat meant to be split up over days in a single afternoon. I sat idly eating from the jar of peanut butter during our “math lesson” on Monday, only to panic when I realized that the peanut butter was almost gone. I ate the last bar of emergency chocolate I’d bought myself last night, anxious about the schools closing, and sad, as a former NYC high school teacher, about all the kids I knew who would lose so much now that they didn’t have their schools.We were on a walk last weekend and our older daughter had to go to the bathroom so we went into a nearly empty bar by our apartment. All the servers were standing by the bar talking about the virus. I was a waitress for a long time, and, though I’m trying to do my part to social distance, I wished that I could sidle up close to them and tell them how sorry and how scared for them I am. I remember the bone-deep fear of a patio shift on a Sunday when it rained unexpectedly and a day that was supposed to provide a sixth of my rent suddenly resulted in $20. I don’t need to remember those years because I’m still living them. Just two years ago – as a mother of two and the sole provider for my family – I was told my boss was stepping down and her replacement might not ask me back the next semester. That quick stop into the bar was a tangible reminder of how precarious my finances have been and continue to be.The title of this column is Two in Five, because that’s the percentage of Americans who couldn’t come up with $400 in an emergency. That’s one good brunch shift as a server in New York City 20 hours of childcare in Brooklyn a third of a six-week teaching gig at a community organization half a column at a major publication one quarter of my biweekly pay at my most well-paid adjunct job. Maybe I’m more used to being scared than people who don’t do gig work my life has been precarious for years. But also, I’m used to being one of the people bailouts and an economy on the upswing doesn’t touch. That $1.5tn dollars injected into the stock market, payroll tax cuts – these have nothing to do with our lives or our precariousness.One bad week or one lost job or cancelled shift – not to mention a pandemic – is all it takes to push us backwards. I know better than to think anyone will come and save us, better than to think our landlords will give us a break, that our ability to access healthcare or childcare won’t just disappear. And now, we’re staring down not weeks, but months, of this.Two in five of us live in constant fear of when one single catastrophe destroys us, debilitates us, gets us behind on rent or forces us to have to cancel some service or essential thing that only feels expendable now that we have no choice. We already felt, almost always, like we were one stroke shy of drowning, and now the emergency is here, it’s both invisible and unrelenting – there is no end in sight. It’s hit all of us at once."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1bd516bcb6e0d38921ca489d8e2422347f699a35/0_203_3600_2161/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b453f9b734d874319aa9848b553d5cd","title":"us election coronavirus primaries voting by mail","story":"Primaries have been delayed and conventions are in question as calls for voting by mail raise concerns of their ownWhen Spelman College announced this month it was suspending in-person classes and closing residence halls in response to coronavirus, Ashee Groce, a junior, had a question: how would she vote?Groce, who serves as president of Young Democrats of America at Spelman, had registered herself and a number of fellow students in the Atlanta area. But they had now lost their housing and would have to return home before Georgia’s presidential primary.On a press call for the not-for-profit Rock the Vote, Groce said she was grateful Georgia was one of the states that have delayed their primaries, giving her more time to figure out how to cast a ballot, but those decisions have sparked their own set of concerns.As the coronavirus outbreak spreads across America, it is wreaking havoc in an election year as Democrats pick a champion to try to oust Donald Trump from the White House.But at least 15 Democratic primaries have now been delayed because of coronavirus, essential freezing the Democratic nominating contest – currently dominated by the former vice-president Joe Biden. While state officials scramble to find safe ways for voters to cast their ballots, voting rights advocates warn that lawmakers will have to do considerable work to ensure the pandemic does not derail the presidential election.The delayed primaries are admittedly unlikely to change the final outcome of the Democratic race, considering Biden’s significant delegate lead over his rival, the democratic socialist senator Bernie Sanders. But the country’s necessary focus on coronavirus has left Biden mostly on the sidelines as he tries to pivot to his likely match-up against Donald Trump in November. The status of the party’s summer nominating convention also appears to be up in the air, which could rob Biden of another key opportunity to make his pitch to voters to choose him over Trump.Asked last week whether the convention should be canceled, Biden said no. “I don’t think it should be called off, and I don’t think we should call off any of the elections,” the candidate told CNN’s Jake Tapper. “I think we just have to move forward. We may have to use different means and methods. There’s an awful lot of direct mail voting going on right now, which may be one of the answers.”The Democratic National Committee chairman, Tom Perez, sent a similar message this month after Ohio canceled in-person voting at the last minute over concerns about spreading coronavirus at polling places. Perez said in a statement that states should focus on expanding no-excuse absentee voting and vote by mail “instead of moving primaries to later in the cycle, when timing around the virus remains unpredictable”.Sean Eldridge, the founder of the progressive group Stand Up America, said postponing primaries was unavoidable because so many states lack appropriate voting protocols to deal with such crises. “I think every state is going to have to make that choice right now, but the problem is too many states are not prepared for this moment,” Eldridge said.Eldridge’s group drove more than 70,000 constituent calls to lawmakers urging them to include funding to expand no-excuse absentee voting and vote by mail in the $2tn coronavirus package.“None of us know how long this pandemic is going to last, and we need to make sure every single eligible voter is able to cast their ballot,” Eldridge said. “If Congress provides sufficient funding to the states, then states can put that infrastructure in place now to address the coronavirus pandemic but also to be prepared for future events that could disrupt future elections.”But experts emphasize that states will need to develop a safe in-person voting option to ensure fair elections in the months to come.Certain people, such as those who are homeless or living on a Native American reservation, may not have reliable access to mail, so an entirely mail-based election could leave them behind.“There are these communities that get already wronged by our system, and they’re already getting under-resourced,” said Myrna Perez, the director of the voting rights and elections program at the Brennan Center for Justice. “Relying on the mail in that way would just bake in those existing inequalities.”Perez urged states to set rigorous sanitization standards for polling sites and ensure voters can practice social distancing while casting in-person ballots, so Americans can protect their health while voting.“We need many, many different options ready to go because we’re going to have many erse communities that need to get served, and there’s not going to be one way that is able to serve them all,” Perez said.“We all know that this pandemic has been a threat to our economy, to our health and to our democracy,” Eldridge said. “It’s important that Congress respond on all three of those fronts.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0161bbba05de1f9db2321260d44ed7b1a89d18c3/0_27_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af4f1bb07a5edef0896de0fe29b254f8","title":"are you cohabiting because of coronavirus share your stories","story":"We’d like to hear from people who have unexpectedly moved in together due to the coronavirus lockdown, and from partners who’ve had to remain apart As measures to restrict the spread of coronavirus force people to stay at home, couples who live separately have had to decide whether to move in together or remain apart for the duration of the measures.Because of the short notice of the lockdown announcement, others may have had to remain at a house which isn’t their usual home, or with people they don’t usually live with.We’d like to hear from those who’ve unexpectedly moved in together, or those who have decided to remain apart.Are you living with your new in-laws?

We are now where you will be in a few days. The epidemic’s charts show us all entwined in a parallel dance.We are but a few steps ahead of you in the path of time, just like Wuhan was a few weeks ahead of us. We watch you as you behave just as we did. You hold the same arguments we did until a short time ago, between those who still say “it’s only a flu, why all the fuss?” and those who have already understood.As we watch you from here, from your future, we know that many of you, as you were told to lock yourselves up into your homes, quoted Orwell, some even Hobbes. But soon you’ll be too busy for that.First of all, you’ll eat. Not just because it will be one of the few last things that you can still do.You’ll find dozens of social networking groups with tutorials on how to spend your free time in fruitful ways. You will join them all, then ignore them completely after a few days.You’ll pull apocalyptic literature out of your bookshelves, but will soon find you don’t really feel like reading any of it.You’ll eat again. You will not sleep well. You will ask yourselves what is happening to democracy.You’ll have an unstoppable online social life – on Messenger, WhatsApp, Skype, Zoom…You will miss your adult children like you never have before the realisation that you have no idea when you will ever see them again will hit you like a punch in the chest.Old resentments and falling-outs will seem irrelevant. You will call people you had sworn never to talk to ever again, so as to ask them: “How are you doing?” Many women will be beaten in their homes.You will wonder what is happening to all those who can’t stay home because they don’t have one. You will feel vulnerable when going out shopping in the deserted streets, especially if you are a woman. You will ask yourselves if this is how societies collapse. Does it really happen so fast? You’ll block out these thoughts and when you get back home you’ll eat again.You will put on weight. You’ll look for online fitness training.You’ll laugh. You’ll laugh a lot. You’ll flaunt a gallows humour you never had before. Even people who’ve always taken everything dead seriously will contemplate the absurdity of life, of the universe and of it all.You will make appointments in the supermarket queues with your friends and lovers, so as to briefly see them in person, all the while abiding by the social distancing rules.You will count all the things you do not need.The true nature of the people around you will be revealed with total clarity. You will have confirmations and surprises.Literati who had been omnipresent in the news will disappear, their opinions suddenly irrelevant some will take refuge in rationalisations which will be so totally lacking in empathy that people will stop listening to them. People whom you had overlooked, instead, will turn out to be reassuring, generous, reliable, pragmatic and clairvoyant.Those who invite you to see all this mess as an opportunity for planetary renewal will help you to put things in a larger perspective. You will also find them terribly annoying: nice, the planet is breathing better because of the halved CO2 emissions, but how will you pay your bills next month?You will not understand if witnessing the birth of a new world is more a grandiose or a miserable affair.You will play music from your windows and lawns. When you saw us singing opera from our balconies, you thought “ah, those Italians”. But we know you will sing uplifting songs to each other too. And when you blast I Will Survive from your windows, we’ll watch you and nod just like the people of Wuhan, who sung from their windows in February, nodded while watching us.Many of you will fall asleep vowing that the very first thing you’ll do as soon as lockdown is over is file for orce.Many children will be conceived.Your children will be schooled online. They’ll be horrible nuisances they’ll give you joy.Elderly people will disobey you like rowdy teenagers: you’ll have to fight with them in order to forbid them from going out, to get infected and die.You will try not to think about the lonely deaths inside the ICU.You’ll want to cover with rose petals all medical workers’ steps.You will be told that society is united in a communal effort, that you are all in the same boat. It will be true. This experience will change for good how you perceive yourself as an inidual part of a larger whole.Class, however, will make all the difference. Being locked up in a house with a pretty garden or in an overcrowded housing project will not be the same. Nor is being able to keep on working from home or seeing your job disappear. That boat in which you’ll be sailing in order to defeat the epidemic will not look the same to everyone nor is it actually the same for everyone: it never was.At some point, you will realise it’s tough. You will be afraid. You will share your fear with your dear ones, or you will keep it to yourselves so as not to burden them with it too.You will eat again.We’re in Italy, and this is what we know about your future. But it’s just small-scale fortune-telling. We are very low-key seers.If we turn our gaze to the more distant future, the future which is unknown both to you and to us too, we can only tell you this: when all of this is over, the world won’t be the same.© Francesca Melandri 2020.

Such businesses will required to pay at least that amount to workers – including those who have been stood down since 1 March.Scott Morrison described the measure as an “economic lifeline” at a time when the nation was fighting twin battles “against a virus and against the economic ruin that it can threaten”.The prime minister warned that the disruption caused by the pandemic was such that many countries would see their economies collapse in the months ahead.“We could see countries themselves fall into chaos – this will not be Australia,” Morrison told reporters in Canberra on Monday. “We will get Australians through this, with uniquely Australian solutions to deal with the unique Australian challenges we face here.”Morrison confirmed parliament would have to be recalled to pass the legislation, possibly as soon as next week.The announcement came as officials confirmed that Tasmania and ACT had experienced their first Covid-19 related deaths.As of Monday afternoon, there have been 4,245 confirmed cases of the illness across Australia with 18 deaths.The deputy chief medical officer, professor Paul Kelly, said while there had been a decrease in the daily growth in cases, it was “not a time to take the foot off the brake” as attempts must continue to slow the spread of the virus. He said 55 people remained in intensive care units at present. Kelly also committed to release more detail about the modelling that underpins the government’s health measures, after growing calls for the rationale to be explained at length.Morrison was due to have another teleconference with state and territory leaders on Monday evening, just a day after the national cabinet agreed to tougher restrictions on social interactions, including limiting gatherings with others outside the household to two people.The new $1,500 JobKeeper payment is an about-face for the Morrison government, which resisted union calls for a wage subsidy until employer groups joined the push last week, warning that the previous economic stimulus packages were not enough to support Australians’ jobs.The new wages subsidy aims to help employers maintain relationships with employees, even as increasingly strict restrictions force more and more businesses – particularly retail and hospitality - to shut their doors.The government says the flat payment of $1,500 per fortnight will be available for full and part time workers, sole traders, and casuals who have been with an employer for 12 months or more.“We want to keep the engine of our economy running through this crisis,” Morrison said. “It may run on idle for a time but it must continue to run.”The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said the wages subsidy built on other economic stimulus and support measures announced over the past month.“At a cost of $130bn over the next six months, we are providing support to the Australian worker like never before,” he said. “Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures.”As the coronavirus crisis has led to tighter and tighter restrictions, including forced shutdowns of certain businesses, the government has had to dramatically ratchet up the level of support to prop up the economy and support laid-off workers.Just over one week ago, the government announced an effective doubling of the jobseeker payment, previously known as Newstart, over the next six months, which prompted long queues to form outside Centrelink offices across the country.It assumed a full shutdown in the arts, entertainment, recreation, transport manufacturing and other personal service sectors declines of three-quarters of activity in hotels, restaurants, air travel, retail and wholesale trade and declines of one half in construction and professional service activities.McManus also took aim at the “simply bad communication by governments, state and federal, that led to panic” among employers.The Morrison government had suggested employers “could let people go and they’d be looked after by the social security system” while state governments had suggested that some employers were not essential, she said.On Monday the shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, promised Labor would support “any additional measures which will get more help to more Australians more quickly” - but warned while it would be constructive it would not be “silent”.“Where there are obvious gaps or where there are obvious flaws or where there is a lack of urgency, we will make those points as well,” he said.Chalmers said wage subsidies had been delayed because the Coalition had dismissed “sometimes ridiculing, the good ideas that Labor and others in our community, the unions, have put forward”.The government also confirmed on Monday that it would temporarily ease the partner income test that applies to the JobSeeker Payment. It will now be available to eligible people so long as their partner earns less than $79,762 a year. Previously it was set around $48,000, meaning that many recently laid-off workers would have missed out on the payment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7200859fb487792e1336e456cb1a1b0c126614c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c3503426875ecac8614c1ddb0a46742","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:Covid-19 infections worldwide have risen to 732,000, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. The US had the most cases, with over 142,000 Italy was second with nearly 98,000 and Spain has passed China’s 82,000 cases with 85,000. Italy still had the highest death toll, with nearly 10,800. Spain was second with 7,340. More than 2,500 people have died in the US.Europe’s largest capital and Africa’s most populous city have gone into lockdown and countries including the US have prolonged and tightened already strict confinement orders as the coronavirus epidemic continues to spread across the globe. Moscow on Monday imposed strict isolation measures after many residents ignored official requests to stay indoors. In Italy, which accounts for a third of all global deaths from Covid-19, the government meanwhile warned citizens should be ready for a lengthy confinement that would only be lifted gradually.The spread of coronavirus in the UK is showing early signs of slowing, according to Prof Neil Ferguson, a key epidemiologist advising the government. Ferguson, whose modelling informed the government’s decision to impose a lockdown, said the data was showing signs that social distancing measures were beginning to work, although it has not yet had an effect on the number of daily reported deathsSpain, one of the European countries worst hit by the coronavirus pandemic, has logged a slight fall in the number of people dying from the disease after days of record death tolls. Figures released by the ministry of health recorded that 812 people died from the virus between Sunday and Monday. The news came as Fernando Simón, the head of Spain’s centre for health emergencies and the public face of the government’s response, awaited the results of testing after displaying symptoms of Covid-19.Donald Trump has acknowledged the scale of possible fatalities from Covid-19 in the US, while extending social distancing rules until 30 April. The president said if his administration kept deaths under 100,000 it would have done a “very good job”, bringing him closer in line with the top US diseases expert, Anthony Fauci, who suggested on Sunday deaths could reach 200,000. Trump also claimed his push to reopen the country by Easter had only been “aspirational”, now saying he hoped normality might return by 1 June.Organisers of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics are in final-stage discussions to hold the opening ceremony for the rescheduled Games on 23 July 2021, according to reports in Japan. In the UK, Wimbledon organisers are set to announce the cancellation of the 2020 tournament on Wednesday due to the coronavirus pandemic, according to a senior German tennis official.Asymptomatic people may be infecting others in China despite officials saying the risk of this is low, it has emerged. As China relaxes lockdown measures and people return to work, ​​authorities are concerned about the possibility that asymptomatic carriers will continue spreading the virus.A breathing aid that should help keep coronavirus-19 patients out of intensive care has been developed in Britain by a group including University College London researchers and the Mercedes Formula One team. Mercedes said that they can distribute up to 1,000 a day of the trials set to start this week are successful.New rules restricting group meetings outside to just two people came into force on Monday, as children’s playgrounds, outdoor gyms and skateparks were closed in an attempt to stop the spread of the virus. So far the country has more than 4,000 cases and 16 deaths.The virus has continued to wreak havoc in the aviation sector. EasyJet has grounded its entire fleet of aircraft for at least two months while Virgin Atlantic has reportedly asked the UK government for emergency financial help. Thai Airways International said it may permanently reduce the number of aircraft types it deploys once the coronavirus outbreak ends."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a27694cabab8fe4fd2a89b43d6c9d20d529367ff/0_56_4434_2661/master/4434.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac8e880bc92b05e71f51d35f22484bad","title":"coronavirus symptoms what are they should i call doctor covid 19","story":"What are the symptoms caused by the Covid-19 virus, how does it spread, and should you call a doctor?It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has transferred to humans from animals. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.No. In the UK, the NHS advice is now that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. This applies to everyone, regardless of whether they have travelled abroad.In the UK, you should look on the dedicated coronavirus NHS 111 website for information. If you get worse or your symptoms last longer than seven days, you should call NHS 111. People will no longer be tested for the virus unless they are in hospital.Many countries have imposed travel bans and lockdown conditions in order to try and halt the spread of the virus. You should check with your local authorities for the latest advice on seeking medical assistance.China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January.As of 30 March, more than 720,000 people have been infected in more than 150 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.There have been over 34,000 deaths globally. Just over 3,000 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China, where the coronavirus was first recorded in the city of Wuhan. Italy has been hardest hit, though, with over 10,000 fatalities, and Spain has seen more than 6,800 deaths. The US now has more confirmed cases than any other country. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.More than 150,000 people are recorded as having recovered from the coronavirus.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6dee53ed3a9f5ab0dac3511d8dd5300f66faf65/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6545e252bfa8f09bf05d37da87ef68ec","title":"coronavirus uk how many confirmed cases are in your area","story":"Latest figures from public health authorities on the spread of Covid-19 in the United Kingdom.

Less so in deaths because deaths are lagged by long time from when the measures come into force.“But we look at the numbers of new hospital admissions today, for instance, that does seem to be slowing down a little bit now. It’s not yet plateaued as the numbers are increasing each day but the rate of that increase has slowed.“We see similar patterns in a number of European countries.”Ferguson said the next crucial step was the antibody test that can tell whether people have already had the virus and is in the “final stages of validation”, with hopes that it could be operational within days.Ferguson’s assessment provides some hope that the lockdown could work, but he acknowledged testing would need to be ramped up.Helen Whately, a health minister, told the same programme that the government was hugely increasing testing, including of NHS staff.However, she acknowledged that still only 7,000 people were tested on Sunday, despite the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, and the health secretary, Matt Hancock, claiming the level is now at 10,000 tests a day. Whately said that was the new “capacity” but it had not yet been reached.The government announced in early March it would be testing 10,000 people a day, before increasing that target to 25,000. However, it has taken weeks to get the tests and laboratories ready for 10,000 tests, meaning many NHS workers are just starting to get tested.Whately also declined to speculate on when the UK’s lockdown may end, after Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer, said on Sunday that restrictions could last three to six months."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85d8d08f4b246a3b32ef41a3fad6ce0ab7cf49bc/93_15_1789_1075/master/1789.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ffedda1f470daf8dac8a29885b59cb4","title":"photography then and now berlin before and during coronavirus","story":"Photographs taken in Berlin before and since the coronavirus outbreak began reveal an increasingly familiar emptying of urban social spacesby Photographs by Fabrizio BenschReutersThe number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Germany has risen to 57,298 and 455 people have died of the disease here, statistics from the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases showed on Monday.Germany has been testing around 120,000 people a week, according to NPR, which is partly why this daily rise in confirmed cases is so high.

Photograph: James FordeThe Office of Public Works (OPW) has been given permission for extensive refurbishment of a historic house in the Phoenix Park after scrapping plans to use the property for Airbnb-style letting.Last May the OPW sought planning permission from Dublin City Council to refurbish Rose Cottage, formerly the home of the head deer keeper, and use it for “short-term holiday letting”.Planning permission is required to change the use of a dwelling from a permanent home to short-term letting accommodation. Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy last July introduced additional regulations for the holiday let sector following concerns the proliferation of “Airbnb-style” rentals was reducing the supply of housing, particularly in Dublin.Several politicians and local residents’ groups objected to the OPW’s short-term letting plan for the cottage, which is close to the Ordinance Survey headquarters in the park.Labour’s Joan Burton, who was a local TD at the time, said the restored cottage should be made available for housing for park staff. She warned that the park’s wildlife, particularly the deer, might be “harassed” by holiday-makers.Fianna Fáil councillor Mary Fitzpatrick said the OPW’s application was “foolish” in light of the housing crisis in Dublin. “It’s a long-standing tradition that these lodges have been allocated to park constables, rangers and other members of the park staff so that they are close by during emergencies,” she said.Local residents’ group the Navan Road Community Council said the proposal was “wrong” when people were homeless, and suggested Garda vetting of guests would be necessary due to the proximity of Áras An Uachtaráin, the US ambassador’s residence, Garda headquarters and Farmleigh House. Material changeThe council’s planning department indicated to the OPW it was unlikely to approve the letting plan, noting Dublin city, including the Phoenix Park, was a designated rent pressure zone. “A short-term letting use of the cottage is therefore a material change of use from the established permanent residential use.” There was an “objection in principle to the proposed use”, it said.The OPW withdrew the application, but said refurbishment was still required, and last September submitted a fresh application for those works only.Rose Cottage, which dates from about 1800, is one of about 40 park lodges, several of which are occupied by park staff. The cottage was vacated in the last decade and has fallen into disrepair. Following the granting of permission by the council, the OPW will now restore the cottage and remove 20th century interventions, such as PVC downpipes, concrete roof tiles and modern doors and windows. They will be replaced with appropriate “conservation” materials. Renovation workIt is understood the use of the cottage after the renovation work has yet to be determined. The city council has said it is its policy to consider the contribution of existing uses to the special interest of an area when assessing change-of-use applications, and will “promote compatible uses which ensure future long-term viability”.While the OPW has not used any of the park’s lodges for short-term lets, it has leased a number of other OPW properties around the State, including lighthouses and schoolhouses, to the Irish Landmark Trust for holiday lettings."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4215133.1585496545!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cocooning q a how does it work who must do it can people visit my home","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTony McGrath (76) ‘cocooning’ at his home in Drumcondra, Dublin. Cocooning is now required for everyone over the age of 70 as a measure to limit the spread of Covid-19. Photograph: © Fran Veale As part of the latest emergency measures in the fight against Covid-19 the Government has introduced “cocooning” to help protect the most vulnerable in society. What is cocooning?According to a document released by the HSE, cocooning is a measure to protect people who are over 70 years of age or those who are extremely medically vulnerable by minimising all interaction between them and others. How does it work?Essentially, people in these two categories should not leave their homes at all, even if they feel fit and well. Iniduals who are advised to cocoon should not go to the shops, leave home or garden, or attend any gatherings.People should also avoid all non-essential face-to-face interaction and instead stay connected to friends and family through the phone or internet.Who does this apply to?The Government has released a list of people who should strictly adhere to the cocooning practices. They include people who are 70 years or older, solid organ transplant recipients and people with severe respiratory conditions including cystic fibrosis, severe asthma and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).Other “medically vulnerable” categories include people with specific cancers, iniduals with rare diseases and inborn errors of metabolism that significantly increase the risk of infections, people on immunosuppression therapies and women who are pregnant with significant heart disease, congenital or acquired.How will I get food and medicine?The HSE has said that family, friends and neighbours can support you once you adhere to cocooning guidelines and they adhere to physical distancing guidelines. They also advise that iniduals use online services where possible.Assistance is also being made available through the local authorities, working with voluntary sector services, to ensure you can have access to food, essential household supplies and medicines. Each local authority will publish contact details for this service.How long are these new rules in place?The new measures and restrictions are in place until Easter. However, the HSE said this period is being kept under review.Can people still visit my home?Visits from people who provide essential support to you such as healthcare, personal support with your daily needs or social care should continue, the Government has said.However, carers and care workers must stay away if they have any symptoms of Covid-19.The Government advice also states that regular visitors should not attend your home unless they are providing essential care such as help with washing, dressing or feeding.

Photograph: Tom HonanThe Government should consider closing the country’s borders to prevent new coronavirus infections coming into the State, one of the leading infectious diseases experts has said.Dr Paddy Mallon, a consultant at St Vincent’s University Hospital in Dublin and professor of microbial diseases at UCD, said a major risk to the State was more new Covid-19 infections coming in.“We have got our own outbreak in the country that we are trying to extinguish but the big threat is new infections coming in,” he said.“We should be looking seriously over the next week at protecting our borders and stopping new infections coming in because it will give us the ability to control the infections that we have.”The warning comes as the Health Service Executive said it was “impossible to predict” the timing of the peak of infections but it was planning for the worst of the crisis to hit by mid-April.Prof Sam McConkey of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland called for political leadership to build a “unity government that helps us beat the virus in the next few months” in order to fast-track debate on possible stricter travel and quarantine rules and tracing technology for iniduals.“In a political system that is used to slow deliberation, it will not be an easy task to achieve an agreed outcome in a few days,” Prof McConkey writes in an opinion piece in Monday’s .Ages of deadState officials reported another 10 deaths from coronavirus, bringing the death toll from the disease in the Republic to 46. There were a further 200 cases confirmed, bring the total to 2,615.A further six deaths and 86 new cases were reported in Northern Ireland, bringing the total number of deaths on the island of Ireland to 67 and cases to 3,025.Details of the ages of the first 33 people to die from coronavirus in the Republic were disclosed in official figures over the weekend. Some 29 of the dead – as of March 26th – were over the age of 65, while one person died from each of the 25-34, 35-44, 45-54 and 55-64 age groups.The number of critically ill Covid-19 patients in intensive care units (ICU) was more evenly spread, with the youngest aged between five and 14. Thirty-three were aged between 45 and 64, and 24 people were over 65.The HSE said it was preparing for a surge of coronavirus cases with 1,200 critical care beds, but could not say by how much the State’s ICU capacity would be exceeded at peak.ICU concernsSome 88 Covid-19-infected patients were in ICU on Saturday and there were 167 ICU beds still available, as the HSE scales up the number of critical care beds with life-saving ventilators.Paul Reid, chief executive of the HSE, said given the surge in critically ill Covid-19 patients needing ICU beds – almost a sevenfold increase in over nine days – the possibility of the State’s ICU bed capacity being reached in just more than two weeks was “a very significant concern”.Health officials warned the public that complying with the Government’s “cocooning” direction for the over-70s and the medically vulnerable to stay at home for two weeks was “critical” to avoid ICU units being overrun by mid-April. Such compliance was also critical to avoid those at greatest risk of death being infected.The first shipment of vitally needed personal protective equipment, part of a €28 million order, arrived on an Aer Lingus flight from China on Sunday afternoon.However, new issues emerged with testing for Covid-19 as Mr Reid said the State was “hitting very significant pinch points” in carrying out tests, due to the shortage of reagents, the extraction element used in test kits that go to laboratories.A lack of testing kits led to the closure of the State’s largest testing facility at the Páirc uí Chaoimh GAA ground in Cork. The HSE said there had been “limited testing nationally” on Sunday due to the short supply of testing materials.More than 15,000 people are still waiting to be tested.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4215724.1585568022!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus total of 389 000 apply for unemployment payment in two weeks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLiz Canavan, assistant secretary for social policy for the Taoiseach, during a press conference last week.

Photograph: John McVitty Retired Fermanagh civil servant Tom Best last saw his wife of 51 years alive when she was being placed in an ambulance and driven away from the couple’s Derrylin, Co Fermanagh, home last Wednesday afternoon.Seventy-two-year-old Anne began to complain of severe pains last Monday. Given the arrival of Covid-19, and her underlying medical conditions, the couple’s doctor, Michelle McBrien quickly called an ambulance.Within 24 hours, her condition worsened and she died in Enniskillen’s South West Acute Hospital without seeing her husband again. Anne Best was the first person to die of Covid-19 in the county.Typically, Fermanagh’s funerals are like those elsewhere on the island, where the bereaved enjoy neighbours’ support as they cope with loss. Today, that is no longer possible. Covid-19 has changed the way people live and die.On Saturday, Anne was buried at St Ninnidh’s cemetery in Derrylin, again without her husband watching over her. He has been told to self-isolate at home for 14 days, unable to say farewell to his soulmate.Under a bright blue sky, there was no funeral. A handful of mourners watched from afar as the coffin with a single white rose was lowered by gloved gravediggers. Parish priest Gerard Alwill read prayers. Undertaker Pat Blake stood nearby.‘Take notice’“It’s breaking my heart, it’s just breaking my heart that I couldn’t be there when she died, or at the funeral,” an emotional Tom told the Impartial Reporter newspaper, in an interview he wanted to do “to make people take notice”.Clutching a photograph of his wife, Tom paced up and down his garden, a short distance from where his wife was being laid to rest. It was all that he could do.“I am not going to break all the rules and walk up there and see her. I’m not going to do that because that would not be right it would be selfish on all the people of Derrylin,” he said.Recalling how his wife had begun to feel unwell, Tom said: “She said ‘I feel awful, awful sick’. There was a lot of moaning . . . if you could hear someone groaning and moaning. And she could take pain,” he said.Because he was unable to leave his home and due to hospital restrictions, Tom could not be by his wife’s side. Later, he received the heartbreaking call from a hospital doctor telling him of his wife’s death.‘Fall apart’“I got a call on the Wednesday night explaining that things were not looking good. I’ve been around a lot of death over the years and I can put two and two together. When it comes to your own door, you just fall apart and that is a fact.“I told the doctor whatever you are doing, you are doing your best. Then he said the next call will be the one to tell me she was gone. ‘You can be expecting it’ he said,” explained Tom. That call duly came.With tears rolling down his face, he struggled with loss remembering some little things they enjoyed together – a favourite TV crime series or his habit of making her breakfast each morning. From now, he will be in the house alone.“What impact has it had on me since she died? That’s the big...you know, I don’t know what I can do. The last time I saw her was when she was being put into the ambulance and looking down and that’s it.“It’s heartbreaking, it’s heartbreaking. I wouldn’t wish it on anyone, that is a fact. Maybe some good will come out of it. It is unimaginable, I don’t think we have ever faced anything like this in our time, in my 77 years anyhow.“You might wonder why I wanted to cook her breakfast and do things for her,” he said, folding the photograph of the couple’s wedding day in Gibraltar in 1969 and placing it back into his pocket.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4215236.1585504727!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"labour td says party should consider taking part in government","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSeán Sherlock of the Labour Party: strong supporter of Alan Kelly for the party leadership. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillA senior Labour Party TD has said the party should consider coalition with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael if no other option works out.In a significant development, Cork East TD Seán Sherlock became the first of the party’s six-strong Dáil group to say publicly that Labour should not exclude itself from government-formation talks.“A lot of people have contacted me about that possibility,” he said. “It is something that is increasingly coming into focus in my view,” he said.“If the Green Party and the Social Democrats rule out coalition with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, and if a government of national unity does not come about, then it is something that Labour needs to consider if it means that a stable government can be established.”After a disappointing election in which it lost one seat from its 2016 result, the Labour Party decided it would be better off going into opposition for this Dáil term, in order to rebuild the party.Leader Brendan Howlin subsequently announced he was standing down. The outcome of the month-long leadership contest between Aodhán Ó Ríordáin and Alan Kelly will be known next weekend.The coronavirus emergency, in addition to decisions by other small parties to rule themselves out of a coalition involving Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, is seen by some within the Labour Party as having changed the dynamic. There has been speculation that a new leader could signal a change of strategy by the party in favour of talks on government formation.Kelly supporterMr Sherlock is a strong supporter of Mr Kelly in the leadership race. However, other supporters of the Tipperary TD have continued to express opposition to the party going into government now.“We are halfway through this leadership election, and both sides agree it’s extremely tight. We’re confident of the level of support we are receiving. I don’t know what Alan Kelly’s view is but mine is clear.”Dublin councillor and Seanad candidate Rebecca Moynihan echoed that view. “We haven’t got a mandate to go into government,” she said. “There are other parties with bigger mandates who are in a better position to govern.”“I would be surprised if either candidate for the leadership thought differently.”Challenging timeThe Green Party and the Social Democrats have strongly ruled out any arrangement with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. The former wants a government of national unity to be formed for the duration of the crisis. The Social Democrats have said they may be willing to talk with one of the parties but not with both together.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said that a coalition involving his party and Fianna Fáil, supported only by Independents, would not work as it would not give the State a stable government in what would be a very difficult, chastened, and economically challenging time as Ireland struggled to recover from Covid-19.The nine-strong regional group of Independents is seen as the most likely target, although other Independents such as Michael Fitzmaurice, Michael McNamara, Marian Harkin – as well as some of the rural group of six TDs, including Mattie McGrath and the Healy-Raes – are also said to be interested.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4206213.1584564281!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu sets out proposals for close uk ties after brexit talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Union chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and the British prime minister’s Europe adviser David Frost in Brussels on March 2nd. Photograph: Oliver HosletReutersThe European Union released a draft of its hoped-for future relationship deal with Britain on Wednesday, setting out ambitions for a tight relationship on trade and security.The 440-page document crosses several of Britain’s red lines, spelling out the bloc’s ambitions for Britain to agree “uniform implementation” of state subsidy rules, with the European Court of Justice remaining the adjudicating authority.It also makes reference to the so-called “level playing field”, provisions to ensure fair competition by keeping rules aligned, which London has already rejected.“The Parties recognise that the establishment of conditions that ensure a level playing field between the Parties is necessary for trade and investment between the Union and the United Kingdom, ” the draft reads.The EU’s draft envisages reciprocal access to waters for fishing rights, with negotiations held each year by December 10th on fishing opportunities for the following year, another contentious point.The UK negotiating team said it had also sent a draft to the EU. This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4215656.1585561761!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dominic cummings develops coronavirus symptoms","story":" The coronavirus outbreak at the heart of the British government spread on Monday with prime minister Boris Johnson’s senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, self-isolating with symptoms just days after the British leader himself tested positive.A Downing Street spokesman confirmed a Daily Mail report that Mr Cummings, one of the most powerful men in the government, had developed symptoms of Covid-19 over the weekend and was now self-isolating.Mr Johnson on Friday became the first leader of a major world power to test positive for the virus.

Not even the country’s most senior health officials can say with certainty the trajectory of the US outbreak, but that has not stopped politicians speculating. Steny Hoyer, the second most senior Democrat in the House of Representatives, said: If it comes to it, and we still have the virus ... and best practices is being away from one another, disaggregated, then I think we ought to go to an election by mail.He added: “I think it\u0027s very, very important for the American people to be able to select as a commander-in-chief, particularly at the time when we have great challenges in our country, the person of their choice. So I would be opposed to delaying the November election.”The suggestion is not without controversy. The impact on voter turnout and whether it would favour some demographics over others is unknown and untested. Richard Blumenthal, the Democratic senator from Connecticut, has suggested more absentee or remote voting could be used to make sure voting happens safely. He has also talked about rethinking “how we can allocate space and distribute people so they’re not standing next to each other in polling places.” Mr Blumenthal said: We’re the United States of America. Democracies can conquer these kinds of logistical challenges. We should plan to have our election in November.”Sherrod Brown, the Democratic senator from Ohio, has been among those who has raised the possibility of Mr Trump trying to push back the date for the presidential election. He made the remark when discussing Ohio’s decision to delay its vote due earlier this month in the Democratic presidential nomination race over coronavirus concerns. Mr Brown said his “concern” was that “the president might ask for a delay in the November election based on something, perhaps this, perhaps something else”. However there is no evidence that Mr Trump would consider such a radical step. In fact he has recently talked about the importance of keeping polls open in tough times. Pressed on whether states should push back primaries in the Democratic race at a recent White House press briefing, Mr Trump demurred, declining to back the move. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/03/27/TELEMMGLPICT000228614307_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"herd immunity way impasse","story":"Sweden has taken the herd immunity approach to dealing with Covid-19Just over two weeks ago Patrick Vallance told the Today programme that the government’s strategy for fighting the Covid-19 outbreak was built around herd immunity. This is a tried and tested method for managing outbreaks of infectious disease: once a sufficiently large proportion of the population has some form of immunity, acquired either through vaccination or surviving a disease, it becomes impossible for it to spread. Herd immunity worked for smallpox and it worked for measles - or at least it did until the anti-vaxxers decided that they would exercise their freedom of choice by refusing to immunise themselves or their children.The problem with herd immunity acquired through infection is that it comes at a price: namely that, in this first epidemic (and be in no doubt that this is not the only outbreak of Covid-19 that we will endure), the disease runs riot and the mortality is substantial. A large number of at-risk people will die while the rest of the population is acquiring immunity. This is likely why, once the reality of what herd immunity implies had started to dawn on the population at large, we have heard no more about it.The alternative strategy is to do what China and, to a lesser extent, Israel have done. In China the state knows where you are, or more specifically, where your mobile phone is at any given time. It can prevent you attending subversive events, it can tell whether you really are off sick or have just decided to spend a lazy day in bed. It can tell immediately if you have decided to breach the curfew, send a drone to tell you off and deliver an on-the-spot fine.In 1948, the government of Israel declared a state of emergency to enable it to manage the war that followed the founding of the nation that state of emergency has been in place ever since. History has shown repeatedly that liberties surrendered, however noble the cause, may be a long time returning.So there is both a medical and a philosophical reason why the authoritarian approach is not necessarily the answer.Medically, fighting an epidemic by suppressing it through draconian restrictions of liberty achieves the opposite of herd immunity. It ensures that the majority of survivors have no immunity and so are at just as much risk next time around. Of course, the advocates of this approach are banking on the development of vaccines and other therapies for the management of the next epidemic. But a usable vaccine will almost certainly not be available by the time this disease comes back for an encore. Novel treatments based on anti-malarial drugs and antibiotics will also need to be evaluated in proper clinical trials. So, we will have to do the same again next time with the attendant risks to the economy and the fabric of society.The philosophical question therefore is, in fighting this disease, what kind of society and economy do we want to leave to our children and grandchildren? To what extent are we prepared to throw the baby out with the bathwater?Much has been written and said about how this is the greatest emergency facing our nation – indeed, the world – since the Second World War. Then, more than 30 million people died fighting fascist ideology. There are few who question the justness of that struggle.For centuries we have found no difficulty in asking young men and women to put their lives at risk in defence of our democracy, to say nothing of asking them to do so in pursuit of some often questionable economic and colonial aims. The difference this time is that it would be those of us in the last third of our lives being asked to bear the greatest risk as opposed to those who should still have decades of life ahead of them.I strongly suspect that herd immunity has not disappeared from the agenda of the Cobra committee. I certainly hope that is the case because, when our children and grandchildren emerge blinking into the post-apocalyptic dawn I, for one, hope that the society into which they emerge is broadly-speaking the same as the one in which I have lived my life – not one that resembles the People’s Republic of China.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

They’re a great bunch, traffic wardens. They routinely remember that our cars need love too, and go to the trouble of giving them a card. I won’t hear a word said against them. This leaves two practical questions.Are these new free parking rules the same as Monopoly? And if so, are we also in for a surprise windfall, with random amounts of money pinned behind our windscreen wipers when we park in the right spot?. The government may be playing by the official rules, which any board game pedant will tell you makes Free Parking a meaningless square, but then those at Westminster seem in the mood for dishing out money at the moment... Unless you’re self-employed.Secondly, how exactly can we benefit from more parking spaces being available when, by and large we aren’t driving anywhere? That takes less inventive thinking. This is a great opportunity to really wind up your least favourite neighbour. Elsewhere the Mercedes F1 team has added its engineering might to the cause, developing a breathing aid with the help of University College London and University College London Hospital.

This week the number of deaths related to the coronavirus is probably going to rise considerably: what happened on the Continent will happen to us. It is a test not only of our resources but also our character, and we can emerge from this crisis a better country or a worse one. In that spirit, I am making two pleas to reason.First, don’t panic. It is not helpful. People are going to die and we are doing our best as a nation to save them. But, as Carlo Rovelli, the physicist and philosopher, said last week, to see this as a battle between life and death can only lead to despair because that is a war we all lose in the end. Rather, this is a fight “to give us a little more life”, which is a beautiful way to describe medicine. Seen from that perspective the coronavirus is a challenge, not a nemesis.Unfortunately, some people have gone a little mad in the past few days, typified by the overblown reaction to the news that Boris himself has caught the virus. “Oh my God,” someone posted on Facebook. “Oh my God.”Why? All he has is mild symptoms, which is all that the vast majority of people who catch it will ever get. To say such a thing gets you accused of heartlessness, but we have got to stay rational, we have got to maintain perspective. It is not fair to jump down the throat of every employer who tries to keep a business open it is not right that the police are asking us to spy on rule breakers. If a journalist raises doubts about the strategy, it does not mean they don’t care – they are expressing their right to dissent, often with courage. Fear is not conducive to rational debate. It is at times like these, when forced to watch the utter hysteria of television news, that you understand how a society talks itself into a war or a witchhunt.And that is my second plea: let’s not abandon our freedom. According to a  poll, 86 per cent of us are willing to give up our civil liberties to help beat the coronavirus – and I think they mean (I hope they mean) temporarily and voluntarily, in which case I entirely agree. Self-sacrifice is good: the proper spirit should be “I am happy to stay at home if it helps save lives”. But it should not be “I will do as I’m told because I’m terrified and the state knows best”. If that’s the way a majority of us now think then, in the long run, we really are doomed. A society that does not instinctively cherish freedom will eventually lose it.I say this not out of self-indulgence: on the contrary, I am practically a hermit and can live cooped up like this for as long as it takes. No, I am alarmed that powers of arrest and detention have been dramatically strengthened that new jury trials have been suspended that prisoners are now forced to spend up to 23 hours a day in their cells and are banned from seeing friends and family that parole board hearings have been cancelled. Maybe all this is necessary and justifiable, but we have got to question it and we must stay on guard against Big Brother. How far we are willing to go to protect human rights is just as important a test of a nation’s character as what we will do to protect human life.When the history of this emergency is written, let it be noted that the Government’s instinct was not to shut the churches. The churches insisted upon it.The first published set of lockdown guidelines stated that while public services had to end, churches should otherwise stay open “for solitary prayer”, in effect giving them the status of an essential journey. The Catholic Bishops’ Conference then put out a statement that said church prayer does not meet that definition, civil servants had not thought this through, the Government was wrong and their temples should be shuttered. The Anglicans went even further and banned their priests from going into their own churches. You could infer that the Government has a higher opinion of the importance of church prayer than some Christian authorities.Thankfully, you can still watch Mass online, which I did yesterday in bed with a cup of tea (breaking every rule in the book). Other Christians have been more proactive. I know of priests who are delivering the last rites to people dying with the virus. In Italy, a priest suffering from the disease gave up his ventilator to help a younger patient. And Pope Francis’s blessing to an empty square at St Peter’s was Francis at his best: human, direct, pastoral. Some of the churches in Rome have been reopened after an initial order to shut them. “Drastic measures,” said the Pope, “are not always good”, and he urged clerics to stay with the people, not to abandon them.So what will historians say? They might conclude that while millions of Christians responded heroically, the Church establishment retreated into health and safety, not only because they wanted to do no harm but because Western society is post-religious, science has won, doctors are the new priests and the Church is not sure what to say or if anyone is even listening. They are wrong. This is a fight for life and many of us believe it necessitates prayer. The churches should reopen.Church of EnglandThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

It shows what can be done when universities, industry and hospitals join forces for the national good.CPAP machines are routinely used by the NHS to support patients in hospital or at home with breathing difficulties, but are said to be in short supply currently.They work by pushing a mix of oxygen and air into the mouth and nose at a continuous rate, helping to increase the amount of oxygen entering the lungs.Professor Rebecca Shipley, director of the UCL Institute of Healthcare Engineering, said: It\u0027s been a privilege to work closely with our clinical colleagues and with doctors leading the Covid-19 response in China and Italy.This close contact has helped us to define the need and respond with technology that we hope will support the NHS in the weeks and months to come.Professor Tim Baker, from UCL\u0027s department of mechanical engineering, said: Given the urgent need, we are thankful that we were able to reduce a process that could take years down to a matter of days.From being given the brief, we worked all hours of the day, disassembling and analysing an off-patent device.Using computer simulations, we improved the device further to create a state-of-the-art version suited to mass production.We were privileged to be able to call on the capability of Formula One.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/01/06/06/gettyimages-1197751302.jpg","title":"brian cox succession desert island discs socialism","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Veteran actor appeared on Radio 4’s ‘Desert Island Discs’ to speak about his career, childhood, and favourite songsSuccession\u0026nbspstar Brian Cox is the latest guest to appear with host Lauren Laverne on\u0026nbspDesert Island Discs,\u0026nbspwhere he spoke about his life, career, and favourite music.\u0026nbspThe Golden Globe-winning actor, who plays multi-millionaire antagonist Logan Roy on the hit HBO show, said his socialism is rooted in his experience of poverty as a child.His father died when he was eight years old, and his mother was placed\u0026nbspin an institution after suffering from severe mental illness.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“When you know poverty you know what socialism is and that we have to look after our people,” Cox\u0026nbspsaid.Brian Cox: ‘I look at the Labour Party and I see antiquated socialism’The 73-year-old also admitted that he is a “bit of a hoarder” when it comes to clothes, and chose a sewing kit as his luxury item for the island.“It is one of those things you are left with, an insecurity.

There is no shortage of food, just an excess of demand as people stock up. So far, at least.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhen it comes to making sure everyone is fed, the front line of the fight is not in the pasta aisle at Tesco as shoppers scrap it out for the last pack of fusilli, but in fields up and down the country.British farmers warned this week of a coronavirus-induced labour shortage that could see millions of tonnes of strawberries, cabbages, apples, cauliflower lettuce and more rotting in the fields.‘Green lanes’ could ease shortages of fruit and veg to European shopsFor many years, the bounty of Britain\u0027s agricultural land has been picked and packed mostly by Eastern European hands. Work that years ago used to be the preserve of students making some extra money over the summer is now almost exclusively done by migrant labour.Some of those seasonal workers, mostly from Bulgaria, Romania, a few from Lithuania, are already in the UK but restrictions to stop the spread of Covid-19 mean there is a shortage of about 50,000 seasonal workers, presenting a serious problem for farmers.To plug the gap they have joined forces and launched a nationwide recruitment drive, calling on Britons to Feed the Nation by taking up seasonal roles in the fields. It\u0027s hoped that those who may have lost their jobs as a result of the crisis - chefs, retail assistants, waiters and others - will seize an opportunity for a very different kind of work.So acute is the need that the government is reportedly readying its own Pick for Britain campaign taking inspiration from the Land Army that tilled the fields during the Second World War.\u0026nbspMost places are OK for labour at this point, but in six weeks we\u0027ll be picking, says James Porter, whose family owns East Scryne Farm, a soft fruit farm near Carnoustie, home of the storied golf course on Scotland\u0027s east cost.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailWith a picking season that starts in early May, soft fruit farmers are at the sharp end of a potential coronavirus labour shortage.Most of East Scryne\u0027s pickers would normally arrive at the end of April to start picking raspberries, blueberries, blackberries and strawberries - the fruit that\u0027s often seen as the quintessential symbol of British summer.\u0026nbspGovernment adviser under fire for saying UK farming sector not neededBrexit is an chance to showcase Britain’s farmingStrawberry, white chocolate and pistachio choux bunsFood banks in crisis as coronvirus panic buying leaves families hungryHeartbreaking photo of elderly man by empty supermarket shelvesWe\u0027re concerned that we won\u0027t be able to bring those people over and we have to look at alternatives, says Porter.The farmers\u0027 call to arms needs to be answered soon if we are to avoid a supply shortage that would trigger higher prices. If things drag on, the apple harvest could suffer as could vegetables like cauliflower, broccoli, celery and cabbage.That would mean more imports of fresh fruit and vegetables. But other countries are experiencing their own problems. In Kenya, a major supplier of Europe\u0027s green beans and peas, Reuters reports that half of workers involved in growing and exporting have been sent home as flights are grounded and prices for freight rise.Spain is Europe\u0027s largest exporter of fruit and vegetables and a big supplier to the UK. But it too relies on thousands of migrant workers, many of them from Morocco, who have also been stranded at home due to Covid-19 travel restrictions.It\u0027s fair to say that British workers have turned their noses up at seasonal farm work in recent years, perhaps partly due to the availability of other, more secure jobs in more comfortable surroundings.It\u0027s hard work and the Eastern Europeans are experienced at what they do, says Oliver Shooter, owner of AE Lenton, which runs a group of farms between Skegness and Boston in Lincolnshire, the centre of England\u0027s vegetable production.It\u0027s not rocket science but it is quite a skilled job that these guys do, he says. A top picker needs to know and apply supermarkets\u0027 exacting standards for exactly how fruit and veg must look, as well as how to cut it and pack it. For that they\u0027ll earn £12 an hour if they\u0027re good. Many farms also provide free or subsidised accommodation.The process is more high-tech than most would probably imagine, says Beverly Dixon, group HR director at G\u0027s, a network of large farms growing salad vegetables across East Anglia.We harvest our products in rigs, little mobile factories that go out into the field. They cut the veg at the front of the machine, it travels along a conveyor belt, gets trimmed, wrapped, boxed and put onto pallets all in one go, ready to be transported.Each rig is manned by a team of 16 who work as a family unit and will be kept apart from others as part of social distancing measures the farm is introducing.G\u0027s is looking for 700 seasonal staff, many of them pickers, but also jobs in packhouses and processing operations, team leaders, quality checkers, tractor drivers, bus drivers, forklift operators, some administrators and a handful of engineers.Bardsley, one of Britain\u0027s biggest apple producers, with an 850-hectare estate in Kent, says that in just a few days since the recruitment campaign launched the response has been overwhelming.Come July, when Bardsley starts harvesting 90 million apples - mostly Royal Gala, Braeburn, Cox\u0027s and the farm\u0027s prize-winning Bramleys - it will need some 500 extra workers. We\u0027ve put out the message on our social media saying \u0027come and join us\u0027, particularly to those people who unfortunately may be out of work at the moment. We are not slowing down, says marketing director Georgia Bardsley.We\u0027ve had such a erse range of people getting in touch. Among them are many who had until recently been working the hospitality sector that\u0027s been hit so hard by the coronavirus, including one head chef.Hopefully it gives people who have been affected a bit of hope, says Bardsley.The company\u0027s agricultural technology director, Antony Yousefian, says he\u0027s quietly confident the farm will find the people it needs. He also sees another potential positive to the situation.We\u0027ve seen a big change in consumers wanting to connect with what they eat in the last few years, he says. What a great opportunity for people to do that.I think, longer term, students will come back to doing this as a summer job.More and more of our jobs are higher skilled. We\u0027re hiring software engineers now, we\u0027ve got data analysts. So if you are a graduate, what a way to get into a farming business and apply yourself. In the day earn a bit of money and in the evening you might do some data analysis.Yousefian is currently building a digital map of the orchard to help the farm managers make better decisions by giving them real-time data on things like the climate, soil health and how much fruit is on the trees.The whole industry is changing. It\u0027s not a job that you turn your nose up at anymore.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It came as workers in key sectors work overtime and cancel holidays during the outbreak.“Whether it is in our hospitals, or our supermarkets, people are working around the clock to help our country deal with the coronavirus pandemic,” said Alok Sharma, the business secretary.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlines“Today’s changes will mean these valued employees do not lose out on the annual leave they are entitled to as a result of their efforts, and employers are not penalised.”Under existing rules, full-time workers are entitled to at least 28 days’ holiday including bank holidays each year, equivalent to 5.6 weeks.\u0026nbspHow to help the elderly and vulnerable during the coronavirusHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusHow to be productive when working from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsThe majority of this allowance cannot be carried over so employees lose it if they do not take it.

People with fewer years self-employed will be assessed on the returns that are available.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The are doing a fantastic job and I’m sure the nation will want to find a way to say thank you one we have defeated this virus.”Spain overtakes China for Covid-19 cases Spain overtook China’s total number of\u0026nbspcoronavirus\u0026nbspcases on Monday. An overnight death toll of 812 people brought total fatalities in Spain to 7,340, while the number of infections rose to 85,195 on Monday (against 81,470 in China).Health emergency chief Fernando Simon, who has been holding daily briefings on the epidemic, has tested positive for the virus, his deputy said.Maria Jose Sierra, who replaced Simon, said the daily infection increase had slowed since the introduction of lockdown measures to 12 per cent on average since March 25 from around 20 per cent in the March 15-25 period.Ryainair operating ‘lifeline’ flightsRyanair, unlike easyJet, is keeping some “lifeline” flights in the air, writes our travel correspondent Simon Calder.Europe’s biggest budget airline said: “As most EU countries have imposed flight bans or other restrictions, over 90 per cemnt of Ryanair’s aircraft are grounded for the coming weeks. We will comply with these restrictions at all times. We are working with EU governments to try to keep some minimum flight links open for emergency reasons, even though the passenger loads on these flights will be very low.“We are today (Mon 30 Mar) extending this limited schedule by a week to Thurs 9 Apr.”The company said it will operate these flights daily or weekly and all details can be found on the Ryanair website, saying social distancing will be “optimised” on-board.Prince Charles out of isolationPrince Charles, who had tested positive for coronavirus, is out of self-isolation after seven days and is in good health, his spokesperson said on Monday.Tokyo calls for social distancingResidents of\u0026nbspTokyo have been asked to stay away from bars and music venues.Governor Yuriko Koike has ramped up her calls for social distancing as the Japanese capital braces for a rise in cases.The number of infection cases in the densely-populated metropolis has climbed to 443 cases as of Monday, the local\u0026nbspgovernment said.\u0026nbspNorthern Ireland prisoners releasedNorthern Ireland is to release some of its serving prisoners to prevent coronavirus outbreaks in jails.There is yet to be a confirmed case of coronavirus in the region\u0027s prisons but justice minister Naomi\u0026nbspLong said that, in anticipation both of that moment and strained staffing levels, she now considers it necessary to release some prisoners early.In doing so, I recognise that to release a prisoner before he or she has completed their full sentence is a significant decision which should only be taken when there is no alternative, she said.Such a move is contrary to the ethos of the justice system and will cause distress to victims and their families. However, in the context of the pandemic we are facing, and to ensure as far as possible the safety and wellbeing of staff and those in our care, it is, I believe, an appropriate and reasonable step.\u0026nbspMan tasered after \u0027coughing on police\u0027politan Police officers have tasered a man who allegedly deliberately coughed at them and claimed he was infected with coronavirus,\u0026nbspwrites\u0026nbspKate Ng.The force’s firearms command said on Twitter the suspect walked up to officers who were sat in a car in Haringey, north London, and “shouted that he had coronavirus before deliberately coughing saliva all over them”.\u0026nbspSouth Korea to pay familiesSouth Korea will make emergency cash payments to all but the country\u0027s richest families, then plan a second supplementary budget next month in a bid to ease the drawn-out economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak, Moon Jae-in said on Monday.Mr Moon, after an emergency meeting with economic policymakers, said an emergency disaster relief payment of up to 1 million won (£661) would be made to all households except the top 30 per cent by income, totalling some 9.1 trillion won (£6bn).Officials said they would prepare another extra budget worth 7.1 trillion won (£4.7bn) for parliamentary approval in April and that some small- and medium-sized companies would be exempt from paying utility bills starting this month.Children\u0027s charity sees huge rise in pleas for helpA children\u0027s charity has reported a 1,100-per-cent\u0026nbspincrease in applications for its emergency cash fund during the first week of the coronavirus lockdown.Aberlour Child Care Trust said many families were struggling to buy essentials and pay for utilities.Following an urgent appeal launched on 18 March 18, more than £88,000 has been raised by members of the public.The trust is the largest children\u0027s charity that is solely Scottish and usually helps more than 7,500 families a year.As well as financial difficulties, the charity has experienced an increase in requests related to domestic abuse.Spain updateOf the more than 85,000 people who\u0027ve tested positive for Covid-19 in Spain,\u0026nbsp12,298 are health workers, authorities have said.Switzerland figuresThe Swiss death toll from coronavirus has reached 295 people, the country\u0027s public health bureau said on Monday, rising from 257 people on Sunday.

Under the disobliging headline “The Independent: a newspaper killed by the internet”, a piece in one of our competitors commented: “While a cacophony of voices exists online, the loss of a groundbreaking newspaper which was once considered radical and anti-establishment is likely to be keenly felt at a time of political upheaval and discontent.”While not as disobliging as the wreath sent round by another rival to the Indy’s editorial offices to welcome the launch of the first edition in October 1986, this death certificate was also premature – and completely wrong in its reasoning. The Independent is far from absent. The internet, if anything, saved The Independent.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt was precisely because of the web’s confused, chaotic conspiracies and discordant\u0026nbspmadnesses that the calm voices, radical attitudes and enduring values of The Independent were needed and indeed welcomed as we grew our online presence. The Independent’​s journalism found a vast new global audience, unimaginable before. We should not have been surprised, but it was heartening.\u0026nbspThe Independent had always been “forced to innovate”, as we always say, but success on this scale – not mere survival – is never preordained. Profitability, and the growth of our reporting teams, have returned after an absence of some decades.\u0026nbspSo far from crawling into some corner to conveniently expire, in the last four years, The Independent, troublemaking as ever, has once again confounded its critics, and has prospered by its presence on the internet.Today, we have an audience of up to a\u0026nbsphundred\u0026nbspmillion readers\u0026nbspeach month, more during the current pandemic, as more and more people turn to a trusted and truly independent source of advice, analysis and reliable information. The Independent\u0026nbspis the UK’s largest quality digital news brand, with\u0026nbspsubscriptions to Independent Premium and The Daily Edition growing.\u0026nbspWe must be getting something right.\u0026nbspBut that pessimistic article of 2016 was right about one thing, though the scale of the political upheavals it mentioned to come were far greater than anyone presaged. In the spring of 2016, after all, Barack Obama was still in the White House and few gave a boorish reality TV star named Donald Trump that much chance of winning the White House. David Cameron was still in Downing Street presiding over a small but stable government. His EU renegotiation and the subsequent Brexit referendum victory were assumed to be little more than formalities, an interlude before\u0026nbspGeorge Osborne took over. Corbynmania was “a thing”. Nigel Farage was in semi-retirement, Boris Johnson was an amusing afterthought, there were no gilets jaunes, the international effort on climate change was still alive, and various potentially deadly pandemics never seemed to actually materialise in Britain. Isis\u0026nbspstill looked invincible and the British royal family seemed boringly immutable. TikTok was what clocks did. There were even some who thought Leicester City wouldn’t win the Premier League.\u0026nbspSince then, as we know, we have experienced some fierce hurricanes, real and metaphorical. This collection of front pages of our Daily Edition from these turbulent years offers some insight into our times – and a reminder of how much the country and, we hope with no immodesty, the world needs the internationalist, liberal, environmentalist values The Independent has always stood for. Our reporting and analysis from the Middle East, for example, by Patrick Cockburn, Robert\u0026nbspFisk,\u0026nbspBel Trew, Borzou Daragahi and more is unsurpassed in its intelligence and prescience. Kim Sengupta’s dispatches from Ukraine to Iran to\u0026nbspZimbabwe have proved once again the worth of independent-minded journalists telling the stories as they see them on the ground. In election after election, vote after vote, leadership crisis after leadership crisis we have tried to make whatever sense we could of politics under Cameron, May, Corbyn and Johnson. We are proud too of our campaigns for a Final Say referendum and for the homeless, as well as our calls for urgent action on the climate emergency. We might also remember, in this strangest of years, the World Cup, Olympic Games and summers of sport in easier, happier times.\u0026nbspThe Independent has been there to report, analyse and comment upon these momentous events just as we always have been since 1986. A\u0026nbsptalented, tireless team of journalists,\u0026nbspthe support of committed owners and – above all – a\u0026nbspgrowing,\u0026nbsp loyal and independently minded readership\u0026nbsphave meant our digital future is at least as bright as our print one ever was.\u0026nbspThank you.\u0026nbspThis article is part of a special edition of the Daily Edition, featuring 50 of The Independent\u0027s most memorable front pages from the past four years.

Ian Colbeck, professor of environmental science at the University of Essex, told The Independent that the reduction in global emissions will most likely be temporary.“Emissions tend to bounce back fairly quickly shortly after a crisis ends,” he said.\u0026nbsp“Expect to see short-term impacts on energy and emissions disappear as governments introduce stimulus packages to increase industrial output at the end of the pandemic. Following the global financial crash in 2008-09, carbon emissions increased by 5 per cent as a result of such stimulus.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailMany environmental experts say the pandemic presents an unprecedented opportunity to curb global emissions.Professor Martin Siegert, co-director of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change at Imperial College London, told The Independent that the UK government “has an amazing opportunity to shape the economy in a slightly different way” by incentivising companies to adopt low-carbon business models. The Conservative government has pledged to make the UK carbon-free by 2050.“We are spending money on almost every company in the country right now. What we should be doing is saying, ‘You can have this money but you need to be compliant with a zero-carbon future by 2050,’” Professor\u0026nbspSiegert said.According to Professor Siegert, the transition to a low-carbon economy requires trillions of pounds of investment. If it is all spent on managing the coronavirus outbreak, “we will not have the financial muscle to invest in a low-carbon future”, he said.Dr Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), has also warned that the pandemic could stall global efforts to transition towards clean energy.“We should not allow today’s crisis to compromise our efforts to tackle the world’s inescapable challenge,” he said in a\u0026nbspstatement.Wildflowers move north as Earth’s temperature continues to riseThe IEA has already predicted that global oil demand will sharply decrease in 2020, by 435,000 barrels a day in the first quarter, due to the pandemic.“The sharp decline in the oil market may well undermine clean energy transitions by reducing the impetus for energy efficiency policies,” Dr Birol said.Cheaper energy reduces the appeal of cleaner, more efficient cars, homes and offices, Dr Birol said, calling on governments to reduce subsidies for fossil fuels. Coronavirus is also likely to stall production of clean energy technologies, such as solar panels and wind turbines, while many parts of China are under lockdown.“Governments can use the current situation to step up their climate ambitions and launch sustainable stimulus packages focused on clean energy technologies. Rather than compounding the tragedy by allowing it to hinder clean energy transitions, we need to seize the opportunity to help accelerate them,” Dr Birol said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

People who previously struggled with universal credit continue to do so. Rough sleepers and sofa surfers continue to live without shelter. Services that once offered support have shuttered to protect workers, while people are burning through their kitchen cupboards faster than usual because they are stuck inside.\u0026nbspIn short, many of those who have needed to use food banks in the past, those who are not among the government’s 1.5 million most at-risk people and will not be able to call on its swelling volunteer service for support, still need help.\u0026nbspThe Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign aims to help give these people the support they need. Click here for ways you can help.And here are five things you might not have considered to help you to support your community’s food bank.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesA common misconception is that food banks exist to offer the bare minimum – but to do so would be to completely undermine what food can give us in our day to day lives. We don’t only eat for sustenance – we do it for pleasure, to access our cultures, to engage in tradition. Food is central to the human experience, and for millennia has been key to how we experience love and affection.How to support our campaignSo ultimately think about what is going to taste good. Of course you can pick up staples that will be warmly received, but you can also donate things that get you excited, and share that excitement with someone else.Take, for example, Easter eggs. They may not be a matter of life or death, but by donating them you can give a parent the chance to treat their child, and a child the ability to engage in a communal tradition they might have been left out of. You are not just handing out subsistence, but a moment of dignity and joy for a family – and all it took was a bit of chocolate.It’s not just foodFood banks have never been just about food. Poverty is about choices – do you buy something to eat, or put money on the meter to keep the electricity running? Do you really need the heating on, or can you hold out? Will you be hungry now, or hungry later?\u0026nbspAt their most fundamental level, food banks are about a community pulling together and trying to resolve those conflicts – so when you think of donating, empathy is key. On one side of the spectrum, this means not just dredging mystery tins from the back of your cupboard – if you didn’t want to eat it over the last two years, chances are no one else will either. On the other, it’s about thinking of the groceries you couldn’t live without – be that food or something else.In the early days of the UK epidemic, among the first things to be stockpiled were hygiene products – sanitary towels, hand wash, toilet roll. If you didn’t have the ability to bulk buy, or the spare funds to travel from shop to shop by car or public transport, you were stuck. Donating bathroom products means people who use the service don’t have to choose between hunger and hygiene.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe range of reasons people visit food banks is vast, reflecting many of the social issues seen across the country, from universal credit delays to limited post-prison rehabilitation systems, rising rents and jobs that simply do not pay enough to allow for survival.\u0026nbspBut helping rough sleepers and sofa surfers out represents a unique challenge for food banks – particularly those who do not have access to kitchens and so are less likely to feel the benefit of, say, the bag of dry pasta many would receive. While volunteers will build a parcel that helps as much as possible, you can go a step further by putting together boxes of much-needed items that can be handed straight over as is.\u0026nbspAsk if your local service is interested, then get a few shoeboxes and add things that might prove useful – like socks and underwear, first aid kits, compact waterproofs, or toothbrushes and paste. Once again as much as you are donating a small box of odds and ends, you are also handing over dignity, and the tools people need to look after themselves.\u0026nbspBags of bagsFood banks across the country have had to make drastic changes to how they operate due to the virus – while volunteers may have a few contingency plans up their sleeves to keep services running, readying for a global pandemic was not among them.What has followed has been a herculean effort to organise outright change in a matter of days. Entire delivery systems have been dreamt up out of thin air, while the elderly and at risk who make up much of the volunteer base have been sent home.\u0026nbspFood banks strained as volunteers isolate and demand surgesFood banks have never been more needed, or closer to collapseFood banks in crisis as coronvirus panic buying leaves families hungryFood banks are under threat – the government has to step inUnited and City make joint food bank donation to fight coronavirusOperations have also been streamlined to feed as many people as possible, as hygienically as can be achieved. And as every service user’s food is bagged up and handed over, a small mountain of plastic bags are being deployed.So, bizarrely enough, in this time of national crisis, that bag of shopping bags that you and every other UK resident has been keeping in the corner of their kitchen or under their sink for years might finally serve a purpose. After all that time of being stored and neglected after trips to the supermarket, they could be put to use in ensuring social distancing.\u0026nbspAsk your local food bank if they could use them – but if you can go a step further and also feel a little apprehensive about contributing to the impact of plastic on the planet, consider handing over canvas bags instead. There are so many feelings wrapped into asking for help – and when you’ve been let down by the world around you time and time again, one that’s likely to come up is shame.\u0026nbspVolunteers work hard to try to mitigate that – and make the experience about support and community, but it’s easy to feel self-conscious walking away from a food bank and onto the high street with an array of clearly worn and mismatched carrier bags in your hands. A canvas bag, while sturdier, is also more discreet.Possibly the most useful thing you can do for your local food bank is among the easiest – ask what they need. While the Trussell Trust, the nation’s largest food bank charity, helps to set up and support sites, the inidual operation in your region sets its own rules and runs its own show. Others run via other charities or completely independently.\u0026nbspSo check out their tweets to see what they are appealing for, or send them an email to check what they are after, or give them a call and offer up a few hours a week to stack some tins (particularly if you are young, physically fit and don’t mind lugging around crates of produce).\u0026nbspReaching out, at every level, is fundamental to what food banks are. In reaching out you will get the satisfaction that comes from rallying around your community at a time where we’ve perhaps never been more isolated. What the person who comes to ask for food will get, from your contribution combined with others in your area coming together, is help when it’s possible no one else can.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We have teamed up with The Felix Project – a start-up charity we helped launch in 2016 – to deliver produce to community hubs in London boroughs.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent is also asking food charities across Britain to contact helpthehungry@ to tell us about your project and help build a directory of ways that our readers can help the hungry in their area – through money, volunteering and food donations. Food banks, which were already struggling to meet the need for emergency food parcels, have seen a huge surge in demand in recent weeks, while at the same time coping with dwindling donations, supermarket rationing systems, and a loss of many volunteers to self-isolation – yet none of the government’s rescue money goes to them.British households have stored more than £1bn worth of goods in their homes in response to the pandemic, creating shortages for food banks as shoppers ignore assurances that supply chains are robust.How to support our campaignJess Phillips, the Labour MP who recently ran for party leader, has backed our campaign, saying: “Nobody should be in the position of not being able to get enough food. In my constituency, London and in places all around the UK the coronavirus pandemic is placing extra stress on a system that was already straining.“We should all do what we can to help food and other essentials get to those that need it. That is why I’m backing the Help the Hungry campaign – please give if you are able.”Pastor Obi Onyeabor, the manager at Barking Foodbank, part of The Trussell Trust’s national network, said his pool of around 50 volunteers has been reduced by a dozen or so people currently self-isolating at home. Yet he and his team have kept their two church hall food banks open, and are now making home deliveries on Tuesdays and Thursdays to make sure the most vulnerable get supplies.“We have been scrambling for the past couple of weeks, doing all that we can – but we’re appealing for more people to come and help,” he said. “Out of fear people have been buying for themselves and their families, but I’ve seen some real generosity too.“I hope that if we can get past the panic buying stage, more people will want to give money, food or some of their time too.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But funding has dropped since the outbreak of Covid-19, limiting their capacity to carry out vital work at a time when it is more important than ever. As part of the London Food Alliance, along with FareShare and City Harvest, The Felix Project will coordinate deliveries in London boroughs in order to distribute surplus food to the elderly, poor and vulnerable. The charities will deliver food to the hubs, where local volunteers will package up parcels and arrange “last-mile” deliveries to the homes of the vulnerable.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has backed our campaign to help in the capital in partnership with our sister title the Evening Standard. He said: “In a city as prosperous as London, everyone should have enough food to feed themselves and their families – but unfortunately the coronavirus outbreak means some Londoners are facing even greater difficulties. It’s commendable these organisations are joining forces to help ensure surplus food isn’t wasted and instead reaches those who need it most. I urge Londoners to support this crucial initiative.”Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, said: “Our role is to pick up large volumes of nutritious surplus food from the commercial sector and deliver it to community hubs to ensure there is enough food for vulnerable people for as long as this health crisis ensues. We will be working all hours doing our bit – and it would be wonderful if your readers can get behind us so we can do this job for London.”Emma Revie, chief executive of The Trussell Trust, which supports 1,200 food banks, appealed for help from the public to get vital food to people who cannot afford the basics, and to boost volunteer numbers in areas where they are needed.\u0026nbsp“Our main priority as coronavirus unfolds is ensuring the safety of everyone who comes to a food bank – whether it’s someone needing help, someone volunteering their time, or someone making a donation,” said Ms Revie. “Until we are confident that adequate government protection against poverty is in place, food banks provide an essential community service to people unable to afford food. But this should not fall to food banks.\u0026nbsp“Our benefits system could be the life raft people need now. That’s why it’s more important than ever that we end the five-week wait for universal credit. While incredible food bank volunteers continue to help people unable to afford the basics, we would ask our government to take this essential step and end the five-week wait now. It’s five weeks too long.”Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network UK, which oversees 834 independent food banks, said the charitable services were “struggling to stay above water” in the current climate and accused the government of so far “failing to act” to prevent an ever-increasing number of people falling into poverty.“Food bank use was rising before the coronavirus outbreak and the impact of job losses can only make matters far worse. But this catastrophe in the making is avoidable,” she said. “We’re calling for an income-based solution to this crisis which would mean that the Herculean efforts by volunteers across the country wouldn’t be needed.“FareShare, the UK’s biggest food redistribution charity, is also calling for more volunteers to help with packing and making van deliveries. The organisation takes food from the food manufacturers that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors or overproduction, and gets it out to food banks, hospices, homeless hostels and other charities.Commercial director Alyson Walsh estimates around 1,200 people have got in touch over the past week. “We have quite a lot of older volunteers who have had to stay at home, but we are now seeing a wave of interest in new people willing to fill in.”Ms Walsh added: “We know we have the capacity to do more – we have the warehouse\u0026nbspspace and the chillers.

At the same time, if he failed to prepare for the worst he would not be doing his job.The comments underscore what has emerged as a potential major problem as the crisis has played out in the US, and Mr Trump has sought make the inidual states take responsibility for tackling the disease, with the support – but not leadership – of the federal government.Several state governors have condemned this approach, among them Washington governor Jay Inslee who told Mr Trump the governors were looking for a quarterback like “Tom Brady”.On Saturday, Mr Cuomo said the total number of infections in the state had reached more than 52,000 people, and the death toll had reached more than 700.“The government has said they have sent us 4000 ventilators those 4000 ventilators are not currently in use.\u0026nbspWhy? Because we don’t need them,” added Mr Cuomo.\u0026nbsp“What we’re doing is we’re planning for that apex, we’re planning for the critical need, and making sure we have the equipment the staff, the beds, for that critical need.”He said the cost of the machines had increased from $25,000 to $45,000 as other states had sought to buy them.\u0026nbspHe added: “We’re literally bringing up the price ourselves.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

More serious cases develop severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis and septic shock.As the number of people infected by coronavirus rises everyday, we can all play our part in reducing the spread of the virus by following the guidelines set by the government-which include staying at home, social distancing and regularly washing your hands with soap.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Cross-contamination is rampant. The animal cruelty is off the scale.Bears, tigers,  wolf cubs, crocodiles, hedgehogs and turtles are not spared in this notorious wildle food trade, either.Now the despicable wet markets used by some Chinese people — markets already responsible for the Sars outbreak in  — have finally brought the world to its knees.Scientists have established that it is highly likely Covid- was linked to a notorious live animal market in Wuhan.Gene sequencing analysis shows the new coronavirus probably started in bats and was transferred to humans via the scaly anteater the pangolin.So why is there so little outrage about the wet markets that we know have the potential to cause catastrophic outcomes to human health Even Donald Trump — slammed for branding Covid- the “Chinese virus” — avoided criticising the wet markets when prompted during a press conference at the White House on Wednesday.Maybe that’s because the moment someone tries to speak up they are accused of racism.That happened to reality star and retail entrepreneur Luisa Zissman earlier this week when she posted a video on Instagram of a wet market and called for them to be “banned completely”.After the usual social media outrage, she told me: “I wholeheartedly disagree with this particular part of Chinese culture, but that does not make me racist.” It should be remembered there are many campaigners within China desperately trying to get the wet markets banned too.After all, the addition of more exotic animals only dates back to the s, as the ruling communist party struggled to feed the population and million people perished in what became known as the great famine.By , the ironically named Wildle Protection Law encouraged industrial-level breeding of the likes of bears, bats and turtles to be sold through wet markets. And that’s when the viruses began to form.When the Sars crisis was linked to a wet market in southern China, officials shut it down and made wildle farming illegal. But they reversed the decision just a few months later.As of  it was a £billion industry, mainly because the rich and the powerful pay copious quantities of money to eat rare wildle as they believe  claims about their role in Chinese medicine.Now with coronavirus spreading, the government has again temporarily banned wildle trading and shut down wet markets.But it’s not permanent yet — and it must be.We already know that the early Chinese cover-up of Covid-, which makes Chernobyl look like a misdemeanour, resulted in the disease’s rapid spread.In fact,China had taken early action experts reckon the number of coronavirus cases could have been cut by  per cent, making its rampage all over the globe far less likely.The new illness was directly linked to the infamous wildle market in Wuhan on December , but it wasn’t until New Year’s Eve that the World Health Organisation was informed and the site closed.The brave Chinese doctors who tried to spread the word about Covid- were shut down by the authorities too, and early testing was stopped and samples  destroyed.I have no doubt the Chinese government has blood on its hands over coronavirus.And saying that now, at the peak of the health crisis, is not the time to tackle the issue is wrong.We must have this uncomfortable discussion while our anger is raw and the pain  all too real.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.I DON’T have enough superlatives to describe my adoration for Lady Gaga.No pop star of her generation has been more consistently savvy, smart or, for that matter, talented.So it pains me to so deeply disagree with her decision to delay the release of her highly anticipated new album Chromatica, which was due to drop on April , in the middle of quarantine hell.In fact, I actually think the delay is quite selfish.Thanks to the technological advances in streaming, listening to new music is one of the few activities we can engage in collectively without having to leave the house.

In fact, the sooner we do this properly, the sooner this nightmare will be over.At such a trying time it is imperative we celebrate the brilliant work being done by so many to keep society running.So thank you to the doctors, the nurses, the NHS workers, the first responders, the supermarket staff, the cleaners, the bus drivers, the Tube staff, the delivery drivers, the journalists and anyone  who NEEDS to keep working to keep our society going.They’ll thank the rest of us for doing our part too and staying indoors.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is what a government should do, but only when faced with a le-or-death situation. It is not a sane strategy for normal times.What the old dunce cannot grasp is that such gargantuan bailouts will need to be paid back by years of tax rises and further austerity. If he wants credit for the spending, will he also accept responsibility for that future hardship No, we didn’t think so.Corbyn will be remembered as Labour’s worst-ever leader, the architect of their most abject defeat in  years. He drew anti-Semites like flies to dung. He repelled decent Labour MPs and voters.Only leftie cranks and Tories will miss him.IN six weeks as Chancellor, Rishi Sunak has saved an estimated .million jobs and bailed out Britain.

That we’d all wake up and think: “Nah. My job’s not important at all. I’ve been wasting my le really, so I’ll stay in bed.”Everyone thinks their job is important, so everyone went to work, and this meant that in London especially, the public transport system was rammed full of commuters. This made everyone very angry.I don’t want to blame anyone for what’s going on. If you shut a country down overnight there are bound to be issues. It’s no one’s fault.I do, however, have a helpful suggestion for people who really do need to get to work. A suggestion that no one will have considered. It’s a means of transport that’s virus proof.You can’t be infected when you’re inside it and you can’t pass your infection on to anyone . It’s called the “motor car”.For years, successive leaders and politicians have done their best to squeeze it out of society.They’ve lowered the speed limits and raised the taxes and ­introduced congestion charging and even suggested, hilariously, thatyou ­absolutely must have one, it should have an electric motor. Like a milk float.Even the great libertarian Boris ­Johnson — a former motoring correspondent for GQ magazine — has been involved, handing half the road network over to wretched cyclists.Well, now’s the time to stop all that.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.During the Covid- outbreak, when it’s important we keep our distance, all ­parking restrictions should be lted.Cars should be allowed to use both bus and cycle lanes and all traffic cameras should be turned off. I know this flies in the face of what the eco-mentalists say is good for us but buses are petri dishes so park them at the depot.Trains and the Tube are no better, so turn off the power immediately. In the last three months of last year, million people in this country had jobs. And that’s handy because at the last count there were million cars registered for use on the road.This means that everyone can get to their place of work, safely, in a virus-proof cocoon. Strange isn’t it. For years we were told that cars would one day kill us all. But now it’s obvious that actually, they are our knights in shining armour.I only ask because the phone she was using looked like it was from about .Who was she calling  Dial-a-Disc WHILE scrolling through my phone the other day I was interested to read that I could increase my immunity to coronavirus by taking more vitamin C.Then I was told I would not catch itI stared for two hours every day at a picture of Charlize Theron.Later, I received news from someone whose neighbour’s aunt lives next door to a doctor’s cleaning lady that I should drink my own urine.But I was quickly distracted by someone  whose hairdresser had hacked the World Health Organisation and found that under no circumstances should I eat anything containing vitamin C. Or look at Ms Theron.And then I remembered something Important. Every single thing on the internet is b******s.But there’s one small problem.How do you reach anything on the shelves AS I write, the whole world is trying to work out why Germany is doing so much better with the coronavirus than everywhere .The bald figures are certainly intriguing. In Britain, . per cent of people who catch the disease go on to die. In Italy, it’s a terrying nine per cent. Whereas in Germany, it’s . percent.Experts have claimed that the epidemic started there in the Baian Alps, so the people it affected were young, fit skiing enthusiasts. Who barely noticed they had it.Others have pointed to the fact that Germany has many more beds for critically ill patients than Italy. And a HELL of a lot more than the UK.Then there’s testing. For months German medics have been testing the sort of numbers the rest of the world can only dream about. I wonder, however,anyone has considered this: The Germans do well . . .  because they are German.I was once told by a professor at Rome University that: “You can have as many laws as you like in Italy. Just so long as they are not enforced.”So, when the government there first told everyone to go home and stay there, they simply carried on riding around on their Vespas and kissing everyone.It’s the same story in Britain. We were told to stay at home but because the sun was out, we all hit the park for a picnic.The Germans are dferent. You tell Wolfgang that he must wash his hands every  minutes and he will wash his hands every  minutes. You tell him to go home and he will do so, immediately.It’s probably considered racist to talk about national characteristics these days. But in these troubled times I’m going to plough on regardless and say thatwe want to survive, we’ve got to be a bit more German. And for once, do as we are told.Which I’m told is an important ­ingredient in a building project.WE keep being told that the supermarkets will be able to keep up with our demand for food. But I seriously doubt that.I was told this week that the supplier providing my farm with veg seeds had closed. And because he had no delivery drivers, he was dumping his stock.I’ve now found a replacement and I will be getting them in the ground next week. But who will harvest them in three months, when the people who normally do this kind of thing are stuck in Latvia  Students  Fat chance.To make matters worse, a lot of peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers and courgettes you buy come from Spain.And who, right now, in this locked-down country, is planting them, and packing them and taking them to the docks or the airport  Still, there is some good news.Vegetarians will be forced to abandon their idiocy and start to eat meat. Lamb looks like a good bet. Because all the restaurants and pubs are shut, and exports are tricky, prices have more than halved in the past seven days.Bloody annoying for me as a sheep farmer.

The -year-old commander knows all too well what le is like on lockdown.He spent a year and a half living in a tiny tin can in close proximity to his crew.And he has some good tips for not going stir crazy.Obviously the space station astronauts had a lot of work and experiments to do, but that did not take up all of their time. And like the rest of us, they needed to keep busy.Scott has lots of common-sense advice for coping with being cooped up.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.First of all, we need to have a routine. We have to make sure we get up at the same time every morning and that we get washed and dressed and make our beds. We also need a regular bedtime.Scott says you have to get outside at least once a day — we can do that on earth — while also folowing the rules.You need to schedule times to talk to family and friends and have proper meal times.Exercise is vital. Our very own spaceman, Tim Peake, trained and completed a marathon on a running machine when he was part of the crew on the Space Station.Not all of us are fit enough to run -odd miles, but we can use this time to improve stamina and energy levels. I’m still doing my exercise classes with instructor Maxine Jones on her YouTube channel, and I will be starting virtual yoga with my daughter Rosie, who is in Singapore.I was surprised to learn Scott took actual books, not ebooks, into space.But he said holding a real book in his hands meant he could become completely absorbed, and concentration was not interrupted by messages pinging on his iPad.One of the most interesting things he said was to keep a journal of these strange times.It is more than just jotting down what you got up to that day. You need to go deeper and describe your hopes, fears and state of mind, and also what you hope to achieve when this is all over.One of the things Scott valued most during his long stint in space was video calls with family and friends. And he says one of the silver linings of this crisis is time to reconnect with loved ones.I know exactly what he means. I have been spending hours in WhatsApp chats with Rosie, my best friend Joyce, who is in lockdown in Spain, and my mum in East Kilbride.We chat about everythingand it lts my spirits. Scott’s other sensible advice is to get your information from the experts — and he advises against relying on the internet.He is right. Social media is stuffed with misinformed people and mad conspiracy ­theories.I was shocked to realise how some teens don’t watch any news outlets or read newspapers. They get their “news” from Facebook.They also think they are invincible, which is why we saw those packed beaches and parks this time last week.This was partly because they were unaware of the need for “social distancing” but also because they think it won’t happen to them.But Scott’s most important message to all of us is about working together.“All people are inescapably connected and the more we can come together to solve our problems, the better off we will be.“I’ve seen humans work together to prevail over the toughest challenges imaginable, and I know we can prevail over this one,we all do our part and work together as a team.”Well, I would urge you all to listen to Scott.If we can put a man on the moon then we can beat this awful virus. It won’t be easy but I have faith in science.And as long as we obey the rules, and make some sacrices, we WILL overcome.NO matter what you think of him, it would be churlish not to wish Boris Johnson a speedy recovery.But my sympathies are with Carrie Symonds, who is due to give birth in three months. She’s in isolation at a time when she needs his support.My thoughts are with all expectant parents now, bringing babies into a world we barely recognise and unable to be together in the delivery room. It will be bittersweet for all of them.ONE part of the world untouched by Covid- is my spiritual homeland of Antarctica.I visited the great white wilderness three years ago and cannot wait to .Aside from astronauts, the men and women who man the science bases in Antarctica – particularly the station at the South Pole – are well used to being in isolation while living on top of one another.Which is exactly what most of us are doing right now.Living space is limited at the Pole, and there’s no escaping the other  human beings holed up at the station for the full Antarctic winter.It’s virtually pitch black for six months and you can’t really go outside apart from short bursts of vital scientic work.Most are in danger of becoming “toasty”, which is their description of going stir-crazy.Being cramped, isolated and without proper personal boundaries and “me time” can make you cranky, short-tempered and irritated by the smallest things.In order for us all to avoid toastiness during these strange times, I’d recommend a few rules, some of which were given to me by a hardy survivor of winter at the extreme south.Have a sanctuary, evenit is just in the toilet reading your newspaper and doing the crossword.If you are feeling at the end of your tether, don’t bottle it up.Talk about your feelings and listen to what others in the house with you are saying.You might very well be annoying them as much as they are driving you up the wall.It’s early days, and this is a marathon and not a sprint.Unlike those at the Pole, at least we can still go outside and enjoy the sunshine and the heat as well as the light.I’VE got a Star Trek version of Monopoly and I’m wonderingit is too soon to bring it out from the back of the cupboard.I’ve never actually got to the end of a game of Monopoly and I reckon this might just be the only time that will ever happen.I’m also going to start watching Game Of Thrones for the first time, which should keep me going for a couple of weeks. Any other suggestions for box sets gratefully received.I’M sure all dog owners would agree that our fantastic, loyal, loveable pets are keeping us sane right now. I don’t know what I would doI couldn’t take Angus for a walk once a day.It’s not just a chance to get out in the fresh air and do some exercise, which is good for our physical and mental health, but it’s having something that takes your mind off the current state of the world.When I’m playing with Angus I can almost forget those feelings of anxiety that creep up on all of us and simply enjoy his energy and enthusiasm.He needs to be fed and watered and taken care of, and that gives me a much-needed sense of purpose.It’s a proven fact that just having a dog in the house to cuddle boosts your well-being and cuts stress levels.I don’t know what I would do without him.IT has never been more vital for all of us to receive clear-headed analysis and news we can trust.That’s why it’s so important you continue to buy your Sun every day.There’s a free delivery offer for those unable to get to the shops and of course there’s our splendid online version.We need to be well informed about the latest, fast-moving events and have all the facts to best protect ourselves and our families.Thank you for your loyalty and, as always, for your comments and feedback.

Then suddenly, since Monday, we are not.It’s not even been a week since the new normal for all of us is to stay put.I am guessing that for most of us, it feels like twice that. For many of us, being unable to roam freely is the stuff of nightmares.Still, although it’s been a hard week, I am feeling fortunate. Others I know are really struggling, but I’m very lucky to have a house, a job and the basics in my fridge. But my goodness, it’s boring staying at home all the time, isn’t it At the moment more or less every day is the same. I get up, do conference calls, watch the news and go to bed.But I have been trying to do a few things dferently. For fear of my muscles atrophyingI have started using an exercise video.That may sound normal to you but for me, this is staggering. It’s one from the s and is really quite funny and ­dficult at the same time.I’ve also been more studious than usual and have been doing online lectures for my master’s degree.I have put in the hours with a TV show called This Is Us.And I’ve been cooking up a storm — making increasingly inventive recipes with bits and bobs from the back of the store cupboard because the idea of getting a supermarket delivery slot feels like a fantasy so I have not even bothered to try. I cook whatever my corner shop has in stock, which sadly is not a lot.I know many supermarkets are prioritising elderly and vulnerable shoppers, which is right and proper. And I really hope that the people who are hoarding and stockpiling out of fear soon realise that they don’t need to do that.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Friends who work in the food ­industry have repeatedly told me there is no issue with supply.Especiallypeople continue to go to their local shops, which should still be stocked — and which need their custom.I am nine days into my -day self-isolating as I am still waiting to see my dad, who is recovering from cancer.And, like many others, I’m focused on the importance of being absolutely certain I am ­infection-free before I even think of going to see him and my mum.So really, I’m just sitting it out. But gosh, it’s tedious.One of the biggest changes for me is not being able to go out or see my friends. But on Friday night we had a Skype party. We all got out a bottle of wine, and I even washed my hair before we had a laugh.We are also playing the game Psych — which is great fun and played on your mobile with your mates.It’s made me realise how many of the things I blithely took for granted as being my inalienable right have changed — literally overnight.And I don’t know whether it’s a good or bad thing that my kids aren’t home with me. I’m pretty sure my daughter has already had coronavirus but happily she seems fine now.But I obviously can’t see her other than on video phone as I am isolating. And boy, do I miss her.My son, meanwhile, is with his housemates in Buckingham. They seem fine — working out in their garden gym, making meals together and playing Xbox. In fact, it’s just another day for him.I know there are people reading this who are genuinely struggling and having a seriously hard time with being isolated, who are worried about loss of income, about elderly or vulnerable relatives, or who are stuck at home with ­dficult or even violent people.It is hard to reflect on anything when we are in the middle of it.We have to focus on getting through a day at a time knowing there will be plenty of time to learn lessons when this has passed.We’ll no doubt start from the basics, like being hyper-vigilant about which animals enter the food chain, scrupulous hand-washing and reassessing our attitude towards travel — something we’ve all taken for granted for so long.We will also focus on building the NHS back up. Just as we built nuclear deterrents to protect ourselves against war, we have to protect ourselves from the ious viruses that we now know are, increasingly, out there.Yes, the important thing is the here and now. We’ve seen unprecedented events this week alone, with the PM Boris Johnson,Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty all self-isolating after either testing positive or showing symptoms of the virus.But what is vital is the long-term strategy to fight another attack like this in the future.And in the meantime, apart from feeling a bit cooped up, all in all I am pretty much doing OK with self-isolating.Apart from one thing — I can’t find any hair dye to cover my grey hair, for love nor money. Now that really is a nightmare.ASbeing stuck at home wasn’t hard enough, sports fans are having to get through this time without any football.Now that’s what I call adding insult to injury.As fans will already know, all football has been postponed until April . But behind the scenes, all football clubs, including mine, are doing whatever it takes to ensure the season finishes.I think everyone understands that our priority has to be the safety and good health of our players and the fans. So, while matches are not being played, players are doing all they can to stay fit and well so they are ready whenever it’s time to resume games.Meanwhile, the stadiums, training grounds and offices are all shut.Then, after April , we hope matches can recommence, behind closed doorsrequired.In the meantime, it’s a waiting game. So here’s hoping you’ve got some old Match Of The Day shows lined up to while away your time.ONE thing about us all having to stay at home is that it’s giving celebrities nowhere to hide in terms of what they have got to offer the world.They are on their own at home, with nothing much to do, just like us.Some – Joe Wicks teaching PE to the nation’s primary school kids every morning, Carol Vorderman holding online maths classes or Richard E Grant reading from the script of Withnail And I – are trying hard to provide the nation with useful entertainment.And then there are others. Instagram is also peppered with images of reality TV and soap stars in extremely scanty underwear.Without the props of stylists, red carpets and paparazzi shots, we see them for what they really are.Human beings, just like us.AS a week of firsts comes to a close, athletes and sports fans alike were further disappointed by the announcement that the Olympics have been postponed.Something that only a few weeks ago would have seemed unimaginable now feels, clearly, like the only sensible thing to do.Apart from the logistics involved with quarantine and uncertainty about travel restrictions, some athletes cannot train while some can, which, when the integrity of the sport is at stake, is fundamentally unfair.ANYONE  bored  With This Is Us my current favourite thing to watch, I’ve compiled a list of some other fab shows, just in case you’ve finished Succession and need some inspiration.Here goes – The Crown, Ozark, Luther, Line Of Duty, Sense, Grace And Frankie, Schitt’s Creek, Sex Education, Messiah, Spinning Out, Unbelievable and Mum.I WAS so moved by the nation overriding the old stf upper lip mentality to stand on their doorsteps to give NHS workers a round of applause on Thursday night.And then I read a tweet from a nurse saying that literally as the nation were clapping, she had received an email from her employers advising her not to travel to work in unorm or display her work ID.This is because some people have been mugged for these items and the very scant privilege – like an early supermarket slot – that they bring.Come on, people – sort it out. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And we wholeheartedly condemn ignorant racists pointing the finger at them.But the dangerous despots at the head of the Chinese government ARE to blame — and allowing them to emerge with a propaganda win would be a monumental injustice.When the dust has settled, the West must drastically rethink its cosy relationship with President Xi Jinping and his Communist cronies.And Britain should take the lead.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more."},{"url":null,"title":"michael gove cough television coronavirus","story":"MICHAEL Gove appeared to stled a cough during a live TV interview this morning - just days after coronavirus struck down Boris Johnson.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster seemed to struggle with a cough during an appearance on BBC’s Andrew Marr show.His actions sparked fears for his health in the same week Boris Johnson and the Health Secretary Matt Hancock revealed they had the virus.However, aides have now insisted he does not have a cough and was just clearing his throat.One said: He does not have symptoms.Both the Prime Minister and Mr Hancock revealed their diagnoses on Friday and announced that they would be self-isolating.Johnson said: Im self-isolating and thats entirely the right thing to do.He added that the more effectively we all comply with lockdown and self-isolation measures, the faster well bounce back.Thank you to everybody whos doing what Im doing, working from home, he said.Hancock said he would be staying at home until next Thursday.The cough came on a day Mr Gove revealed Britain had finally hit , coronavirus tests a day in its bid to beat the virus.He said: “Well, we have been increasing the number of tests and I can confirm today that the number of tests being carried out is , now and we want to increase that – , a day – and we want to increase that to , a day.“Just last week the Prime Minister authorised the new programme of testing so working with research institutes and also with companies like Boots, we are now in a position to be able to test more.”Yesterday, the PM said the situation would get worse before it gets better.In a letter being sent to households across the UK this week, the PM suggests the government will not hesitate to enforce further lockdown measuresneeded.His letter states: “It’s important for me to level with you — we know things will get worse before they get better.“But we are making the right preparations, and the more we all follow the rules, the fewer lives will be lost and the sooner le canto normal.”He added: We will not hesitate to go furtherthat is what the scientic and medical advice tells us we must do.”To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more."},{"url":null,"title":"data cap scrapped coronavirus","story":"INTERNET providers will remove data limits to boost Brits stuck at home during the coronavirus crisis.The scrapped cap comes with the nation under strict orders not to leave home.Internet service providers and mobile operators including BT EE, Openreach, Virgin Media, Sky, O and Vodafone have all agreed to the measures.They are designed to ensure all Brits have access to telecoms services during the lockdown.The removal of data caps will apply to all fixed broadband services, while the firms have agreed to offer generous packages to the most vulnerable.Digital secretary Oliver Dowden said: “It’s fantastic to see mobile and broadband providers pulling together to do their bit for the national effort by helping customers, particularly the most vulnerable, who may be struggling with bills at this dficult time.“It is essential that people stay at home to protect the NHS and save lives.

It’s not a fixed point, a date in the calendar like Easter. It is something that all of us can affect by our actions.”Mr Gove also hinted that Britain could be heading for a fresh bout of austerity once the crisis is over.He said Chancellor Rishi Sunak’s generous jobs bailout packages will mean Britain will have to go on a borrowing spree.But he insisted the Treasury is confident Britain will eventually be able to pay back the money once the nation gets back to work.

The idea is thatenough people build up immunity to the virus they protect those who are not immune, acting as a firewall.This is why although roughly  per cent of people cannot be vaccinated against measles, they are protected by the  per cent who are.Due to its “reproduction rate” around two thirds of Brits would need to be immune to coronavirus to stop its spread with this method. But the PM U-turned on this plan when it was estimated to get to that figure , would die.Instead Britain is now following the example of China which has halted the spread of the disease by using a lockdown. The idea is to slow down the spread by drastically limiting how much Brits move around and have contact with each other.It aims to get the numbers to a manageable rate that does not swamp the National Health Service and throw the country into chaos.In China, where the virus started, strict lockdown rules have massively reduced the transmission. There are occasionally new cases in Wuhan, the origin of the pandemic, but most new reports in China are from ing citizens. Singapore is seen as another leading light on lockdowns and in general Asian countries have curtailed the spread with strict curfews.Europe has started to follow the example, to prevent already stretched health services being overwhelmed with hundreds of thousands of coronavirus patients.Italy has surpassed China as having the most deaths from coronavirus with over , to date. The country struggled as the virus was already widespread when they first detected it.Spain is also suffering badly with over , deaths in total - only second behind Italy worldwide.In all countries the lockdown does appear to have started to slow the increase in deaths and cases, but it is too early to say conclusively.Sweden stands out as shunning shutdowns in favour of public information programmes, but a sudden spike in cases last week has caused concern they may have miscalculated.Germany has also taken a slightly dferent route, investing heavily in testing to monitor the disease.It means that, although they have three times as many cases as Britain, they have half as many deaths and have only recently introduced lockdown measures.World Health Organizationexpert advisor David Heymann told The Sunday Times: The jury is still out as to which strategy or strategies work best, but underlying them all is the need to get populations to collaborate with the outbreak response and understand how to protect themselves and others.Experts are waiting to see indicators that the epidemic is slowing down but Professor Mark Woolhouse, an infectious disease specialist at Edinburgh University, said: “This is unlikely to become apparent in under three weeks.A slowdown is not measured as a reduced number of deaths, but a smaller rise day-on-day.The key target for Britain’s lockdown is to stop the NHS being overwhelmed by “flattening the curve”.So far the health service is coping, but with the peak expected within weeks it is still too early to say.In Asia it has been successful because governments have managed to persuade the population to isolate and wear masksthey cough or sneeze. The challenge for the government is to persuade Brits that the lockdown and social distancing must be taken seriously, otherwise it will not be effective.The lockdown aims to eventually stop the rise of cases and see a decrease in both the number testing positive each day and the number of deaths. Once this happens countries seek to relax the lockdown.Butthe lockdown is relaxed too fast the cases could rocket again. Chinas initial success in flattening the curve of infection means they are now looking to unlock industry to get the economy moving.Prof Heymann said: They are doing it very cautiously to see what happens. Then they will begin to unlock other sectorsthey see its successful.There are currently no antivirus therapies for coronavirus and it is estimated a vaccine will take  to  months to develop.As economies will struggle to maintain a lockdown for that long, and Brits will struggle in isolation, the government will need to rely on a dferent tactic.The preferred route is to conduct mass testing to determine who is immune and who is not. Those with immunity can thento work and once two thirds have immunity Brits will be protected via herd immunity.Britain is currently only carrying out , tests a day and is aiming to hit , a day.But former PM Tony Blair yesterday called on the government to test “virtually everybody” as the faster route to get Britain back up and running.The second requirement for easing lockdowns will be to safeguard against the cases arriving from outside Britain.Prof Heymann said: You need a good disease detection or surveillance system and a good outbreak response”.But he warnedeasing the lockdown doesn’t work “they might want to lock up again.”To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

School science labs donating protective goggles to frightened NHS staff complaining they’ve been thrust defenceless into the frontline against a deadly foe is the final nail in the coffin of  years of ­destructive Tory austerity which left the NHS on its knees. Ministers and advisers are braced for an inquiry exposing smugness, chaos, fatal blunders and woeful preparations at the heart of Government obsessed with Brexit triumphalism. The Covid- cataclysm has made temporary socialists of deregulators and free marketeers, Tories from Boris Johnson down converted to the value of public intervention and strong Government to save the country. Jeremy Corbyn was too much Me-Me-Me self-congratulatory in a BBC interview but Labour’s outgoing leader is on the money asserting this crisis justies his politics. December’s humiliation might never have happened had coronavirus erupted three months before rather than after the  election just as Grenfell could have toppled Theresa May seven days ahead, instead of beyond, the  poll. The political kaleidoscope is shaken again and when we’re unsure how the pieces will settle, the democratic argument is clear for another election to take instructions from the people. Johnson’s manesto is shredded. He will have no mandate for what comes next whether that is tax rises or vicious spending cuts repeating austerity’s self-defeating stupidity. Bonfires of what Conservatives call red tape, and what we know as job rights and health and safety will doubtless be considered. Tories who pretend soaring deficits and debt under Labour after  weren’t triggered by the global banking collapse won’t stop hypocrites screaming higher rises in  are due to coronavirus.  They were wrong then and right now which is a challenge for Labour’s likely next leader, a Keir Starmer hotly tipped to be crowned to little fanfare on Saturday.

Three Labour MPs I canvassed, smart politicians who will be in Starmer’s team, didn’t want one and are confident Tory record poll leads will drain away later when Johnson’s faults are scrutinised forensically on the other side of this apocalypse.

The shocking image comes to light after a hospital consultant became the first frontline NHS worker to die from coronavirus. Fears are fears mounting that countless lives are being put a risk by a lack of testing and protective kit. NHS England confirmed on Sunday that senior doctor Amged El-Hawrani, , died at Glenfield Hospital in Leicester after testing positive for Covid-. It comes as Boris Johnson writes to every household in the country to warn that “things will get worse before they get better”. The death toll from the outbreak rose  to , yesterday. Ear, nose and throat specialist Dr El-Harwani, who died on Saturday, is understood to have contracted the virus several weeks ago. In an emotional tribute his relatives called him “the rock of our family” who put everybody  first. NHS England described Dr El-Hawrani as the first practising hospital doctor to die of the virus. Dr Adil El Tayar, an organ transplant surgeon, , died in a London hospital last week after volunteering at an AE department in the West Midlands. An Essex GP, Dr Habib Zaidi, , died in intensive care at Southend Hospital last week after, according to his doctor daughter, “textbook symptoms” of the virus. As worrying footage of a nurse working in a coronavirus ward wearing only basic protection was passed to the Mirror, the Doctors’ Association UK said it was “deeply saddened” by Dr El-Hawrani’s death. And it urged the Government to make a priority of “protecting the lives of the le-savers”. A joint statement from its president Dr Samantha Batt-Rawden and chair Dr Rinesh Parmar said: “It is simply unacceptable that some doctors still do not have access to adequate PPE.  “This is crucial, especially for the highest-risk procedures undertaken by intensive care doctors, anaesthetists and ENT surgeons.” It is not known how Dr El-Hawrani contracted Covid-. On Sunday claims emerged that scientists predicted four years ago that the NHS would be overwhelmeda deadly virus hit the country. The Government exercise carried out by Imperial College London in , predicted an outbreak of HN flu would leave NHS unable to cope, due to a lack of PPE, and ventilators. Ministers have promised that millions of pieces of protective kit will be delivered to key workers. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said: “We simply cannot ask people to be on the frontline without the right protective equipment.” But footage, received by the Mirror shows an agency nurse working in a hospital wearing just a basic apron, short gloves, mask and goggles. The paramedic beside her is in a long-sleeved gown and full head cover.  An unnamed woman, who filmed the clip last Wednesday is heard saying: “This is how it is.” The hospital trust did not respond to a request for comment. Meanwhile staff at a London hospital are hiding PPE as shortages bite it is claimed. “We’re in a situation where people are having to hide them for their own staff,” said one obstetrician. Another NHS doctor said: “All my colleagues are nervous, some are going off sick because they don’t feel safe.” The head the Royal College of Nursing says about % of frontline staff have had to take time off work to self-isolate having shown symptoms. Amid the shortage of kit, four volunteers have raised £, to buy PPE. Three doctors and an architect set up the appeal and Hollywood actor James McAvoy has backed their cause, by donating £, saying: “NHS staff are heroes.” To help ease the strain on staff Labour MP Margaret Hodge has called for the Government to help set up pop-up supermarkets in hospitals to make sure they can buy food. It comes after grim stories of medics being unable to get supplies from shops emptied by panic buyers. Ministers have repeatedly pledged to “ramp up” testing – promising to start testing NHS staff this week. But the first new lab to open will initially process just  samples.  And there are concerns parts of the UK lack the necessary laboratories and staff. Doctors in Cambridge reportedly claimed tests are taking up to four days to come back, while in Hull they were said to be taking  hours. The turnaround time in London is thought to be down to  hours. Ministers have ordered .million tests following criticism last week that they had bought .million without knowing they would work. And the Government is today expected to confirm an order for thousands of ventilators. Cabinet minister Michael Gove yesterday refused to say when all NHS workers will be tested.

I started off with a homeschooling schedule but I’ve got rid of that now and our days are made up of a little bit of learning, a little job, lots of hugs, lots of dancing and singing and lots of outdoor exploring and I honestly have never seen Ivy so happy.She’s got binoculars from Bright Minds who have loooooads of fun learning products. I’ll apologise nowany of the neighbours catch her spying out of the window.We’re also finding it quite therapeutic to slow down our pace a bit and just enjoy actually having conversations with each other again, no need to keep adding to or checking our calendar to see what plans we have or how little spare time we have. It’s actually lovely. Another silver lining for me as a self employed small business is that my rainbow pin badges have been selling out. The rainbow has become the symbol of hope throughout the world and my motto has always been to fight through the storm for your rainbow. So many NHS staff and keyworkers around the country are wearing my pins with pride!You can get yours here."},{"url":null,"title":"i conquered coronavirus diabetic teacher","story":"NewsI conquered coronavirus Diabetic teacher, , tells how she battled back to healthSarah Hall started to feel more tired than usual, and freezing cold, before the tell-tale cough arrivedShareByKelly-Ann Mills:,  MAR NewsSarah Hall is a secondary school teacher \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

But he claims he has been targeted by vigilantes who wrote aposgo homeapos in the dirt on the rear window of his car. A aposthreateningapos leaflet was also put on his doorstep which reiterated the message, he said. This is pure harassment and in another context would be considered a hate crime, Tony added. Tony told the BBC: Over the past week we have had Go Home daubed in the dirt on the back windscreen of our car, leaflets telling us to do the same and someone haranguing me to aposGo Homeapos from the street outside our house. This is pure harassment and in another context would be considered a hate crime.  Since the lockdown we decided to stay here because it would be non-essential travel to go back. I spend a lot of time in Devon, I carry on a business down here and my weaposs from Devon. We are following all the rules, we are self-isolating and we only go out when we have to for provisions.

Tony bought the house in Bigbury-on-Sea in Devon around -years-ago and claimed he had as much right to be there as anyone . Devon and Cornwall Chief Constable Shaun Sawyer said the behaviour was unacceptable.  He said: This is a family who are probably just as frightened and concerned as everyone .  If they are already here we should welcome them and make them feel part of our community. This is not a time to turn person against person and for us in the South West to turn against the people of London or vice versa. Local councillor Beth Huntley said that the majority of properties in the village were holiday lets or second homes, and that most of the population there is elderly. The member of Bigbury Parish Council said: We hope the community is free of the virus, but every newcomer brings a threat to the older community. It would be lovelypeople who own holiday homes stayed close to their homes. But I think a conciliatory approach is always a good idea.

But the couple hit back, saying they donapost expect the US to pay and their security will be privately funded. The US president tweeted: I am a great friend and admirer of the Queen  the United Kingdom. It was reported that Harry and Meghan, who left the Kingdom, would reside permanently in Canada. Now they have left Canada for the U.S. however, the U.S. will not pay for their security protection. They must pay! But a spokesman for the couple has now responded, saying the couple arenapost expecting the US to pay and that their security will be privately funded. They said: The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have no plans to ask the U.S. government for security resources. Privately funded security arrangements have been made.  When Meghan and Harry announced their plans to quit as senior royals, a decision which reportedly caused a lot of upset and anger behind Palace walls, they said they hoped to become financially independent. However they originally said they would continue to receive funding for security protection as Harry was born into the royal family and because of his military service. Their statement read: It is agreed that The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will continue to require effective security to protect them and their son.  This is based on The Duke’s public profile by virtue of being born into The Royal Family, his military service, the Duchess’ own independent profile, and the shared threat and risk level documented specically over the last few years. No further details can be shared as this is classied information for safety reasons. The average salary of a protection officer is about £, and the couple will need about , experts have claimed. There is also then the cost of travel, accommodation and overtime. Police in the UK feared guarding the pair as they tour the world on money-spinning trips could leave them unable to cope.  Earlier this year, senior officers were understood to be drafting emergency plans to double the ­protection team guarding the couple and their son Archie, who were all in dferent countries due to their schedules.

The cold snap moving in from northern Europe and blowing across the North Sea to Britain has been referred to by one forecaster as a aposmini-Beast from the Eastapos. This will be accompanied by some extra cloud coverage and sporadic outbreaks of rain. Sunday saw some Brits struck with snow, some even settling in parts of the north and Scotland.The Met Office has warned of more snow next month with bookies taking bets on April being the coldest ever.The bitter winds are expected to last much of the week meaning temperatures in the range of -C will feel as low as -C.  While cloud will be thick enough for some showers, mainly over northern Scotland and eastern, southern and central England. As such,  flood alerts have been put in place across southern England by the Environment Agency. Greg Dewhurst, senior meteorologist with the Met Office, said the week will be warmer than the weekend just gone, however, though will be cloudy.  He said the uncharacteristic snow in what was the official start of the summer time with the clocks going forward, was a big contrast to earlier last week. Mr Dewhurst went to say the cold north-easterly wind only added to the cold feel. The good news is that cold feel doesnapost last too long over the coming days. As we go into next week, it tends to stay on the cloudy side, so not the blue skies of last week, but temperatures will climb up a little, with highs of between C and C. Mr Dewhurst said, however, the changeable weather at this time of year meant it was too early to predict with any certainty the weather for the Easter weekend, despite punters placing bets on snow.The Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze said: “British Summer Time is starting with easterly winds bringing a late-season mini Beast From the East. Itaposs ironic after mild westerlies through winter. “Snow flurries were possible on Sunday in the East right down to Essex and Kent, and inland.

There was also an officiator, reading from a mini order of service and the rest of the bunnies were the guests.The amusing post soon went viral, garnering over , likes and , retweets.But the fun didnapost stop there, as the couple then decided to get creative with the transport for the bunnies from the wedding, placing them on an ark.Writing on his blog, Thai Spicy Travel, Mark joked: As tradition dictates, the animals went two by two. And as the government dictates, they maintained a safe social distance of two bunny metres at all times."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus good news return normal","story":"NewsCoronavirus good news!

Donald Trump has finally backed down on his insistence that the US would be open as normal by Easter - an assertion roundly slammed by medical experts. Yesterday the US president extended his stay-at-home guidelines until the end of April after a top medical adviser said more than, Amercians could die from the outbreak. The reversal by Trump, which he said would be disclosed in greater detail on Tuesday, came as the US death toll topped , from the respiratory disease, according to a Reuters tally, with more than , cases, the most of any country in the world.

Back in Britain, two paramedics had their food bought for them in Sainsburyaposs after shoppers rallied round to show their support. The pair entered the store in Loughton, Essex, on Sunday and were quick to catch the attention of other locals. Adam Brooks said : As I walked around the aisles I noticed two young female paramedics and I said aposkeep going guysapos and walked on, other shoppers also praised them too. Mr Brooks said that by the time he had reached the checkouts several people had lined up to pay for their shopping. He said: A guy said to them, aposWell done, you are doing amazing workapos and the paramedics looked emotional. He edged closer to them and said, I must pay for your shopping and then he tapped his card on the terminal. They couldnapost thank him enough. It was a nice thing to witness. While an artist known for putting motivational posters on city streets across the world is now sending notes directly to NHS staff. Andy Leek, , is behind Notes To Strangers, a public arts project in which he leaves colourful and positive messages for people to walk past in their daily lives.

Leek, from London, said the project was focused on helping and appreciating NHS staff, who he described as incredible.

Nothing concrete, though, and I want to prove my fitness first before doing anything.“If the season gets extended, that might end up being a good thing for me.“There might even be time for me to play for somebody this season depending on what happens. That would be great for my fitness before heading into pre-season.”Despite the impact the coronavirus has had on le back in Scotland, Murray and his family are planning to head back to Dundee in the coming weeks with his time at Wits coming to an end.In South Africa, the virus hasn’t yet had the same effect as in Europe and the football season was only shut down last week.He admits there are worries but being back home and closer to family and friends is a draw for Murray as he plots the next move of a career that has seen him turn out for Montrose, Downfield, Tayport, Dundee Violet, Arbroath, United, Hibs and then the Dark Blues before heading for Johannesburg.CALUM WOODGER: It#s a perfect storm and, make no doubts about it, Dundee and Dundee United are right in the eye of it\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp calum-woodger-dundee-fc-dundee-united-spfl-shutdown embed # secretlKqPsPpAv\" data-secret\"lKqPsPpAv\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"He added: “There haven’t been any deaths so it is all just starting here, to be honest.“I think countries like this have learned from the ones who got it first so President Cyril Ramaphosa here is putting measures in place for prevention, hand sanitiser everywhere and things like that.“I get UK TV so I’ve been hearing all the stuff from home, get to see Boris every night, and it is worrying.“Having lived in South Africa, you are isolated at the best of times anyway so that won’t be as much a problem for people here.“You never walk anywhere for safety reasons – don’t get me wrong, it’s a great place but you have to be careful.”Murray has loved his time in South Africa but says he’s looking forward to getting back home.“I’ve missed Scottish football in some ways, not others I suppose,” he added.“The football is good over here but there’s not the passion in the stands like in Scotland.“It’s a dferent culture.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Editor Andrew McQuarrie grabbed a torch, pulled on his big-boy trousers and joined the funhellipIt was .pm on a Saturday night and I was trying to communicate with a supernatural beingusing a pair of copper rods.Having done as instructed and asked the tools a simple lsquoYes Norsquo question, I was slightly dismayed to see the rods stubbornly remaining still, the spirit apparently refusing to play ball.Sheila, an employee of UK Ghost Nights, appeared quite perplexed as her eyes darted between me and the rods.ldquoAre you a sceptic  she asked, a faint edge of suspicion laced in her voice.I admitted that I was indeed a sceptic, but one who was more than willing to be converted into a true believer.Happy with this answer, Sheila ushered me into a corner that was, she said, known to be particularly popular with spirits.ldquoAre we in Melrose  I asked the rods, willing them to show even the smallest hint of movement.But after a full minute of tense observation, it was plain to see the equipment would not co-operate.An hour earlier, when the ghost experts were delivering their briefing, they had promised the  paying customers that ldquonothing is fabricated on the tours.The insinuation, it seemed to me, was that this would likely not be a night of high drama and theatrics.Nevertheless, I couldnrsquot help but feel a bit disappointed that my opening bid to converse with the dead had fallen distinctly flat.And over the next four hours, so it would prove, my luck would not change much.Yet, as I wandered the portrait-lined corridors of the George  Abbotsford Hotel, trying to channel my inner Bill Murray, some of the people to whom I spoke offered compelling tales.Few were as gripping as those delivered by Dawn Barrett - owner of the hotel for the last  months - and her cooking team.Among the unusual goings-on noted by Mrs Barrett, for instance, were lights turning on and off on their own, furniture moving around, footsteps at all hours and even the feeling of her hair being brushed.Asked for her views on the supernatural, Mrs Barrett said: ldquoI definitely believe - Irsquove seen and heard too much now.It was Mrs Barrett herself who contacted UK Ghost Nights in the first place, with the aim of getting to the root of what makes the hotel tick.ldquoI want to know why they [spirits] are here. I donrsquot understand how they can put lights on and off. I just want to understand it more, she said.Head chef Kailee Reidie, , spoke of an alarming encounter with a spirit who has come to be known as John, supposedly a grouchy ex-chef.As Kailee turned on the fryer one evening, while she was alone in the kitchen, her hair was pulled back so sharply that she was thrown into the table behind her, banging her head.ldquoAs soon as I turned my back on him [John], thatrsquos when it happened, recalled Kailee, going on to explain her emotions at the time.ldquoI was in shock because I knew he [John] was there, but Irsquom not a big believer in ghostshellip Irsquove never seen John - itrsquos just a feeling.Just a feeling. Well, there was certainly a sense of foreboding in some areas of the building - not least the cellar and the attic.In one of the attic rooms, we indulged in an activity called the lsquohuman pendulumrsquo. This entails three people standing in a row, with the person in the middle acting as the spiritrsquos means of communication.When the spirit is asked a Yes No question, the piggy in the middle is expected to rock forwards for a lsquoYesrsquo and backwards for a lsquoNorsquo - a movement being directed by the answering spirit.One by one, the customers lined up to participate in this creepy experiment, watched by the rest of the room with a mixture of excitement and dread.Time and again, the spiritrsquos presence was well felt. In fact, there turned out to be a number of obliging spirits, each surprisingly keen to answer questions including, lsquoDo you have childrenrsquo  and lsquoAre you happy with us being herersquo As I watched this circus unfold, I was praying Irsquod be able to endure the entire episode as an observer, a witness to the craziness.Not so much because I was scared - although I was a little, I must admit - but more because I knew what would happen.,params: .pushldquoAndrew, would you like to have a shot in the middle What followed was several minutes of embarrassment for everyone.Because of course I didnrsquot move. Not even an inch. And the change in atmosphere was so marked that I genuinely wonderedmy trousers had somehow dropped to my ankles without my noticing.Thankfully, my clothes had remained bound to my body, but any faith I might have had in the ghost-hunting process was sliding away fast.As the tour continued, taking in several other locations promising ldquohigh activity, it became increasingly dficult to muster the energy to stay alert, with the clock ticking into the wee small hours.That said, there was one incident which aroused a certain degree of puzzlement - a maglite which appeared to flash when certain questions were posed.Admittedly, that was a curious development. But still not enough to push me into the camp of believers.The more I dwelt on the nightrsquos events, however, the more I came to realise the deeper signicance of it all.Before the tour, UK Ghost Nights founder Lisa Tedstill had made sure I was aware of the crucial equipment to bring.ldquoAll you need is a torch and a sense of humour, she said, going on to lay her finger on the true essence of the affair.ldquoWe donrsquot guarantee there will be any paranormal activity - anyone who does that is a charlatan.ldquoBut we can guarantee everybody will have a very fun experience.And, indeed, while I may have left the George  Abbotsford that night without a firmer belief in ghosts, I certainly ed home with a smile."},{"url":null,"title":"council-powers-handed-chief-meetings-scrapped","story":"PLANS to hand Scottish Borders Councilchief Tracey Logan delegated control of decision-making are expected to be rubber-stamped this week.It comes hot on the heels of Prime Minister Boris Johnsonrsquos instruction that everyone in the UK should spend most of their time at home in order to counter the coronavirus outbreak.But on Thursday , in an unprecedented move, proposals to temporarily delegate the local authorityrsquos decision-making responsibility to the Chief Executive will be passed.Council meetings in Newtown St Boswells will be cancelled until September , with the exception of vital committee meetings which will be done through video-conferencing.SBC chief legal officer Nuala McKinlay stated: ldquoAs the virus makes a wider impact on public le, Scottish Borders Council must consider how to respond.\"In taking any decision to protect health by limiting social contact, it must also ensure processes are in place to enable it to continue to make urgent decisions.ldquoIn order to allow decisions to be made, it is proposed that all those decision-making s of council which can lawfully be delegated, be delegated to the chief executive to be made in consultation with members and relevant senior officers.It is also proposed that any committee meetings which do need to take place between now and October will be held via remote video links.Ms McKinlay added: ldquoThe Local Government in Scotland Act  allows a local authority to y that process and conduct a meeting by other ways.

Shersquos right, of course. We need such stories just now.My response was: ldquoYes, we all need to make our own version of Stone Soup.My youngest daughter overheard me. ldquoYuck, I donrsquot want that, I want porridge for breakfast like usual, she said.I reassured her and reminded her of the story. Itrsquos an old tale Irsquove shared in these pages before. It has many versions and I base the story in a land when there is a famine and people have very little food on which to survive, and so understandably people keep what little they have for their own use.But then a wise traveller fills his pot with water and begins to boil it over a fire. Then he adds a stone. People get curious and ask: ldquoWhat are you making  The traveller replies: ldquoStone soup.ldquoStone soup  Never heard of that.ldquoOh, itrsquos delicious and very filling.ldquoCould I try some ldquoOf course, but it would taste betteryou had something to add to it, says the traveller.And so as the story unfolds, each person adds a little to the pot, which means in the end the soup really is delicious and filling, and there is enough for all, because everyone has shared the little they have.But before they eat, the traveller does one last thing ndash takes out the stone!My daughter remembered the story and was reassured stone soup wasnrsquot on the breakfast menu. But I think the storyrsquos meaning has deeper signicance than just the sharing of food. Itrsquos also about the sharing of ourselves, and how adding a little bit of who we are can transform the pot of community.In the midst of all the fear and panic around us just now, this is what is happening. People are helping out, checking on neighbours and thinking how their own behaviour can affect others who are more vulnerable.And in all this, our mental wellbeing is as important as our physical health. Irsquom reminded of something my motherrsquos partner once told me. His name was Harry. He was originally from Holland and in his childhood he lived through the horric Dutch famine of -.He said: ldquoWe survived on rotten potato soup, tulip bulbs and a joke a day. Sometimes the jokes were as rotten as the potatoes but just as important!We need to smile, laugh and feel connected, especially in dficult times. We can all begin our own metaphorical stone soup and invite others to contribute and share.For example, many of my fellow storytellers are arranging online storytelling sessions. I will be telling stories online for the schools I currently work with and Irsquom happy to do likewise for any other organisation or group ndash once my six-year-old has taught me how the technology works!There are local musicians playing online gigs, people sharing recipes, visiting older family members outside their windows, writing letters and telephoning people for a chat the list goes on. One idea can lead to another, and soon a new community pot is made!Every contribution, no matter how seemingly small, can make a big dference to that pot. And in so doing, it will challenge that sense of despair and powerlessness that so many of us feel right now.So the question should be: Whatrsquos your thing  How can you safely share it  Whatrsquos your amusing or uplting story or your talent  Think about it and letrsquos share, for others, as well as ourselves.And so in the spirit of this, here is my wee contribution for this week itrsquos a funny wee tale passed onto me, so I claim no credit or originality for it. It was told to me by an Irish friend, but Irsquove adapted it slightly.There was this van driver called George who got a job delivering monkeys to the zoo.

It was so strange not being able to give each other a hug, as we have always done over the past  years of our friendship.I chose a walk in which I hoped we would meet nobody , and we walked two metres apart. Despite our plan not to talk about the virus, we inevitably ended up doing just that, although not all the time.The walk took us to the site of the old Byres Kirk, just beyond Ormiston. As hoped, it was deserted, and so we entered.The eeriness of current events affected my behaviour. I walked around with my friend, carefully ensuring I touched nothing. The original kirk built here in  is long gone. It replaced an even older kirk, the remains of which are hidden in private woodland next to nearby Ormiston Hall not far from this site.The first kirk at Byres was eventually demolished and replaced by a neo-gothic building in the s. But after the opening of a new church in Ormiston in the s, Byres Kirk was finally abandoned and eventually demolished in the s.But the graves remain, including war graves, and there is also a headstone erected by Isabella Burns, sister of the famous poet, to the memory of her children.It was this headstone I had come to see. Isabella was the youngest sister of Robert Burns and she lived in Ormiston and Tranent for a while. In  she was widowed, with nine children, three girls and six boys. She set up a village school to help make ends meet.Itrsquos dficult to imagine what her le must have been like, but I think the fact she was part of Robert Burnsrsquo immediate family may have given her a status and a degree of respect most women were denied.I found the stone and was intrigued by it. Two of Isabellarsquos children are mentioned one of them, Edward, died at the age of  in China.ldquoChina  I said out loud to myself, wondering what he was doing there. I saw the date of his death: November , .Then it dawned on me: the Opium Wars! He must have been a soldier. I quickly Googled it on my phone and sure enough he was serving in a regiment there.I stood for a moment, thinking about the story behind this scant piece of information. The Opium Wars are not usually a prominent part of our history curriculum, although they should be. The British state went to war with China to safeguard the ability of British traders to sell opium to the Chinese, which resulted in  million addicts there. Itrsquos a dark part of our imperial history, and the fact that a nephew of Robert Burns ended up dead in China defending state-sponsored drug smuggling by Britain seemed horribly ironic and sad. But it also gave me a sense of the connectedness we all have. The decisions people make, especially those in power, affect the lives of others in ways we will never know or predict.The memorial headstone also had a later inscription which recorded the death of Isabella herself. She lived until she was  and died in . She isnrsquot buried in this graveyard, however, as she spent the last years of her le in Ayrshire and was laid to rest in Alloway Kirkyard.Such a web of le and connection, now mostly long forgotten, revealed by this one memorial stone.As I left, I noticed the trees: oak, sycamore, beech and yew. They seemed to grow out of lost human memory, asthey were now s of forgotten stories.On ourjourney to the car, we passed another memorial stone, this time to the Polish soldiers who had been based in Ormiston Hall in the s during the war. This too is now a time of memory fading, but not forgotten, as the flowers someone left revealed.We had succeeded in a walk seeing almost nobody, except a passing cyclist at the end. Next time we go on such a walk, spring will have arrived undisturbed by human footprints. Keeping people safe must be the priority.Although it was an unusually sombre walk, we found time to laugh and see the funny side of things too. We have to live le, make the best of our time, and the times, we have.And when we can once again regularly venture into naturersquos wonders, what an extra special gt it will seem."},{"url":null,"title":"sleep-boost-prestonpans-youngster-charity-dad-supported-lends-hand","story":"Murray Scott, , liveswith broadcaster dad Mark,  mum Laura, , a supply classroom assistant at The Hub at Sandersonrsquos Wynd Primary School and sister Sophie, seven, a pupil at Prestonpans Primary School.Murray, who attends The Hub in Tranent, has a partially deleted chromosome which affects his development and brain.The condition also affects Murrayrsquos spine and hips he is unable to walk or talk, is doubly incontinent and is tube fed.Murray also has epilepsy and reduced vision, and for the first eight years of his le was unable to sleep through the night.Mark said: ldquoHe was born with it ndash itrsquos a chromosome disorder which neither of us [mum and dad] carries.ldquoHe would have been  months when we got the diagnosis ndash at that point he was one of  [sufferers] in the world.Murray is described by his family as a ldquoreally happy, content wee boy, and ldquoreally good natured.

Those who commit themselves to months alone at sea in the name of le-changing moments, philanthropy and legacies.It was in  that The Sunday Times announced the award of a trophy, The Golden Globe, for the first person to sail single-handed and non-stop around the world. The event was the first organised, non-stop race around the world for iniduals. Those attempting to make the journey had little understanding of how the experience would pan out or how their minds would cope with a year in isolation.The only sailor to complete and therefore win this first feat was Sir Robin Knox-Johnston, who crossed the finish line after  days alone at sea. Knox-Johnston once said: ldquoYou donrsquot really knowyour brain will stay sane. Your sense of humour is absolutely essential.Now a sailing legend, Knox-Johnston founded the famed Clipper Yacht Race, an event he started so that everyone who wanted it ldquocould have the opportunity to experience the challenge and sheer exhilaration of ocean racing.Sir Robin spoke on the current pandemic on his Twitter feed stating: ldquoBack from the Philippines, the crews now home and the boats sitting for the next - months by which time we hope this virus will be history.\"Now in self-imposed isolation for which my past has trained me perfectly. Look after yourselves everyone.A physical challenge on the surface, ocean racing is fundamentally a mental marathon. An endurance test for the mind to adapt in an ever-changing and high-risk environment.As the power and effect of the pandemic takes hold of the world, the constant change of climate and influx of data leads for new adaptions every day. This is an environment not dissimilar to the challenges faced by iniduals who take on these solo excursions.As a marine marketing agency, Gordon Ritchie, director of GRM Marketing, continues: ldquoDealing with offshore yacht racing and rowing can bring out the best in you. All of the small teams or iniduals are normal people doing extraordinary things.\"They are all well planned and determined. They all have a complete resolve to overcome any challenge placed in front of them and are determined to get to the start line ... that can be just as dficult as getting to the finish line where the risk lies mainly with the team or inidual.GRM is no stranger to supporting sailors and rowers making their way to the start line ready to embark on psychological journeys of self-isolation out at sea.The Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge is a -mile rowing race beginning in La Gomera in the Canary Islands and ending in Nelsonrsquos Harbour, Antigua. The race can take anything from a record-breaking  days to four, back-breaking months.This year, GRM supported two teams in this race named \"The Worldrsquos Toughest Row\", BROAR as they made their way to the start line and HMS Oardacious in PR during their final stages. In December, team HMS Oardacious became the fastest serving military team to cross the Atlantic and raised nearly pound, to provide mental health and wellbeing support to their submarine community for The Royal Navy and Royal Marines Charity. The charity aims to support personnel, veterans and families as they overcome challenges faced during and after service.Following the impact of the pandemic, mental health has arrived back at the forefront of many online and government discussions. With businesses facing collapse, iniduals facing job losses and with millions now confined to their homes, this pandemic is predicted to move from a physical crisis to a mental one.The anticipation of lockdown and self-isolation has been the anxiety-inducing issue facing iniduals worldwide as we adapt to this new normal. It will take a period of adjustment, but as in all situations and challenges we adapt, and can in time prosper.As serving submariners in the Royal Navy, HMS Oardacious shared their unique insight on self-isolation when embarking on the Talisker Atlantic Challenge.Lieutenant Hugo Mitchell-Heggs explained: ldquoAs a Royal Navy submariner we are well versed with spending extended periods of time deployed, isolated from society, our loved ones and what most would consider home comforts.He continued: ldquoSettling into a routine and being creative is fundamental to onersquos own wellbeing. Itrsquos never easy settling into a new pattern, and even for submariners, the first week at sea is often the most challenging.\"We also observed this on our ocean row, adapting to each other and our teamrsquos dynamic, to our new diet, safety culture and challenging environment. Twenty-foot waves and gale-force winds from day one was challenging, but with the right mindset we adapted and found ways to not just survive but also thrive.\"The benefits of a routine, and building things to look forward to in your day are a fundamental tactic for maintaining motivation and positivity while self-isolating.\"He said the value of a routine was that it \"provides structure to the working day, to the week and to the whole deployment patrol which can often go on for months on end\".\"Nutrition, exercise and mental stimulation are fundamental to thriving. During the ocean crossing, physical stimulation was aplentybut keeping our mental stimulation took being both creative and adaptable: audiobooks, podcasts, Christmas day karaokeand most importantly, conversation with our crew mates ndash whether it was jokes, banter or a lsquodeep and meaningfulrsquo while rowing under a moonlit sky.Upon speaking to Mitchell-Heggs and taking time to reflect, it becomes clear that in this period of crisis, we as a society have found great dficulty in the removal of the freedom to see those that we look forward to seeing, or the cancellation of events we look forward to experiencing. Holidays were the first to go, then events and gigs, now seeing friends and loved ones. What we now need to do is to find things in a simple day routine to look forward to.Your evening meal, your FaceTime to a friend, your weekly trip to the grocery store.

The concept of self-isolation, a once-unfamiliar term to the masses, has now become every inidualrsquos reality.In the coming months, we will see the effects of this new \"self-isolation\" and begin to understand the trials that sailors, rowers and explorers endure when taking on challenges that disconnect them physically from the outside world.Gordon Ritchie continues: ldquoIn the light of the Covid- outbreak we should consider that we are now at the start line and all we have to do is complete the challenge and get to the finish line.\"The common outcome is that everyone will have gained a lot from the journey, and be in a much better place when the champagne is uncorked.In this time, it is worthwhile to challenge yourself, try something new, learn something, donrsquot stagnate.\"If we can do it isolated in the middle of an ocean, anyone can do it from the luxurious comfort of their homes and with that constant connectivity, muses Lieutenant Mitchell-Heggs.How to beat isolation, by Sir Robin Knox-Johnston\"Isolation can be incredibly frustrating.

But in that lies the answer, create a project to focus the mind and pass the time.\"If you are a yachtsman, you can learn and practice your knots, or how to throw a line ashore. If you are a landsman, well those knots are always useful.\"Bear in mind I had no one to talk with. No communications at all for most of the time, so I had to think of things that would keep me mentally stimulated. I took to learning poetry. We have wonderful poetry in the English language, but anything that makes the mind work is good.\"Now many of us are staying at home with time on our hands, we could put the time to good use. It might amuse children as well.\"Knots are something many of us use daily so why not practice them, and learn a few new ones  It will keep those skills you have learned fresh for when you can get outside and for my Clipper Race Crew ndash when you re-join your boats next year.\"You have probably seen lines thrown from a boat that donrsquot cover the distance, or get tangled on their way. I suggest you go out into the garden with a rope and practice to develop this skill.

I had  days of it, but I had plenty to do during that period which made the time pass reasonably quickly. So there is the answer. Create a project to fill the time.\"I cannot get over to my boats where there is always something to do, so the garden furniture is getting sanded and re-painted and then I will have to face up to the long put-off job of sorting out everything in my Man Cave, apart from sorting out our new Clipper Race schedule, of course.\""},{"url":null,"title":"snp-mps-foreign-secretarys-incompetence-cost-abandoned-scots-lives","story":"SNP MPs Alyn Smith and Stewart McDonald have lashed out at the minister and the Foreign and Commonwealth Officeafter receiving hundreds of emails and calls from their constituents who cannot get home.Years of budget cuts and no comprehensive plan has left the UK Government playing catch-up with other countries such as Denmark, Germany, Ireland and Israel in its attempts to repatriate, the MPs claim.:Dont bring your virus here, Gringos: Scots stuck abroad face escalating tensions as they wait for help to get homeThey are now calling for the army to be used to bring people home, and sayswt action is not taken it could cost lives as the coronavirus pandemic worsens.Speaking to The Herald on Sunday, Stewart McDonald challenged Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to ldquopull his finger out, while berating airlines trying to ldquomake a fast buck out of abandoned tourists.The Glasgow South MP said: ldquoDominic Raab is showing that he is way out of his depth and it is our constituents who are paying the price for it.ldquoForeign Office Officials advising Members of Parliament to tell their constituents to crowd-fund or try and raise bank loans in order to get home safely during a global health pandemic is about as contemptible as you can get.ldquoThe Foreign Secretary needs to pull his finger out and start a global effort to bring our citizens home.ldquoPeople are being left with little or no money, are running out of critical medicine and in some cases are being left with no accommodation in the country they are visiting.ldquoThe airline industry, many of whom are doing their best to raise a fast buck and want to charge people eye-watering amounts tohome, are proving useless and ought to be ashamed of the way they are trying to extort travellers for money during a global health crisis.McDonald, the SNPrsquos Defence spokesman added that Raab should be using the Ministry of Defenceldquoto ensure that the armed forces ndash logistically well prepared around the world ndash start non-combatant evacuation operations for UK citizens and dual nationals stranded abroad.Should the MoD be utilised in the effort, no additional legislation would be needed as there are already measures in place for non-combatant evacuations.The MP said: ldquoDominic Raabrsquos dither and delay has the potential to cost lives.

In the city itrsquos easy to clock up miles on foot without even noticing, simply going about daily le. In the country, much of what you do requires a car or bus. Unless you have a dog ndash and a great many people round here do ndash it would be possible to live in the lap of hills, heath and woodlands without stepping beyond the garden gate in good weather and the front door in bad. This friend can go for months without getting her crampons on.Yet it is hard resist the call of the wild. On fine weekdays, as I sit at my desk, I hear the villagersquos retirees clumping past in their hiking boots, leaving base for an attempt on the nearby peaks, or merely a gentle stroll along the riverbank. Hoolet has more than its fair share of Munro-baggers, lean folk with the legs of grasshoppers and enough puff to inflate a hot-air balloon. There are so many dedicated walkers, in fact, that it probably partly explains why theyrsquove chosen to live here. Whatever the starting point, there are enough paths and trails to carry you across the borderlands and deep into Northumberland without using a drop of petrol.Another of my northern chums ndash she works on farms but still has the face of an English rose ndash has been planning a visit with her pony. She hopes to ride through Roxburghshire to Lindisfarne, a journey of  or  miles. As she BBs her way south, she requires not just bed, bacon and scrambled eggs but a basket for her sheep dog and grazing for her packhorse.Few things are more frustrating than not being able to stretch your legs because yoursquore working, knowing that others are out there having fun. My husband is often one of them, ing bright-eyed, invigorated, and caked in mud. He could feature in a detergent ad, though moleskins and scratchy socks coated in a rich chocolatey goo are not as photogenic as grubby football strips or toddlers drenched in spaghetti sauce.When I do get out, however, there is nothing quite like it. I can either walk up the back garden and out of the gate through the sheep field towards the lower slopes of the hills, or head into the village until I reach the woods. The first route takes me past cherry trees that in summer are laden with fruit, dangling from every branch assomeone has gone overboard decorating the Christmas tree. Itrsquos no wonder the place is alive with birds, who can gorge themselves on a daily replenished source of fruit, nuts, seeds, and the insects that nibble among them. With the squirrels getting back up to speed after winter, competition will soon heat up.One of our bird feeders fell out of the apple tree last week, thanks, I suspect, to a swinging squirrel that chases off the finches and blue tits whenever it swarms up the tree trunk. I watched the other morning as it dangled upside down from the summerhouse roof, desperate to find a way into the new feeder wersquove hung there, specially designed to keep it out. So far itrsquos showing far more interest than the birds. Who knows, maybe it willwith wire-cutters Up in the woods I once followed a squirrel that ran ahead of me for half a mile, turning to peer over its shoulder every few seconds asto make sure I was keeping up. Occasionally Irsquove come across roe deer, who take a startled look before leaping away like show jumpers. These woods are my favourite part of the walk, beech masts crunching underfoot, and thick drts of leaves hiding treacherous roots and holes. Thanks to the abundance of larches and pines, I sometimes catch the scent of the aftershave my father used to wear. And, even when rain is thundering, the canopy is so dense that in here it is dry.Itrsquos another world when you emerge from cover and start climbing. Leaf mould gives way to gorse and heather and a rutted track. We once met a man leading his horse as he bent double poring over the ground. He was retracing the route where, at some point, he had dropped his car keys. We took his number in case we came upon them, but yoursquod need a metal detector out here to have any chance. Scree and boulders, waist-high bracken and swamps of moss could swallow anything pocket-sized for the rest of eternity.By this point itrsquos high enough to catch a breeze, even on virtually windless days. Out on the hilltops themselves it can blow so hard that not just untethered hats are in danger but even sunglasses can go flying. Yet blustery or calm, sodden or sunny, the view from the summit stops time in its tracks.Spread out below is a peaceful landscape of fields and trees, sheep and cattle, and the occasional dawdling car. The hazy blue Cheviot hills fade into the distance, snow still clinging. In one direction lies the nearest town, dinky as Lego. In the other the horizon disappears much as it has for centuries. On my favourite peak, in fact, there is evidence of bronze age settlement, the trace of ancient forebears right beneath our feet.Itrsquos a reminder that, geology apart, what you see from up here is a largely manmade picture, the product of aeons of habitation and cultivation. Despite, or perhaps because of, that, getting a larkrsquos eye view is a great leveller. This vantage point invites you to think of those who came before, and those who are to follow. It also heightens respect for those creatures working ceaselessly to survive, never knowing what tomorrow holds. The sense of smallness and transience this provokes is oddly reassuring."},{"url":null,"title":"rab-mcneil-quiet-drink-home-unless-live-country","story":"MOST people drink at home now.

In our local, the drams are so tiny that just inhaling the aroma of your whisky drains the glass.However, during the current crisis , folk have been pining for the pub. So much so that theyrsquore creating ldquovirtual pubs where they can talk to their mates about the football, make several marriage proposals, and sing like a lintie to the despair of all others present.The influential Daily Star newspaper called it ldquooff your facetime, and quoted expert opinion that home drinking will rise from  million pints a week to m during the pubs shutdown.

Irsquom not even sure how the phenomenon works. Something to do with video-conferencing via apps on your portable telephones. Such a lot of nonsense.But I will own that the pub is a central part of British le. In its convivial sense, it used to be the case that this applied more to England, where therersquos always been more of a lad culture, but where women also could enjoy themselves within reason.Scottish pubs in the old days, by contrast, were pale and dour places.

Theyrsquore full of craic. Wersquove all become a little bit more Irish in that sense, and thatrsquos no bad thing.But, even so, the pub is rarely what itrsquos craicked up to be. Therersquos no rollicking piano in the corner. If you go in on your own, no one will speak to you. If you try speaking to a lady nowadays, she will alert the constabulary and have you arrested for hate speech.At least in your own house, you can say what you like. Or, failing that, you can just stare at the bottle, lamenting lost loves and le in general.Rural racketHERErsquoS an odd thing you learn only through experience.

In both cases, itrsquos a rare day when there isnrsquot someone nearby hammering, drilling or re-enacting the Battle of the Somme with weaponry from BQrsquos arms depot.If yoursquove a country road nearby that leads to nowhere and nothing, yoursquoll know the traffic on it never stops. Where itrsquos going and why is anybodyrsquos guess. And thatrsquos before you come to farmers ndash industrialisers of the country ndash and their ious infernal machines.Compare and contrast with a nice quiet flat in the city. With no gardens, sheds, DIY workshops or farms nearby, yoursquove no local loci for racket. You may even live furth of traffic. What bliss.PG Wodehouse has his witless urban characters frequently bemoaning countryside racket. But, writing before the age of electronic DIY equipment and horticultural artillery, he was referring mainly to birdsong, which I adore. In the garden, Irsquom uneasy when, for some reason, therersquos none.Birdsong isnrsquot at the same psyche-destroying pitch as DIY ordnance. Neither is it rhythmic.

Hardly had I unpacked my things than salmon farmers pitched up on the beach in front of the house and started rhythmically hammering on their cages.Silence: so dficult to find.

An investment would have increased our capacity to do something, austerity did the opposite, needlessly squeezing public spending and destroying countless jobs in the supply chain, leading to a decade of economic stagnation.It is vital to realise that when the Government grasped the scale of the crisis, pound billion was made available. This was not money saved up for a rainy day, it was money simply created to allow the Government to redirect the economy to a dferent path. If we need another billion pounds or another trillion, it can also be made. When the economy s to running at full capacity, we can choose to pay for it through some combination of lower spending and higher taxes and higher inflation. But not until then. And the Tory Government could have taken the same decision to abandon austerity at any point since the global financial crisis to drive the UK economy, but it chose spending cuts over protecting people.Alan Ritchie, Glasgow G.I WISH I shared Rebecca McQuillanrsquos optimism .Nothing will change when we get through this crisis in terms of the relationship between the haves and have-nots.This crisis will make nary a dent on the fortunes of Messrs Ashley, Martin and Branson.However, when shops open their doors again, pubs start selling beer once more and people resume flying, those who have been laid off viciously and unceremoniously by the respective owners will seek toto diminished businesses.If there was any justice Sports Direct shops and Wetherspoons pubs would remain as deserted as they are today but the people who would really suffer would not be their billionaire owners . The people who would suffer are the ex-employees competing for a reduced number of jobs.Who do you think will retain the upper hand the fat cats sitting on their piles of cash dangling the carrot of a limited number of low-paid jobs, or the employees who desperately need to recover from the debt they have unwillingly fallen into and whose Government aid has run out because we were all in it together but now we are back to ldquonormal The billionaires will still be billionaires but the poor will end up poorer.William Thomson, Denny.WHILST we rightly focus on the physical health of the population, the stock market rocks back and forth with many investors losing money and some iniduals making a lot of money by gambling on shares rising or falling.The lasting impact will be on the value of our major companies, normally profitable, making them targets for takeover by foreign companies at knockdown values. We have already seen Scottish companies taken over by Chinese and Korean businesses and production then being moved abroad. Witness for example the transfer of a majority of production of green technology to other countries and the failure of the Scottish Government to achieve its employment targets on renewable energy.We have a Westminster Government which believes in the free market and happily sees business sold off. The time has come to offer the same protection to business as the population at large. Stop all trading on the stock market till the crisis is over and ban the sale of UK companies to foreign companies and governments for the next two or three years in order to offer longer term protection to the working population.Bill Eadie, Gfnock.THURSDAY nightrsquos meaningless gesture of standing on your doorstep clapping NHS workers was frankly akin to rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic. I did not take part.Donrsquot get me wrong. As a cancer survivor I thank every single day for the fabulous treatment I received  years ago at the hands of our wonderful consultants, GPs, nurses, porters and auxiliaries. I agree with John NE Rankin . If we really want to support our NHS staff, lets pay them all a decent living wage, fund the NHS properly. We can do it. All we have to do is cancel Trident.What would you rather do have the capability to bomb a third world country or care for your elderly relative or loved one in a properly funded hospital or care home  Donrsquot stand on your doorstep clapping, campaign to ensure we have plenty of protective equipment for all our health care professionals ndash including care home workers. Value their contribution to our lives.Make sure they donrsquot have to work -hour shts. I am in my seventies, you donrsquot need to tell me what is valuable in le ndash health is the single most important thing we have.Anyone that thinks itrsquos better to fund Trident is frankly off their heads.If there is one thing that comes out of this dreadful situation we are all facing, it is that we must get our priorities right.Sheila Duffy, Glasgow G.THE Covid- pandemic is a viral disease which due to its scale has caught a lot of health systems on the hop. One of the inconvenient truths emerging about the disease is the number of very valuable health care workers who have become seriously infected with the disease whilst trying to aid their patients.This brings me to ponder the future method of providing health care for this type of epidemic given its sheer scale. We must therefore keep those presenting with new diseases away from our general hospitals.Would it not be possible to start designing and constructing large-scale isolation and treatment and control units with one huge central floor area ward to accommodate the very ill  All support systems would be bolt-on external units. They could be built and left in readiness.Specically, all attendant medical staff would work in the ward by using self-contained non-cumbersome support suits with additional plug-in ports for remote air supplythey were required to stay on station for an extended period. Upon leaving the area all would go through a dry or wet cleaning room before disrobing. All equipment should be reusable after drying and sterilisation.The North Sea designers for saturation ing, I feel sure, could provide valuable input to the methodology to support current medical standards and the extreme sports clothing designers likewise.Hopefully we will get through this crisis relatively unscathed, but lets be prepared the next time.Archie Burleigh, Skelmorlie.THERE are media reports on a daily basis of the statistics relating to the incidence of coronavirus in a number of countries. These relate mainly to those countries with a well-developed healthcare system: China, Italy, Spain, France, Germany, and, now, the United States.It is recognised that even in those countries where some testing can be conducted, there will be ying degrees of under-reporting.There is less reported information from other countries such as Greece, many in Latin American, Turkey, Scandinavia and the Balkans.Turkey, Italy and Greece have the additional problem of providing shelter to large numbers of refugees.As far as Africa is concerned, only South Africa has recently figured in the news.In many countries there is a huge disparity between the \"haves\" and the \"have-nots\", with the latter greatly outnumbering the former. The possible spread of the virus among those with little access to healthcare must be a terrying prospect. Intensive care units, protective clothing, ventilators  No chance. Social distancing in the crowded cities of India would seem impossible.Many aid agencies must be greatly concerned about the likelihood of financial support becoming much reduced as inidual contributors and governments struggle to support those in need closer to home. Most charity shops are now closed.Fortunately, there have been examples of kindness and neighbourliness extended to those in need of assistance. As the outbreak continues, there is a risk of this support wearing thin and there will be a need to remind ourselves that \"our neighbour\" extends beyond those in our immediate vicinity.Malcolm Allan, Bishopbriggs.LAST Friday I decided to avail myself of the generous offer, by Sainsburys, of the -am shopping hour for older people. So off I went to our store in Kelso wondering what would be happening.I have to say that I was greatly impressed by the organisation of the event, where staff conducted it all with friendliness and tact. I must also congratulate the older folks, queueing and then shopping, for their good manners and conduct. The staff replenishing the shelves were, as ever, friendly and helpful, and what efficiency as ever. This -am hour will now be when my weekly shop takes place on either Monday, Wednesday or Friday each week.Thank you to all at Sainsburys and I must also include members of staff at other places in this douce Borders town of Kelso who are managing things so efficiently. Indeed thanks to all who are involved in keeping our communities running as well as possible.I shed tears and smiled a lot last night as I clapped outside my house at pm, for my two nieces, and all the others in the medical profession, who are in the front-line battle against our common enemy. I heard other clapping coming out of the misty night and felt comforted.Thelma Edwards, Kelso.FOR the many families living in homes with no gardens, often on upper levels with no balcony, the impact of only being able to leave their homes for exercise once a day may have a signicant adverse impact on childrens physical and emotional health and development.With playparks shut and the advice being to exercise near your home, should we be mindful of some discretion for families living in confined spaces without gardens This crisis highlights the disparities in our society and as ever, the disadvantaged will pay the highest price.Diana Turbett, Isle of Arran.Read more: It is right that Scotland should take its own coronavirus approach"},{"url":null,"title":"politics-watch-thou-shalt-skype-moment","story":"Not so now. This is current affairs, brought to you by coronavirus. Video conferencing is Britainrsquos growth industry. People who hitherto thought Zoom was a synonym for speed are busily sending meeting ID codes to colleagues and friends.And just when Skype seemed rather passeacute, it is on every political  show in the country, as the presenters we are so used to seeing surrounded by people are suddenly surrounded by screens. Yesterdayrsquos Ridge on Sunday, Sophie Ridgersquos Sky News show, which is proving to be a more-than-competitive rival to Andrew Marr on the Beeb, was a tour de force of remote contributions. With the clocks having moved forward, as we blearily pressed  on the Sky remote we were faced with Michael Gove, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, who had also stood in for our coronavirus-positive Prime Minister Boris Johnson at Fridays daily Government press conference.My first reflection was to wonder what the odds would have been, four years ago when Mr Gove torpedoed Mr Johnsonrsquos Tory leadership campaign, of the former being the latterrsquos right-hand-man at a time of national crisis. As usual, though, Mr Gove was in complete charge of his brief as he delivered the incredibly serious and dficult message that there is no fixed end date to the lockdown.Big hitter though Gove is, he was followed on Ridge by the biggest hitter of my adult le - former Prime Minister Tony Blair. Customarily, Mr Blair did what the country still seldom gives him credit for he answered the questions he was asked fairly and reasonably, giving his experience of how governments around the world handle crises.The public mood of co-operation - the lsquoall in this togetherrsquo spirit which has characterised the last fortnight in particular - was brought to a halt by Labour leadership contender Rebecca Long-Bailey who, following the lead of her mentor Jeremy Corbyn, has struggled to join in the national group hug. The sky-high approval ratings for both Mr Johnson and the Tory party, which sailed over  per cent in a poll on Friday, will not persuade them to sht their strategy.Over on BBC, Mr Marr broadcast his show from the BBC newsroom rather than his usual studio which, in addition to the absence of guests, was another visual display of the dference coronavirus is making to broadcasting. After Mr Gove made his second appearance of the morning to close the show, attention turned to Gordon Brewerrsquos Politics Scotland, which opened with Scotlandrsquos new national hero, Jason Leitch.Dr Leitch, Scotlandrsquos favourite dentist, already has a CBE but it is as likely that hersquoll have a knighthood by this time next year as it was unlikely four years ago that Michael Gove would now be Borisrsquos number two. I cannot name a Scottish news and current affairs show which Dr Leitch has not been on in the last week, and his easy manner together with his straight and simple answers will become an example of good practice for companies like mine which perform a media training service.Mr Brewerrsquos shows, of which I have often been a part in the studio, are usually characterised by meticulous positioning of guests and himself in order to keep everyone out of shot during the remote interviews on screen. Yesterdayrsquos was simpler, with Mr Brewer fixed in position as all three guests appeared from their living rooms.Dr Leitch has been a busy boy. He has appeared regularly on BBC Scotlandrsquos The Nine, a show whose well-documented problems stem, in my opinion, from scheduling rather than quality.That news was offset, somewhat, by the excellent show last Thursday where Rona Dougall took viewersrsquo questions directly to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, cominglive from Bute House.ITVrsquos Wednesday night Peston show is surviving, although only without the studio presence of its eponymous host Robert. Hearing Anushka Asthana open the show by saying ldquoRobert Peston is in quarantine was a rather eerie opening to a show whose magazine-style formatmakes it particularly dependent on having guests in the studio.Political TV addicts and contributors like me, and I believe the producers of the shows, should use this as a time for reflection. Those producers who insist on guests being in the studio are right to a large degree. Last weekrsquos shows are far the poorer for the presenters being in solitary confinement.That is not to say there is no place for so-called \"down the line\" appearances. Depending on the segment, being out of the studio can work better. It is a balance, which some understand more than others.However there is much more we could think about during this time of reflection to improve our political output. We suffer from a basic problem that our studios are in the wrong place producing political television while marooned  miles from the Scottish Parliament.So, for starters, Irsquod like to see BBC Scotland and STV make more use of their Edinburgh studios, perhaps on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, when politicians are always in Edinburgh. This, at a stroke, would ensure that, in a post-coronavirus environment, presenters and contributors really can be all in it together.Andy Maciver is Director of Message Matters"},{"url":null,"title":"mark-smith-conversation-yes-campaigner-points-one-way","story":"The reason Irsquom saying all of this now is because of a conversation I had recently with a Yes campaigner. Yoursquoll know him: Alan Bissett. Hersquos a novelist, performer, and famous Falkirkian, and he was one of the leading figures of the  campaign and one of its most passionate agitators. Alan and I were talking to each other because of the plansto mark the th anniversary of the Declaration of Arbroath, but the turn the conversation took was surprising. It didnrsquot go how you would expect.The thing is that, for a while now, a lot of Scots who lean towards the Union have felt like wersquore living in an age of conflict, and that the  referendum was partly ndash no, largely ndash to blame for that. But evenyou disagree with that premise, or the cause, you might still agree about where we are now: Yes versus No, Leave versus Remain, Salmond versus Sturgeon, the human race versus Covid-. Even the attempt to control the coronavirus is described in terms of conflict ndash we are at war, they say we are fighting an invisible enemy.But whattherersquos a dferent way of framing this and a new way forward  When we had our chat, Alan Bissett told me he was just as much a supporter of Yes in  as he was in . The No vote was a disaster, he said, and Scots find themselves trapped and buffeted without any control of their political destiny. Independence needs to happen sooner rather than later, he said. Itrsquos an emergency.But itrsquos what Alan told me next that was really interesting because I think lots of Scots feel the same way, eventheir actual views havenrsquot shted much. What Alan said was that, for him, a lot of the heat had gone out of the argument since . In the old days, he said, he wouldrsquove gone on the attack, but hersquos better now at listening to people with dferent views, and has more respect for them. He still argues the case for Yes, but he does it with less of an edge in his voice.Why has this happened  Itrsquos because Alanrsquos been mixing with dferent people. In , he was living in Glasgow and working in the arts and most of the people he socialised with were Yes supporters. But he has since moved to the country and lives in a small village where he comes into contact with a more erse range of opinion. Down the pubthere are going to be lots of unionists and this fact has changed the way Alan approaches things.The lessons Alan has taken away from it all are interesting. Herersquos what he said to me: ldquoIrsquom talking to guys who might have very dferent opinions to me andyou start being too forthright about it, theyrsquore going to tell you to f*** off. Theyrsquoll probably see you as some a******* who comes into the pub and spouts off about Scottish independence. I canrsquot be that person. It doesnrsquot work. So itrsquos made me a better communicator and more reflective when it comes to politics. Irsquove got better at listening.Of course this doesnrsquot apply to everyone ndash just look at Twitter. The opinion poll at the weekend suggesting a big election win for the SNP next year also makes another independence referendum more likely, which will surely get the blood boiling just as much as it did in . But even so, for a lot of people, the passage of time, or a change of scene in Alanrsquos case, or the spread of an invisible virus, has made the debate feel much less aggressive than it was, and we should try to go with that. We should try to learn something from the moment of calm that some of us are feeling.I think Alan has already, and I hope I have too. One of the subjects we talked about was identity and how important it is to both sides of the argument over the constitution in Scotland. Alan said he was more aware, and respectful, of the fact that many Scots feel British and want to remain British. Itrsquos their identity, and the same works the other way round for Scottish nationalists: they feel attached to their identity and, letrsquos face it, even those who decry identity politics have an identity. We should all recognise and respect those facts.We can also do what Alan has done and pull back a little from the swing and punch of Yes and No. A good first step would be to come off Twitter, which Alan has already done ndash Twitter is merely fuel to the fury and is not the place for nuance or respect. We could also ndash when wersquore allowed to ndash socialise with a much more erse range of people, which Alan has also done. If yoursquore a Yes voter, make sure that your first post-Covid coffee is with a No voter and vice versa for unionists. And donrsquot just wait for them to stop talking so you can make your point. Listen.I appreciate some people will think all of this is naiumlve, but a more respectful conversation is more likely to produce a settled will that we can all go along with in the end and thatrsquos what we need. Obviously, Alan Bissett hopes the settled will is going to be for independence I hope itrsquos for the Union. But itrsquos more likely to be a broad agreement or a settled consensusit comes from a long, respectful, reflective conversation rather than a political punch-up. If we listen to each other and slowly move in one direction, itrsquos more likely to last. If we respect each other, we will respect the result. Irsquom going to try to remember that when I come out of isolation."},{"url":null,"title":"Marianne Taylor  How Coronavirus is exposing America   s weaknesses","story":"How could it not be with Donald Trump leading the coronavirus response  This is, after all, the man who only a few short weeks ago was playing the virus down iously as a hoax invented by his political enemies, a problem his government had ldquoclosed down and something that would ldquodisappear...like a miracle.This is also a man who stands on a  of hating science and experts, and whose utterances are weighed down by re-election.

Like the whole of the UK we are struggling to get PPE , so it is tricky,# he added.On stock levels, following earlier panic buying in the UK, he said that fresh food lines have fully recovered, whereas the full supply of items such as household cleaners, toilet roll, pasta and cereals are taking a little longer to fully recover, although they are still coming through the supply chain in more limited numbers, and should be fully recovered in around two weeks.Mr Tennant said that the store is now employing around  extra staff to handle the extra workload, which has been welcomed in the community, with so many other businesses having to shut down due to restrictions.On opening hours changes, he said that the store was now open am-pm Monday-Saturday, am-pm Sunday.However, he had taken the decision to open am-am on Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday mornings for NHS and care workers only, and am-am Monday, Wednesday and Friday for vulnerable people and the elderly.He said that this would be the case for the foreseeable future as the lockdown restrictions continue.The Orcadian Facebook page also features a pinned post showcasing numerous local shops around the islands, all of which are doing a fantastic job rallying to support folk at this unprecedented time of need. copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This is actively being considered at a regional level.Although there has been considerable modelling done within the Trust to look at how we might maximise available critical care capacity within our own hospitals, it would be premature for us to say anything more at this point given that things could change very quickly.”The Trust is also prioritising its resources to support the most vulnerable in the community. This has involved reviewing all Domiciliary Provision with families to identy what care they are able to provide for their relatives in these exceptional and very challenging times. This should free up domiciliary capacity to focus on those who require critical care which cannot be met by any other means during this COVID- period.Commenting, Phil Hughes, the Trust’s Director of Community Care said:“We will work with families to arrange for contingency placements in care homes on a temporary basis for iniduals where there is concern that the level of frailty and risk would indicate that this is the most appropriate way to provide care during this period or where the current care arrangements are unable to be sustained.We are also working to increase capacity in the community or care placements within our own community hospitals and residential units, in addition to working with the care home sector.The stepping down of non-critical interventions is allowing us to free up capacity of community nurses, social workers, care staff and Allied Health Professionals.”The Trust has also been working in partnership with GPs in primary care to set up COVID- Centres as part of a network across the region to manage the increased incidence of Coronavirus cases in the community. New centres will open in Antrim, Ballymena and Coleraine and the emphasis will be on patient safety, staff safety and the provision of a sustainable primary care service.The new centres will not be testing facilities and will only be for patients who are very unwell, are suspected of having COVID- and require medical attention. Patients will not be able to report directly to these centres without being referred by their GP or Out of Hours provider.The Centres will help to free up GP services to deal with the COVID- pandemic, whilst balancing the need for primary care services to continue with the minimum of disruption.For further information please contact: Claire Scullion on   .

A y bath and hair wash are not necessary because while gunpowder residue in your hair was always a problem, coronavirus in your hair is not.

If you’ve kept your balaclava it could be the best decision you’ve made since you said yes to the Northern Bank job.

Water cannon deployed most recently at Woodvale during the Camp Twaddell national emergency are available and ready to go with a : water-bleach ratio. Baton charges are being rehearsed at the PSNI training centre at Garnerville with officers wearing hazmat suits instead of riot gear and with temperature gauges on the end of their batons.

Andyou have to drive, fight any temptation to increase your speed because there#s no traffic around.Mr Swann urged extra caution for children playing at home.Playing at home is obviously vital for children, but injuries from the likes of trampolines are commonplace, he said.Again, it#s about being ultra-careful and supervising children at all times.Likewise, DIY jobs that involve heights or potentially dangerous equipment should best be avoided until more normal times .Our health service is going to be under unimaginable pressures in the coming days and weeks.There is no guarantee that normal levels of hospital care for fractures and other trauma injuries will be possible.Niall Eames, Belfast Trust consultant in trauma and orthopaedic surgery, said: We will do our absolute best to look after everyone, but we may not be able to manage injuries as we normally do.We therefore must avoid any injuries where we possibly can.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They were instead advised to stay at the back of their homes while Army technical officers made the device safe.Chief Inspector Gary Reid said: The device was subsequently taken away for further examination and I can confirm that it contained component parts which, had the device been detonated, would have made it viable.Mr Reid said officers hunting the perpetrators were working to establish a motive and the circumstances surrounding the incident.It is clear whoever is responsible has no respect, or regard, for the valuable police resources that were erted away from other community priorities, he said.It beggars belief, that given the unprecedented challenges we as a police service face in relation to the Covid- pandemic that there are still reckless iniduals out there determined to put the lives of others at risk as they did in Lagmore Grove.This is already a stressful and worrying time for people so,ever there was a time for this type of senseless activity to stop, it is now.Mr Reid also appealed for anyone with information regarding the incident to come forward.Sinn Fein councillor Danny Baker condemned those responsible.This was a senseless act and shows little regard for the community, our key workers, emergency services and health workers, he said.I appeal for anyone with any information to bring it forward to the PSNI.These reckless actions are in stark contrast to the efforts of workers carrying out essential work.Those responsible offer nothing, only disrupting the efforts of our emergency services to help those in most need at this time of crisis.

You have that dark humour.In the book Joanne talks about her pregnancy with Hannah, which was fraught with dficulty as doctors thought she may miscarry again, due to an incompetent cervix.Terriedof losing her baby, she was put in six months of bed rest during the winter of .Their beautul daughter Hannah was eventually born safe and well, following a caesarean section.I had to have a section because she was breach from  weeks, recalls Joanne.The consultant told me thats what saved her from going the same way as Jacob.They said she was standing up in my womb holding on to my ribs.Joanne got pregnant again but the pregnancy was ectopic, a potentially le-threatening complication where the baby grows outside the womb.The baby couldnt survive and the couple were told there was no option but to end the pregnancy.The operation didnt go to plan and Joanne had to have one of her fallopiantubes removed and two blood transfusions.After I came back from surgery I was in recovery for hours and when my mammy saw me she got very emotional.She said I know you want to give Hannah a sibling but you are my child and Hannah needs her motherI said right Lawrence, Im not trying any more. We have to draw a line under it.It killed me.I could still have another baby, but I know mentally that I couldnt cope.Throughout her pregnancies Joanne had been keeping diaries of everything that happened.Ive always written, she says. Even before this book I always joked that I was nursing until I decided what to write about.I wrote a diary after Jacob and I still have it. I suppose its like the mood diaries we use in work so people can see they are getting better.I made a diary of my pregnancy with Hannah and then after she was born I was content and I thought this is great, Im finally a mammy.I loved being in that mammy role and all the funny stuff that happened and I decided I really should keep a diary of all this.Joanne sent her diary to friends who were living in America and Australia as a way of keeping in touch and gradually built up the confidence to show some work colleagues too.One girl at work has a sister who is a blogger The Red Duchess, and she told me I should share it as a blog.I had it all on my computer to show Hannah when she is older anyway so I did it and I thought sure this is lovely.It wasnt until she was forced to take three months off work after breaking her shoulder that Joanne started thinking about turning the blog into a book.She contacted local authors Claire Allan and Felicity McCall for advice and they gave her the confidence to approach a number of publishers.Despite receiving positive feedback, Joanne found the process a bit overwhelmingand decided to shelve the plans for a book to concentrate on her career.Around this time a promotion came up at work and Lawrence encouraged her to go for it.I thought it would be a wee challenge but I was sick nearly every day when I was studying for the interview, she admits.Doubts would pop into my head like well, you were s*** at pregnancy and stuff.I did the interview and it was horrendous. Afterwards I cried so much and I knew it wasnt right.I was always grand at interviews and I never let it get to me. But I was just so low and couldnt get past it.The post came up again and I thoughtI went to the doctors and got something to settle me for the interview I might have a chance.When I went to GP surgery there must have a pregnancy clinic going on and there were pregnant woman everywhere and I felt so emotional.Joanne was seen by a young doctor and explained why she was there, but after reading her notes and listening to her story the doctor told her she didnt think the job interview was the problem.She said Youve had  years of trauma trying to get pregnantShe said Joanne, youre a nurse - youve just bottled this up and done most of this yourself and this interviewhas just tipped you over the edge.Joanne got treatment for her anxiety and kept writing to help her process her feelings and also record all the happy moments with Lawrence and Hannah and her stepson Dylan.Last year, Joanne heard about Jude Morrow, a Derry man with autism who had self-published a book about parenting his son.Judes book was a huge success and climbing up the Amazon best sellers list, so she got in touch to see what he thought about hers.He was hugely encouraging and told her to self-publish,advising her to spend a little money getting a cover designed for the book and to have it professionally edited.Joanne says self-publishing was a journey into unchartered waters, but she had the help of her dad and her self appointed PA Harry McGarvey.Just last week Joanne finally got her hands on the first copy of her book Memoirs of a Mad Mammy, but it was a bittersweet moment because she couldnt share it with Harry who was self-isolating due to the threat of the coronavirus.I left it on the garden wall for him and he was up at the window giving me air hugs, says Joanne.Copies of Memoirs of a Mad Mammy can be pre-ordered now on Amazon.It is also available on Kindle and will be available to buy at Little Acorns bookshop in Derry. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He says: Journalists have played a vital role in recent weeks providing the public with factual information needed now more than ever.It is a sad irony that the threat to jobs in journalism is higher now than ever.The steep fall in demand for products of all sorts has seen advertising revenue plummet. Widespread lay-offs are threatened.This comes on top of a series of blows in the past few years. The NUJ has fought hard to protect members. But against a bleak economic background, it hasn’t been possible to prevent redundancies.The hammer-blow of the coronavirus pandemic has now put a question mark against the very future of a number of titles in Derry and Donegal, as well as across the rest of island. Journalists fear further loss of valued colleagues.Journalism dfers from many other industries in that workers tend to have a close relationship with the communities around them as well as with those they work alongside.Many people can be sharply critical of the local media, but at the same time value what they do. A community which loses a local ‘paper will be poorer as a result. googletag.cmd.push Some of our local papers are strong and will survive. But others are at real risk. It is for these reasons that the wider public, not just those who work in the media, should support journalists in striving to keep titles alive and save jobs in journalism for the next generation.Journalists are no more entitled to their jobs than anyone . But we do play a vital role, which has been highlighted as never before over the course of the coronavirus disaster.The NUJ is in talks with government in both Dublin and London about the need for support to see newspapers survive. It is reasonable to ask citizens in general, and their political and other representatives, to voice their support for the union as it tries to save valuable jobs and the valuable role which NUJ members play. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Minister Mallon said: “Just yesterday I confirmed MOT test centres would no longer be carrying out tests and that all vehicles eligible would be issued with a temporary exemption certicate . However, this could not be applied to four year old cars and taxis due to legal requirements. “I am pleased to confirm that following signicant work by my officials, I am now able to put arrangements in place to ensure four year old cars can get back on the road,given the ongoing health advice, the journey to be made is essential. googletag.cmd.push “From tomorrow, four year old cars will be given a TEC for six months from the date that their MOT test should have been due. This will allow the vehicle to be taxed and driven on the road. Issuing the certicates will take some time but the exemption will automatically apply from the due date. “The PSNI has agreed to our request that given these exceptional circumstances, where PSNI detects a vehicle without a valid MOT certicate, it will in suitable cases, exercise its discretion under the law, in circumstances where there is no identied risk to public safety. It is important that drivers realise that they are responsible under the law for the roadworthiness of their vehicle at all times.” googletag.cmd.push The Minister continued that she and officials are continuing to urgently explore options to support taxis at this dficult time. “For taxis which require PSV tests, new regulation and legislation needs to be put in place to allow the legal issuing of Temporary Exemption Certicates and,despite best efforts, this is taking longer to resolve. However, I want to reassure taxi drivers that we are working urgently on options to help them at this dficult time. I recognise the taxi industry is being hard hit by this public health and economic crisis. I also am working with Executive colleagues and pushing hard for more support from the UK Government for the self-employed. Protecting drivers and the public from the serious impact of COVID- is my priority.” Alastair Ross, Head of Public Policy for Northern Ireland at the Association of British Insurers, said: “Insurers recognise that this is worrying time for everyone and will take a pragmatic view. They will not penalise customers for something that is entirely out of their control and where motorists with an MOT exemption certicate request a quote, they will not be prejudiced by their lack of a valid MOT certicate. This applies regardless of whether they wish to renew with their existing insurance provider or are looking to take out a policy with a dferent insurer. “Insurers do, however, expect that motorists comply with their legal obligation to keep their vehicle in a roadworthy conditionthey are driving it. Those affected by the ongoing MOT testing suspension should continue to service their vehicle and carry out basic checks such as looking out for brake wear, ensuring that all lights are working and that windscreen liquid and oil are at the correct levels.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Rosemarie and Sean Lynn from Dungiven tied the knot in a simple ceremony at St Columba’s Church, Long Tower after their original date fell victim to Covid-. The couple were married last Tuesday evening at :pm, just hours before government regulations banned weddings were due to be introduced. Rosemarie told the County Derry Post they were determined to go ahead with the ceremony. She said: “We got engaged in November and decided we’d get married on the th of April this year. googletag.cmd.push “A few weeks ago, our venue rang and said with coronavirus, they weren’t going to be open. “It was important for us to get married and have family and friends back at the house, so we brought it forward to Saturday the th of March.”  Boris Johnson and the British government had other ideas, however, and Monday’s announcement that weddings were banned left the couple ‘numb’. Things changed when Sean and Rosemarie rang their driver to inform him of the developments. “Brian, our limousine driver and he said: ‘Why don’t you ring the council and see what they can do ’ “So I rang and said we had the papers, we were getting married in the church and the priest was willing to marry us, but we needed the go-ahead from the council. She said to leave it with her. googletag.cmd.push “I was praying to St Anthony when the lady from the council rang back and said we had the go-ahead until  o’clock that night to get married.” The short time frame became even tighter as Rosemarie’s fianceacute Sean finished a sht as an emergency medical technician with the Ambulance Service. “Rosemarie rang and said: you’d better come home quickly because we’re getting married tonight,” said Sean. “I rang the duty control manager and was shocked when they gave the go-ahead for special circumstances. “I had to come home, lt the wean, scrub up quickly and get into the chapel. Of course, she was  minutes late.” Denied the luxury of time that most brides have to prepare for their wedding, Rosemarie was forced to improvise. She said: “I got ready, did my own nails, my own make-up, put the fake tan on, did the whole thing myself. “I had a wee dress I got last year that I just loved. It wasn’t even meant to be for a wedding, I just bought it because I liked it. “It felt like I was in a film. I wasn’t nervous, I was excited, but it was almost an out-of-body experience.” The couple’s faith was central to their decision-making, and both were delighted with the simple ceremony. Sean said: “I’m over the moon, I really am. “The big day would have been great to have, but the sacrament between me, her and God was the main thing.” “The ceremony was beautul,” said Rosemarie. “It was the two of us, the priest, two witnesses and Sean’s wee boy and we all had to stand six feet apart and sit six feet apart in the limousine because of the regulations. Although the couple were able to celebrate with a few drinks at Sean’s house, the honeymoon is on hold as he helps battle the threat of Covid-. He said: “We have a few days to spend together and keep le simple. I’m going out to C every day, so I’m glad for a few hours of something positive.” Rosemarie is hugely proud of her husband’s role. She said: “He’ll be back out in a few days saving lives, that’s what he loves to do. “He always was that kind of person who cares for people, and that’s what it’s all about now.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Letrsquos look out for each other in these turbulent times.Cllr McMurray mdash who spoke ahead of Mondayrsquos ban on access to Tyrella beach mdash said that last weekend he had been ldquoinundated with messages and calls regarding the number of people attending local forest parks.ldquoUnfortunately, it appears that the general population is not adhering to the advice in relation to social distancing and I would suggest that they are nearly treating this crisis as a national holiday.I will be reviewing access to our forest parks with party leaders and senior management team, he said.ldquoWe have been pushing a lot of advice and guidance with regard to the need for social distancing but it is not resting with the population. It is so dficult to balance the need to allow people the space to walk to protect mental and health and well-being, but we ask that the public refer to guidelines set out by public health officials to do so safely.Cllr Lewis said the closure of leisure centres, play areas, council-owned facilities and schools across this district had been done for peoplersquos safety.ldquoI appeal to people to recognise why these areas are closed, he continued. ldquoPlay parks and sporting facilities should not be used. It is imperative that we recognise and accept the seriousness of this illness. It simply cannot be business as usual, we must heed all relevant medical advice.Cllr Lewis added: ldquoThis is for our own safety, while also protecting the integrity of our health service and those vital, dedicated experienced staff who support it. Newry, Mourne and Down Council has taken extreme measures and please respect these steps. This isnrsquot a holiday and itrsquos not a jolly. We are protecting le.Cllr Gallagher said it was vital that everyone in the community ensures that social isolation is adhered to, highlighting the need to reduce the risk.He added: ldquoThe elderly and those with predisposed health conditions need to keep their distance and follow public health guidelines. Remain at homepossible and get someone to do your shopping. Family units are important. People must not allow others into their home and visits that are not essential must stopCllr Howell said that last week the Education Minister finally declared that schools would close to help prevent the spread of COVID-, highlighting the huge responsibility on parents to ensure that not just children are safe, but so are those they are in contact with.She added: ldquoUnfortunately, some young people think that this is the start of their summer holidays and they are free to continue with no worries or concerns. I am appealing to parents to inform their children about social distancing and the importance of adhering to the public health guidelines.ldquoIf your teenager goes out can you be confident that they will observe the required social distancing of two metres  Many of them donrsquot have the willpower to practice what is being advised.ldquoAs a parent I know only too well how hard it is to keep teenagers from going out, but we need to set the example to our children. If these social distancing rules are not adhered to, they will come home and unknowingly pass the virus to others, perhaps family members with underlying health issues or aged grandparents..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th March 2020 Pretend.jpg","title":"‘Pretend cough’ over credit union worker  ","story":"POLICE will be contacted after a saver in Downpatrick Credit Union ldquopretend coughed at a staff member last week during the coronavirus outbreak, it has been revealed.Mary Cullen, chair of Downpatrick Credit Union, warned that it was now operating a ldquozero tolerance policy as incidents of verbal abuse to staff increased during reduced opening hours.She said the credit union, which is situated in Market Street, had been inundated with messages of support after she posted a warning post on Facebook last Friday where she asked members to respect everyonersquos boundaries regarding social distancing and to accept the new reduced hours cover.She said a member of the public verbally abused a member of staff before ldquopretend coughing at them.ldquoThis particular incident is not acceptable and going forward, unfortunately, Members who cannot be courteous to our staff will not be served, said Mary in her post.ldquoWe are in a very dangerous time and are doing the best that we can. We are very lucky to have an amazing team at DCU, letrsquos appreciate and respect them as they try to continue to provide a service to members.ldquoThe support for my staff has been phenomenal. Members have contacted me to express their sadness and disgust that anyone could behave in such a manner.One shocked local person commented: ldquoWhat is actually wrong with people being totally ignorant to what is happening.Several people called for the person to be banned from the credit union.Mary said that the staff had to adopt themselves to the changed methods of operation and service in the public health crisis.ldquoWe have had a fair amount of verbal abuse since implementing restrictions on the number of people in the banking hall at any one time and staff have been working tirelessly to ensure a safe environment for all by encouraging social distancing, she explained. ldquoWe will continue to monitor member activity and behaviour and have a zero tolerance policy now in place.However, she warned: ldquoAny member who does not respect the boundaries in place or who proceeds to abuse staff will be asked to leave the building, I have told the staff that the Board support them ,% and continue to do so.ldquoI will be making contact with the member and we will be pursuing this matter through the PSNI.The credit union is from .am to .pm on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday and from .am-pm on Saturday.

If people did go out, they were advised to keep two metres apart.Council officials say the latest closures are part of the organisationrsquos ongoing coronavirus response and that the decision will be reviewed on an ongoing basis in line with Public Health Agencyguidance.Last week, council officials had decided to keep Tyrella beach and Delamont Country Park open and had agreed to waive the entrance fee to both facilities. But there was a dramatic U-turn on Monday when these two popular facilities also went into lockdown.Across the district a range of community events have been cancelled with last Sundayrsquos horse race meeting at Downpatrick taking place behind closed doors, with spectators locked out.The local authority want people to obey self-distancing requirements with its decision to close Tyrella beach and Delamont Country Park further evidence of its concern about people spreading the virus.It is clear that both facilities have now been placed in the ldquohigh risk category alongside the districtrsquos leisure and community centres. Local politicians say that their key priority is to protect the public and staff.The closure of Tyrella and Delamont comes after Sundayrsquos sunshine brought people out in their hundreds to ious locations across the district, despite government advice not to engage in mass gatherings.beachAnyone in Newcastle town centre last Sunday could have been forgiven for thinking that it was Easter, while nearby Murlough beach was crammed with visitors.It was a similar scene in Ballyhornan and along other parts of the Lecale coastline, including Kilclief and Killard.Rowallane councillor Kathryn Owens said she fully supported the decision to close Tyrella beach and Delamont Country Park.She said: ldquoI totally support this decision. It may not be popular, but sometimes we need to take the tough decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, after the droves of people went to local parks and forests on Sunday, it appears people still arenrsquot taking the coronavirus issue seriously and are clearly flouting PHA guidelines.Cllr Owens added: ldquoThis is not a decision that Newry, Mourne and Down Council wanted to take as we had hoped that common sense may have prevailed. It was a decision we were forced to take and we must do all we can to stop the spread of this disease..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th March 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C March 25%2C 1980  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash Downpatrickrsquos Grand Cinema is to re-open in September, six years after it closed its doors.Workmen will move in shortly to give the cinema a pound, facelt and when the picture house is re-opened, it should be able to compete with the best in Ireland.That is the aim of Mr Harley Breen, the owner of the cinema, who this week outlined the work which needs to be completed before the curtain opens.ldquoWork is expected to take around six months and will involve completely refurbishing the inside of the cinema, Mr Breen explained.ldquoWe will be taking out all the seating and replacing it with a new type of seating, the most exclusive available.

Her previous experience had been restricted to cars, tractors and Land Rovers, but she was always keen on tackling something bigger.ldquoBeing so fond of driving, it was only natural that I would take such a job. Lorries were out of the question, as drivers often have to load their vehicles, so when I say the advert for bus drivers I thought I would apply, said Noelene.ldquoI never thought it possible that they would accept me, so it was a pleasant surprise when I was offered the chance to attend the Ulsterbus training school. I was the only female among the drivers, but that didnrsquot deter me.BALLYGOWAN mdash A teenage Ballygowan girl has ben congratulated by the Northern Ireland Hotel Catering Association for her success at a recent salon culinaire.Margaret Wilson won the gold award in the junior section and this earned her praise from the Association.Margaret had been attending the Associationrsquos catering course at the college in Portrush this year, having progressed from Downpatrick Technical College where she passed the pre-catering course to earn qualication.She was entered by the Association for the salon culinaire at Belfast Castle at the start of the month, and her win prompted them to write to the South Eastern Education and Library Board to congratulate them on such an outstanding pupil.The Associationrsquos letter was read at Tuesdaysrsquo Board meeting, where members were pleased to se Margaretrsquos progress.

He wrote: ldquoSo I turned with all my heart to the Lord My God...He protected me and he consoled me as a Father for his son...There is no other God...The Lord God said through the prophet, lsquoCall on me in the day of distress and I will set you free and you will glory mersquo.They said this is a reminder that ldquoGod truly is our shield in the stre.

Cabinet members. A -year-old girl with no underlying symptoms. People in their s, , s, s, s and s. A man who was born in , when the Spanish Fly pandemic was sweeping the world. The fabulously wealthy. The poverty stricken. Brilliant academics.Covid- doesn’t give a damn. Not a single damn. Your background and location is irrelevant. If it can reach you it will strike you down: sometimes fatally, sometimes devastatingly – yet stopping short of death, sometimes not much more than a passing blow. And none of us has any certainty – even guesswork seems pointless – about which category we’ll fall into.Right at the start of the scare there was a view – no more than a form of urban myth, as it happens – that older people, + and maybe already regarded as ‘vulnerable’ in one way or another, would be hit hardest.Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is self-isolating after contracting coronavirus, chairs a morning Covid- meeting \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting... Yet we soon discovered that the virus is no respecter of younger people, or those not regarded as vulnerable, either. As I’ve said, it doesn’t give a damn.I actually took some comfort from the fact that, a few months short of my th birthday, I was probably more vulnerable. Maybe not a dead cert , but certainly with less favourable odds than the others in my household Kerri, Megan Lilah and Indy. I’m certainly in no rush to shake the Grim Reaper’s hand anytime soon – I’m presuming he wouldn’t go in for elbow-rubbing, even now – butCovid- comes into our house I dread the prospect of one of the others dying while I survive. That would be truly unbearable.Maybe it’s because I’m in my mid-s, or an older dad with children, or because the present crisis has made me revisit and reflect upon the mistakes and missed opportunities in my past, or the fear of the virus, or maybe even a combination of those and other factors but I do find myself unexpectedly upset, even weepy right now. Sleep is dficult. Relaxing is dficult. Switching off and tuning out is impossible. Politics and politicians no longer interest me. Oddly, I’m finding a quiet comfort in The Chronicles of Narnia, which I’ve never read before. Brilliantly written and hugely inventive.I find myself watching the young blackbirds hopping around our decking and feasting on the cat’s food. They’ve got used to me and ignore me as I walk to and fro, often within inches of them. We still have a couple of robins very happy to sit right beside me as I dig through the soil. I lay in the hammock on Thursday lunchtime and listened to the noise: not of planes and traffic, but of glorious, wonderfully cheerful birdsong. We have a grey squirrel who visits our tree-house and vegetable-patch barrels. Last year I would have chased him. Today, I smile and chat. In one way this is all so matter of fact, yet in so many other ways it is extraordinary. All of this is, quite literally, happening in my own backyard. It’s like having a spacious outdoor extension where we can unwind, run around, play swing-balland bounce on the trampoline.As I say, very ordinary in one senseyet psychological le-savers right now. We are always able, in a very specic, very important way, to ‘leave the house’ and go outside. We don’t need to walk to a park, or drive to a beach, or find a hill to climb. Outside is through the kitchen door. And it’s there anytime and every time we want it either separately or together. We spend hours in it every day and Indy,  months, runs himself ragged.Believe me, I’ll never take the garden for granted again. I’ll never complain again about mowing, digging, cleaning-up, watering, leaf-clearing, dead-heading, weed-killing, fence-fixing or any of the other dozens of little jobs I always tried to avoid. At a time like this, we are blessed – and I mean that in the real sense of the word – to have the garden. When this is all over maybe the developers, planners and architects who specialise in urban projects will consider the importance of your own, everyday, outside space, to our collective mental health  Like everyone  I also find myself focusing on the what-s from my past and present and the ‘I wonder whats’I survive, or don’t survive. One firm decision has been made:I make it through to the other side of this crisis I will get all of my adoption files and background details and read them. I had wonderful adoptive parents in Sam and Adelaide, who provided me with the love, support, strength and supply of second chances I needed to have the le I have now. But I exist because of two other people. I hope I haven’t left it too late to find out about them. Whatever happened and for whatever reason I was placed in an orphanage the fact remains I still have a debt of gratitude to my birth parents. I wouldn’t be here without them. I’ve also begun a diary about what’s happening right now: the story of an ordinary family and how they coped in extraordinary circumstances. I don’t know whether I’ll ever get to finish it, but as a writer it would be absurd not to record as much as I can about what is happening at this crucial moment in world history. And precisely because these are extraordinary times it is important that as many of you as can, also keep a diary, or even just a notebook, about your own experiences, reflections, fears and memories. What is happening now is happening to all of us and that’s why the collective, personal stories must be saved and told.Finally, stay strong, stay safe, stay healthy. Be more patient with each other, particularly the children. The next few weeks are going to be really, really dficult, I fear. Best wishes to all of you.

Performance of the Oberammergau Passion Play : Freelance“The nd Oberammergau Passion Play will be postponed due to the current situation caused by the corona pandemic.”In the Baian district of Germany, beside the Ammer River and framed by the Ammergau Alps, Oberammergau is a small town known for its woodcarvings, its NATO School and its internationally renowned -yearly Passion Play.The organisers of the Passion Play summarised the historical signicance of the postponement, explaining that the event “goes back to a vow made in . At that time, the people of Oberammergau vowed to perform the suffering, death and resurrection of Christ,no one died of the plague anymore.Engraving depicting the Passion Play in  : Freelance \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Therefore the plans to perform the Passion Play in  are currently beginning.”Held in the ‘decimal year’I attended a performance in , one of the most vivid and moving experiences of my letime, and indeed, I had toyed with the thought of ing this year.There would have been  performancesstarting in mid-May with an expected , visitors from around the globe paying between € to € for a ticket.The enormous production has been running since  except for two cancellations and a postponement.Crucixion scene in the Passion Play in  : FreelanceNearly half of the , residents of today’s Oberammergau are involved with the show - actors, musicians, front of house, backstage and looking after the horses, sheep, goats, cows and doves that add to the often intensely dramatic scenes.The other half of the townsfolk run the restaurants, shops, hotels, BBs and farmsteads where many of the visitors stay,they’re lucky.The nearest accommodation I could get in  was St. Anton am Arlberg in the Austrian Tirol.Participants in the production must have been born in Oberammergau or have lived there for  years.Oberammergau on the River Ammer in  : FreelanceIt’s not unusual for up to four generations of the same family to be taking part in the same run of plays, which can involve around  children on stage at the same time.In the th century, passion plays were held in many parts of Europe, often performed on carts in the street.They re-enacted Christ’s last days, from his entry into Jerusalem to his trial, crucixion, resurrection and ascension.In the bigger and more elaborate productions, when scene one ended the cart trundled off to another part of the town or city and scene two arrived, and so on!They were the ‘poor man’s Bible’ enabling even the most illiterate become familiar with Bible stories.But Oberammergau’s is the only play with its origins in a collective vow to God which has run, almost without a break, for approaching four centuries. This unique double-accolade brought the town a UNESCO World Heritage award.It’s quite likely that passion plays were already common events but a document in Oberammergau’s archives records “the first decades of the th century went by in peaceful calm…but then followed the Thirty Years’ War with all its hardships from  until . As early as , infectious diseases spread in Baia. This village was spared by dutul vigilance until the church festival in , when a man brought the plague into the village.”More than  local folk died and almost every family lost loved ones.“Faced with the great distress that the terrible illness inflicted upon the population,” the archive continues, “the leaders of the community came together and pledged to hold a passion tragedy once every ten years. From this day forward, not a single person perished, even though a great number of them still showed signs of the plague”.They made the pledge in  and the Passion Play was first performed at Pentecost in , on a wooden stage that some say was built on plague-victims’ graves near the church.Surviving documentation from the  production shows that the play ran ‘completed smoothly’ with seating provided ‘for spectators standing close by.’From  the date of the performance was changed to the beginning of each decade, by which time folk were coming from all over Germany to see substantial productions.Paint and painters for the  show’s scenery cost  guilders, ‘the gentlemen trumpeters’ got two guilders and  guilders went ‘to the actors for drink’!There was no performance in  when Maximilian III’s Clerical Council banned all passion plays and when another threat loomed in the s the so-called ‘mad’ King Ludwig II of Baia protected it from those who wanted to close down the ‘harmful’ passion plays. Following WWI the play was postponed until , and there was a special th anniversary show in  attended by Adolf Hitler.There were no performances in  during WWII, just the second cancellation…until now.Plans to perform the Passion Play in  are already under way, for over  five-hour shows, several thousand participants, a -strong orchestra and a -strong choir.\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Please try again later.Submitting...Staying fit and healthy was never easy, but it just got an awful lot harder. Lurgan man Geoff Gates, who has created the Limitless weight loss programme, believes people shouldn’t use lockdown as an excuse to adopt a poor diet and exercise routine.He said: “The Limitless philosophy has always been that the only reason people get stuck in a rut is because of their limiting beliefs. If you feel good through proper nutrition and smart exercise, you will naturally be drawn towards better lestyle choices.”At times of great stress, for many diet often goes out the window. Geoff shared his advice on how to eat well during a crisis: “The issue here is we need to be not using food to combat stress but instead, tackle the stress head-on, that’s the first step. “I get all my clients to start practising meditation immediately. When I first suggest meditation to someone, they often wonderI’m joking or being serious. It’s not some hippy-dippy woo-woo thing, this is a proper prescription. They often report profound changes almost immediately.”Geoff said that having been overweight and depressed himself helped him to create Limitless: “There is gold in the depths of despair, and I count my experience as a blessing now. Without my personal struggle, I could never have developed the techniques to create the best weight loss programme in the world.”He said in terms of nutrition it was important to focus on quality food: “Broccoli is especially good for the lungs and its funny that it looks like a lung, just like walnuts a great for brain health they look like a little brain. As bizarre as this may sound, I believe our creator has provided us with clues.”Geoff said the current situation makes it even more important to make shopping lists, especially now that visits to the shops are meant to be limited. He commented: “There are always ways to make healthy food convenient food. We all own a freezer, so it’s just a matter of being a little bit smart and preparing ahead. “I advise my coaching clients to buy freezer bags then put all the ingredients together in the bag and use as and when they need them.”In terms of exercise he said: “I don’t think it’s been more relevant to use our time to focus on our health and fitness. The most used excuse I have heard continuously through my  years in the fitness industry was that people didn’t have time. Now we have an abundance of it. “So now you have plenty of time the next excuse will be that you don’t have the equipment. I refuse to hear it. “The simple truth is we don’t need gyms and never have needed them. The way I see it is the gyms have been a luxury, not a necessity. “The misconception is that you cannot get strong, fit and healthy without one – the truth being you can get the same results with just your good self, become your own gym.”He added: “If I was going to advise on one piece of home equipment it would be an adjustable set of dumbbells. He suggested a quickfire lockdown workout could include  bodyweight squats,  star jumps,  straight punches,  upper cuts,  push ups and  mountain climbers.He said those conscious of social distancing could exercise earlier to avoid encountering other people: “I have always got up at am to train so when I am out running in the morning, there is no one about. For me, being outside when no one is around is perfectly acceptable. We need fresh air.”\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Michael said: “People think, the music is dark and intense, they’re going to be really dark and intense.The band’s original line-up of Michael, Andy and Fyfe \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...“The most messed-up people I find are people in pop music. A lot of them are horrible twisted people with weird agendas and they become quite damaged iniduals. Then they go on stage everything is rosy.“It’s really the old cliche – never judge a book by its cover. With us the lyrics are kind of twisted, but there’s a big, dark sense of humour there.“We let off steam when we go on stage and jump up and down for  minutes. You tend to be pretty chilled afterwards.”When the band first got together in  lead singer and guitarist Andy Cairns was a pupil at Ballyclare High. Michael, who attended Larne Grammar with Fyfe Ewing , wasn’t present for the band’s first recording though he was there in spirit.On the front cover of metal magazine Kerrang! in He said: “Fyfe and I were in the same English class and would have traded records. He was in a band, I was in a band. “His band and Andy’s band had played a gig at Jordanstown Uni. They had more in common than they did with their own bands. “They did a demo together. I was there in spirit because Andy didn’t have a bass guitar so Fyfe asked me and I lent Andy my bass. Andy played it on the first demo.” Michael soon joined to play his own bass and things clicked from the start: “Our first gig was at Giro’s supporting Decadence Within. It went down really well, I was flabbergasted. “We weren’t trying to be U or Guns N’ Roses – those were the two big musical things at that time in , . I don’t mind U and I quite like Guns N’ Roses but we had our own little thing going on.“You kind of gravitated towards anyone who liked something that wasn’t Bryan Adams at school. In Larne where I grew up the metallers hung out with the goths, the goths hung out with the indie kids and you heard Joy Division, The Dead Kennedys and Slayer. We clung together as musical outsiders.”The friendship between Michael and Andy has extended more than  years: “I think I was  or  when Andy and I first met. When the first album came out I’d just turned . I’ll be  later this month.“One thing we did find quite early on is that we tend to be huffers. We got that out of our system. If you don’t like something you say then, you don’t leave it for six months and have a meltdown in the middle of eastern Europe.“There’s a lot of rock and rolls myths and stereotypes out there that people love. One of them I think which is not correct is that you need to have creative tension in a band. Maybe that’s works for one or two albums, but that burns itself out really quickly.“It’s really great working together as part of the band, what I get out of it is quite special, I think I’m very lucky.”Michael contrasted the crazy intensity when the band shared a house together in Belfast’s Holylandswith the situation now where they all live in dferent parts of the UK.He said: “I think there was one time me and Andy worked out over an -months period we’d been within  metres of each other every day with the exception of Christmas Day.“Now I live in Larne, Andy lives in Cambridge and Neilour drummer lives in Derby. When we meet up there’s lots of interesting stories and dferent experiences to share rather than walk down the main street in Larne going, ‘oh there’s the lads’.”On Fyfe, his original bandmate who left in , he said: “I haven’t spoken to him since he left. We have friends in common. He’s doing alright I believe. He moved to Brighton, he’s been there  years now. He’s had very little involvement in the music business.“It’s a real pity because he was such a great drummer, it’s just he couldn’t really get on with the lestyle. Somewhere down the line we’ll meet again.”Family man with attic of collectablesLast year Michael contributed a recipe to a celebrity cookbook to support his nephew Matthew who had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia.Michael said: “Matthew is doing well. The family is getting things back on track. It was a big thing, he’s still a bit traumatised as you’d expect but he’s doing well.”Of family le at home in Larne he said: “My we works full time soI’m at home I’m daddy day care. The only downside is when I’m away, I’m away   so there’s a whole dferent set of challenges for my we who’s an absolute saint.”Askedhis children, aged nine and five, were excited about their dad being in an band, he said: “They saw us at a big festival in Europe which was great because they were at the side of the stage and they were able to see , people from the other side. “They’re quite blasé about their dad being in a band. They’re not into music that much, they’re more into games, football and karate.”Michael went on to discuss some of the Therapy  treasure trovecontained in his attic: “I’ve got Fyfe’s original snare drum that he used on Babyteeth, the basses that I used on Troublegum. I’ve got a lot of the flyers, posters, tour passes and recordings and audio stuff I’ve kept over the years. The attic is a disaster area.”In the early days of Therapy  a pair of denim dungarees were Michael’s stagewear of choice. Askedstill had them, he said: “I actually do. I’m quite pleased that I’d still fit into them but I never wear them.“When we did the Troublegum shows a while ago there were some bets that they’d turn up again, but it didn’t happen for whatever reason. But never say never – right now I don’t think the world is ready for that.”Michael explained that there were in fact two pairs of his trademark dungarees, one of them he referred to as ‘the good pair’ then immediately burst out laughing.“Can you imagine denim dungarees after three weeks of touring ” he said. “It’s hard to find a -hour laundrette when you’re on the road. They were crunchy. I’m surprised they’re still in one piece.”Dates cancelled due to pandemicTherapy  have had to cancel some European tour dates later this month because of the coronavirus.Michael said: “We’ve had to cancel where the crowds would have been above ,, some of the big festivals we were really looking forward to. As it stands we’re still planning to play some of the smaller shows unless told otherwise. “It’s something that you just can’t account for. Gigs sometimes have to be cancelled because of illness or injury but this is beyond the band’s control. It’s a bit of a headmelt.”Touring major European cities is a far cry from the band’s gigging schedule in : “When we started there was the Warzone Collective in Belfast and Hope Promotions in Dublin. They worked in conjunction and would bring hardcore punk bands over like Fugazi and Concrete Sox. “We knew the Warzone people and that led to us being invited down to Dublin to play with the likes of Babes In Toyland. “They’d rent rooms above pubs for gigs, in Belfast they used the Art College and the Conor Hall. “We were quite lucky to get in at that DIY stage.”It’s okay not to be okayMuch is currently being done to raise awareness and funds for musicians suffering from mental health issues, particularly through Aware NI, PIPS and Help Musicians. As a band Therapy  have been tuned into the struggle from day one with many of Andy’s lyrics exploring the pressures that weigh on the human mind.Michael said: “It’s something that we’re all very aware of and very sympathetic towards. Being a young male in Northern Ireland there’s a bit of a ‘come on, man up’ vibe. That has been very damaging for a couple of generations now.“There is a rock and roll myth that everyone’s an all-singing, all-dancing, all-fighting gunslinger – you roll into town decimate it and move on. It’s not really like that.“I don’t think anyone hasn’t been touched by themselves or someone  who has had a mental health issue.“It’s such a fragile thing. It’s right there, there just seems not to be the widespread acknowledgement that it exists and for treatment. It’s so underfunded. It’s a real tragedy.”He added: “We’ve always had a lot of empathy, we take people as they are, we don’t have the answers, but we do try to let people know that it’s okay to not be okay. “Just talk about it, talk to your friends, talk to someone, reach out. Thankfully that stigma is moving away.“We’ve always been celebrating the outsiders – be yourself, do you own thing, what makes you happy, self preservation, looking after yourself.”Michael continued: “It’s one of these rock and roll myths that people want their musicians to be messed up and die young and leave a pretty corpse. “None of us subscribe to that at all.“We like to have a good time when we’re on tour, but doing it for so long there’s a massive element of self preservation.“It’s about doing a good gig. People don’t come and see you againyou’re stood there looking bored or hungover. It’s not pleasant for anyone – the player or the watcher.“We all feel a big responsibility to put on a good show. There’s people who have seen us  plus times.“We want every show to be as goodnot better than the last time. You make a rod for your own back with that.”• Therapy  will play the Limelight on September  to celebrate the band’s th anniversary• To coincide with the ‘So Much for the  Year Plan’ tour the band re-recorded  of their UK Top  hits in Abbey Road with producer Chris Sheldon, who produced the original Troublegum album.

As the rain lashed down pretty much all day Friday and the wind did too much howling and yowling for my liking, we went to bed and then awoke to roads that looked like rivers between Sully and Barry and fields resembling lakes in Dinas Powys.My son and I played lsquospot the tops of the treesrsquo as we drove a erted route to get to his football match on Saturday morning and discussed climate change and the power of nature atas we drove through sun, hail, wind, and rain to get him to his match.The third weekend of storms has taken its toll. It feels tiring and worrying to be soaked once more.But it occurred to me as we left the house early and crawled along with other erted drivers that just a few miles up the road in Pontypridd and indeed in other parts of Wales and across the UK, people are witnessing their homes and business, their lives, being washed away and so as irritated and fed up as I may have been, I scrabbled for perspective.Perspective is a tough one. There will always be someone worse off and someone better off and whilst you can sympathise and empathise and seek to understand, you can only really know your own lived experience.But this is in part why I am so interested in the news, because in dealing with, embracing, enduring, revelling in my own le, I appreciate that window on the world to open my mind, teach me things and remind me that there are others in similar, same, better and much worse situations than me. It doesnrsquot stop a flooded road being frustrating, but it does remind me that in the midst of chuntering and muttering, because I do indulge in a chunter and mutter, thatpossible, it is important to take a moment to think about a world outside ourselves and our immediate surrounds.It can feel depressing. It is easy to feel powerless. But I do believe that as citizens in a democracy, it is important to have an idea about what is going on becausewe always turn a blind eye, eventually I fear, we might stop seeing anything at all. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The aim is that these virtues help to form them.With such a vast space at its disposal, the school ensures that children are given a rich and versatile experience.In the orchard, pupils pick fruit from pear, apple, plum, and damson trees which they use in cooking lessons during the autumn.They also grow  dferent kinds of fruit, salad, and vegetables in a polytunnel.Earlier this year, St Josephrsquos Primary was awarded a gold award in the UNICEF Rights Respecting School programme.The award is granted to schools which show a commitment to promoting childrenrsquos rights and raising awareness of these amongst young people.It recognises efforts to place the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child at the heart of a schoolrsquos policies and practice.ldquoAlongside our work on rights is the fact that we want our children to be aware of their responsibilities, said Mr Rein.ldquoYes, they have rights to be heard, but they also have a responsibility to listen to others.St Josephrsquos was the first school in Wales to develop a pupil parliament.Every child is a member of the parliament, and elected representatives from eight student groups form a cabinet which has decision-making powers.ldquoThe school parliament is a vehicle for the pupils to have a voice, so they can decide how the school can be a better place, how the local community can improve, and how we can help the UN to achieve their global goals, continued Mr Rein.ldquoSo the children are looking inward ndash at themselves and how the school environment can improve ndash and looking outward at how we can develop better links with the parishes and the areas of Penarth and Dinas Powys.ldquoOur Eco Ministry has been involved in a project to tidy beaches and pick up plastic, and our Healthy Schools and School Mission team have given food to local foodbanks.St Josephrsquos Primary is one of  innovation schools which have been chosen to contribute to the Welsh Governmentrsquos new curriculum framework, which will be rolled out to every school in Wales by . As part of the new framework, schools are required to design their own curriculum based upon the needs of specic learners, rather than adhering to a national learning program.St Josephrsquos curriculum is lsquoresearch-ledrsquo, meaning it is based on findings in child development and cognitive science.Teachers have undertaken training on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop, and lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social, and physical development.Mr Rein said: ldquoWe want our children to develop physically in terms of their gross motor skills, their fine motor skills, and their locomotion skills.ldquoWe have apparatus on which they can hang, climb, and swing, to build up their core strength.Mr Rein called the schoolrsquos curriculum lsquoreally ambitions.rsquoldquoWe are one of sixteen innovation schools in Wales helping to implement the new curriculum and develop special projects to do with the curriculum, he said.ldquoWe have taken that on by focusing on a knowledge-rich curriculum, so that we develop childrenrsquos knowledge, skills, and give them fantastic experiences.ldquoWe have taken good, rich materials from lots of dferent places, and developed some of our own, which we have implemented to a high standard.ldquoBehaviour in the school is exemplary partly because we have spent a long time asking what good teachers do.ldquoWe practice together as staff, so our teachers are working at a high level using a very well-researched curriculum.In last yearrsquos maths reasoning test,  per cent of pupils at St Josephrsquos scored higher than the national average, and  per cent of pupils scored above average in the National Reading TestldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos, said Mr Rein.ldquoEverything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.The schoolrsquos curriculum has recently been praised by cabinet member for education and regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, who said St Josephrsquos had done a lsquobrilliant job.rsquoShe said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning.ldquoIt encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It will cut planned capital spending to pound million from a budget of pound million and will work to grow online.MS said in a statement: \"Whilst we remain confident that the post-crisis future of the business and our transformation programme remains as strong as ever, trading over the next nine to  months in our clothing and home and international businesses is likely to be severely impacted.\"As a result, it is not possible to provide meaningful guidance on future earnings, although we are taking every step to secure future value for shareholders, colleagues and suppliers.\"The chairman of Wetherspoon has said that a decline in sales was accelerated when prime minister Boris Johnson told people to stay away from pubs.After rising in previous weeks, sales fell by . per cent in the week to March  and the slowdown has picked up further since the Prime Ministers statement, Tim Martin said.It came as the business reported profit before tax rose  per cent to pound. million in the half-year to January  on revenue of pound million.Health secretary Matt Hancock has warned that coronavirus will keep spreading as long as people continue to socialise.Speaking on talkRadio, Mr Hancock said: \"If you stay at home you are saving lives.\"I know, of course, this is a more dangerous disease for older people but not exclusively, some young people get it too.\"But, more importantly, the more that people continue to go out and continue to socialise, the more it will spread and the longer were going to have to keep these measures in place.\"So, were urging people to follow the public health advice.In the emergency Bill thats in front of Parliament right now, we are taking the powers to be able to enforce these measures, so we can make it happen by lawwe need to.\"Id rather not do that and the evidence so far is that the vast majority of people are following the advice, are doing what is sensible and right.\"The company said it was cancelling its interim idend, which had been p a year earlier.Mr Martin said: \"It is obviously very dficult to predict, in these circumstances, how events will unfold in future weeks and months, but we now anticipate profits being below market expectations, so long as the current health scare continues.\"As a result of this uncertainty, it is impossible to provide realistic guidance on our performance in the remainder of the financial year.\"The company has decided to delay most capital projects and to reduce expenditure, where possible, including the cancellation of the interim idend.\"As a result of these actions, combined with the Governments proposals on business rates relief and credit guarantee facilities, the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to maintain operations at a substantially lower level of sales.\"Nicola Sturgeon has urged anyone who left the medical profession in the past three years to consider ing to help the fight against coronavirus.Sharing a plea from Scotlands chief nursing officer Fiona McQueen, the First minister tweeted: \"Scotlands NHS needs our help to meet the #coronavirus challenge.\"Mr Hancock said some retired medics whoto work in the NHS to fight the coronavirus will be able to come \"straight back in\".Asked on the BBCs Breakfast programme when workers couldto the NHS, he said: \"Well, over the next couple of weeks because for some theyll have very recently left and they can come straight back in, their annual trainings been up-to-date and they can just restart.\"Imagineyouve left at Christmas, for instance, you can restart straight away. For others who have been out for a little bit longer, they may need more of a refresher because, of course, its vital that we keep people safe, thats the whole point of the NHS.\"So the letter will go out today, well then be engaging inidually with all those who respond and I very much hope that many, many thousands will respond.\"From those Ive talked to, I think people can see just how important this is. The training will happen for those who need it over the next couple of weeks, at the same time well allocate people to a hospital near them because theres a logistical exercise here as well.\"Mr Hancock suggested that tougher measures could have to be brought inpeople do not follow the Governments advice.He told the BBCs Breakfast programme: \"What I can say is thatpeople follow the advice, stay home which saves lives andthey keep apart from others, more than two metres, more than six foot, then we can tackle this and we can turn the tide.\"The scientists advise that we can turn the tide in  weekspeople follow the advice.\"If people dont follow the advice, then itll be longer and we might have to bring more and tougher measures.\"He added: \"We have brought these measures in earlier than Italy did in terms of where theyre up to with the number of cases.\"But were absolutely clear thatwe need to, we have the powers, in fact weve got a Bill in front of Parliament now to strengthen those powers further.\"But I think its far betterpeople follow the advice.\"The FTSE  has risen by more than five per cent in early trading as travel companies jump out ahead after a bruising few weeks for the sector sparked by the Covid- pandemic.Intercontinental Hotels jumped by about a fth despite revealing that demand for rooms was the worst it had ever seen, as markets opened on Friday.EasyJet also rose by around  per cent and cruise operator Carnival jumped by around . per cent.Meanwhile, the price of a barrel of Brent crude oil joined the rally, rising five per cent to . dollarsafter a massive fall earlier in the week.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has warned about the prospect of a recessionpeople do not receive their wages.Labour has urged the Government to ensure the salaries of workers are protected as businesses lose trade during the coronavirus pandemic.He told the BBCs Breakfast programme: \"We need the Government now to act to protect people to keep them in their jobs.\"In that way, what well be able to do is ensure people have an income coming in, their job will be protected, but we prevent the second wave of a recession hitting uswere not careful.\"Becausepeople lose their jobs, they dont have their wages, demand collapses in the economy and then you really do have a recession.\"The lesson from past crises like these is act fast and act big, so thats why were saying the Government should step in and say to employers, well cover  per cent of your wages, you keep people in work.\"Demand for a room at Intercontinental Hotels has reached its lowest point in history, the group said, as the travel industry continues to be battered by the coronavirus pandemic.The business revealed that it would be cutting costs, eliminating its idend and reducing salaries in a bid to save cash.However, shares in the group, which have been badly hit in recent months, jumped by around  per cent on market open in London as investors reacted positively to the companys proposals.Chief executive Keith Barr said: \"Demand for hotels is currently at the lowest levels weve ever seen.Intercontinental Hotel Group has a robust business model and the measures we are announcing today to reduce costs and preserve cash give us the capacity to manage the business through this unique environment and to support our owners during this incredibly dficult time.\"These were not easy choices and we are mindful of the impact these decisions will have on our colleagues and shareholders.\"However, we believe that these are essential to ensuring that we come out of this as strong as we possibly can and ready to capitalise on what remains an industry with excellent long-term growth potential.\"Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders , said the list of key workers to whom schools will remain open is \"perhaps more extensive than we might have expected\".He said: \"Realistically, theywill need to identy these children by lunchtime.\"Mr Barton added: \"We already know from the trajectory of this that were not going to have many staff.\"We have to be careful that the message to parents is not business as usual.\"Matt Hancock said that a communication will be sent to around . million people who are classed as vulnerable to set out specic action for them to take.The Health secretary told Sky News: \"The first thing were going to do is set out exactly what conditions that applies to.\"We expect about . million people to then get a communication from the NHS to say that they are part of this and what they need to do.\"Many of these people have pre-existing health conditions and so will be very worried right now, and I understand that, and theyll need very specic sets of action - for instance, how do you go about still getting your chemoyou have cancer whilst also social-distancing \"If you have cancer its particularly important to stay away from other people, but you also of course have got to keep going with your chemotherapy.\"He added: \"These are some of the most dficult and challenging cases so well be getting in contact with them, butpeople think that they are on this list and dont receive a communication from the NHS, then they also need to get in contact.\"So that is under way, the money was announced for it yesterday.\"A combination of money to the NHS and money to councils because theyve got a very big part to play in keeping people safe.\"ASCL general secretary Geoff Barton said schools will have first worked to identy vulnerable children, as they will know who they are, and will then be looking at the \"key worker\" category.He said the ASCL is telling members: \"You have to do your best to negotiate the key workers list. Youre doing this to a tight timescale, and what you offer children on Monday may be dferent to what you offer next Wednesday.\"Mr Barton said that initially, schools will be doing all they can so that pupils who need to can still turn up to their own school after the weekend.In the longer term, there will be more strategic planning of school provision, he added.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers , said: \"The Government has made clear that every child who can be safely cared for at home should be. And their advice makes clear too that this applies to children of key workers.\"For the vast majority of children and young people, school buildings will close tonight and not reopen for the foreseeable future.\"Taking up a place at school during this time of wider closure is the offer of last resort, for the minority of key workers, who have no alternative.\"School leaders have many questions that remain unanswered about how this will work in practice. We will continue to work with the Government throughout the day to provide greater clarity to schools to enable this reduced offer to be up and running as soon as possible.\"Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, added her voice to calls from school leaders urging parents to only send their children in as a last resort.She said: \"This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending. This will not achieve the goal of slowing the spread of the virus.\"So it is vitally important that parents follow government advice to keep their children at home, wherever possible. Schools can only accommodate a limited number of children and the fewer children making the journey to school, and the fewer children in educational settings, the lower the risk that the virus can spread.\"The competition watchdog has launched a taskforce to tackle businesses looking to exploit the coronavirus outbreak to take advantage of customers.The Competition and Markets Authoritysaid the outbreak has prompted concerns that people could be exploited by companies \"charging excessive prices or making misleading claims about their products\".It said it has already contacted traders and s over excessive pricing of hand sanitiser as part of its efforts.Andrea Coscelli, the CMAs chief executive, said: \"This is obviously a time when we all have to behave responsibly to protect our fellow citizens, and particularly those who are most vulnerable.\"We urge retailers to behave responsibly in the exceptional circumstances of the Covid- outbreak.\"Butthey do not, our taskforce is monitoring market developments to enable us to intervene as quickly as possible.\"We have a range of options at our disposal, from warnings to enforcement action to seeking emergency powers.\"The ceremonial of the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace, St Jamess Palace and Windsor Castle is being postponed until further notice \"in line with Government advice to avoid mass gatherings\", Buckingham Palace has announced.The palace said in a statement that the situation would be \"reviewed on an ongoing basis, with a view to restarting when appropriate\". article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.
