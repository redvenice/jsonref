Bright-yellow stripes are being applied to the pavement at now-familiar two-metre intervals outside the school’s three sets of gates, and over the next few days, these markers will appear in classrooms, too. In between, dedicated routes will be laid out to take children safely from the school gates to their classroom doors.These plans, orchestrated by Bonneville’s headteacher, Andrea Parker, were being rolled out as the school prepared to reopen its doors to reception, year 1 and year 6 pupils in line with the latest government guidelines. Schools, colleges and nurseries across England welcomed more children and students from 1 June onwards – and headteachers like Parker are busy preparing to embrace a new way of learning.“For every headteacher, keeping children safe is going to be at the top of their priorities”, says Parker, who is also the lead headteacher for Jessop primary and Stockwell primary schools. “We began our preparations by sending out a survey to check the pulse of how teachers and parents were feeling about returning to school. From there, we were able to start modelling what we need to do to support our families, and help them to feel more confident in sending their children back.”Since lockdown, the school has continued to take in around 25 of its 420 pupils each day, split into smaller groups for safety – the children of key workers, those from vulnerable families, or with education, health and care plans in place. “We’ve been open every day during lockdown,” says Parker. “Staff members even volunteered to work through the holidays, which has been fantastic.”Meanwhile, those teachers who have remained at home have been working on providing the online resources parents need for home schooling. “Overnight, we’ve all had to completely change how we work on a day-to-day basis with no training and no transition period, and teachers have been working incredibly hard to achieve that,” she says.At the same time, Parker believes temporary home schooling can’t replace the benefits of schools-based education, especially when it comes to the transitions experienced by those children who will begin returning to school from 1 June.“Reception, year 1 and year 6 are all key milestones,” she says. “Younger children are in the early stages of their education, and we want to be there for them as they develop their reading and friendship groups, and simply learn how to learn.“At the other end of the spectrum, year 6 are about to go to secondary school. It’s a time when they celebrate their SATs and everything they’ve achieved and worked hard for.”The Bonneville school building, which dates back to 1905, is large and welcoming. When I visit, days before reopening, crafted cardboard models of sea animals hang from the ceilings, and children’s work covers every inch of spare space on the walls.With only a fraction of the school’s 420 pupils in attendance – including Parker’s own six-year-old daughter, who is in school as the child of a key worker – the sound of children’s laughter, which usually fills these hallways, can only faintly be heard drifting in from the playground.“Our teachers are very excited and as desperate to see the children as I am,” she says. “They’re anxious, too, but going through our risk assessments with them has helped a lot.“With fewer children coming back to start with, we don’t need everybody to be here, which means those who are very anxious can be asked to come back later on. Hopefully they’ll see how things are working and their confidence will build – some people just need that, much like the parents who need to have a choice.”Home schooling for those children who remain at home will continue to be supported by teachers, but to reassure those who do send their children in, a raft of safety measures has been put in place.At the school gates, parents are required to socially distance from each other (guided by those painted stripes) during staggered drop-offs. “Bubbles” of up to 15 children will be dropped off together, with an allocated “bubble lead” – the class teacher – taking students into the building in shifts.Before entering their classroom, they sanitise their hands before being allocated a desk each for taking lessons, watching pre-recorded assemblies, and eating lunch, which will be delivered at the door. Outside space will be utilised for lessons as much as possible, while playtime and PE will be enjoyed within the children’s inidual groups.“Although younger children will be in smaller groups, it’s not just about the size of each bubble – it’s about dynamics as well,” says Parker. “Children are people with their own personalities and their own way of being, so we have to make sure each one is a manageable group and dynamic.”Extra hygiene measures include specific play and sports equipment allocated to each bubble, regular handwashing, staggered bathroom breaks followed by janitor cleaning, and early closing on Friday afternoons for deep-cleaning sessions. The early Friday closure will also be used to facilitate statutory planning and preparation time for teachers. The school has also drawn up sets of principles that parents, teachers and children will be asked to adhere to.For staff, these include having an awareness of each other – for example, no more than two teachers in the staffroom at a time. For children, the principles include reinforcing the NHS’s Catch it, Bin it, Kill it messaging. For parents, coming to collect children as quickly as possible if they fall ill.Bonneville has also worked to tailor specific solutions to the erse community the school serves. “In terms of the country Lambeth is hugely erse”, says Parker, citing the borough’s significant Caribbean, African and Asian communities, as well as pupils from Spanish-, French- and Portuguese-speaking backgrounds.“We know that the BAME community have surfaced as being prone to having a higher rate of infection”, says Parker, explaining that the school’s risk assessment process is being developed with the heightened vulnerability of BAME students, staff and their wider community in mind.Communicating to children why their schools have changed is a crucial part of helping them adapt to their new regimes, so Parker plans to share a virtual tour of the new school layout with pupils, and plug lessons about the roles of key workers into the curriculum.Parker’s plans have focused on building confidence among children, staff and parents, and communicating with them every step of the way. “It’s about trying to adapt, even though we don’t know how long we’re going to be adapting for,” she says.Check with your Local Authority for the latest news on schools opening in your area.This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

From Damien Hirst’s sword-fighter to a cat called Hodge, our critic picks his top 10The ship, which sank in 1912 with more than 1,500 souls drowned, has become a symbol of the precariousness of existence. It is commemorated by this marble monument in the city where the doomed ocean liner was built. A female mythological figure of Fate looms over a drowning sailor held in a mermaid’s embrace. Created by sculptor Thomas Brock and erected in 1920, it’s a passionate exception to the often tight-lipped statuary of imperial Britain.A contemporary of William Blake and the rustic bard himself, John Flaxman is a forgotten genius of British sculpture. His statue of Scotland’s national poet was commissioned in 1824 for a rotunda on Edinburgh’s Calton Hill. Today this intense Romantic homage to the poet as hero is kept in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, but it is worth climbing the hill to appreciate its original lofty location. Maybe one reason why this statue has become a magnet for graffiti is that it is such a striking presence in Parliament Square. A duller statue would attract less attention. For some, Churchill is a racist responsible for the 1943 Bengal famine for others, he’s the war hero who saved Britain and defeated Hitler and his murderous doctrine of racial hate. However Churchill is seen, this statue won’t let us forget him. It is a truly characterful work of art. Not for him the proud, upright stance, full of strength and absent of doubt, so common in lesser statues. This is a much more complex, much less celebratory monument, capturing the aged politician hunched over – weighed down by events, perhaps even by his own conscience and his regrets – but still strong, still standing. There is more than a touch of Rodin’s expressiveness about it. Ivor Roberts-Jones gave his brooding masterpiece a scale and mass that holds its own among the spires of Westminster, the seat of British power once wielded by this man. It is a statue that magnificently expresses the colossal place of Churchill in British history, and the many sides of the man – a shielding or oppressive work, depending on your perception of Britain’s most famous war leader.This statue by\u0026nbspsculptor Jon Bickley pays homage to a very privileged cat. Hodge belonged to the ebullient dictionary writer and 18th-century wit Samuel Johnson, who fed his pet solely on oysters. He didn’t want his servants to resent looking after a cat so he himself went to get fresh oysters from street-sellers every day. Hodge is included in\u0026nbspthe Talking Statues project, so you can hear him tell his own fat-cat story.\u0026nbspThis fantastical marble statue of a classical deity drips watery encrustations and emanates the mysterious power of nature. You’ll find it in the dark and dreamlike Grotto at Stourhead, Wiltshire. The 18th-century gardens are the setting of an ambitious array of public sculpture intended to educate the nation. Inspired by the art of Renaissance Italy, this garden god takes you out of the ordinary into the sublime. Famous for her photographs of people in the street holding up signs saying what they’re thinking, Gillian Wearing brings an unpretentious\u0026nbsptouch to this suffragette memorial in Parliament Square. Fawcett isn’t portrayed in some florid monumental way but as someone just like us, who happened to do something brave. She even has one of Wearing’s signs to share her message.They are neither heroes nor antiheroes. We don’t know what they may have done or are capable of doing. Innocent or evil, oppressed or oppressors, the figures placed on a Merseyside beach by sculptor Antony Gormley are none of these things. They are just human beings. Returning to prehistory for inspiration, Gormley creates universal, open images of our common nature.You can barely see the statue of Henry William Paget, Marquess of Anglesey, on top of his tall column, but this monument – soaring over leafy trees and green water – is still one of Britain’s most memorable. It shows Anglesey leaning on a stick, a reference to the fact that when this commander in the Napoleonic wars was chatting to the Duke of Wellington at Waterloo, a cannonball tore off his leg.\u0026nbspThis compassionate masterpiece asks us to feel for the oppressed. The six citizens of Calais who offered their lives for their town in the Hundred Years War become universal figures of human suffering in Rodin’s expressive hands. As they gesture their supplication in poses that embody a powerful range of moods, from silent dignity to tragic eloquence, they bear witness to history’s crimes and speak for all victims.\u0026nbspThere’s no danger of Damien Hirst’s colossal bronze bisected woman ever fading into the background as so many statues do. She towers over Ilfracombe harbour in Devon, raising a sword skyward for even more height. Hirst explores his obsessive theme of our secret inner anatomy with echoes of Leonardo da Vinci and no regard for anyone’s idea of good taste. This stupefying statue doesn’t commemorate some famous person. Instead, it looks inside us all.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6581b54dd7881463079915a2e00bf34a99b4272/2127_1278_4527_2716/master/4527.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6883e54ebcfbb6ef89eb865d2f5fbc9","title":"schoolchildren on lockdown in leeds in pictures","story":"It’s not the same for every family during the Covid-19 crisis.

Some have been displayed at the firm’s Waterside headquarters near Heathrow, but many of the 1,500 artworks in the collection have been on the walls of its executive lounges.However, with some analysts believing that the lucrative business travel market may never return to pre-crisis levels, lounges are likely to have more austere decor in future.According to the Evening Standard, Sotheby’s has valued a number of works held by BA for a potential imminent sale, with one piece by Bridget Riley – described by some as a masterpiece – likely to leave BA’s Heathrow executive lounge and raise millions for the embattled airline.The move comes as the majority of BA’s fleet remains grounded because of the coronavirus pandemic, with all of the aviation industry facing an uncertain future.Álex Cruz, the airliner’s chief executive, had promised to “take every possible action to conserve cash” when BA notified unions it was planning redundancies. The minimum consultation period for up to 12,000 redundancies passes on 15 June, potentially allowing the airline to start shedding staff, although BA has said it does not expect to do so on that date.British Airways did not comment on the art selloff, but a source said the airline was not ruling anything out to save money and jobs, and the idea is believed to have been taken up by management after asking staff where to find savings.IAG, its owning group, recently said it was burning through cash at a rate of €30m (£26.7m) a day. Plans to restore many flights in July are currently under review while IAG attempts to overturn the government’s quarantine rules, introduced on Monday.​BA said: “We are acting now to protect as many jobs as possible. The airline industry is facing the deepest structural change in its history, as well as facing a severely weakened global economy.”The Unite union, one of three representing BA workers, has disputed the need for mass redundancies. Len McCluskey, the general secretary, said: “The company is claiming to be in financial difficulties while\u0026nbspBA’s Spanish parent company IAG is still planning to spend close to €1bn to buy another airline, Air Europa.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/895e8ca2aa9aeba7d46ce9113882487e8fd8d4db/0_134_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9006a4e7ae8cbd401fafbb0e4e5f3abe","title":"business lobby group the cbi appoints tony danker as chief","story":"Danker has worked at  News and Media and at No 10 under Gordon BrownBusiness lobby group the CBI has appointed Tony Danker – a former government adviser – as its new director general.Danker, 48, will replace Dame Carolyn Fairbairn at the helm of the UK’s foremost business lobby group when she steps down in November after five years in the pivotal industry role.He is currently chief executive of Be the Business, a government and industry-funded organisation launched by George Osborne with the aim of boosting the productivity of British companies.Danker was previously chief strategy officer at  News and Media, the publisher of the  and Observer.The appointment comes at a critical moment for companies around the country as the coronavirus crisis plunges Britain’s economy into the deepest recession in living memory, and as the country gears up for leaving the EU at the end of the Brexit transition period in December.Against a backdrop of mounting job losses as businesses fight to stay afloat, the CBI has taken a key role alongside other business groups and trade unions in shaping the government’s economic response to the crisis.As an organisation with a direct line into government to lobby on behalf of 190,000 businesses, employing 7 million people between them, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, publicly thanked the CBI and unions for helping to design the Covid-19 furlough scheme.However, the CBI has faced criticism in recent years over its stance on Brexit, as one of the most vocal supporters of the remain campaign before the 2016 referendum and as one of the leading organisations warning against a no-deal exit.The lobby group also clashed with Labour ahead of the 2019 election after it was found to have exaggerated claims over the cost of Jeremy Corbyn’s renationalisation plans.Danker will be expected to draw on experience at Be the Business in attempting to fix Britain’s dismal productivity record of the past decade as the country recovers from the Covid-19 recession.He also takes over as demands grow on business to better serve society at large, rather than simply lining the pockets of investors and top executives. Pressure is mounting on firms to pay fair taxes, tackle the climate emergency, reduce inequality and boost ersity in the workplace.The CBI said more than half of the candidates considered to lead the organisation were female, while a 10th were from a black, Asian or minority ethnic background.Danker said: “It is an honour to be asked to lead the CBI, which is doing vital work in response to Covid-19. Meanwhile, Be the Business is also working to support thousands of businesses around the country through challenging times, helping them emerge resilient. This is my total focus until October.”Before his time at the  between 2010 to 2017, Danker was a policy adviser to the government of Gordon Brown, working in the Cabinet Office and Treasury.

It’s one thing to be accused, rightly, by pundits and even the odd shareholder, of “kowtowing to China” by supporting publicly the security crackdown law for Hong Kong. The stakes become higher when the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, makes the same accusation and, for good measure, mocks HSBC’s failure to win respect in Beijing with its “show of fealty”.Having tried to avoid making political statements for decades (apart from on the Scottish independence referendum, oddly), HSBC is now firmly on the geopolitical stage. Its board knows that, of course, and chairman Mark Tucker seems to have set the course: if push comes to shove, the bank will opt for China.Thus nobody should be surprised that Peter Wong, HSBC’s top executive in Asia, signed a petition supporting China’s proposed new powers for Hong Kong. For HSBC to post a picture of him with pen in hand was provocative in the extreme, but one assumes Beijing liked, or expected, the flourish.Yet, Tucker and the chief executive, Noel Quinn, can also be under no illusions about Washington’s ability to wreck a chunk of HSBC’s business should it wish. The ability to clear dollars is crucial for an international bank. The ultimate sanction – withdrawal of a US banking licence – may be many steps away but it exists and represents a very large stick.Indeed, we’ve had one mini-rehearsal already. HSBC was hit with a $1.9bn fine in the US in 2012 for allowing terrorists and Mexican and Colombian drug cartels to launder millions of dollars. The episode could have been worse if the US justice department had pursued a criminal prosecution. A conviction would have led to an automatic review of the bank’s charter to operate in the US.There was more than a whiff of politics about the decision not to prosecute. A US congressional report published letters from George Osborne, the UK chancellor at the time, and UK regulators warning of a “financial calamity” if HSBC were put in the dock. The calamity was avoided but HSBC never had much goodwill in Washington even before Trump. The UK’s ability to plead on HSBC’s behalf is surely also lesser these days.The Huawei connection adds another layer of complexity. To Beijing’s fury, HSBC handed over documents that led to arrest in Canada in 2018 of the Chinese technology company’s chief financial officer. Meanwhile, the response of ordinary Hongkongers to HSBC’s backing of Beijing is anyone’s guess. The bank enjoys a status unlike anything in the west, with share certificates handed down through generations a serious customer backlash could hurt.For now, Tucker \u0026amp co seem to be trying to muddle through. It’ll hope US-China tensions die down and presumably will keep further inflammatory stances to a minimum. One could call the strategy logical given the commercial bind but there is absolutely no guarantee it will work. HSBC is in a deep political hole with no reliable friends.Another day, another fundraising for Ocado, wonder-stock of the FTSE 100 index. It was only last December that the online grocery retailer, or supplier to other grocers of robot-filled warehouses, raised £500m via issuing convertible bonds. Now it’s back for another bite: £350m in convertibles, plus £657m of equity.Both offers, one suspects, will be snapped up. Founder and chief executive, Tim Steiner, tells a compelling tale about how the pandemic is accelerating growth of online shopping by years.

It began a phased reopening of schools in England last week, with primary schools opening to children in nursery, reception, year 1 and year 6 from 1 June, after all schools were closed from 23 March to curb the spread of coronavirus. Boris Johnson’s goal, however, was that all primary school children in England should be back in class for a month before the summer holiday.On Tuesday, the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, admitted that not all children would be able to return before the summer, with some having to wait until September. It is a serious blow for the the government’s strategy to bring the country out of lockdown, but an even greater blow for children – particularly disadvantaged pupils – who are losing out on months of their education because of Covid-19 restrictions.Headteachers and teaching unions had been telling the government for weeks that the reopening plan was unworkable because of physical distancing requirements, space constraints and staff shortages. On Tuesday, the government had to admit they were right.The government’s own guidance says schools should teach pupils in protective bubbles of no more than 15, half the normal class size, to limit risk of transmission of the virus. The maths is simple enough for a primary school child – if the usual classes of 30 are halved, a school will need double the number of classrooms and not even the most energetic and ingenious of headteachers can manage that.Ministers are going to leave it to the experts. Williamson has said he would like schools that have the capacity to welcome back more children before the summer break, but headteachers will be given the flexibility to decide for themselves if and when to admit more pupils. Schools in England come in all shapes and sizes – some are old Victorian buildings with small classrooms and limited outdoor space, while others can be adapted more easily to cater for multiple groups of smaller classes.Secondary schools in England, like primary schools, will remain open to children of key workers and vulnerable pupils, and students preparing to take GCSEs and A-levels next summer will – ideally – get some face-to-face time with their teachers. Otherwise, most secondary school pupils will continue with online lessons until the end of term.Williamson told MPs the government was “working to bring all children back to school in September”. He also said exams would take place as normal next summer. Teachers are more circumspect and warn that if physical distancing is still required by the end of the summer, schools may have to offer a combination of online lessons and face-to-face teaching, limiting the number of pupils on site at any one time.Education is a devolved issue. Wales has waited to reopen its schools until 29 June, but will only allow a third of pupils on site at any school and only for a limited period. The summer term will be extended for a week to help pupils adapt, and the Welsh government has said some remote learning will continue next term.In Scotland, the majority of pupils will not return until 11 August, after their summer holiday, and they will receive a blended model of in-school and at-home learning. In Northern Ireland, some pupils will return in late August with a phased return for the rest after that.Ministers are under growing pressure to spell out plans to help disadvantaged children catch up on lost learning. While they have been entitled to attend school throughout the closures, many have not and formal teaching has been suspended. There are fears the attainment gap will widen and disadvantaged children who have not been able to access online resources from home will fall further behind. There have been calls for summer camps, but planning appears to be at an early stage and the education secretary has acknowledged it will take more than a few weeks to help close the gap."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/178afdc6aaac8c768787d1ba6bf4221371f8b65f/0_0_4515_2709/master/4515.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc712039da8b26a3634e3199cd828bc7","title":"chris packham the virus has taught us that we are part of nature not above it","story":"The naturalist has always spoken his mind – and attracted death threats in the process. But Covid-19 has given him a new perspective on how humans can live in harmony with the natural world ‘I’m tramping through damp, long grass in the wake of two poodles,” Chris Packham tells me, over the phone, at nine in the morning, from his home near Southampton. “One of the joys of the UK is this rich, verdant colour at this time of year, so green that it’s almost blinding.” The naturalist’s voice, compelling and contemplative, draws you in and slows you down, to the point where you are concentrating hard enough to see what he describes, even when you can’t.Generally, of course, you can see it: Springwatch has been back on screens, packed with the images – baby birds with their gaping maws, treecreepers blinking – we have always cherished and lately come to rely on. Packham, 59, has such a natural, contagious sincerity in his enthusiasm that he should be in the “national treasure” class, one of those rare figures who unites the country and is immune from politics. But he determinedly is not – he won’t, today, talk about grouse, hen harriers or any of those bird-cruelty issues that have brought him death threats of the most lurid kind (dead birds hung up by his gatepost, Twitter abuse too awful to detail). The BBC, I am given to understand, would prefer him not to speak on these topics. But in January he fell foul of the neutrality police in another way: while promoting his documentary about the global population, he said that, for the sake of the planet, people should consider having fewer children (he has no biological children).Packham admits the idea is controversial, but “I approach things as a pragmatic biologist”, he says, calmly. “There’s not a racist cell in my body I don’t think of humans as being different.” That was not my question, although he has been accused – nefariously, he says – of singling out countries such as Nigeria, and therefore pointing the finger at sub-Saharan Africa, when “the real problem is what you and I are consuming”. “Ultimately, we are all the same species, in the same place, at the same time, with the same problem, and if we don’t start thinking collectively to sort it out, then we won’t do it,” he says. “A global conversation about how many people the planet can sustain is something that has to happen.”\u0026nbspI happen to disagree – if you look at the recent work of the social geographer Danny Dorling, it shows that birth rates are already in decline worldwide we are entering a natural slowdown. What we have not managed to slow down is rich people’s consumption.But, in a way, this makes me admire Packham all the more: there is enough to contest in these choppy waters that he could avoid them altogether and still hold his head high as a passionate defender of the natural world. He does not play it safe, nor does he skirt the largest, most uncomfortable implications of his analysis. He worries constantly – about the IPCC’s warning that we have 10 years to solve the climate crisis, about the strongman politics dominating the world stage, about the loss of bioersity and the long-term impact that will have on harvests – but he does not\u0026nbspsound\u0026nbspworried. He sounds like a man telling you that your boiler is broken, but he knows how to fix it.We need better leaders, given that we are living under “undoubtedly the worst portfolio of politicians that we could possibly have imaged in our lifetime”, and we need to “shape a new world” after the pandemic, with the environment at the centre of our decision-making. On reflection, we all know how to fix this boiler, just as we all enjoy the sight of a ladybird, but it is soothing and exciting to hear it described.Packham always says of his early life, growing up in Hampshire, that he was a bit difficult, emotionally adrift, until he took a baby kestrel from its nest when he was 14 and fell violently in love with it. This led to a zoology degree, at the University of Southampton. He got into TV not via presenting, but in production, for the BBC’s 1984 series The Living Planet. His career as a presenter started with The Really Wild Show, in 1986, when he electrified the nature scene with his Gary Rhodes hair and his apparently effortless fluency.He has an endearing Dr Dolittle quality the defining images of his career capture him cuddling an animal or bird that does not like to be cuddled. Here he is with an owl, now with a badger. He is much more evangelist than showman.\u0026nbsp“I probably got as much joy out of other people reconnecting with nature as I have got from reconnecting with nature myself,” he says of the lockdown period. “It’s been an absolute joy to see people posting pictures with ladybirds on their fingers and frogs in their ponds and birds singing in their gardens, but they will now have to join our ranks and remember what they took from that, because we do have to fight for it.”As the pandemic confined us all to our homes, he and his 25-year-old stepdaughter, Megan McCubbin, launched The Self-Isolating Bird Club: half an hour a day of guerrilla twitching, broadcast on Facebook every morning. “People seemed to like it,” he says (7.8 million of them tuned in). He and McCubbin have since taken their double act to Springwatch. “The producers of Springwatch liked our on-screen rapport. I call it bickering, they call it on-screen rapport.”\u0026nbspHe is keen to stress that McCubbin is a good, sound zoologist in her own right: “She knows her stuff, she likes science and understanding things. She loves finding out things that I don’t know and she does that very easily.” You would struggle to say who is the straight man of the double act – they are both incredibly, winningly geeky.McCubbin is the daughter of Packham’s ex-partner, Jo McCubbin. They split up years ago, but Packham remained a large and influential part of her life – she came to zoology partly thanks to time she spent at the Isle of Wight zoo run by Packham’s partner, Charlotte Corney. He describes these relationships as “a relatively confused – but not too unusual, these days – family setup.” They all get on very well. “Charlotte goes to Jo’s parties I don’t. I’m not a party sort of person.” (I am reminded of the joke about the doctor, the lawyer and the mathematician who are each asked whether it is better to have a wife or a mistress. The doctor says it is better for your health to be married. The lawyer says it is better for your finances to be unmarried. The mathematician says: “It is better to have a wife\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspa mistress – then they can chat and you can go off and do maths.”)He is relatively equanimous about the restrictions of the pandemic, as you might imagine of a person who does not like parties. But he is deadly serious about Covid-19. “Speaking entirely biologically, what the whole, horribly harsh, tragic lesson of the virus has taught us is that we are part of nature we’re not there to hold dominion over it, we’re not above it.“We’ve always been exposed to pathogens – everything from smallpox to bubonic plague. We’ve beaten them through our advances in science and I’m not regretting that. But we are an organism, living on a planet, and the way we were living was unsustainable. We were overcrowded, we were eating animals that we’d shipped alive from one part of the world to another, and we’re paying a terrible price for it.”This is not a million miles away from the putative Extinction Rebellion (XR) stickers, disavowed by the group as fake, that read “Corona is the cure, humans are the virus”. But he reiterates that he is not against medical advances he is very much in favour of people living long and healthy lives. Nevertheless, he does not situate the plight of mankind at the centre of his thinking we are no more than one part of an infinitely precious ecosystem – and we are the part causing the problems.This is the kernel of his radicalism – and no broadcaster’s duty of impartiality will make him disavow it, nor his support for XR and similar movements. “That’s the most positive thing that we’ve seen – Extinction Rebellion, Fridays for Future. All those young people have taken to the streets, in an informed way and in a peaceful way. That’s been absolutely heartening. That gives me a sense of hope.“And again, in the last week, we’ve seen all of these demonstrations because of continued racism. Some of them have been violent. I never support violence, but a lot of people are very, very angry. When people reach that tipping point, they no longer sit in bars they take to the streets and demand their rights. We need to be demanding a right to a healthy environment and I think we’ve started to do that.” (I spoke to Packham before the Bristol protest at which the statue of Edward Colston was torn down, so this should not be taken as a comment on that, but my impression is that his heart is with the angry protesters, rather than those bemoaning the civil unrest.)\u0026nbspIn his sentiment and his delivery – quietly passionate, unabashed by what is and is not considered acceptable – Packham is very like Greta Thunberg, who often says that she thinks her Asperger’s is part of what makes her the activist she is. She is not affected by convention or “the Overton window” (the range of policies deemed politically acceptable by the mainstream), but rather tells the truth as she sees it.Packham was diagnosed with Asperger’s in 2005 and has spoken openly about it since, although he does not describe it in terms of upsides. “I struggled terribly when I was younger. Not as a young child, but later, when I was an adolescent and going in to my 20s. And my hope in speaking about it openly was that young people wouldn’t suffer in the same way. Because if they had a better understanding, and the people around them had a better understanding, life would be a lot easier. And it’s been quite heart-rending more people come up to me and talk about autism than do about natural history.”His job, though, is the same in both cases – to explain things, he says, in relatively simple ways. “I don’t mean that in a patronising way. I just mean speaking frankly and plainly.”\u0026nbspThe last time I interviewed Packham was five years ago. Back then, while powerfully exercised about animal cruelty, he was much more comfortable on the territory of other species, patiently explaining why he preferred birds to mammals (“I like feathers better than fur I think eggs are neater than placental matter I like things that fly rather than things that walk and – this is a subjective thing – they’re a more beautiful organism”). But the geopolitical intensity of the world we are in now draws him back constantly to our species. “Let’s be honest: a lot of the governments that have mishandled the corona crisis are not going to survive it. I sincerely hope that there will be a huge peaceful shake-up and people will start moving in the right direction.”While he is careful about which governments he means, he is resolute about the right direction: away from fossil fuels and flying away from careless consumption away from considering the natural world a resource to exploit. We are good at solutions, but only under pressure. “One of the stats that I’m always drawn to is that, when Pearl Harbor was attacked, in 1941, 7 December, America was producing 4m cars a year. From that point until the end of the war, they only produced 141. That’s how powerful our ability to respond to problems is. They used that capacity to produce weapons.”I am surprised by the parable – it does not feel like humanity at its finest, that, when push comes to shove, we will throw everything we have at killing each other better. But he is not a sentimentalist – whether or not we are capable of great change, we are certainly capable of huge change – and that is what the world needs. I thought I detected a note of optimism, but he had returned to his house and was eating toast, so it may have been blood sugar.\u0026nbspSpringwatch is on BBC Two at 8pm every night until Friday previous episodes from this season are available to stream on BBC iPlayer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d343c1bb4d37155065b0bef614d25b47e6bcfae0/0_401_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c77d448fa86782058410699c5ba6fc9","title":"spiky hairy shiny la abuzz with new insect discoveries in pictures aoe","story":"Since 2014, entomologists have sampled millions of insects around the city, identifying 800 species, including 47 new to science.

Do your research online first, buy before you try – and avoid jeansPicture the scene: you walk into your favourite clothes store for the first time in three months, check your mask is covering your nose and mouth, and pump sanitiser into your hands. And then you spot it – the perfect gingham dress. Just the mood-boosting, picnic-appropriate fillip your wardrobe needs, and it is just there, on the other side of the shop floor. But, instead of making a beeline for it, you have to take the long way round, following the one-way system marked out in arrow stickers on the floor, pausing when the shopper in front of you does in order to observe the two-metre-rule (the pandemic-era grandmother’s footsteps that we have grown used to in the supermarket aisles). And then – disaster – the masked shopper in front of you reaches for your gingham dress and takes the last one in your size. Which means that, if she doesn’t buy it, it will be headed for quarantine in the stock room, rather than back to the shop floor.From 15 June, clothes shops will be able to reopen in England, just a few days after their counterparts in Northern Ireland. The rest of the UK will eventually follow suit. Some people will have no interest in ing straight back into frenzied consumerism, what with the aforementioned frenzied consumerism being implicated in the rapid global spread of the coronavirus catastrophe. Some people will be constrained by financial circumstances. Some people may quite fancy a shopping trip just for a change of scene, but will still be trying to jigsaw together the jagged pieces of work and home-schooling children who are not back in the classroom.But reports from post-lockdown all over the world suggest that there is likely to be an appetite for a post-quarantine clothes splurge. A Hermès boutique in Guangzhou took the equivalent of £2.1m on its first Saturday after reopening, setting a record for a single day in a single boutique in China’s retail history. Wherever Zara stores have opened their doors from Paris to Tunis, shoppers have formed long first-day queues.With pubs, cafes and restaurants yet to reopen, those who do go clothes-shopping next week will be guinea pigs for the new normal. They will be the first to assess the look and feel of the world of commercialised leisure time in which many of us used to spend our weekends.With warehouses of unsold summer stock to shift, retailers are at pains to do everything they can to make customers feel safe. Some of the basics will be universal. In-store numbers will be strictly limited, so expect queues outside. Stores with more than one door may operate separate entrances and exits to avoid face-to-face contact at these points. Masks will be worn by staff, and shoppers will be encouraged to follow suit. Contactless payment will be encouraged (expect a push on Apple Pay and other mobile payment services, which are not usually subject to the £45 limit) and sanitiser pumps stationed by each cash desk. Only household members can shop together, and lift occupancy will be limited to one person or those from one household.Lots of things will vary between stores, however. In the first wave, many will open only those branches whose customer base can travel by foot, bike or car. John Lewis will keep changing rooms closed for now, but Reiss and Gap will open some, with rigorous sanitising between customers.Jewellery and watches will be particularly challenging to try on, as the virus can live on metal for much longer than on fabric. Most stores have extended their returns policy to encourage shoppers to try clothes on at home John Lewis is considering installing “drop boxes” at store entry points, so that returns need not add to in-store footfall. Some shops will open for shorter hours so that staff don’t need to travel at rush hour, others will open for longer to spread out footfall. Selfridges is considering reducing the amount of stock on the shop floor so that shoppers can give each other more space. Harrods will open an outlet at the west London Westfield shopping centre in July where the traditional tightly packed sales rails can have more room. Most stores will keep cafes closed, but 49 Marks \u0026amp Spencer stores will sell takeout coffees. Some stores will have toilets open – but as one PR told me off the record, those that will aren’t keen to broadcast the fact and become de facto public toilets while few alternatives are available.Even the greatest cheerleader for the embattled retail industry would struggle to frame this as an enticing day out. Vigilance over meticulous hygiene may reassure customers that they are safe, but that is not the same as making them feel relaxed, happy and in the mood to spend. After all, until three months ago, bricks-and-mortar retail relied on delivering a fun experience to tempt shoppers offline – and “sterile” was one of the most damning verdicts you could deliver.But there are already signs that a new genre of IRL shopping trip could begin to emerge. The lost art of window shopping, for instance, is enjoying a renaissance. During the pandemic, Mixology, a teenage fashion store on the Upper East Side of New York, resisted boarding up its windows and instead installed new outfits in the windows with a sign reading: “See something you like in the window? Feel free to text or call,” with the shopkeepers’ phone numbers listed. Where fashion stores have reopened in other city centres, retailers have repurposed their windows from abstract, artsy cubes to showcases for key looks available in store, encouraging shoppers to do their initial browse of the selection in the open air and without touching any stock.“You need a plan,” says Helen Seamons, the ’s menswear fashion editor and a gold-standard shopper, when I ask for her tips for a successful physically distanced shopping trip. “The age of the aimless browse is over for now. And the etiquette of flicking through rails seems doubtful. So do an online recce and save screenshots to your phone of pieces you like. That way you can ask staff where they are, and reduce your wandering-about time.” Some small neighbourhood boutiques that will have capacity for only one or two shoppers at a time plan to offer short bookable appointments rather than having customers lined up outside.Alternatively, this could be the time to pivot to online clothes shopping. The best place to start is with a brand you already wear, so that you have a good sense of what size you take and a realistic expectation of what the fabric and finish will be, these being tricky to assess online. Melanie Wilkinson, the ’s styling editor, suggests: “This probably isn’t the best time to buy a new pair of jeans – historically, the one item that requires hours of trying on. Continue to embrace the smart jogging-bottom trend of lockdown instead. You can wear these with silk blouses and relaxed shirts, which are easier to shop for online.” Order several pieces at once and expect to send most of them back – if you only order one item, you might be tempted to convince yourself you like it to save the bother of returning it. But whether you are shopping in store or online, you won’t be taking anyone with you into a changing room for a while.To recreate shopping with friends, consider setting up a WhatsApp group for honest advice so that each of you can try on new purchases in front of the mirror and send selfies for feedback. (Consider carefully who you want to include in this group. Does their taste match with yours? How much brutal honesty is too much? Will it annoy you if they copy what you buy?)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/270c49d4dd8fe6355d0bb5df1bcb28df0449319a/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b2bb1e3417ac79d8d812b3bbf0c7313","title":"the edit 12 of the best fathers day gifts under 50","story":"From stylish T-shirts to charity face masks, there are plenty of alternatives to aftershave.

The only certainty is that this won’t be the jambalaya your momma made, but it is still delicious.½ tsp white peppercorns½ tsp black peppercorns1 tsp paprika1 tsp cayenne (or more if using a very mild sausage)1 tsp dried thyme2 bay leaves½ tsp salt2 tbsp lard or neutral oil2 smoked pork sausages (see step 2)4 bone-in chicken thighs1 onion1 stick celery1 green pepper3 garlic cloves4 spring onions800ml chicken or pork stock1 tsp Tabasco, or other hot sauce, plus extra to serve300g long-grain rice (not easy-cook)300g large raw prawnsThis is a recipe for the drier style of jambalaya, often described as Cajun. If you are looking for the soupier, tomato-rich, red Creole version, add a 400g tin of chopped tomatoes along with the stock and reduce the latter to 500ml (or consult the chef Brad McDonald’s book Deep South for a dedicated recipe).American andouille are hard to get in the UK (although McDonald’s book can teach you to make your own), so Polish smoked sausage (fresh rather than dried), smoked cooking chorizo or anything with a high meat content, ideally smoked, will work. If you are using something without much spice, compensate by adding a little more cayenne pepper to the spice mix in step 3. To make this vegetarian, replace the sausage with a smoked, meat-free version, the stock with vegetable stock, and add beans or vegetables of your choice (okra would be apt) instead of the chicken.Toast the peppercorns, paprika and cayenne in a small, dry pan over a high heat, until they smell toasty, stirring regularly to make sure the spices don’t burn. Then tip into a mortar or electric grinder, leave to cool slightly and grind until smooth. Stir in the thyme, bay and salt, and set aside.Cut the sausage into thick slices. Heat the oil in a wide pan (ideally one with a lid, but you can use foil if not) over a medium-high heat. Fry the sausage until the meat is browned and the fat has begun to render, then transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper. In the same pan, fry the chicken in the sausage fat until lightly golden all over (leave on or remove the skin as you prefer).While the meat is cooking, peel the onion and finely chop it and the celery, then seed and finely chop the pepper. Peel and crush the garlic and chop the spring onion, separating the white and green parts. Add the whites to the rest of the vegetables and set aside the greens.Transfer the chicken to a second paper-lined plate and turn down the heat under the pan to medium-low.

Take out the chicken, stir the rice briefly, then add the prawns and sausage to the mix.

The unusual receipt of broadcast money for this season’s games in June and July will allow clubs, whose financial years end on 31 May or 30 June, to boost revenues in their 2020-21 accounts, potentially to collective record-breaking levels, particularly as next season marks the start of a new, more lucrative TV deal.In 2018-19 top-flight revenues exceeded £5bn for the first time, Deloitte said, but Dan Jones, the head of its sports business group, said football’s landscape had been substantially altered, at least in the short term. “We expect significant revenue reduction and operating losses across European football,” he said.The clubs meet on Thursday to finalise plans for the season resumption next week and were boosted on Wednesday when the latest round of Covid-19 testing returned only one positive result from 1,213 tests on players and staff.

The football industry will be hopeful that a V-shaped recovery and a return to relative financial normality for the 2021-22 season is possible.”The situation is more perilous in the lower isions and the Championship particularly. Despite EFL clubs returning unprecedented revenues in 2018-19,collectively breaking £1bn for the first time, closer examination reveals an unhealthy overall picture.“League One and League Two were doing a lot of the right things already. Yes, you had isolated incidents like Bury but you could say they were down to bad management. Systemically they were in a better place than 10 years previously. But if you take the ability to play in front of crowds away they haven’t got the broadcasting money to fall back on. That’s going to be very painful and very hard for those clubs to manage.”The latest round of 1,192 coronavirus tests on Championship players and staff brought six positives from four clubs.

Smartphone shopping, augmented-reality changing rooms, same-day delivery (perhaps soon by drone) – with so much innovative e-commerce out there, you would think that small and micro businesses were tooled to the hilt with technology. In reality, nearly half of UK small businesses lack even the most basic of 21st-century gizmos: a website.In recent months, consumer spending has dropped significantly because of Covid-19, but where money is being spent, it is likely to be through online purchases, so a website is more essential than ever if a business is to thrive. In fact, a survey for the website builder GoDaddy found that lockdown has prompted a fifth of micro businesses to set up an online presence for the first time, while nearly half of such businesses have boosted their digital and social media activity.Some savvy small businesses are tapping into this trend by using their websites to create additional opportunities for consumers to spend. Online promotions, reward schemes and e-gift cards are just some of the ways businesses can help keep customers returning.Promotions (vouchers, discounts and deals) are a great way to attract new customers and keep them coming back for more, as are contests, giveaways and flash sales. Meanwhile, free deliveries and automatic replenishment of perishables using a subscription model have become increasingly popular in the e-commerce world. Placing time limits on deals can create a sense of urgency and encourage uptake.Another way to spur bigger purchases is to create product or service bundles, or to cross-sell complementary items. Multi-buy deals – such as three for two – can result in a larger shopping basket too. And what about the customer who leaves your website without purchasing the items in their cart? A reminder email might entice them back.But be warned about heavy discounting, if it’s not done properly, businesses can end up reducing the perceived value of their products or services.Ultimately, it’s crucial to benchmark the results of any promotion against your regular pricing to see which strategy has the most positive impact on the top line.For small businesses, the prospect of running promotions can seem daunting, but it doesn’t need to be if you know where to look. GoDaddy has created a suite of email marketing tools specifically designed with small businesses in mind. These tools let clients quickly and easily send out notifications about promotions, and even automate them to lighten the load.And to help you get to know your customers better – who they are and what resonates with them – GoDaddy makes it simple for its clients to create surveys and monitor the results. All of which will help you run your business in a way that bolsters your bottom line.Reward schemes differ from online promotions in that they encourage repeat purchases over an extended period.The added benefit is that your business can gather data on consumer behaviour and satisfaction, so you can tailor products or services to their needs. Your customers may also spread the word about your loyalty scheme and encourage others to join.For customers, there are many benefits – saving money and time, winning prizes, and early access to products, services or events. Communicating the advantages of a scheme is one of the keys to its success.Typically, customers earn “points” when they buy from you, refer friends or post about your business on social media. You can also award points for anniversaries and business milestones.Shoppers can be automatically enrolled when they make their first purchase, or can opt in via your app, website or social media channels. Customers then redeem their points to get products free or at a discount.Remember to take time periodically reviewing the performance of the programme. You can choose which metrics you measure – whether it’s number of members, or rewards earned or claimed – but it’s important to understand what worked well, what didn’t, and how to improve the programme.Digital gift cards could be the ultimate guarantor of customer loyalty during the pandemic. They’re not just a source of immediate income, they are an endorsement of your business from the giver and a warranty that you’ll gain a future customer. What’s more, they are a relatively cheap marketing tool that spreads awareness of your brand.Some businesses combine e-gift cards with promotions offering future discounts, which they hope will encourage recipients of e-gift cards to return and spend more.This makes sense as the cost of acquiring new customers can be far higher than retaining existing customers. And those existing customers are much more likely to try out new products and to spend more as their trust grows. This underscores the importance of a loyalty scheme for small businesses.Developments in technology might be moving at a rate of knots, but small businesses needn’t be left behind. Beyond the bells and whistles of drones and augmented reality, there is a world of opportunity for entrepreneurs. And it all begins with a website.GoDaddy launched the #OpenWeStand initiative offering a number of free tools, widgets, resources and blogposts at\u0026nbspOpenWeStand.org\u0026nbspto help small businesses keep their digital doors open while their physical doors are closed.

In many states and cities, what we see as traditional weddings, with large gatherings of people, have been banned. We are living through a period defined by its disappointments, by concert debuts that will not happen, by plays that will not launch, by aborted careers and, yes, by grand wedding dreams that will never reach fulfillment.The disappointments of missed weddings are no doubt painful. But the truth is that a re-evaluation of the contemporary wedding was already well overdue.In 2019, the wedding industry is, or rather was, worth $70bn, and that’s in the United States alone, and that doesn’t include honeymoons. It was pure madness. Many industries are going to have be be reconsidered in the wake of the economic shutdown, and weddings should be at the top of the list. Like the cruise industry, we should just let it die.\u0026nbspHalf a century ago, marriage meant big life changes:\u0026nbsplosing your virginity,\u0026nbspmoving in, merging bank accounts, having kids. But now, three-quarters of couples already live together. They split the bills. They share a bed. Marriage is not a requirement to be an adult any more.\u0026nbspNonetheless, we maintain these supposedly necessary traditions. The most widespread collective response to the approach of gender equality has been that, in our most significant public declarations of love and commitment, women dress up like they’re minor members of the Russian royal family from the 19th century and men dress up like they’re waiters on cruise liners. I guess it’s good to begin any major phase in life with a consciousness of your own ridiculousness, but surely there ought to be limits.And then there is the cost. The average cost of a wedding in 2019 was $32,329. The median cost for a house in the States that year was $200,000, according to Zillow. Do the math: the average cost of a wedding is a serious downpayment on an average house. You start off the period of your life when you really need money by collecting it in a pile and burning it. A big wedding makes leasing a sports car look like a good financial decision.Spending all that money on a wedding won’t make you happier, it won’t make your marriage stronger. The opposite, in fact. In 2015, social scientists in Singapore did the work. In ‘A Diamond is Forever’ and Other Fairy Tales: The Relationship between Wedding Expenses and Marriage Duration,\u0026nbspthey found marriage duration is inversely associated with the spending on the ceremony and the engagement ring. The more you spend, the shorter the marriage lasts. But that’s obvious any time you go to a wedding. You can tell how unhappy a couple is by the size of the flower arrangements.\u0026nbsp(For the record, my wife and I eloped in the aftermath of September 11. We were, according to lifestyle journalists at the time, a “terror marriage”.)\u0026nbspThe idea that you need to have the big wedding because of “tradition”? The “tradition” behind weddings was all thought up by Madison Avenue types a hundred years ago. Karen Dunak, a history professor at Muskingum University in Ohio, wrote As Long as We Both Shall Love: The White Wedding in Postwar America. It’s a fascinating history of the consumerist nonsense that is the modern wedding. “When you have this rise and this increased democratization of a consumer culture in the 1920s, this is when you have more wedding registries this is when you have department stores that would have wedding departments,” she told me. “This is when you have the commercialization of a lot of services related to the wedding. That you would have bakers who make wedding cakes, you would have wedding boutiques, you would have florists who would make wedding arrangements rather than people doing it as a part of home craft.”The tradition of huge elaborate ceremonies followed by enormous parties, all at vast expense, belongs to the recent past of unparalleled growth. That period is over. It’s time to make some new traditions – vastly, vastly cheaper ones.Before Covid-19, a wedding was a way to begin your life together in a splurge of debt and wasteful narcissism. That is what a pre-Covid wedding forced you to do: it forced you to turn your love into a lifestyle. It forced you to turn your private life into a big display. There was enormous social pressure to engage in what is obviously a folly: to begin adulthood by lying, by making up fraudulent histories, by pretending that you’re independent, by grotesque and unoriginal conspicuous consumption.\u0026nbspCovid-19 is ruining a great many beautiful things, glorious art, wonderful meetings, even love itself. But this destruction – the destruction of the wedding industry –\u0026nbspwe should take for what it is, a blessing in disguise. Let’s not let the insanity back. We should keep weddings right where they are, right now: nowhere.\u0026nbspStephen Marche’s audio series How Not to F*ck Up Your Marriage Too Bad is available on Audible June 11"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2037774804774e6a1feb1a52bf3c9e59602bc553/0_186_5607_3364/master/5607.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=397613b0e3a3f45e2bc7b0a465dc1d12","title":"forget burnout there is nothing worse than a boring job","story":"Being severely underworked can bring depression, illness and – for one French employee – a tasty payoutAge: As old as employment, but the term itself was coined in 2007 by two Swiss business consultants, Peter Werder and Philippe Rothlin.I guess somebody has been working too hard. To be honest, I’m hardly working.\u0026nbspSounds like my dream job! Be careful what you wish for. You may end up suffering from boreout.\u0026nbspIs that like burnout? It’s similar, but with a very different cause. It turns out that being severely underworked can also lead to depression, illness and, in some cases, a huge payout for damages.\u0026nbspThis is so not a thing.\u0026nbspIt so is. A Paris appeals court just upheld a boreout claim by a former Interparfums employee, Frederic Desnard, awarding him €40,000 (£36,000).\u0026nbspPlease state the facts of the case.\u0026nbspOnce a busy and fulfilled worker, Desnard was sidelined after the company lost a big contract in 2010. He was then transferred to a post where “no one cared if I arrived at 9am or 10am”.I do wish they would advertise these jobs more widely. Desnard’s duties were almost nonexistent. “I had to buy some supplies – a few sheets of paper – and then my day was over,” he said.\u0026nbspSeriously, just get me to the interview stage, and I will nail this. The lack of work soon took a psychological toll. “You go on the internet at first,” said Desnard, “and then you shut yourself in an empty office and you cry.”That just sounds like work to me.\u0026nbspDesnard became depressed and had an epileptic fit at the wheel of his car. He took seven months off work and was sacked in 2014, on the grounds that his prolonged absence disrupted the smooth running of the company.\u0026nbspThey couldn’t run the company without someone who didn’t do anything? His lawyer made the same point.\u0026nbspWould it be prejudiced of me to describe the whole notion of boreout as very French? Perhaps not. Under French labour laws it is difficult to make employees redundant. Instead, they are often sidelined or shelved – mis à l’écart – in the hope they will get bored and quit.\u0026nbspI don’t know which is more French – getting paid to do nothing or complaining about it.\u0026nbspDesnard argued it was a form of psychological harassment.\u0026nbspI would describe it as a modest promotion, myself.\u0026nbspUnfortunately for you, the court agreed with Desnard.\u0026nbspDo say: “It is important that companies ensure their employees are neither overworked nor underworked.”Don’t say: “What’s the name of the illness you get when your job is too interesting?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d05b625877df0b11425e57b658ce7c44a38d23b5/0_356_4664_2797/master/4664.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b11e5e17fef90487662d08516a53b32","title":"living in england are you planning to move out of a city","story":"We would like to hear from people who are relocating outside cities due to the coronavirus pandemicWith estate agents in England allowed to conduct viewings via video or appointments where people are physical distancing, some have noticed an increase in people wanting to move out of cities amid a rise in home working.Whether you are buying or renting, if you are moving away from an urban area we want to hear from you.What are your reasons for moving out of the city?

Next up: the hugely influential poet who brought Baudelaire to punkWhen, in 1971, the music producer and manager Sandy Pearlman approached Patti Smith and suggested she front a rock band, she laughed off the suggestion as ridiculous. She saw herself as a poet and a painter. Between shifts at the New York bookstore where she worked, Smith would perform readings of her verse at small clubs alongside Lenny Kaye, who provided blasts of feedback on guitar. Smith and Pearlman became friends anyway four years later, she finally his took advice and made the landmark punk album Horses. REM’s Michael Stipe later said it “tore my limbs off and put them back on in a whole new order”.Punk is rarely noted for its literary qualities, though Smith was unapologetic in her love of the French poets Genet, Baudelaire and Rimbaud. Her songwriting on Horses revelled in intricate phrasing and imagery, and deliberately blurred the lines between punk and poetry. It also stuck two fingers up at punk’s self-imposed two-minute rule –\u0026nbspa response to prog’s perceived self-indulgence – with some tracks exceeding nine minutes.Gloria (In Excelsis Deo), a re-working of a Them song, with its immortal first line “Jesus died for somebody’s sins but not mine”, remains the perfect encapsulation of Smith’s spirit: transgressive, hypnotic, determinedly true to herself and her art. At a time when women musicians were expected to trade on their femininity, there was nothing pretty about her delivery. It was urgent, often incantatory, given to stretching vowels (“people say ‘bewaaaaaaare’, but I don’t caaaaaaare”) and turning them into sneers. Elsewhere, there are tales of suicide (Redondo Beach), an alien visitation (Birdland), a lightning storm (Kimberly) and a boy who breaks out of his skin and flies away (Break it Up), many of them incendiary and intense, and anchored by the spiky garage rock of the era.If Horses gave the impression that Smith’s path would be unyieldingly left-field, her third LP set us straight. Produced by Jimmy Iovine, who would go on to work with U2 and Dire Straits, Easter was, by comparison, polished and accessible, and yielded a bona fide hit in Because the Night, a joyful, air-punching ode to hedonism and love – more Pat Benatar than Baudelaire. The song, partly written by Bruce Springsteen who happened to be recording down the corridor from Smith, irked some fans who accused her of selling out, but she didn’t care. “I liked hearing myself on the radio,” she told New York Magazine. “To me, those people didn’t understand punk rock at all. Punk rock is just another word for freedom.”\u0026nbspSmith took much of the 80s and 90s out to raise her two children, a decision she has said came easily given her reluctance as a rock star. But then a series of deaths brought her back to songwriting, including that of her friend and former partner Robert Mapplethorpe in 1989, and her husband, the MC5 guitarist Fred “Sonic” Smith, her brother Todd, and her friend Kurt Cobain, who all died in 1994. Unusually confessional, and more subtle and folksy than her previous works, Gone Again is a stunning elegy to those she lost as well as a document of her path to healing.As you move through her career, Smith’s albums become increasingly hit and miss, though even the misses have their moments, each bearing testament to her dedication to profundity and poeticism. Banga, her 11th album, has no duds. The pleasingly in-your-face title track comes from the Russian novelist Mikhail Bulgakov’s The Master and Margarita and features dogs barking in the background, while Constantine’s Dream is inspired by Piero della Francesca’s fresco sequence The History of the True Cross. Loosely themed around the concept of exploration, the album brims with poetic rapture, and is interspersed with tender songs such as April Fool, in which lovers “race through alleyways in tattered coats” and This Is the Girl, a sweet tribute to Amy Winehouse.The infamous B-side to Smith’s first single was her first fully-fledged “rock’n’roll poem”. A cri de coeur against production-line drudgery, it told of the time she worked, aged 16, in a baby buggy factory in New Jersey where she would hide in the basement and dream of a different life. Piss Factory is mostly spoken rather than sung, the words delivered against improvised, often frenzied piano. It tells of the futility of the job, the foul conditions and the workers who “got no teeth or gum or cranium”. Smith didn’t see eye to eye with her colleagues, who were incensed by the copy of Rimbaud’s Illuminations in her pocket and instructed her to leave it at home. When she reappeared with it the next day, they dunked her head in a toilet bowl of urine to teach her a lesson. Hence, “piss factory”.M Train, by Patti SmithJust Kids, Smith’s 2010 memoir of her youthful partnership with the photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, is obviously excellent but her 2015 book, M Train, offers a delicious insight into who she is now. Between tours and speaking engagements, her time is spent taking photographs, sitting in coffee shops writing in her notebook, basking in memories of dead loved ones and, for relaxation, watching re-runs of Morse.Patti Smith: Dream of LifeThis lyrical documentary, directed by Steven Sebring and full of terrific archive footage, is an intimate portrait of Smith in which she talks politics, love, grief and the compulsion to create. “I always felt something different stirring in me,” the twentysomething Smith says of her move to New York. “I knew there was stuff inside me that would flower. Maybe it would ruin me.”\u0026nbspRevenge of the She-Punks, by Vivian GoldmanGoldman’s examination of the hard-won achievements of women artists includes an illuminating chapter on Smith, whom she sees as “a new breed of autonomous, self-defined and uninhibited female rock star”, and where, in 1976, the pair meet up and sift through secondhand clothes in Notting Hill. Unused to having money and keen to share the love, Smith ends up buying Goldman a jacket.

That’s why we need to include a more erse range of historical perspectives in our curriculum and examinations.”The letter, signed by the Tory MP Sir Peter Bottomley, Labour’s former shadow equalities minister Dawn Butler and former frontbencher Clive Lewis, members of the SNP, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and the Green party’s Caroline Lucas, said there should be a more balanced reading of Britain’s colonial and imperial past, and its legacy of abuse and exploitation.More recent history, such as the treatment of the Windrush generation should also be included, they suggested, as well as the positive contribution black people and people of all ethnicities have made to Britain.The British empire and its slave trade is not a statutory part of the curriculum, although many schools choose to teach it. Black History Month takes place in the UK in October with resources available for schools.The MPs’ call for a curriculum review follows campaigning by Labour under Jeremy Corbyn to create an emancipation educational trust that would deliver school programmes and focus on African civilisation before colonisation.The civil rights campaigner Paul Stephenson, who who led the Bristol bus boycott in 1963, was suggested as someone all pupils could study.The organisation The Black Curriculum is also collecting signatures for an open letter to be sent to Williamson on making black history compulsory in primary and secondary schools and requesting a face-to-face meeting with him. It would like a response from the minister before Windrush Day on 22 June, which was observed for the first time in 2018.The letter, led by Moran in parliament, comes as Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said the curriculum must be improved to break down barriers to defeating racism.She said: “We must improve the curriculum so that students learn about how Britain was founded on global histories. Students should learn about the achievements and roles of black Britons in every field of human endeavour. And they should learn about the campaigns by black workers for equal treatment and the stand against injustice.”Bousted also called for a review of teacher training to equip all trainees with anti-racist strategies, and a new recruitment strategy to make the teaching profession more erse“This term, the NEU will launch an anti-racist framework to respond to the experiences of black children and black staff and to help education staff develop anti-racist approaches,” she said.“We support the initiatives from NGOs such as the Runnymede Trust and youth movements such as The Black Curriculum to highlight the importance of challenging the education system to be more inclusive and making the curriculum representative and relevant.”There have been concerns that because academies, which are not controlled by local authorities, have greater flexibility in what they teach and are not required to follow the national curriculum some children may miss out on opportunities to study black history.\u0026nbspThe current curriculum suggests that within key stage 3 history pupils could look at the British transatlantic slave trade and its effects and abolition. This comes under the broader subject area of “Ideas, political power, industry and empire: Britain, 1745-1901”.The Black Curriculum suggests a broader historical approach, with black history taught through topics such as the pre-colonial black presence in Britain, migration from 1910 to 1960 and assimilation, and a closer look at 21st-century geopolitics, including migration patterns and deportation.

If you’re one of Spotify’s 286 million monthly users, you’ve probably noticed an icon on your mobile app that looks like a computer monitor behind a speaker – that’s your portal to Spotify Connect, a super-simple way to play music on all your home tech devices, from your smart fridge to your laptop. But how does it work – and how does it stack up against other wireless streaming methods?Since 2018, Spotify Connect has been available for all users, however to be able to connect to every compatible device out there, you’ll need a Spotify Premium subscription. You can use it on your tablet, phone or computer as a kind of remote control to play what you want, where you want it – Spotify offers podcasts in addition to its extensive library of music. And unlike using a Bluetooth speaker, the music won’t stop if you receive a call.Using Spotify Connect is really easy. From the mobile app, choose something to play, then tap “devices available” underneath the song name. Next, tap the icon of a screen and a speaker, and you’ll get a list of all the Connect-compatible smart devices on your home network. You don’t have to add them, they appear automatically if they’re connected to wifi.The process on a computer is pretty similar: play something, then click the icon of a screen and a speaker in the bottom right of the app and choose your preferred device.There’s a vast range of compatible gadgets, so chances are that the device you want to play music on is on the list, but you can check here just in case.Once you’re streaming, you can use your phone or computer as normal: the audio comes directly from Spotify, not your device, so you can take calls and keep the music going. It doesn’t run your battery down, either.Moving the sound around is really straightforward: just tap a different device on the list and the music instantly continues there. This is especially handy when you’re moving rooms, or you need to switch away from the soundbar because someone wants to watch TV, for instance.And when it’s party time (after the pandemic, we might add!), use Spotify Connect to start a group session so that everyone can contribute to the playlist – another feature you can’t get with just Bluetooth or wifi. You’ll see the option to “Start a group session” at the bottom of your Spotify Connect device list, which gives you a code to share with friends so they can add their favourites.Bluetooth is an easy, near-universal wireless method of connecting one smart thing to another. That connection is called “pairing” and is usually simple to do – for instance, on many speakers, there’s a little button with the Bluetooth symbol (a stylised B that looks like a sideways pair of scissors) that you press to start sending out signals. Then, turn on Bluetooth via your phone, or whichever device you’re trying to connect to, scan for nearby Bluetooth gadgets and select your speaker from the list. The instructions vary slightly by device, so check the help files for yours if you’re stuck.Pairing is usually straightforward and only has to be done once – from then on it should work automatically. But Bluetooth does have its downsides too, the more distance there is between the music device and the speaker, the more chance there is for interference and sound drop out – something you don’t need to worry about with Spotify Connect. Thick walls can really mess up the connection too, as you’ll notice if you wander around the house with wireless headphones on.Bluetooth is the best choice for listening to music outside your home, because you can use it for portable speakers, car stereos and so on without needing to be close to a power socket or wifi router. However, it’s a real drain on the battery life of whatever device you’re streaming from.The connection can also be temperamental, varying on some devices more than others. If one of the gadgets you like to listen on often drops out, it’s worth trying a different method.Most devices that can play music, such as speakers, TVs, games consoles and even smartwatches have an app that helps you connect them to your home wifi network, and from there you can link up your streaming source.For instance, a smart speaker such as Google Home gets connected to wifi during setup, using its app. Once it’s ready, you just open the app settings and choose your preferred service for streaming music and podcasts, then start issuing voice commands – such as “OK Google, play Spotify”.The benefit of using wifi rather than Bluetooth is that you don’t have to worry about keeping your devices close together. As long as whatever’s playing the music is connected to wifi, you’re good – and you can use your phone for calls without cutting off the tunes.Spotify Connect runs on wifi, so you’ll see all these benefits, plus the added bonus that it will automatically seek out and connect with compatible devices. So if you are going to connect over wifi, it makes sense to do it via Spotify Connect.Spotify Premium gives you music without the interruptions.

Before that his last competitive outing was at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in December 2019. Using the current season’s cars is banned under regulations so Hamilton took to the track using the Mercedes W09 from 2018, a car with which he won the world championship. With the season starting with an intense programme of three races in succession, putting in time behind the wheel in advance was seen as essential.Hamilton completed a substantial period of running in wet and dry conditions and pronounced himself very satisfied with the results.“When you leave the garage the first time, you get this buzz, and it doesn’t matter how many years you do it, it always feels new and fresh,” he said. “Obviously this is an older car, but it still felt fantastic. We got through a solid programme today.“I didn’t feel like I’ve ever left the water, so that’s a positive. Every time you take a big break – I think it’s been 103 days or something – you always wonder whether you can still drive. So it’s a good feeling to know of course I can, I’m ready, I feel fit.”Mercedes ran a similar test for Hamilton’s teammate, Valtteri Bottas, on Tuesday and applied their new operating protocols across both days. F1 is intending to run each race as a closed biosphere and teams are expected to commit to minimising risks.The Mercedes crew operated wearing face masks, and in some cases full facial protection for team members who had to operate in proximity to drivers – such as when they are being strapped into the car. All team members were practising physical distancing and were tested for coronavirus before they got to the circuit. All returned negative results and Hamilton wore a face mask when he was not in the car.The team implemented a range of procedures including a full grid-start simulation. When racing resumes the starting-grid process will involve a far more limited number of personnel than is usual.Ferrari are expected to run a similar programme at their test track in Fiorano. The F1 season opens with races in Austria on 5 and 12 July before a third in Budapest on 19 July, all held behind closed doors. Subject to the sport being granted exemption from the government’s 14-day quarantine restriction, Silverstone will then host races on 2 August and 9 August."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e2ac8f72835f9568c78094c47ddace5d9cad796/0_137_4119_2471/master/4119.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b61fb3bda812b2c388a54c6046a2600f","title":"my hero was tiger woods his skin colour didnt matter rory mcilroy","story":"Rory McIlroy hopes golf can play its part in delivering a more multicultural society as it returns to tournament action days after the funeral of George Floyd. McIlroy cited his own idolisation of Tiger Woods as a reason why skin colour shouldn’t lead to the placement of barriers.After a three-month absence triggered by coronavirus, the PGA Tour will restart with the Charles Schwab Challenge in Texas. It is the death of Floyd, rather than the pandemic, which feels most prominent on the landscape after demonstrations on both sides of the Atlantic. The Tour has initiated a moment of silence each day in Floyd’s memory and left the 8.46 tee time free, in reference to the period he was pinned to the ground by a policeman in Minneapolis.“A great word that I’ve sort of been thinking of over the last couple of weeks is ‘tolerance,’” said McIlroy. “I think everyone can just be a little more tolerant, and a little more educated and not as ignorant.“My hero growing up was Tiger Woods. Tiger doesn’t look the same as me, has had a very different upbringing to the one that I have had, but he was my hero growing up, and it didn’t matter what colour his skin was, what his beliefs were. Tiger was my hero, and he’s been a lot of kids’ heroes over the years that have grown up playing golf. We’ve been very lucky to have him in our game. I think that there should be more people like him in golf.”McIlroy was struck by a conversation, filmed in recent days, between Harold Varner and the PGA Tour’s commissioner Jay Monahan. Varner is one of a tiny number of black PGA Tour members. “These issues I think really hit home with me,” McIlroy explained. “Harold said, it maybe just isn’t about the players, it’s about everyone in the game of golf. There’s so many people that are involved with the game, and as long as we continue to give people from different backgrounds opportunities to be in golf, that can only be a good thing.”Woods called last week for a “safer, unified society” on account of the “shocking tragedy” of Floyd. The 15-times major winner is not in the Charles Schwab field but speculation suggests he may feature next week when the PGA Tour reaches South Carolina.McIlroy, who reiterated his belief that a world circuit in golf would be beneficial, praised the PGA Tour for “robust” Covid-19 procedures. “It has felt very safe,” said the Northern Irishman. “Everyone is doing the right things, and the people that are involved with the tournament are wearing masks and wearing gloves and there’s sanitiser everywhere you look. It feels safe. I feel safe, and I would say basically everyone else that’s here feels the same way.“I think it’s an important week because golf can show that we can play in a socially distant manner. We can conduct a tournament and adhere to all the safety protocols that have been put in place.“It is going to be very easy to fall back into old habits because it’s just what we’ve done. I’d say for the viewing public just to give the players and the caddies a little bit of leeway in terms of if they see something on TV that isn’t quite right. We’re having to figure it out as we go along, as well. But I think golf can show that it can be played, especially at the highest level, and adhere to the guidelines that everyone else has to adhere to.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c7cb9f3bbb99031a6d460f0878b48544a4042dd/0_168_5700_3422/master/5700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=977d6e1f74d8e0764d23daf20d116b01","title":"mark gatiss on madness of george iii nottingham playhouse national theatre stream","story":"The star of Nottingham Playhouse’s The Madness of George III, streamed for National Theatre at Home, talks about royalty, lockdown and theatre’s futureThis play is about King George III’s “madness”, but its cause is not entirely clear. Do you have your own theory about the source of his collapse?The only thing that dates the play is a diagnosis of “porphyria”, which turns urine blue. That was the fashionable reasoning of the time. My feeling is that he had a massive mental breakdown: he had lost several children and he was one of those kings, like George VI, who was not really fitted to monarchy and might have been a farmer instead, but he had an enormous sense of duty.Do you think the way we regard mental illness has changed significantly since the play was first performed in 1991?People definitely feel more able to talk about it but the stigma hasn’t gone away. As a country, we tend to want to sweep things under the carpet. But all of the campaigns are very helpful, and we are in a different place to where we were in the early 90s. We had a whole day in rehearsals when we discussed how to talk about mental health.The king’s doctors come across as comical and clueless and George tells Dr Willis (played by Adrian Scarborough), who leads him to recovery, that it was time that cured his illness, not treatment. Do you think that to be true?I think that the king wanted to own his recovery. Part of the characterisation of the doctors as comical or cruel is down to dramatic necessity. Dr Willis has to be different from the others – the saviour whose methods involve a regime of hard work, fresh air and getting outside to reconnect with nature, plants, flowers, which even today might be beneficial in lockdown. The big problem for the king’s doctors was that they weren’t allowed to touch him without his consent but Dr Willis said he had to treat the king like any other patient.Are you writing in lockdown or binge-watching TV?I’m mostly painting and do it almost every day. I’m writing a bit and have written my adaptation of\u0026nbspA Christmas Carol, but being in the middle of a global emergency is not conducive to the muse. This will be remembered as the year that never happened. If we knew that we’d be back to normal by January we’d have a framework, but not knowing eats away at creativity. Most writers usually write in a vacuum, but I keep coming back to the question: “What’s it for?”Sam Mendes recently called for companies like Netflix and Amazon to help fix the arts after the lockdown, given the profits they have made during it. What do you think about this?It’s complicated. It would be wonderful if this wasn’t just a gesture but a proper fund – but I wouldn’t hold my breath. As Sam said, we have to look at the ecosystem, and of course it’s the responsibility of government but it can’t be just that. We’re not like France and will never value culture like we should, so we have to talk about the economic argument. More people go to the theatre than to a football match, and it’s a huge part of who we are and what we do. Even if you were just being a hard-nosed Tory about it, it makes an absolutely huge amount of money.You have said that regional theatre is the\u0026nbsplifeblood of the industry\u0026nbspand also backed a\u0026nbspcampaign\u0026nbspto save King’s Head theatre, a fringe venue in London. What is your biggest worry for the future of theatre?Without hyperbolising, this is not the plague, and anyway the plague didn’t destroy the concept of theatre, nor will this, but a lot of the infrastructure and ecosystem is being smashed. Theatre will return, but a lot of old friends and institutions will fall, and that feels upsetting and soul-destroying.

A software error in the company’s app had led to patients being presented with recordings of other users’ consultations with their doctors. At least three patients were affected, the company said, and none of them had viewed the videos.Speaking at the virtual CogX festival, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said he was unaware of the data breach, but that it did not affect his views on the value of private partnerships within the NHS. “What I care about is getting results,” Hancock said,\u0026nbsp“when companies will come and help in the middle of a pandemic.

But it can’t serve that role and act as the long arm of the Chinese government,” said the group’s CEO, Suzanne Nossel.With its alluring market, China has long been problematic for US tech giants that generally boast of allowing unfettered free speech at home.Apple in 2017 acknowledged that it bowed to Chinese law by removing apps for VPNs, or virtual private networks, that let its users evade local controls."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a104afad75b8a8197746ddd1186ac568297e24c/0_21_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1abc03d35d6b79d9dabb89aa0f464098","title":"ant and dec sincerely sorry for blackface sketches in early 2000s","story":"ITV presenters impersonated people of colour in Saturday Night Takeaway segmentsAnt and Dec have apologised for a segment of Saturday Night Takeaway in which they impersonated people of other ethnicities using blackface and said they would not make such sketches today.The presenters darkened their skin and wore prosthetics during a segment in which they pranked famous faces while in disguise.

Glad I kept hold of my DVD’s,” he tweeted.On Tuesday, Little Britain was removed from Netflix, BritBox and BBC iPlayer due to concerns about the use of blackface by stars, David Walliams and Matt Lucas. The comedy sketch show, which first aired in 2003 on BBC Three, has been removed along with the pair’s follow-up, Come Fly With Me.The latest removals, taking place as the Black Lives Matter protests continue, have started a debate about the kind of TV shows and films that cross a line with their depictions of race.The recently launched service HBO Max has removed\u0026nbspGone With the Wind\u0026nbspafter criticism of the American civil war romance epic’s positive depiction of slavery, but confirmed it will eventually return to the service with a “discussion of its historical context and a denouncement of those very depictions”.Cops – the reality show, which showed police car chases, arrests and violent apprehensions – was cancelled by the Paramount Network after 32 seasons. The civil rights group Color of Change applauded the decision, saying Cops and shows like it played a “significant role in advancing distorted representations of crime, justice, race and gender within culture”.Channel 4 removed Bo Selecta from its All4 streaming service after white comedian Leigh Francis, who starred on the show doing impressions of black celebrities including Craig David and Trisha Goddard, apologised for using blackface.Deadline reported that Netflix has removed four shows from its services in Australia and New Zealand, which starred Australian comedian\u0026nbspChris Lilley, who regularly performed in brownface.At present, BBC iPlayer has Lilley’s Summer Heights High and\u0026nbspWe Can Be Heroes on its service, but two other shows that have been accused of containing racist portrayals, Angry Boys and\u0026nbspJonah From Tonga, are listed as not available.The debate about racist or problematic films and TV shows being on streaming platforms isn’t new.In April 2019, it was reported that Disney would not be including Song of the South on its streaming service Disney+. The film has long been criticised for its depiction of life on a plantation as idyllic, and it grossed $65m at the US box office in 1946, but was never released on DVD in the country.

The implications could be wide-rangingScrolling through Airbnbs in Brooklyn, one listing stands out. “IMMUNE HOST,” claims the heading in caps. Among photos of rooftop sunsets and interiors, lies something else unexpected – a picture of a positive antibody test.Host Martin Eaton says he got tested a few weeks after getting sick with what he suspected was Covid-19 in March. When the results came back positive, he decided to include it in his profile to attract reservations.“If I was having to travel to New York I’d prefer staying with somebody who had the antibodies versus somebody who didn’t,” says the 48-year-old writer. So far, he adds, “it’s proved pretty successful”.In the absence of a vaccine, immunity is emerging as a potential key to resuming normal life after the pandemic – leading some to believe that testing positive may not be such a bad thing. Providing they survive, they will at least – they hope – be immune. But as states and countries slowly reopen businesses to the public, how important will it be?Questions remain over the accuracy of Covid-19 antibody tests and the World Health Organization has warned that there is no evidence that people who have recovered from the virus and have antibodies are protected from getting it a second time.But experts predict that if survivors are found to be immune, they could perform a range of jobs and services – such as volunteering in hospitals and nursing homes, caring for coronavirus patients and working in shops and food processing plants – risk-free. And, depending on how authorities, business and society at large respond, they could also be entitled to greater freedoms.In Chile, the government is issuing “release certificates” (but they will not confirm immunity) to people who complete quarantine after testing positive. In China, “health code” apps are being used to determine who can travel where.Dr Anthony Fauci, director of America’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said immunity certificates are “possible” in the US and that they “might actually have some merit under certain circumstances”.Providing there is a way to certify that people have had the test, that it was effective and that the antibodies last, Dr Ezekiel J Emanuel, chairman of the department of medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania, says immunity passports could have “real positives” for both the patient and the wider community.He also believes it will become necessary for travel – even after a vaccine – to prove immunity and as a means to skip quarantine. “Showing that you’ve been infected and are immune and can’t transmit the virus is a really powerful mechanism.”The concept is already being adopted by the private sector. The hotel booking app Sidehide and verification company Onfido are developing an immunity passport for hotels – set to launch in Miami this month.Such are the perceived benefits of immunity that some people are intentionally trying to get the potentially deadly virus.Dr Jerome Williams Jr, cardiologist and senior vice-president of consumer engagement at Novant Health, says they have had multiple people test positive in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, after attending “coronavirus parties” – gathering unprotected with positive people – in the hope of getting infected.Without knowing exactly how immunity works, the parties are, he says, “a bad idea all round”.Despite the perceived advantages of immunity, creating a system that publicly identifies people with antibodies opens safety and privacy issues.\u0026nbspThe ACLU has warned against immunity passports, which it fears could incentivise poor people to risk their lives to intentionally get sick so they can work, exacerbate racial and economic disparities, encourage health surveillance and endanger privacy rights.Eric Klinenberg, sociologist and director of the Institute for Public Knowledge at New York University, says immunity is not “the new golden ticket” it is perceived to be.“That just opens up a Pandora’s box of questions about how we determine who’s immune, about how we record and register who’s immune, about how we track people and what happens to people who are not?” he says. “So I can very easily see it becoming yet another source of controversy in an already ided country.”This, she adds, created “immunocapital” that affected newly arrived white people’s ability to get jobs, homes and insurance policies, which meant they had little option but to try to get infected.Olivarius fears a similar situation could be created today if employers start hiring only people with antibodies. “I’m worried we’ll develop this system, the haves of immunity, the have-nots, it sounds science fictional almost.”Immune status could also result in discrimination. Last month, it was revealed that the US military was considering banning people who had been hospitalised by coronavirus from enlisting – guidance it has since walked back.There is, Olivarius warns, “a fine line between privilege and stigma”. “Even if there are benefits to being immune potentially, like being able to work, maybe later immunity could turn into a kind of stigmatised status.”But according to Cathy O’Neil, mathematician and author of Weapons of Math Destruction, it is unlikely that immunity will grant people much power, considering brown and black people are the ones hardest hit by the virus and therefore the most likely to be immune.“Most powerful people in this country will not have immunity and they will not set up a system that excludes them from things that they like to do.”It’s possible that, given regional differences in infection rate and its distribution in the population, only a very small number of people in some areas would actually be eligible for an immunity certificate. And the concept may be most compelling now, as the public anxiously awaits a vaccine.\u0026nbspBut once one is developed, O’Neil predicts the advantages of any immunity certificates will fade. The infrastructure set up to track it, however, would probably live on.“I do worry that it’s like we’re welcoming our algorithmic overlords to our lives in order to deal with this public health menace,” she says. “And then we’ll be stuck with them.”\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9389da9d4c95aefd3eb6b377d8360e26b10e7c7a/125_0_4375_2625/master/4375.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23e1a0c068d6ef55ce3e9f46be411a04","title":"has time in lockdown made you want to approach life differently","story":"If this experience has given you a chance to take stock and make some resolutions for the future, we want to hear from youLiving in lockdown has put everyone under strain, but it may also have given some of us time to take stock and work out what we really want from life.

Almost certainly too small to be a personal ornament or intended to be on display, he says, “it looks like an object that you would carry with you in a bag, perhaps with other objects.\u0026nbspThe findings are published in the journal Plos One.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69a20e071767c0c17df7e6eaa01cf6862fbd441c/0_376_5219_3132/master/5219.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c23bb23e4d3c710dfe9de369ff6af7fd","title":"eu says china behind huge wave covid 19 disinformation campaign","story":"Brussels shifts position by accusing Beijing for first time of running false campaignsChina has been accused by Brussels of running disinformation campaigns inside the European Union, as the bloc set out a plan to tackle a “huge wave” of false facts about the coronavirus pandemic.\u0026nbspThe European commission said Russia and China were running “targeted influence operations and disinformation campaigns in the EU, its neighbourhood, and globally”. While the charge against Russia has been levelled on many occasions, this is the first time the EU executive has publicly named China as a source of disinformation.\u0026nbspFrench politicians were furious when a Chinese embassy website claimed in mid-April, at the height of Europe’s pandemic, that care workers had abandoned their jobs leaving residents to die. The unnamed Chinese diplomat also claimed falsely that 80 French lawmakers had used a racist slur against the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.“I believe if we have evidence we should not shy away from naming and shaming,” Vĕra Jourová, a European commission vice-president, told reporters.\u0026nbsp“What we also witnessed is a surge in narratives undermining our democracies and in effect our response to the crisis, for example the claim there are secret US biological laboratories on former Soviet republics has been spread by both pro-Kremlin outlets, as well as Chinese officials and state media.”“I strongly believe that a geopolitically strong EU can only materialise if we are assertive,” Jourová said, alluding to the aim of the European commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen, for the body to have more clout on the world stage.The more assertive stance marks a change in tone from a report in March which merely described Chinese media narratives, while focusing the spotlight on disinformation from Kremlin-backed sources. It comes after lawmakers in the European parliament accused the commission of watering down an earlier report on disinformation under pressure from China – charges EU officials strongly denied.\u0026nbspEU member states are grappling with how to deal with China on a range of fronts, from foreign policy and security, to the economy. The commission described China as a “systemic rival” in a 2019 report that was seen by many member states as marking a watershed in how the EU deals with an increasingly aggressive government in Beijing.The commission has encouraged social media companies to sign a voluntary code of practice on disinformation, while threatening regulation if they fail to act. The latest report steps up demands on platforms to be more transparent in sharing data with researchers and intensify work with independent fact checkers.\u0026nbsp“I would not like the platforms themselves to be the arbiters of truth,” Jourová said.The Chinese-owned video-sharing app TikTok has become the latest company to sign the code of practice, the commission said, joining the likes of

bubble plan lets single parents in england combine households","story":"Boris Johnson announces easing of restrictions for single parents and people living aloneAbout 11 million people living alone or as single parents will be allowed to combine with another household to form a “support bubble” in England, Boris Johnson has said.The prime minister announced the new easing of social restrictions at his daily press conference in a move to alleviate loneliness among adults struggling on their own.The guidelines will apply from midnight on Saturday, meaning some grandparents will be able to hug their grandchildren for the first time and some couples can be reunited.The new rules will mean single parents and children under 18 that they live with, as well as single adults living alone, can go inside one other household and even stay overnight without maintaining physical distancing.A single-person household will be able to join together with a multi-person household, so a lone parent could, for example, visit their children’s grandparents in another part of England for help and stay for an extended period.It will also mean a couple who live apart can be together for the first time during the lockdown, if at least one of them lives alone.However, any multi-person household will only be able to join with one single-person household, so it would mean hard choices for a group of people living together with partners who live alone elsewhere.It will also not apply to people told to shield, who are meant to be isolating until the end of June apart from being able to meet one other person outside their home.If any member of the support bubble developed coronavirus symptoms, all the members would have to follow the normal advice on household isolation.Explaining the new rules, Johnson said: “We are making this change to\u0026nbspsupport\u0026nbspthose who are particularly lonely as a result of lockdown measures.\u0026nbsp“It’s a targeted intervention to limit the most harmful effects of the current social restrictions.\u0026nbsp“It is emphatically not designed for people who don’t qualify to start meeting inside other people’s homes, because that remains against the law.”\u0026nbspThere were 8.2 million people living alone last year and 2.9 million lone parent\u0026nbsphouseholds, according to the Office for National Statistics.“We would want to make sure that people who have been\u0026nbspsuffering from loneliness, and have been unable to see their families for a long\u0026nbsptime, the rest of their families, are able to do that,” Johnson added.The news is likely to be met with relief from people who live alone but frustration among others who will still not be able to meet loved ones unless physically distancing outside in groups of up to six.Officials admitted the measure was not going to benefit everyone but was targeted at those who had been left isolated by the lockdown restrictions.\u0026nbspThe government has been criticised for prioritising the reopening of the economy, including zoos, shops and outdoor cinemas, above people’s social contact with their families and the full return of schools.However, ministers and the scientific advisers have stressed that the biggest risk of transmission is within households rather than distanced workplaces, so they have been acting with caution to ease restrictions on families meeting each other.One exemption to the exclusivity rule will be that parents who are separated can continue to move children between households, so the children of separated parents could potentially be in two separate support bubbles – one bubble for each parent."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c6f85a0ccacf8831d5ec6e848e659940aaea9cf/355_12_2268_1361/master/2268.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f22def6c67f64a81bd1d8c128d448934","title":"surgisphere

Lancet’s now-disputed blockbuster study Dozens of scientific papers co-authored by the chief executive of the US tech company behind the Lancet hydroxychloroquine study scandal are now being audited, including one that a\u0026nbspscientific integrity expert\u0026nbspclaims contains images that appear to have been digitally manipulated.The audit follows a  investigation that found the company, Surgisphere, used suspect data in major scientific studies that were published and then retracted by world-leading medical journals, including the Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine.Further inquiries by the  into Surgisphere and its founder and chief executive, Dr Sapan Desai, have confirmed that:The blockbuster Lancet study based on Surgisphere data led to global trials of hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19 being halted in May, because it appeared to show the drug increased deaths in Covid-19 patients.The study was retracted after a  investigation and researchers found inconsistencies in its data, which came from a database owned by Surgisphere. Desai was a co-author of the paper.The New England Journal of Medicine also retracted a study with findings based on Surgisphere data and which also listed Desai as a co-author. A third paper involving Surgipshere and Desai, which examined the impact of the drug ivermectin on Covid-19 patients, has been removed from the website SSRN, a repository for scientific papers. can confirm that studies authored by Desai and published before he established the Surgisphere database in 2019 have come under scrutiny by the scientific community and journal editors.Dr Elisabeth Bik, a microbiologist specialising in scientific integrity, examined a research paper co-authored by Desai and published in 2005 which formed the basis of his PhD in anatomy and cell biology from the\u0026nbspUniversity of Illinois at Chicago.\u0026nbspThe paper, published in the Journal of Neurophysiology, examined differences in the inner-ear tissue between species of rodents. \u0026nbspIt included a collage of nine images of tissue sections obtained from different species including a mouse, a chinchilla and a tree squirrel.\u0026nbspBik works full time identifying scientific fraud, and researchers around the world send her images for review. After the retraction of the Surgisphere papers she began examining some of Desai’s other work. Bik said when she looked at the tissue images in Desai’s PhD paper, repeated patterns jumped out at her.“They are supposed to be from different rodents, yet the rat and the gerbil images have areas shared between them,” she said. “There is not only copy-pasting within the images, but also between rat cells and gerbil cells, for example.”Bik highlighted her suspicions on PubPeer, a website where scientists can provide feedback on papers.“I cannot think of any other explanation than these images have been digitally manipulated,” she told the . A spokeswoman for the journal told the  the editorial board was “aware of the situation and is reviewing the matter”. Neither Desai nor his supervising author at the University of Illinois at Chicago responded to a request for comment.According to online profiles, Desai, who is now 41, has had an extraordinary and varied career. In 2010 the online encyclopedia Wikipedia flagged his page for deletion after editors raised queries about his accomplishments.“If half of the claims in this article are true, this is indeed an exceptional young man,” one website editor wrote of Desai, who at the time was 31. “However, exceptional does not necessarily equal\u0026nbspnotable. Most claims are unsourced or sourced to the subject’s own websites. Many claims are over the top.”As well as holding at least one PhD, a medical degree and working as a vascular surgeon, Desai has also founded several companies including Surgisphere and a charity. His claims (on the deleted Wikipedia page) of having a second PhD and a Juris Doctor, or law degree, could not be independently verified by the  and Desai did not respond to questions about this.His biography also says he completed his master’s of business administration in healthcare management at Western Governors\u0026nbspUniversity. The university did not respond to requests for confirmation of this MBA. But according to the university archive he gave a speech to a graduation of university students in 2012, telling them: “Nothing that is easy is worthwhile. Because at the end of the struggle is a fountain that never stops, a fountain that showers us with the twin gifts of knowledge and wisdom.”In a video he made for a crowdfunding campaign to support a product he designed, described as a “wearable neural induction device”, Desai said he also held a PhD in neuroscience. The device, which Desai boasted could increase brain function and creativity, never came to fruition.  could find no other record of his having neuroscience qualifications and Desai did not respond to questions about this.Meanwhile Elsevier, a well-known Dutch publishing and analytics company specialising in scientific content, told the  it was “initiating the process to thoroughly re-assess” papers involving Desai.  has contacted several of Desai’s former co-authors and colleagues for comment.’s investigation has also raised questions about other Surgisphere claims. The company’s website previously stated that it was “partnered” with a handful of researchers at leading universities to complete “groundbreaking projects”, including Harvard, the University of Minnesota, Stanford, the University of Utah and the University of Glasgow. Those affiliations were removed from the Surgisphere website on Friday.When asked about collaborations, the universities said they had no formal relationship with Surgisphere.A spokeswoman for the University of Utah said it was not aware of any institutional relationship. One co-author of the Lancet paper, Dr Amit Patel, is listed as being affiliated with the university but a spokeswoman said Patel had been an unpaid adjunct professor and had not held a faculty position since January 2017.\u0026nbspOn Monday Patel announced on Twitter that he had resigned from the university. “I had verbally terminated my affiliation with the University of Utah over a week ago and formally this past Friday,” Patel wrote. “There is a much bigger story for which I still do not have the information.”He said in the tweet he was related to Desai by marriage. But this was “old news”, he said. “Despite this I still do not have the information of what happened at Surgisphere,” he said.Patel did not respond to requests from the  for comment. A university spokeswoman said: “The University of Utah does not comment on the reasons surrounding termination of academic appointments.” Harvard University medical school also said it had “no formal research agreements or partnerships” with Surgisphere, and said the reference on the company’s website could reflect Desai’s collaboration with Dr Mandeep Mehra, an investigator and cardiologist at Brigham and Women’s hospital, which is affiliated with the medical school.Mehra was listed as a corresponding author on the Lancet study, which said: “The corresponding author and co-author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.”In a statement to the  after the retraction of the Lancet study, Mehra said his intentions “have always been to contribute to scientific discussion and to ensure that the practice of medicine is based on the best evidence available”.“During this pandemic, I have felt this even more keenly, and believe that it is imperative to provide timely data that informs both the scientific field and the care of our patients,” he said. Mehra said he understood Surgisphere to be a privately held company that purported to have data from hospitals around the world “that could be leveraged to answer important public health questions I posed in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic”.“Since we do not have the ability to verify the primary data or primary data source, I no longer have confidence in the origination and veracity of the data, nor the findings they have led to,” he said.“It is now clear to me that in my hope to contribute this research during a time of great need, I did not do enough to ensure that the data source was appropriate for this use. For that, and for all the disruptions – both directly and indirectly – I am truly sorry.”A spokeswoman for the Lancet said the journal was “reviewing our requirements for data sharing and validation among authors, and data sharing following publication” as a result of the retracted study.The University of Minnesota said it had no record of anyone at the university collaborating with Surgisphere.

But interviews with experts, and analysis of the government’s own data, paint a grim picture of what the UK has endured – and a lack of confidence about what the next 12 weeks may hold.First glance at the now-familiar government graphs suggest the curves tracking new infections and deaths are showing significant improvements, at least when viewed from the devastating peak of the outbreak around Easter, when new infections hit 3,918 on 5 April and deaths peaked at 943 a day on 11 April, taking rolling averages.\u0026nbspCloser inspection reveals a less comforting picture. When Johnson spoke 12 weeks ago there were 913 new cases of coronavirus recorded each day on average. At the latest count there were 1,543.Twelve weeks ago the seven-day rolling average for daily deaths was just 21 this week it remains 10 times higher. As the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, reminded Johnson in parliament on Wednesday, the UK’s excess deaths during the pandemic have passed 63,000 – higher than in Italy, Spain and France. As Greece (with a death toll of 183) welcomes holidaymakers, Britons still cannot stay overnight with extended family in most cases.Scientists are also concerned that as lockdown lifts, the test, trace and isolate system for quelling future outbreaks is not robust enough. The care sector, where at least 15,000 have died from Covid-19 so far, warns that the government’s tactics to protect the most vulnerable in a second wave remain largely unchanged.It is the sheer numbers of infections and deaths at the peak that have shocked many. Two days before Johnson made his prediction, the UK government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said less than 20,000 deaths would be “a good outcome”.That milestone was passed more than six weeks ago. According to Sir David King, a former chief scientific adviser and now chairman of an independent version of the government’s Sage advisory group, that could have been the total death toll.King has calculated that if Johnson had ordered the lockdown on the day he promised to “turn the tide”, rather than four days later, transmission would have been slashed and fatalities halved. Prof Neil Ferguson, the Imperial College epidemiologist and former government adviser, also said on Wednesday that the death toll could have been halved if lockdown had come a week earlier.We have not “sent coronavirus packing”, King says, because the R factor – the rate of reproduction – is still not low enough. His group is worried we are risking a second wave by lifting lockdown restrictions now.“There has been a series of really dreadful mistakes by this government that has led to a vast number of people dying and they need not have died,” he said.His calculation about an earlier lockdown was supported by Prof Roland Kao, chair of epidemiology and data science at the University of Edinburgh. He found that if Scotland had gone into lockdown two weeks earlier, its death toll could have been cut to a fifth of the country’s 4,000 deaths now linked to the disease.\u0026nbsp“Cutting the virus off earlier has a huge benefit,” said Kao, who warned the tail of the epidemic is likely to be unpredictable and long.Some modellers predict more grief to come even in this first wave. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in Washington DC, for example, believes the UK could suffer another 3,500 Covid deaths by 4 August.Critics say the tide has not turned in other ways too. The government’s test, trace and isolate system remains “not even close” to being able to keep up with new infections, said King. Care homes complain about a continued lack of testing to control outbreaks which can spread through asymptomatic staff and residents.“We need much clearer protocols on planning for a second wave and they need to make their plans public,” said Martin Green, chief executive of the industry group Care England. “We need either weekly or fortnightly testing.”Care minister Helen Whately said on Tuesday she is expecting scientific advice soon on the appropriate frequency of repeat testing. Some care managers now want ministers to use hospitals to quarantine infected residents in future outbreaks, as happened in Hong Kong where no one has died from Covid-19 in a care home.“In any assessment of turning the tide you have to include preparedness and clarity of action against Covid,” said Dan Hayes, chief executive of the Order of St John Care Trust, which runs 82 care homes and accommodation centres where 242 residents died from Covid-19. “We still don’t have certainty about care residents being able to access hospital treatment on the same basis as everyone else. There is still a viewpoint that people in care homes will not benefit from treatment.”The shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, said the government’s “Protect the NHS” mantra had obscured other important aims.“The prime minister had all this rhetoric about turning tides, and taking things on the chin,” he said. “Twelve weeks later, we have one of the highest excess death rates in the world. And yes, the NHS has coped: but it’s coped on the back of discharging its patients into care homes cancelling operations delaying treatments for cancer – which probably means we’ll have waiting lists at 10m by Christmas.”Downing Street, by contrast, takes a very different view of its performance – and the outlook for the future.Referring to Covid-19 as “an invisible mugger”, Johnson claimed in the House of Commons on Wednesday that it had been an “astonishing achievement” to “drive down the curve”.Asked about whether the country had “turned the tide”, his spokesperson added: “Thanks to the very hard work of the British public we have now passed through the peak and you are seeing the key indicators like the new hospital admissions, new infections and the number of deaths falling. But at the same time we know we have much, much more to do in order to both beat this virus and put the country fully on the road to recovery.”"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"The effects of climate change could damage, and possibly even destroy, our collective heritageAgriculture Minister accuses Green party leader of doing a \u0026lsquodisservice\u0026rsquo to rural communities"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climateTime to restore meadows once full of insects and nectar in summer and spires of seeds in winterA new report shows no let-up in the loss of wildlife in Northern IrelandCorncrakes get major EU funding despite being of \u0026lsquoleast concern\u0026rsquo on Red List criteria"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

In the first week after restrictions were eased, the median had risen from two to three, for the first time since mid-March.It has been rising since, as has been the average, which is now moving towards four.Sources in the HSE said concerns would be raised if the number of close contacts was to rise.“As close contacts have a higher positivity rate, more contacts will lead to higher cases.“But the concern would arise if we started to see a steady rise in cases over a longer period,” added the source. \u0026nbspWith an appreciable drop in the number of new cases in the past few weeks, the scale of the contact-tracing operation has been reduced.Now, only two of the nine centres that were operating at the height of the pandemic remain open, with enough staff deployed to have 30 available on a seven-day basis.Scaling upThe first call is always made to the diagnosed person by a clinician.The second and third calls are made to ascertain how many contacts the person has had in the period around diagnosis, and then to contact those people to inform them they have been in close proximity to a person with coronavirus.With wide testing due to restart in nursing homes in the coming weeks, it is expected there may be a short-term need to scale up the operation.There are also contingency plans to bring in more contact tracers quickly should there be further surges of the virus in the coming months.In all, some 1,500 people were trained to be contact tracers before and during the outbreak.However, given that there were no dramatic spikes in the spread of the disease, no more than 200 to 300 were used.Plans are afoot to put contact tracing on a permanent footing, in one or two centres with a small number of core staff, who will be able to deal with monitoring future viral outbreaks or a second wave of coronavirus, either regionally or nationally, and tracing contacts.The service will be designed, said officials, to be scaled up quickly should the need arise.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4275858.1591810282!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"q a on face masks what is the latest advice","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA cloth mask of at least three layers is best for the general public, the WHO advises. Above, protective face masks at a clothing stall in Norwich, in the UK. Photograph: Chris RatcliffeBloombergGo into any supermarketshop, or take any form of public transport in Ireland, and it is clear few people are wearing face masks. It is hard to resist the conclusion that either they are utterly confused by changing public health messaging, or they don’t see the merit of wearing a mask. Those in the latter camp may believe this Covid-19 pandemic is dealt with as Irish deaths and cases are close to zero – and wish to get back to normal as quickly as possible. Or they are not prepared to put up with what they perceive as the hassle of wearing a mask with all the protocols about how to put it on and take it off correctly, not forgetting re-use procedure. There is social stigma too around wearing them.While the world for the most part agreed on the best way to deal with the Covid-19, ie lockdown, physical distancing and repeated handwashing, the same cannot be said about face masks. There is huge variation between countries in some they are mandatory in public places, in others they are worn routinely whenever there is risk of an epidemic. Differing advice from health authorities doesn’t help.A lot comes down to interpreting research, evaluating risk and factoring human behaviour. So scientists don’t reach an absolute position and governments wrestle with what to tell their citizens who are demanding clarity.What on balance is best advice?Advice on whether to wear a mask has changed in line with emerging research about Covid-19. Evidence backing the wearing of masks in public, where there is community transmission, has strengthened – especially in confined spaces. They do not need to be worn in the open air or while driving a car.When it comes to those over 60, whose immune system is weakening coinciding with ageing, and those with underlying conditions, the case is clear-cut. Moreover, this age group should wear medical-grade masks that, fortunately, are now more readily available, though not cheap.What is the latest advice from the World Health Organisation?In the past week, WHO has come out more strongly in favour of masks, with a variation of types recommended depending on circumstances. Its updated guidance says the public should wear masks where physical distancing is not possible. It is firmly in favour of medical masks for the over-60s and those with pre-existing conditions. A cloth mask of at least three layers is best for the general public. Initially, the WHO was almost anti-mask, insisting many people won’t wear masks properly, thereby risking infection. Masks give people a false sense of security and encourage risky behaviour, it contended. Compounding matters was the obvious shortage of masks for healthcare workers as cases rose rapidly. WHO accepts growing indications that the more people use masks, the lower the transmission, notably from those who are asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic. Previously it recommended masks for people who are symptomatic, to prevent spread to others.What research is persuasive in favour of face masks?At the onset, scientific evidence on the effectiveness of face masks in slowing transmission of respiratory diseases was limited. There was no data on Covid-19 since it was a previously unknown disease.However, there is a growing body of evidence favouring face masks and cloth coverings. This week a UK study found population-wide face mask use could push Covid-19 transmission down to controllable levels, and prevent further waves of the virus when combined with minor lockdowns. A US study found that if 80 per cent of a closed population were to don a mask, infection rates would statistically drop to approximately one-twelfth the number of infections – compared to “a live-virus population” in which no one wore masks.Where does Ireland stand in light of revised WHO guidance?NPHET’s expert advisory group is to review the latest WHO recommendations, but evaluation of current advice suggests Ireland is very much aligned with that viewpoint – though there may be a difference of emphasis.The bottom line, however, is mask use is nowhere near the level warranted. There has been a failure of national advice to hit the target – understandable at a time of exponential rise in cases less acceptable when easing lockdown.There is much catching up to do, to ensure supply of more specialist masks are available for those who are vulnerable to Covid-19 and those who cannot afford a mask or make a cloth version. Supplying free masks to every household could make up lost ground.What is the prudent way to proceed?There is no going back to normal soon. Risk of contamination of surfaces and infection is ever present. Good hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette, while maintaining physical distancing where possible is still the winning formula. But “wear a mask” in the correct way has rightly been added to that mix.

The role of agriculture in reducing greenhouse gas emissions remains a key sticking point, with isions between the Green Party and Fine Gael on the issue demonstrated on Wednesday when Green leader Eamon Ryan and Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed clashed during a Dáil debate.Sources said all parties knew the “landing zone” for agreement is for average annual reductions to be about 7 per cent, but that there would not be complete clarity about how that would achieved in the later years of a five-year term. One Green source acknowledged it would not be possible to have a detailed roadmap for the reductions in emissions every year, and the Minister for Climate Action Richard Bruton referenced the example in the Dáil of Denmark – a country specifically identified as a role model in the Green manifesto. “The reality is that we will probably end up in a position like Denmark, which has committed to high ambition but cannot specify all of the pathway,” he said. “That is the reality we will have to follow.”If negotiating teams and the deputy leaders agree the bulk of a text on Thursday or Friday, the remaining issues will be “kicked upstairs” to the party leaders to agree. Green agreementFine Gael and Fianna Fáil doubt that Green deputy leader Catherine Martin will agree a final text approved by the leaders, but Ms Martin has told her party she wants to get a deal that will gain the two-thirds support it needs among Green members. Meanwhile, Rise TD Paul Murphy sought to stoke Green Party fears that it will be attacked from the left after a deal. Mr Murphy said the Greens would be a “mudguard” for “neo-liberal and austerity policies” if they agree to share power.He said the Greens will be blamed for every “austerity” measure under the guise of it being “about the environment”.Mr Ryan said he “fundamentally disagrees” with claims his party will be bad for farmers, as Mr Creed accused him of doing a “disservice” to farmers over their efforts on bioersity.Meanwhile, Sinn Féin finance spokesman Pearse Doherty said he has been in touch with Mr Ryan to tell him that his party still wants to form a government and will attempt to do so if the current talks are unsuccessful.“We’ve made sure we have been in contact over the last number of days,” Mr Doherty said. “We have reassured people we want to be part of a government for change.”“It is important that the Greens know there are other options.”The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4275945.1591827159!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"covid 19 number of contacts almost double since restrictions eased","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe median number of contacts per diagnosis has risen to close to 3.5 per person, compared with an average of two per person when full restrictions were in place. Photograph: Alan BetsonThe number of contacts identified by people diagnosed with Covid-19 has been rising since restrictions were eased three weeks ago and has now almost doubled.The median number of contacts per diagnosis has risen to close to 3.5 per person in the weeks since May 18th, compared with an average of two per person when full restrictions were in place. The Health Services Executive has said in one case diagnosed last week, the inidual named a total of 25 contacts, a level that has not been seen since the early stages of contact tracing last March. When the tracing process began in mid-March, the average number of close contacts was 20. This dropped very quickly to an average of three and the median close contacts being two per person. In the first week of restrictions being lifted the median moved from two to three and is now heading towards four. \u0026nbspThe news comes as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) warned a second wave of Covid-19 would wipe out any chance of economic recovery in Ireland either for this year or next.In its latest economic forecast, the OECD said as things stand, GDP would likely fall by 6.8 per cent this year due to the pandemic, before returning to 4.8 per cent growth in 2021.It warned, however, that the economy would contract by 8.7 per cent this year with little or no sign of recovery in 2021 if a coronavirus outbreak reoccurred.The OECD also forecast that the unemployment rate here could be anywhere between 10.8 per cent and 12.3 per cent in 2020.The figures come as the organisation predicted the global economy would contract 6 per cent this year before bouncing back with 5.2 per cent growth in 2021, providing the coronavirus outbreak is kept under control.Reopening the economyTaoiseach Leo Varadkar cautioned that the plan to reopen the economy was contingent on the virus being kept under control but also signalled more areas being eased ahead of schedule.“There is always the risk that it might make a comeback… It is possible that the worst is over, but it’s not over yet,” he said.In an interview on RTÉ’s 2FM, Mr Varadkar also said hairdressers could be allowed to reopen earlier than previously planned and he described as “too slow” the Government’s initial five phase roadmap to reopen the country from the coronavirus lockdown by August.Government sources said on Wednesday night that hairdressers and barbers would reopen on June 29.The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) is due to meet on Thursday to review progress in the pandemic, and to review the World Health Organisation’s updated advice on face coverings. The meeting will consider “communications regarding appropriate use of face coverings in community settings”, according to chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan.Minister for Children Katherine Zappone has meanwhile announced a €75 million childcare package to allow creches reopen while not imposing additional financial burdens on parents. Under the scheme, creches will not charge higher fees than they did before the Covid-19 crisis.The plans, however, have been described as “short-sighted” and a “major disappointment” with particular criticism that it will run only until August 23rd.

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsIs it that time of the year again?How quickly the months pass. It seems like only yesterday when the last Fluff ’n’ Puff jamboree was held in the Dáil. Those TDs, they really love their annual Climate Change Big Day Out.The event is so significant it is enshrined in law. Under the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, the relevant minister must present an “annual transition statement” to both houses of the Oireachtas, including an overview of what the government is doing to combat climate change while outlining future plans for curbing dangerous emissions.This is the fourth one. It was published in December and brought for discussion on Wednesday by Richard Bruton.“It is an honour to have the opportunity to make a transition statement at this time,” he said, in what might have been a nod in the direction of his party’s protracted ongoing government formation talks with the Greens. But he was giddily referring to next week’s “first anniversary of the publication of Ireland’s first ever whole-of-government climate action plan”.There isn’t a scrap of bunting left in the country.Fianna Fáil’s Seán Fleming welcomed the debate but he didn’t think the Minister’s contribution was much good as there was nothing about implementation.“The entire report is only fluff and puff,” he concluded. “I want less fluffy policy statements and want specific reports on the issues in the future.”He was followed by John Lahart. “Like my colleague, I want to huff and puff also, but I will take the opportunity to advocate for the cycling argument,” fluffed the TD for Dublin South West, forgetting Seán had been huffing about the Minister’s puffing and making no such pronouncement on his own sterling efforts.Sinn Féin’s David Cullinane was also unimpressed. “I agree,” he declared, waving the report in the air. “This is 70 pages of fluff. There isn’t much in it.”However, having listened to the strong points made by Fleming about the need for specifics, he was sure next year’s report will see “no more huff and puff and that Fianna Fáil are going to blow the house down and usher in a new level of transparency”.Only in the event of them forming a government with Fine Gael and the Greens, he added. But will the Greens go in or stay out? That is the question, the only question, in Leinster House these days.During the debate, TDs from parties involved in the talks went nowhere near the subject. Everyone else was fascinated.Eamon Ryan came into the chamber for the second session of statements on the annual statement, but gave nothing away. This time, as Richard Bruton had done his two hour Covid-restricted stint, Michael Creed, the Minister for Agriculture, was pressed into action.Meanwhile, Eamon Ryan was annoyed with people putting it about that the Green Party in government would be a bad thing for farmers.He found an ally in Bríd Smith. The People Before Profit TD rounded on “people who claim to be the defenders of rural Ireland and loudly attack the Greens for trying to destroy rural Ireland”. These iniduals talk about the party’s proposals on farming like they are “the greatest threat since the Famine or since Cromwell.”In the fight to reverse climate change “farmers are critical. They’re the heroes, they’re going to be the key,” said Ryan, quoting a German politician he admires. “And he’s right.”Labour’s Seán Sherlock couldn’t wait to hear what the Green leader had to say as “a prospective tánaiste giving us a sense of his vision”. Eamon Ryan looked up at him, but, unusually, he didn’t crack a smile. And his expression didn’t change either when Sherlock added that Michael Creed, “potentially the continuing or next minister for agriculture, is also here to listen to that view”.Fianna Fáil’s man at the farm gate, Charlie McConalogue, must have been raging he didn’t get a mention.So what were Creed’s thoughts on the “disparity between the Government’s 3.5 per cent target for reducing emissions and the 7 per cent or 6.5 per cent target that is being bandied about as part of the discussions of the programme for government?”Sherlock had asked Richard Bruton the same question earlier, getting back a convoluted but carefully non-committal reply. He fared no better with Creed. What about Eamon Ryan? Any thoughts on the Greens holding out for those increased targets?Bríd Smith was concerned that Ryan’s party’s negotiating team may be green by nature as well as by name.“If they believe a 7 per cent reduction will be achieved under a party merged with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, they’re fooling themselves. They may think it may not happen in four years but it could happen in 10. I can guarantee them that with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael driving the policy, it will not happen in 100 years, and the seas will be washing over us.”Paul Murphy of Rise beseeched the Greens to think again. There is still time to escape the evil clutches of Leo Varadkar and Micheál Martin, who are trying to lure them down the path to eco-neoliberal perdition, egged on by the scheming right-wing media.“There is an alternative, which is to join with the eco-socialist left.”Otherwise, the party will end up as nothing more than a “green mudguard” for the two big parties, and that way spells disaster.In the chamber, methane hung heavily in the air for the entire day, even though all the doors were thrown open.Independent TD Michael Fitzmaurice had some fascinating thoughts on wind and how seaweed can stop cows farting too much.“The report on methane in regard to suckler cows shows that using seaweed products has brought that down by 79 per cent. These are the angles we should be looking at, not kicking farmers and saying we should be culling half or three-quarters of the national herd.”Limerick’s Richard O’Donoghue, one of the new recruits to the Rural Independents, said people on the ground in rural Ireland feel they are not being listened to.“We are the best country in the world for protecting and respecting other people’s cultures, except when it comes to our own and especially when it comes to the farming sector,” he said, establishing his membership credentials of the group.He said reducing the number of Friesian bull calves being born would help cut the size of the national herd.

With protests sweeping the world in the wake of the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Leopold is increasingly seen as a stain on the nation. Photograph: Virginia MayoAPThe statues are falling. With each day that passes, another statue of Belgian king Leopold II is hauled from its pedestal by authorities and taken away.They became a target as Black Lives Matter protests swept the world: burned, defaced, and splashed with red paint. Their removal is pre-emptive. It’s said, perhaps to reassure those offended by their removal, that the statues are being restored, and kept in a safe place.It’s hard to imagine they could ever return. What were they doing there in the first place?Even in his own time, Leopold II was viewed as a monster. In 1885, he used the pretence of a scientific and humanitarian initiative to seize a vast part of Africa 80 times the size of Belgium. It was a private colony, under his personal rule. It was renowned for grotesque cruelty, and it made him very rich. The cliche was that guns and chains went in, and rubber and ivory came out.Vivid scenes of the torture, mutilation and slaughter of the unfortunate inhabitants of the royal colony as they were forced to harvest rubber for the king and his subcontractors were captured by the Sandycove native Roger Casement. In 1903 he was working in the British diplomatic service, and was given the assignment of investigating the alarming reports issuing from the colony.Here is one testimony he collected, from a local child with the initials “U. U.”“When we were going on the way they killed ten children because they were very, very small they killed them in the water. Then they killed a lot of people, and they cut off their hands and put them into baskets and took them to the white man. He counted out the hands – 200 in all,” the testimony reads.“The soldiers saw a little child, and when they went to kill it the child laughed so the soldier took the butt of the gun and struck the child with it, and then cut off its head. One day they killed my half-sister and cut off her head, hands, and feet because she had on rings.”Irish nationalistOn his return from Africa, Casement began his evolution from servant of empire to Irish nationalist. He joined the Gaelic League, then Sinn Féin, then began smuggling guns into Ireland, and was hanged as a traitor in London following the Easter Rising of 1916.\u0026nbspThe number of people who died under Leopold’s rule in the Congo is estimated to be about 10 million. Nevertheless, in Belgium, some still see Leopold II as a national hero, who worked to further the power and glory of his small European state. Statues of him abound: in the centre of Brussels, he sits astride a horse in a heroic pose, above the inscription “patria memor” (the homeland remembers).Joëlle Sambi Nzeba, a Brussels local who is Congolese-Belgian, told me what walking past the statue is like. “What I see when I walk in the city are the stains, the mark of the domination,” she said.\u0026nbsp“There are symbols of Leopold II everywhere. There are over 100 streets and bus stops that are named after men who took part in the colonisation of the Congo. Nowhere does it say we killed 10 million Congolese, that we cut off men and women’s hands to build Belgium.”Sambi Nzeba is part of the Belgian Network for Black Lives, a group of mostly women of African descent that has been part of anti-racism protests. They are campaigning for recognition not just of the past, but of how it has shaped the present.‘Proper housing’“It’s not a single man, it’s about a system, and the situation perpetuates today,” she told me. “Why does Congo still have a debt to pay? Let’s talk about that. Why can’t people of Congolese descent here in Belgium get proper housing, proper jobs? Why aren’t we represented in the media?\u0026nbsp“In this lockdown, this Covid, our mothers and sisters and aunts are the ones, like the nurses in the hospitals, on the frontline,” she added. “Those majority of people who sweep the streets are certainly not white people.”The subjugation of the Congo did not end when, to quell international embarrassment, Leopold was forced to give his colony to the Belgian state in 1908. It remained a Belgian colony until 1960. The Congolese hero of independence, Patrice Lumumba, became its first democratically elected prime minister, but he was removed from office and executed not long after by Belgian-led troops. The soldiers dissolved his body, but took some of his teeth as souvenirs.What followed for the Congo were cycles of war and looting it continued paying debt to Belgium. Today, despite its vast natural resources of cobalt, copper, diamond, tantalum, tin and gold, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is one of the world’s poorest nations, still deeply indebted to international creditors, and 72 per cent of its people live on less than $1.90 a day.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Annexation would be incompatible with international law, Maas warnsTerror group ramps up attacks as crises including coronavirus provide opportunityGovernment pressed to speed up talks with IMF and donors to secure funds and halt slideBritish-Iranian woman seeking release after first furlough from jail in Iran since 2016Police and security force officers killed in roadside bomb and gun battleHealth authorities confirm more than 3,000 new cases on two consecutive daysOpponents warn that US-backed plan would lead to independent Palestinian stateWar and coronavirus-ravaged country to get $1.35bn from UN and Saudi ArabiaTension rises in region with Israel planning to extend sovereignty to Jewish settlementsGiven lack of other options, authorities used restrictions as main tool to fight pandemicFormer cabinet minister Saad al-Jabri was strategic architect of Saudi counter-terrorism effortsPrime minister claims allegations are a \u0026lsquodeep-state\u0026rsquo, left-wing political witch-huntLong-serving politician will become first sitting prime minister in Israel\u0026rsquos history to stand trialPA president cites imminent threat of Israeli annexation of parts of the West BankFirebomb attack on home claimed the lives of a couple and their 18-month-old sonWHO forecasts coronavirus will kill 42,000 and infect most of 28 million populationRival Gantz to take over as prime minister of Israeli unity government after 18 monthsAshraf Ghani to lead country as rival Abdullah Abdullah oversees Taliban peace process, sources sayCeremony will end political deadlock that has dragged on for more than 500 daysArab and foreign jihadis ambush military convoys and assassinate officials as Baghdad and Damascus try to contain coronavirusStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4274925.1591724621!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit uk talking to eu about accelerating talks says mordaunt","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBrexit supporters: The UK government will  soon publish plans for preparing Britain’s border operations for changes after the post-Brexit transition period. Photograph: Andrew TestaNew York TimesBritain wants to accelerate the pace of its negotiations with the European Union by changing the format of the talks, a cabinet office minister told MPs on Tuesday. Paymaster general Penny Mordaunt said any agreement must be in place before the end of the year so that businesses would have time to adapt to its terms.“There is no point in our arriving at an agreement at the 11th hour: we have to arrive at an agreement to enable it to be implemented and ratified, but also in order for our citizens and businesses to prepare. That is what is dictating the timetable, and that is why we must have renewed focus. We are talking to the EU about having a change of format – about how we can increase the pace of negotiations, get the focus where we need it to be, and get a deal done for both our sakes,” she said.‘Achingly pragmatic’Ms Mordaunt said the government would soon publish plans for preparing Britain’s border operations for changes after the end of the post-Brexit transition period. But she declined to give details and said officials were planning for all outcomes, including the possibility that no deal would be agreed.“It would be prudent and wise for us to prepare for every scenario, just as we have always done. We did so last year and then did not need to implement those preparations. I am confident that we cannot only come to an agreement but do so in a timeframe that gives people the time that they need to prepare and to understand. We are very aware of the other things that are going on in the world that form the backdrop to that. Our approach is going to be achingly pragmatic,” she said.Transition periodFormer Northern Ireland secretary Julian Smith said that businesses in the North had told him they were moving jobs to the Republic because of the implications of the Northern Ireland protocol. The SDLP’s Claire Hanna drew the minister’s attention to last week’s vote in the Northern Ireland Assembly calling for an extension to the transition period.“The government insisted that the Northern Ireland Assembly should have the final say on the protocol. The Assembly finally gave a say on Brexit when it voted last week to request an extension to the transition period to allow businesses, which are currently in the fight of their lives due to Covid, to adapt and to have the certainty that the minister refers to. If the Northern Ireland Assembly’s consent is so vital, should the government not listen to what it says?” she said.Ms Mordaunt said that, although the Assembly would determine whether the terms of the protocol remain in force in a few years’ time, the government would not extend the transition.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus.

Educating our children must be a priority. But the Government’s mismanagement – and even blind spot – on this issue puts at risk the welfare and education of children as well as denting the prospects of recovery.For weeks, parents and teachers were told that all children will be back at school for a month before the summer. However, on Monday, without warning, ministers ditched that commitment. Responsibility for this lies at the door of No 10. There was no plan, no consensus, no leadership.The longer schools are shut, the greater the damage to children’s wellbeing and education and the increasing pressure on parents who are having to juggle childcare and work commitments. The warning from the Children’s Commissioner a few days ago could not have been starker: a generation of children now risk losing out on over six months of education.I do not underestimate how difficult it is to reopen schools safely in the current climate. But those difficulties were entirely foreseeable. It should have been obvious that serious effort was going to be needed to support children’s education during the pandemic. Weeks ago, I urged the Prime Minister to secure a national consensus on the reopening of schools to address the valid safety concerns being raised. I even offered to work with him to find a way through, but was ignored.It is characteristic of this Government’s handling of the pandemic. Too slow into lockdown, too slow on testing, too slow to get protective equipment to our frontline workers and now too slow on getting a plan in place for children’s education. We now have the ridiculous situation where next week betting shops and theme parks will open, but parents are not clear when their children will go back to school.There is a very real risk that this country will lag behind the rest of the world in its recovery and in the wellbeing and education of our children because of the mistakes this Government has made. We cannot allow that to happen. We need decisive action. That requires three things.First, a national plan to reopen our classrooms safely. That plan should be developed in the next fortnight with those who understand schools best: parents, teachers, education unions and council leaders. Without a plan, there is a risk that even by September many schools will not be able to reopen, and some children could be out of education for an entire year. I remain committed to working with the Prime Minister to develop that plan in the national interest.Second, there is no doubt that the way children are educated needs to change in light of the pandemic. Schools cannot reopen as normal. Adaptations need to be made so that teachers, children and parents can be kept safe. Introducing these changes must be a national effort using the creativity of the British people. Towns, villages and cities are full of empty buildings and spaces that can be repurposed. Theatres, museums, libraries and leisure centres could be repurposed and opened for children.Third, we need to take steps now to reverse the gaps in attainment that have been worsened during the lockdown. Despite the best efforts of teachers, millions of children will have gone without a proper education for nearly three months. They cannot wait until September to start learning again.None of this is beyond the capability of government. It simply requires focus and determination to do the best for our children.The Chancellor’s pre-Budget report next month must therefore include additional resources to fund schemes that can educate children over the summer months. I would also urge the Government to issue guidance requiring all children of school age to have a one-on-one meeting, with a teacher from their school and parents before the summer holidays start.At Prime Minister’s Questions today, Boris Johnson did not appear to understand the urgency and the scale of the challenge of getting schools back up and running safely as soon as possible. Parents and teachers can see the mistakes that have been made, but what they need now is a strategy they can trust.

We are suffering from the worst possible Covid combination: the largest number of excess deaths per capita, and the sharpest recession of any rich country. It’s a nightmare and, together with the quarantine chaos and the failure of the NHS tracing app, helps to explain why the Government appears so discombobulated, so deflated, so risk-averse.Johnson’s luck has temporarily run out. The scientists gave him the wrong advice at the start, the bureaucracy let the country down appallingly, he and his top team caught the virus and he is now making his own, unforced errors, as he struggles to push through the unlocking of Britain. Even his staunchest supporters are baffled: what is going on? Tory MPs are panicking, and for once have a point. Why is our crisis dragging on so much longer than that in France, Italy, Spain or Germany? Can we have the old Boris back please, and some of his buccaneering, can-do spirit?Yet all is far from lost, and it would be an act of extreme stupidity for the Tories to turn on Johnson now. The OECD forecast that the UK will suffer worse economically than its rivals is the product of a typically useless technocratic spreadsheet, ready to be refuted by reality. Britain’s daily deaths and infections continue to slide, and the economy is reopening. But if he is to capitalise on this, Johnson needs to start gambling again. Nowhere is this more true than with schools.Their closure has been a calamity, and was probably unnecessary to get the epidemic under control. Our understanding of how this virus works remains shockingly rudimentary, but not only is it almost entirely harmless to children, there is evidence that the virus peaked before lockdown, when schools were still open.Keeping them closed for so long is fast turning into a national scandal. The impact on children has been catastrophic: they are being robbed of their education, separated from friends, unable to play the sports that matter so much to so many of them. Dreams and opportunities are being extinguished, for approximately zero gain to the older people the policy is meant to be protecting. Almost all children have lost out, but by far the greatest impact will be on the poorest and most vulnerable.This madness must now end. Schools must be reopened fully, as a matter of national urgency, and with the same zeal, determination and strong messaging displayed at the start of the lockdown. It should become the Government’s totemic policy: Johnson must tell the nation that educating the next generation is more important than anything else.Even if it leads to a higher R rate, and even were it to mean that other social interactions would need to be curtailed to compensate (which I doubt), our children must come first (and it would certainly work as a slogan). It is true that some will become transmission vectors, spreading the virus to elderly or vulnerable adults. The answer is to focus the Government’s resources on managing and minimising this risk, shielding those who need it, without allowing it to terrify us into depriving an entire generation of its schooling.Ideally, and contrary to the Government’s pathetic capitulation this week, the reopening of schools would proceed over the next few weeks. Some social distancing would stay in place, but Johnson should immediately ditch the two-metre rule, replacing it with a one-metre guideline, as in France or Singapore. Almost every other Western country is managing it, so why can’t we?If that is still asking for too much, let me propose a final deadline of September to reopen all schools fully, with no social distancing, with a set of new cleanliness and testing protocols. We should not opt for some “Nightingale model”, whereby halls and churches are taken over to create weird socially-distanced experiences. That would be a sickening cop-out, a gigantic distraction: children deserve a renormalisation of their lives, not yet more ineffective “safetyism”.By the first day of next term, schools must guarantee no social distancing in the classroom or playground and no bubbles. Full school uniforms should be used again. All sports should return, including rugby. Canteens should reopen, though with tweaks for hygiene. Ditto IT rooms, libraries, science labs and the rest. Assemblies should be held as before. School buses, where they exist, should operate fully.The changes should focus on hygiene, PPE, testing and quarantining. There should be hand sanitiser everywhere, regular handwashing and cleaning of facilities and equipment (as now). Shared items should be disinfected at least once a day. Older teachers or those with conditions that put them at greater risk should wear masks or visors. Common-sense precautions should apply: if a young child needs carrying, it would make more sense for a younger teacher to do it rather than a 70-year old.But the greatest change should be testing: all children, staff and visitors to the school should undergo temperature checks on arrival. Anybody ill should not be allowed into the school, or kept in a special room until they can be picked up again. In parallel, the Government’s testing programme should pivot towards schools, children, teachers and parents: there needs to be mass and regular testing, and not just if anybody develops symptoms.Any school with a case of Covid should shut for a period, and everybody tested before they are allowed back. Children and families should be quarantined to contain the spread. There will doubtless be flare-ups, and at any one time 2-3 per cent of schools may have to be closed, as we have seen in Israel. We need a massive publicity campaign explaining why it is the right thing to do.I’m not blasé about this virus. I know people who have died. I worry about a second peak, though I’m also hopeful that a vaccine will rescue us. But no civilised society can order the reopening of its pubs and tennis courts while keeping its schools closed. Johnson must break from the overly cautious scientific establishment, and announce that he will guarantee a proper return to schooling for all children.

There is worse, seemingly not yet noticed by the “Topple the Racists” organizers: during the American Civil War, he for a time supported the slave-owning Confederacy.  Whether this wipes out the reasons why he has long been honoured (and was loathed by the Right) is, I suppose, a matter of moral judgment. On the virtuous side of the scale is his creation of modern progressive politics urging democracy as a moral right attempting to give Ireland home rule creating a modern civil service supporting sexually abused women advocating Italian freedom opposing arms spending campaigning against ethnic atrocities in the Balkans criticising imperialism and arguing for an ethical foreign policy, and so on. His political record is unsurpassed – 60 years in politics, and prime minister in his eighties. He was arguably the most wide-ranging, intelligent, unpredictable, dynamic (and psychologically odd) of our great modern politicians – a progressive global hero worshipped by his huge working-class following. Personally, I am not an unalloyed admirer of his rather sanctimonious style of politics, allied with a shameless opportunism (playing with an ace up his sleeve and claiming that God had put it there, commented a colleague). It is an odd spectacle to see some on the modern Left destroying their own heritage. But it is a distortion of history: Gladstone was not a slave trader, or owner, or defender of slavery. The past is different from the present: the educative purpose of looking at history, however superficially, is to try to understand that difference, and in this case to understand why Gladstone took the positions he did. He thought that the legal and peaceful abolition of slavery was to the general good. In the American Civil War, he accepted Lincoln’s statement that the war was not about slavery. He believed that it was dragging on endlessly, causing huge suffering, not least economic suffering to the workers of Northern England, most of whom supported his desire for a negotiated peace. These may have been wrong opinions, as Gladstone later acknowledged. But they were understandable, and hardly wicked.  I am not one of those who regard all historical monuments as sacrosanct. No one has the right to a statue or even a hall of residence in their honour, and certainly not in perpetuity. We can surely choose to remove the statues or other honorifics of people we no longer respect, or have merely forgotten. I rejoiced when the many statues of Stalin and Lenin in the old USSR were pulled down: I’d be pretty worried if they were put back.  But my main reason for feeling uneasy about this present campaign is less historical than political and ethical. If we crudely apply the most “woke” criteria to figures in the past, few will emerge untarnished, and the campaign itself will soon become ridiculous: on the hit list already are Captain Cook and, for no obvious reason, Robert Peel (another popular hero – for reducing the cost of food). More seriously, to attack a figure like Gladstone, or vandalize the statue of Churchill, due to distorted historical understanding or just for the hell of it, is a deliberate rejection of our shared history, not just the bad but also the good. It is a clumsy attempt to start a nihilistic culture war and offend as many people as possible. Scapegoating heroes from the past may be for some in Britain just a fun way to break lockdown and feel virtuous with no effort. But stirring up dissension on an issue – police brutality in the United States and racial discrimination in general – on which most people agree is bizarrely counter-productive.  Robert Tombs is a Fellow of the newly launched Centre for Brexit Policy, and he is writing a book called Offshore Island.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/05/11/12/coronavirus-schools.jpg","title":"uk schools closure reopen september economy parents children education","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.If parents can’t work, or can’t work at normal capacity, because of childcare commitments it threatens to be a blow to the wider economy. But just how large could the damage of the prolonged school shutdown be?The national return to school is not going to plan.Last month the government said primary school children who have been at home under lockdown should start returning to classrooms from 1 June and that the re-opening of secondary schools could commence from 15 June.However, the re-opening up of primary schools has been much more patchy than expected, with only half of them opening their gates to some new pupils last week.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt is time to put children’s interests first and reopen schoolsThe plan to reopen schools is equally impractical in SeptemberAnd now ministers are suggesting a return to full normality for education may not now come until after the summer holidays in September.Many parents were compelled by the school closures to look after their children during the daytime when they would otherwise have been working.Some have had to quit their jobs to do so. Others have had to reduce their hours. Many are juggling their formal work with childcare, putting great strain on families and harming their productivity.The delayed re-opening of schools will be a blow to many of those households.But if those parents can’t work, or can’t work at full capacity, even as some sectors of business are being allowed to re-open, it also threatens to be a blow to the wider economy. So how large could the damage of the prolonged school shutdown be?How many workers are affected?But not all these families will be affected equally by the school closures.Some of those parents will have been looking after children full-time already before the lockdown and some will have older children who don’t need as much direct supervision.Samuel Tombs of the economic consultancy Pantheon estimates that the school closures will have created a major childcare problem for around 4 million families and that around 2.5 million workers—7.5 per cent of the UK workforce —will have had to take leave their jobs to look after young children.How does this translate into economic harm?No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

By September many children will have had no formal schooling for almost six months. Estimated impact of school closures on GDP in April and MayExperts also fear that older children will get worse exam results due to school closures, harming their prospects in the labour market in the future.Modern economies increasingly rely on the “human capital” of their workforces to grow. This reflects a workforce’s skills and capabilities acquired through education.So, from that perspective, there is a clear danger that a longer school shutdown could inflict greater damage on the UK’s long-term economic growth potential.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The OECD forecasts that the global economy will take a 6 per cent hit, by far the biggest drop of any projection in the organisation’s 60-year history.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe research, which covers 46 industrialised nations, delivers another warning to Boris Johnson’s government, as ministers announce plans to ease a host of restrictions over the coming weeks.How a green economy could solve the unemployment crisisNon-essential shops are to open on 15 June, the business secretary Alok Sharma confirmed on Tuesday, while pubs and bars are set to welcome customers again from 4 July.The relaxation comes despite Public Health England (PHE) research estimating that there are around 17,000 new cases daily, with infection rates rising in the northwest and southwest.At a national level, PHE estimates that the number of people each person is infecting – the R number – is close to 1, meaning that a small increase in the R number would see case numbers rise again.The Faculty of Public Health expressed its concern last week that too many people still have the virus for the country to return to “something approaching normal life”.“We believe the urgent priority for the UK is to learn from the success of these countries by setting an objective of having no new community cases of Covid-19 as quickly as possible,” Maggie Rae, president of the faculty, wrote in the British Medical Journal.The OECD’s forecasters focused on two “equally probable scenarios” – one in which a second wave of infections, with renewed lockdowns, hits before the end of 2020, and one in which another major outbreak is avoided.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

France and Spain are both expected to see their respective economies shrink by 11.4 per cent with Italy faring marginally better at 11.3 per cent.Germany, which has controlled the pandemic more effectively than many other European countries, is forecast to see its economy contract 6.6 per cent this year.If a second wave of infections hits, forcing countries to bring back some restrictions on people’s freedoms, the OECD expects Spain to experience the worst recession, with its economy contracting by 14.4 per cent compared to 14 per cent for the UK.“The 6 per cent decline in global GDP is larger by far than any we have projected in the 60 years since the OECD was created,” said OECD general secretary Angel Gurria.“Hundreds of millions have become unemployed – and that is in the scenario where no second wave of infections happens.”If a second wave were to hit, global GDP is predicted to shrink by more than 7.5 per cent and around 40 million more people will lose their jobs, he added.He reiterated his warning that to see the pandemic as presenting a choice between lives and livelihoods was a “false dilemma”.“If the virus is not brought under control, there will be no robust economic recovery,” Mr Gurria said.OECD chief economist Laurence Boone said: “Both scenarios are sobering, as economic activity does not and cannot return to normal under these circumstances.“By the end of 2021, the loss of income exceeds that of any previous recession over the last 100 years outside wartime, with dire and long-lasting consequences for people, firms and governments.”She added: “Extraordinary policies will be required to walk the tightrope towards recovery.“Even if growth does surge in some sectors, overall activity will remain muted for a while.“Governments can provide the safety nets that allow people and firms to adjust, but cannot uphold private sector activity, employment and wages for a prolonged period.”Responding to the report, Rishi Sunak said the UK was not the only country to suffer economic damage. The chancellor said: In common with many other economies around the world, we\u0027re seeing the significant impact of coronavirus on our country and our economy.The unprecedented action we\u0027ve taken to provide lifelines that help people and businesses through the economic disruption will ensure our economic recovery is as strong and as swift as possible.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The latest study, which involved 2,254 British adults, also revealed that around six in 10 people experienced worse sleep since lockdown began on 23 March.Charting Sweden’s no lockdown strategy“Nearly two-thirds of the UK public report some negative impact on their sleep from the Covid-19 crisis, clearly showing just how unsettling the pandemic and lockdown measures have been for a very large proportion of us,” said Professor Bobby Duffy, director of the Policy Institute at King’s College London.“And this is clearly tied to both how stressful we’ve found the virus itself, and how much we fear the impact of the lockdown on our employment and finances.”Data gathered in April by wearable technology firm Withings showed that people in the UK had been sleeping for 15 minutes longer on average each day during the lockdown.France saw the biggest increase in daily sleep times, with the average person sleeping for an extra 20 minutes each night.These findings can be partly explained by people not having to commute to work due to either working from home or not working at all during lockdown.Similar data from fitness tracking firm Polar revealed that people in Germany are also sleeping for longer.A significant increase in sleep time was recorded by Polar’s sleep-tracking devices as lockdown measures were introduced in Germany on 22 March.Researchers at University College London (UCL) are currently studying the effects lockdowns are having on people’s mental health.Early results suggest that higher levels of anxiety and depression are linked to lockdown restrictions.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Researchers have been unable to find how the bursts could be created, with the only certainty being that the very short but very powerful blasts must be emerging from some unknown, very extreme part of the universe.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe bursts come in a roughly 90 day window, which is then followed by a silent period for 67 days. The pattern then repeats, leaving a reliable 157 day period that was tracked over multiple years.That long pattern could suggest that the blasts are linked to the swirling, orbital motion of a massive star, a neutron star or a black hole.Mysterious signals coming from space answer matter puzzleThis is an exciting result as it is only the second system where we believe we see this modulation in burst activity, said Kaustubh Rajwade of The University of Manchester, who led the new research. Detecting a periodicity provides an important constraint on the origin of the bursts and the activity cycles could argue against a precessing neutron star.Fast radio bursts were first discovered in 2007, and were initially thought to be the result of a one-off event. Scientists then found in 2016 that FRB 121102 was in fact repeating.In the latest research, scientists then studied the source of the FRB using telescopes at Jodrell Bank, which allowed for regular monitoring over a long period that revealed the blast could be seen to be coming in a repeating patter when watched for a long time.This result relied on the regular monitoring possible with the Lovell Telescope, and non-detections were just as important as the detections, said Benjamin Stappers, who leads the MeerTRAP project to hunt for FRBs using the MeerKAT telescope in South Africa, in a statement.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas from fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

By comparison, the UK\u0027s download rate was 67.23Mbps, which is less than the global average of 74.74Mbps.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe average speeds were aggregated by DecisionData.org using global internet service provider (ISP) speeds compared against global index averages by Speedtest.net.The analysis only included the top 25 countries with the highest broadband internet speeds, however recent data from Speedtest.net indicates that the UK ranks around 44th in the world.Singapore\u0027s speeds are fast enough to download an HD film in less than a minute. Using the UK\u0027s average speed it would take more than 3 minutes.A minimum speed of around 40Mbps is needed to live stream 4K content and play competitive online games, while streaming standard HD content requires speeds of between 15Mbps and 25Mbps.With an average broadband speed of 124.1Mbps, the United States fell out of the top 10 for the first time in more than two years. The download speeds are still around double that of the UK.Data from the first week of June gathered by Speedtest.net ranked the UK 45th in the world in terms of fixed internet speeds.The UK performed even worse for average mobile internet speeds, ranking 47th in the world with a download speed of just 35.08Mbps.The UK\u0027s mobile internet speeds were not that much higher than the average global speeds, which stood at 30.89Mbps.Earlier this year, researcher in Australia achieved a world record internet speed of 44.2 terabits per second, allowing users to download 1,000 HD moveis in a single second.Dr Bill Corcoran from Monash University, who led the research, told The Independent that he expected to see the technology see commercial use within the next five years.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms.Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo?

But organisers stepped up after the lockdown began and started providing 5,000 meals a week to families in Poplar struggling to afford or access food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDizzee volunteered as part of his work with Kitchen Social – the Mayor’s Fund for London programme providing food for children across the capital during the school holidays. “I was given an amazing opportunity to visit and help out Kitchen Social at Bygrove Primary School in Poplar, who are providing free food, books and school equipment to kids in the local area where I grew up,” he said.“Thank you to all the amazing people I met and thanks to the Mayor’s Fund for London for connecting the dots.”How to support our campaignBygrove Primary School is also receiving vital supplies from The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project.The food surplus charity, which delivers to hundreds of food banks and community projects across London, began helping the school at the start of the crisis by dropping off one or two trays of fresh produce and staple items each week.The charity has since increased the supply from one or two trays of food each week to 40 trays to help organisers cope with the huge demand.Mark Causton, manager of the school’s initiative, said: “The Felix Project have been an immense help – I can’t praise them enough. We know we’ll need to carry on this work right through the summer, so we rely on all the fresh food they’re supplying.”Mr Causton added: “We’ve seen a lot of parents furloughed or losing work over the past couple of months. In the case of some families struggling to afford to buy shopping, this is one of their only sources of getting food for their children.“It was really great to have Dizzee Rascal here helping out. He got stuck in, and got on so well with all the volunteers and all the families. It was just nice to see a smile on a lot of people’s faces.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

Figures from the Independent Food Aid Network (IFAN) show a 175 per cent rise, with both charities reporting this their “busiest period ever”. Furthermore, a survey by the giving platform Neighbourly of 900 charities and community groups providing food to the vulnerable found that 70 per cent expect the situation to get even worse in the next six to 12 months.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent proprietor Evgeny Lebedev paid special tribute to the almost 6,000 ordinary iniduals who have dug deep to contribute to our appeal. He said: “Time and time again Londoners have shown that they are capable of immense generosity and community spirit in this period of crisis.“To all those that donated, bought and bid — I salute you.”Morgan Stanley said the bank and its employees in London had made the donation as part of their global Covid-19 response.How to support our campaignClare Woodman, head of Morgan Stanley EMEA, said: “The Felix Project plays a vital role in distributing food to people in need, especially those severely impacted by the pandemic. I am proud our employees in London are supporting them as part of our Covid-19 Hunger Relief Campaign.”Another substantial donor was Partners Capital investment group, which donated £95,287.John Collis, head of Partners Capital, Europe, said they “selected The Felix Project as one of our charities to support during this difficult period as it is one of the most impactful charities in London today”.Heads down for quiz nightThe original Top Gear trio — Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May — will tonight host a special Zoom quiz in aid of our appeal partner, The Felix Project. Participants in the Quintessentially Foundation’s “World’s Greatest Quiz Night” will face five rounds of questions devised by Nicholas Shearing, questions producer for top British TV quiz shows Pointless, Debatable and Impossible. May, who has driven Felix vans delivering food to vulnerable Londoners throughout lockdown, said: “At least in this stay-at-home pub quiz version, it will be easy to cheat.” 7.30-9pm. Tickets £10: thefelixproject.orggreatestquizOur appeal was also boosted by the silent auction, in partnership with Quintessentially Foundation, which closed this week with 135 bids placed for 36 lots and raising almost £40,000.The most highly prized lots were two tickets to a Liverpool FC game, four tickets to the Euro 2021 semi-finals, a video-chat with Spurs coach Jose Mourinho, a private guitar lesson with singer-songwriter Ellie Goulding and a helicopter lesson.The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

After paying rent and all her bills from the universal credit she receives at the beginning of the month, she now finds she has just £4.30 left over for food and nappies for the rest of the month.How to support our campaignSo she is almost entirely dependent on school vouchers available for her oldest two children (£15 per child per week) to buy absolute essentials, and one weekly food package dropped off by the Sufra food bank.“I don’t mind going hungry sometimes, so long as my kids have food,” said Ms Sarri-Gonzalez. “Sometimes I might have just one main meal for myself in a day. There was one point during lockdown I didn’t manage to eat anything for myself for two days, almost three days. But I always set the table for the children – I keep things as normal as possible for them.”“It’s so difficult at the moment. So stressful. I’m hoping when the kids go back to school later in the year I can go back to work and make things easier somehow.”The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project has quadrupled the volume of surplus food it gets out to people in need since the crisis began.The work remains as urgent than ever. The most recent YouGov poll for the Food Foundation charity shows over 1.5 million people in households with children have been unable to access food for economic reasons during the lockdown.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Watching parents struggle to put food on the table and go without food themselves is devastating.”Rebecca Archer and her partner – who have three girls aged eight, six and three at home in London’s High Barnet – have found it difficult to afford enough food during lockdown. “The shopping I do is costing a lot more with them at home all the time,” she said.Once the bills are paid and the main weekly shop is done on a Monday, the couple finds they have about £50 left to get through the week – about half the amount they usually had before the pandemic hit.The family has recently taken advantage of two £15-a-week school vouchers they get for their two oldest girls, and receive some cooked meals from their neighbour Katie-Louise Barber – a volunteer delivering food using The Felix Project’s supplies.“It’s been a real strain. Thinking and worrying about money all the time isn’t easy,” said Ms Archer. “I never thought I’d be worrying about having enough for the children to eat. There was one point we just didn’t have enough for the pre-paid gas meter, so we had to go without that for more than a week.”The Trussell Trust, which runs the country’s biggest network of food banks, has warned food charities cannot cope “indefinitely” with the huge spike in demand for help caused by the pandemic.A coalition of anti-poverty charities had written to the chancellor asking for an emergency income support scheme that would increase child benefits and end the five-week wait for initial universal credit payments.Anthony Cotterill, leader of the Salvation Army in the UK, warned: “It’s years since we have seen poverty to be such a real and present danger for so many people. We are approaching a poverty tipping point.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis. Find out how you can help here.

Everyone is very grateful,’ says a volunteer who also uses service when his own illness means he is unable to pitch inFormer music manager John McIntyre was unsure how he would cope when lockdown began.“I was very scared,” said the 75-year-old who has a respiratory condition and lives alone in a one-bedroom flat in Dalston. “If I caught Covid, I wouldn’t be able to get enough oxygen to the heart. I just had to follow the advice and be safe.” Mr McIntyre, who used to manage the jazz reggae band The Beatroots, has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema.He has relied for his daily meal from local charity Made In Hackney which is supplied by our Help the Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project. Mr McIntyre is one of more than two million people who are classified as “extremely vulnerable” because they have compromised immune systems. For the last 10 weeks, many of them have struggled to get access to food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSince March, volunteers from the River House Trust charity have been dropping off Felix produce to people living with HIV. One such volunteer is former actor Stephen Hart who was diagnosed in 2006. When he is too ill to leave the house, he also uses the food delivery service.Despite being high-risk and a life-long diabetic, Mr Hart has been helping to get food to those more vulnerable than him. He has been unable to work since his health deteriorated two years ago, but Mr Hart, who lives alone in south London, said he wanted to help others.How to support our campaign“When I feel well enough, I pick up boxes from River House and drop them off for people who need them,” he said. “I do it when I can but some days are bad days.”Mr Hart said his condition means sometimes he can’t get out of bed. He occasionally receives a Felix box for himself so he knows he has food when he is too sick to move. “It is reassuring to have food in the house,” he said. “Felix has been a lifeline.”Although the British HIV Association said there “remains no evidence” that people with HIV are at greater risk of Covid-19 infection, those with a low CD4 count – the white blood cells affected by HIV – have been advised to shield.Mr Hart said members of the HIV community have been “nervous” since the outbreak. “There isn’t much specific advice so the community has been trying to look after each other.”A 62-year-old living with HIV for 37 years, who asked not to be named, described how his parcels have helped him. He said: “I pick up the boxes as I don’t have energy to go shopping. They’ve been great.”Mr Hart said it was extremely moving to see the response to his deliveries: “It is amazing.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.Modern slavery victims are being deported to countries where they are at high risk of further exploitation because the Home Office is relying on a flawed interpretation of evidence, lawyers and researchers have warned.Guidance used by caseworkers to assess whether people trafficked to the UK can be sent back to Vietnam or Albania – the two most common nationalities for modern slavery victims in Britain – is “significantly misleading” about the risks, one told The Independent.The situation has “horrendous human consequences” if trafficking victims are refused asylum and returned to countries where they are unlikely to receive adequate protection.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesGovernment figures show 1,705 Albanians were identified as potential modern slavery victims by the UK’s National Referral Mechanism (NRM) last year, making it the most commonly referred foreign nationality, while 887 referrals were of Vietnamese origin, making it the second-most commonly referred.Victims identified through the NRM can apply for asylum if they wish to remain in the UK due to fear of returning to the country from which they were trafficked.Record high 10,000 suspected modern slavery victims in UKPotential slavery victims to be deported on charter flight to PakistanHome Office leaves modern slavery victim ‘in limbo’ for five yearsHowever, a report published last month by Asylos, a charity that produces its own reports on country-of-origin information, found many victims were at serious risk of re-trafficking in Vietnam due to economic vulnerability, problems accessing social services, stigma and unpaid debts to traffickers.It also found that recognition by the NRM as a victim of trafficking would not automatically confer the same status with officials in Vietnam, making them potentially ineligible for assistance.The report included one example of a Vietnamese boy who was trafficked from the country twice, once to China, and then once to Laos for sex exploitation, before he was found in Poland.For Albania, the Home Office’s guidance makes almost no mention of boys and young men, which experts said leads to the impression that male victims do not face any issues that would entitle them to asylum in Britain.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailHowever, Aylos last year found boys and young men in Albania are being targeted for exploitation by groups associated with organised crime, some of which have links within the UK.Trafficking victims ‘left without access to justice’ under new rulesDavid Neale, legal researcher and formerly a barrister at Garden Court Chambers, told The Independent that the Home Office guidance on both Vietnam and Albania “painted the country of origin as able to protect the person adequately when that’s very often just fundamentally not the case”.He noted that the government’s assertion that victims were likely to be able to access effective protection from the state in Vietnam was “flatly contradicted” both by the Asylos report and by some of the information included in the Home Office’s own guidelines.“It’s wholly wrong to say that in general people are going to be able to avail themselves of sufficient state protection because in a lot of cases they’re just not. They’re not going to be recognised as trafficking victims at all, and whatever services might be available are just not going to be made available to them,” he said.“Sometimes the Home Office conclusions are significantly misleading. Yet they are presented as if they are evidence when the country summary is not evidence and is in my view extremely problematic and potentially very misleading and I think does mislead a lot of people.”Mr Neale said the “misconceived” guidance was part of a “culture of refusal” within the Home Office that he said was “set up to disbelieve people and to try and paint the country of origin as able to protect the person adequately when that’s very often just fundamentally not the case”.He said negative asylum decisions based on this guidance risked “absolutely horrendous human consequences” for the victims.“They’ll go to appeal, but if they’re unrepresented or not well represented, the judge may not be cognisant of all these issues around the Home Office narrative and they just accept the Home Office narrative, and they could end up in detention – they could end up removed,” he said.“Equally, they could end up living an underground life in the UK for a long period with no access to legitimate work or benefits, which obviously makes people extremely vulnerable to re-trafficking and abuse and labour exploitation.“And even if they’re able to get legal representation to appeal, people can be waiting months or years for their appeal, during which they’re likely to be on a minimal level of support – unable to work and claim mainstream benefits. And of course people throughout this period are vulnerable to re-trafficking.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Social distancing markers around the penguin enclosure at London Zoo.

Information notes are based on rigorous research, we work closely with other governments and organisations to prevent re-trafficking, and removals from the UK are only enforced when the courts and the Home Office conclude it is safe.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Does that make sense to you?”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Hunt said that he has been disappointed by the lack of progress on resuming lessons for primary school children, but refused to criticise his boss in Downing Street, instead blaming unions for their lack of cooperation.“Well I think that some of the largest teaching unions – such as the National Education Union – they haven’t been particularly productive and positive in the discussions,” said Hunt.“I have to be honest with you, I think the vast majority of those involved in education are motivated by what is in the best interests of the children.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?“But unfortunately, I’ve come to the conclusion that there does seem to be many people, particularly those involved at senior levels in teaching unions, who seem to be more motivated by scoring political points than getting as many children as possible back to school.”Asked what evidence he had to back up his claim, the MP accused the National Education Union of “actively discouraging” teachers from conducting online lessons.Hunt was then asked by Derbyshire who exactly had made the comment, to which he replied: “I’ve got the quote...” but added that it was “not to hand”.Mr Hunt said that it will be children from the most disadvantaged backgrounds that suffer the most as a result of the continued closure of schools and reiterated that his passion for education.“Well do something about it then,” the presenter replied.Earlier this week, the government abandoned its pledge to get all primary school children back to class before the summer.Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to announce on Wednesday that zoos, safari parks and drive-in cinemas in England can join non-essential shops in throwing open their doors as part of the relaxation of the coronavirus lockdown on 15 June.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It has four core beliefs: family, integrity, teamwork and success – all integral pillars of its Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme.Put together by Sharon Gray OBE and the federation’s head teachers, it’s designed to welcome pupils back to class after lockdown. “Everybody in the Embark community has done their bit,” says Gray, a headteacher for 20 years, mostly in special schools supporting youngsters experiencing social, emotional and mental health difficulties and schools going through challenges.“It’s been all hands on deck,” executive headteacher and Trust leader of Embark’s schools Matthew Crawford adds. “Even two weeks into lockdown we were thinking about our children returning to school, whatever date that may be.”Safety at school1. Anyone who is unwell or been in contact with somebody showing coronavirus symptoms should stay away from schools, colleges and childcare settings2. Hands should be cleaned more often than usual with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds and dried thoroughly. Alternatively, hand sanitiser or alcohol hand rub can be used3. Promote the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach to coughing and sneezing4. Clean frequently touched surfaces regularly using standard products, such as detergent and bleach5. Help to minimise contact and mixing by altering classroom layout and timetablesWith regards to physical changes that parents and pupils can expect to see in corridors and classrooms, Embark is working with Government guidance and undertaking a thorough, bespoke risk assessment for each of its schools. “It can’t be a one-size-fits all approach,” Crawford stresses.According to Anna Upton – head of the 240-pupil Chaucer Junior School in Ilkeston, Derbyshire – questionnaires were sent out to reconnect with parents, through which they could express concerns and suggest ideas about the return to classrooms.According to Upton, staggered breaks and how drop-offs will work were important issues that were flagged in questionnaires. “But the risk assessment the Trust has put in has allowed us to make a comprehensive plan and we can communicate that to the parents,” she explains.“What the Trust have done with the programme is to implement nine stages which support our schools to open as safely as possible, supporting the staff parents and the children. The risk assessment means that I, as a headteacher, can do what’s right for my school.”Chair of trustees Sarah Armitage emphasises the importance of teamwork based around a guiding principle: families first. We look after families, so we reach out we talk.” she says.“Then there’s teamwork. Let’s harness the power of the team so it’s not the headteacher sitting by themselves with all these things to think about – that load is shared.”Armitage’s back-to-school outlook is optimistic too: “We have created something with this programme that we hope will be massively beneficial. Our role as leaders is to keep that going, carry on putting emotional needs at the heart of everything we do, because then children are able to learn and benefit – and move through this crisis.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.China has removed pangolin parts from its list of traditional medicines, state-backed media reported, in a move campaigners say is a vital step in helping to protect the endangered animal.Pangolins – the world’s most trafficked mammal  – are highly sought after in China and Vietnam for their meat which is considered a delicacy, while their scales are used in traditional medicine and folk remedies.Similar in size to domestic cats and the only mammal covered in scales, all eight pangolin species are protected under international laws but there remains a growing illegal trade of the animals. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis week health authorities omitted pangolin scales from China’s latest Pharmacopoeia, an approved list of traditional drugs and remedies due to “wild resources exhaustion”, according to a report in the Health Times.WildAid CEO Peter Knights said the move was “the greatest single action that could have been taken to save pangolins from extinction.”“The increased protection coupled with the swift and comprehensive closure of live wildlife markets and removal of many wild species from the list of what can be consumed as food in China were already very positive steps to saving the pangolin worldwide and reducing the possibility of them ever being a vector for disease.“And now this announcement, effectively the closure of legal sales of pangolin scales, shutting the last major loophole in pangolin protection efforts,” he added.People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) welcomed China’s decision, but urged action to stop the sale of pangolins on the black market. “PETA gives a nod to China for taking an important step to combat the demand for pangolin scales,” director Elisa Allen told The Independent.“However, as long as it remains desirable and profitable for endangered animals’ body parts to be sold for medicine, wildlife will continue to be killed on the black market.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some scientists believe they may incubate the Covid-19 virus that is thought to have emerged in Wuhan last year and has since swept the globe.Scientists find virus similar to Covid-19 in pangolinsFollowing the outbreak of coronavirus at the end of last year, China banned the consumption of all wild animals in a bid to prevent further outbreaks but many wet markets have since reopened.Earlier this year, The Independent renewed its call for the banning of trade in wild animals to help protect endangered species and avoid future pandemics.“These actions of China will have a real impact, these are steps that were critical, that needed to be taken if real conservation was going to happen for these animals,” said David Olson, director of Conservation at WWF Hong Kong.“Most of the demand for pangolin is coming from traditional Chinese medicine and consumption. That’s what is driving this large scale illegal trade.”With additional reporting by Louise Boyle Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

What previously took a number of researchers a long time can now be accomplished by one drone operator in minutes.”The paper’s lead author Dr Andrew Dunstan, of the Queensland Department of Environment and Science, said: “Previous population survey methods involved painting a white stripe down the green turtle’s carapace when they were nesting on the beach, then getting on a small boat and counting painted and non-painted turtles.“Our eyes are attracted much more to a turtle with a bright white stripe than an unpainted turtle, but the pain washed off after a few days and the counting accuracy suffered.“Trying to accurately count thousands of painted and unpainted turtles from a small boat in rough weather was difficult. Using a drone is easier, safer, much more accurate and the data is permanently stored,” he added.Managing director of the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, Anna Marsden, congratulated the researchers and described the images produced by the drone as “extraordinary”.“Raine Island is the world’s largest green turtle nesting site and that’s why we’re working with our Raine Island Recovery Project partners to protect and restore the island’s critical habitat,” she said.“We’re taking action to improve and rebuild the island’s nesting beaches and building fences to prevent turtle deaths, all working to strengthen the island’s resilience and ensure the survival of our northern green turtles and many other species.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This means friends and families can now see their loved ones.“I know for many this will be a long awaited and joyful moment.”Brits, who are not from single households must still maintain social distancingthey do meet up, and there are a number of restrictions they must abide by.Hugging is not allowed, as is sitting on the sofa, lingering inside and indoor dinner parties.You can however use the toilet during your visit, and as long as you maintain a two-metre distance, groups of up to six people from dferent households can meet outside - meaning BBQs are back on the menu.The Prime Minister urged Brits to “avoid seeing people from too many households in quick succession” and said people should keep the number of households they interact with to a minimum.He was also quick to stress that the Government will monitor the nations rate of infection and reimpose restrictionsnecessary.The tweaked rules will only apply in England - as Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland will follow slightly dferent guidelines as they have a higher rate of infection.Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick has already ordered all parks to keep their gates open and put an end to council patrols stopping people from catching rays and sitting on benches.Police were previously allowed to issue on the spot fines of £ for meeting without a good reason, and this has been increased to £ following Boris Johnsons announcement on Sunday, May .Social distancing rules continue to be even stricter for over-s and those with serious underlying health conditions such as a weakened immune system, chronic respiratory disease or chronic heart disease.On May , it was confirmed that the vulnerable people having to shield would be able to leave their homes the following day, but would have to remain social distanced and it is advised only seeing one person from another householdthey live alone.Some of these rules have been relaxed but they remain dependent on the R rate staying lower than one.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Mr Johnson has encouraged Brits to do “more and even unlimited amounts of outdoor exercise”.People are allowed to sit in their local park, drive to other destinations, and play sports.The Prime Minister stressed people must continue to “obey the rules on social distancing”.To enforce those rules police will be increasing fines for people who break them.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I never suspected him of such crimes.”On the show a former friend and landlord Alexander Bischof showed off his sparse loft area where the serial paedophile stayed.The drter moved in with Alexander and his we in Augsburg, southern Germany, in the years after Maddie went missing, before they all fell out.Alexander told The Sun this week how he was stunned to learn his old mate was the main suspect in the Maddie case.He said: “This is all unbelievable.”\" title\"#Madeleine McCann suspect Christian B had a #hair trigger temper# and threatened pal with a kne, German TV doc reveals# # The Sun\" src\"https:www.thesun news  madeleine-mccann-german-tv-documentary-suspect-christian-b embed # secretHQvXlUNN\" data-secret\"HQvXlUNN\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"The Madeleine McCann suspect had a #hair trigger temper# and threatened a pal with a kne, a German documentary revealed this evening.Christian B is the prime suspect in the disappearance case, with German cops quizzing him in prison.Former pal Norbert M spoke of the -year-olds temper on the RTL two-hour special.He said: #In , I took over a kiosk that had previously been run by him.“He wanted to take a freezer and the air conditioning with him, even though they didnt belong to him.

Maybe there are some British tourists who spent their time between  and  in Portugal, in Praia da Luz, and took some video or pictures.“I hope there are some readers of The Sun who can help us to find the murderer of Madeleine McCann.#The prime suspect in the Madeleine McCann case has been moved to a solitary jail cell amid safety fears.Christian B is currently serving sentences for drug offences and rape in high security Kiel prison in north Germany # and has so far refused to come forward with any information on the case.Claus Christian Claussen, justice minister for the state of Schleswig-Holstein, said in a statement today that the suspect had been moved into solitary confinement over safety fears.He said: #He is in a single cell for Christian Bs safety and security against possible attacks from other inmates.#The suspect has served two thirds of the time and had applied for early release from his drugs sentence, with a decision on his parole expected early next week.Hans Christian Wolters, Braunschweig state prosecutor, said he feared Madeleine was killed shortly after being abducted from her familys holiday apartment in Praia da Luz in .Mr Wolters told The Times: “My private opinion is that he relatively quickly killed the girl, possibly abused her and then killed her.“We believe our suspect committed further crimes, especially sexual crimes, in Portugal possibly but also where in Germany.”Christian B had also fantasised about wanting to #capture something small and use it for days in a chatroom exchange, according to earlier reports.The convicted rapist and paedophile allegedly discussed kidnapping and sexually abusing a child in a chatroom exchange in September , German newspaper Spiegel reported last week.Cops have no clue where Madeleines body is buried but do know how she was killed, it is claimed.\" title\"#Madeleine McCann cops think she was killed soon after abduction as Christian B #boasted about evidence being destroyed## # The Sun\" src\"https:www.thesun news  madeleine-mccann-cops-christian-b-boasted-evidence embed # secretbCDDxhfx\" data-secret\"bCDDxhfx\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"A German television documentary set to start at .pm UK time is set to reveal more bombshell details about the Madeleine McCann case.The documentary will speak to experts with inside knowledge of the probe into Madeleines disappearance.German profiler and crime expert Axel Petermann will piece together a picture of new suspect Christian B.He was revealed as a suspect on last Wednesdays edition of the German equivalent of Crimewatch.Well have all the latest on that here.Cops are revisiting their initial investigation of Christian B, in relation to the  disappearance of a five-year-old girl in Germany, say prosecutors in the northern town of Stendal.Inga Gehricke went missing on May , , from a forest in Schönebeck, Saxony-Anhalt, during a barbecue.At the time of her disappearance, the girl was visiting the Wilhelmshof district of Stendal.She went to collect wood for a campfire with other children in the forest.But, Inga did not , and there’s been no sign of her ever since.Like Madeleine’s case, there has been no trace of missing Inga, and a search with tracking dogs and police helicopters proved unsuccessful.Head of the investigation, Reimar Klockziem, told reporters in Germany that her disappearance was “inexplicable and unbelievable”.It was asInga had been #beamed away from the world”, he said.Bunte pointed out in May, , that “only a few missing persons cases are not cleared up in Germany for a long time. One of them is that of Inga.”The publication spoke to profiler Axel Petermann, who said there was “no recognisable motive, no crime scene, no traces of a crime, and no body.”Now, though, the new suspect Christian B in the Madeleine McCann case is being investigated over the disappearance of the five-year-old.Madeleine McCann cops also fear that Christian B could be linked to another #German Maddie# who was snatched and killed in .Peggy Knobloch, nine, vanished on her way home from school in May  but her remains were not discovered until  years later in a forest near her home in Baia.The case is Germanys most infamous unsolved child murder and the chilling similarities between little Peggys disappearance and Madeleines led to her being dubbed the #German Maddie#.Investigators are now re-examining her brutal killing to establish whether there is a link to Christian B, who had been released from jail for child sex attacks just months before she vanished.Bayreuth chief prosecutor Martin Dippold said: “The suspect in the Maddie case is now also being reviewed in the Peggy case.#The new prime suspect Christian B was already known to British and Portuguese police in relation to Madeleines disappearance in Praia da Luz.Yet, the latest information came from a witness who stepped forward following the appeal by the Met Police on the tenth anniversary in .The suspect # who is  now # is believed to have been leading a #transient lestyle# at the time, as he travelled between Portugal and Germany.It is believed he was living in the Iberian nation between  and  working in the food industry.The man is known to have been in the area at the time of Madeleines disappearance, having taken a -minute phone call an hour before she went missing.CHRISTIAN B. will NOT give any information on her disappearance, his lawyer said today.His attorney Friedrich Fülscher, who represents him with lawyer Johann Schwenn, told RTL today: #Christian B is not making any statements on the case at the moment and we ask for your understanding that we as defense attorneys are not making any statements either.#He said he had visited Christian B. in prison at Kiel Penitentiary, where the -year-old German was being held in solitary confinement, it was reported.When asked how his client was doing, Mr Fülscher replied: #How should a person be doing who is isolated in a prison and accused of the worst crimes by half the worlds population #MADELEINE MCCANN suspect “Christian B” was last week unmasked as a -year-old drter.He is a prolic burglar, who has previous convictions for sex crimes against young girls.Born in Germany in , he moved to Portugal in his late teens.The suspect # who was  at the time of Madeleines disappearancein  # has twice been convicted for sex crimes against young girls.German police # who are treating Madeleines case as a murder inquiry # believe he initially planned to rob the holiday apartment before he #moved on to a sexual motive#.IN , Christian B was investigated over a missing girl from Saxony-Anhalt, Germany, Inga Gehricke.The chief Madeleine McCann suspect was in Saxony-Anhalt when Inga vanished on a family day out in .Cops investigating Ingas disappearance searched Christian Bs home in Neuwegersleben, Saxony-Anhalt, in February  the Volksstimme newspaper reports.But the case was closed after four weeks.Christian B refused to comment about Inga’s disappearance when questioned in prison recently by German police.It is understood a detective from the Met’s Operation Grange team investigating Madeleine’s abduction was also present during the interview.TWO British ex-girlfriends of the main suspect in the Madeleine McCann Case are #terried# he will be released.A pal told The Sun: “They’ve both been beside themselves for days since the police appeals and don’t know what to do.“Their first priority is to help police because they know a lot of things that probably join up a lot of the dots in the investigation.“Their main concern is making sure he’s convicted and stays in prison because they know what kind of person he is.“They’re terried he might get out one day and come for them.#A GERMAN television documentary is set to reveal more bombshell details about theMadeleine McCann case tonight.The two-hour special, which airs tonight, will speak to people with inside knowledge of the investigation into the little girls disappearance.Clarence Mitchell, a long-term close adviser of the McCanns, and Sky News crime correspondent Martin Brunt are among those who will speak on the RTL show.A WOMAN who was raped in  fears Christian B may be her attacker, but Portuguese authorities are said to have ruled him out as a suspect.Hazel Behan has now given a statement to the Met Police, who said they will contact Portuguese police. Speaking yesterday, Hazel waived her anonymity to the , was gagged and raped in her apartment in  but the culprit was never caught.She believes her ordeal bears chilling similarities to the Germans  rape on a -year-old American woman in Praia da Luz.Hazel told the newspaper: #My mind was blown when I read how he had attacked a woman in , both the tactics and the methods he used, the tools he had with him, how well he had planned it out.#CHRISTIAN B has two convictions in Portugal, state prosecutors have confirmed.It follows revelations last week that the Madeleine McCann suspect had been jailed in  for a minor offence, and for petrol theft in .A spokesman for the Faro District of the Portuguese Public Prosecution Service said in a statement last night: #The Maddie suspect was convicted of disobedience in one case and of theft in another.#Five requests for international judicial cooperation were also found in which the name of the suspect is mentioned.#One of the requests is related to a case actioned against unknown people and closed in February , and four related to the investigation into Madeleine McCanns disappearance.#POLICE have already ruled out Christian B. over the rape of an Irish woman by a masked German man in , it is reported.Hazel Behan was working in Praia da Rocha # just a -minute drive from where Madeleine McCann vanished # when she was attacked in her apartment.But Portuguese newspaper Jornal de Noticas reported today that Christian B is not a suspect for the unsolved sex crime.The newspaper said: #Jornal de Noticias has learnt that the idea it was Christian B was considered when he became a suspect in the Maddie case. #Unsolved crimes, like those of Hazels, were revisited and the investigators concluded he was not the author [responsible].#Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A delaying-the-inevitable tactic which meant, by the time Phil and Dennis’s tickets for the April  game between West Ham and Burnley arrived in mid May, the fixture was as dead as Dennis.A lucky escapeyou ask me.The day of reckoning, when it runs out of episodes, fast approaches, of course. For the duration of the outbreak, though, it’s been a biological miracle.Regulars have packed The Vic, mobbed the Bridge Street market and just stood around gawping and muttering, in their usual community-serving way, when Keegan’s sandwich van was trashed by the local drug dealers.The presence of a global pandemic hasn’t stopped EastEnders lecturing us about other medical issues, obviously.Since the boat party accident, in February, it’s been particularly concerned about Ben Mitchell’s deafness, which cut no ice with me for a couple of good reasons.Firstly, Ben Mitchell is a dreadful, immoral, six-headed little turd who it’s impossible to like, let alone love.Secondly, they’d forgotten he was partially deaf for most of the previous decade.There’s not an international crisis or continuity glitch in the universe that can stand in the way of EastEnders’ moral grandstanding, though, so they decided viewers should “see and hear” last week’s heist episode, with Barry Grant off Brookside, through the eyes and ears of Ben.A particularly gormless enterprise, this one, which went off like Norman Collier and Jimi Hendrix on the same bill at The Half Moon in Putney, and was all feedback and missing words.To ram home the message for the hard of thinking, the action was also accompanied by word cloud subtitles that appeared to have been written by Tarzan.“Keep mind on job.”“Cut power.”“Ben, this mistake.”“Daughter without father.”Compared with other EastEnders episodes, I enjoyed it a lot. I usually do when the show tries something a bit dferent and thought you could actually write the entire history of the show in half a dozen lines of this new Tarzan-speak.“Den hate Angie.” “Peter change head.” “Phil. Him shot.” “You not mother.” “Me am mother.” “Peter change head again.” “Get out pub.” It’d be timely as well. After  years and four months of almost constant shouting and stall-minding, EastEnders goes off air next week.Tantalisingly, The Sun’s very own Andy Halls reported, on Friday, that when it s the show will have dropped its old storylines. A dream scenario which allowed me to fantasise about EastEnders .. A happier, funnier show that’s only on twice a week, where the BBC doesn’t endlessly bask in its own right-on virtue and the majority of characters actually sound like Londoners, instead of stage-schooleditorials.But that’s not going to happen, is it So I’m just going to enjoy the silence. Tarzan like.TIPPING Point, Ben Shephard: “Which city in the Midlands shares its name with a meeting between two sporting rivals ”Bill: “Birmingham.”Celebrity Mastermind, John Humphrys: “In an th century poem, what season of the year did Keats describe as ‘a season of mists and mellow fruitfulness’ ”Monty Panesar: “Oliver Twist.”Ben Shephard: “The Anglo-Dutch wars were fought primarily between England and which modern-day country ”Amy: “Denmark.”.THE Last Leg, Desiree Burch on the George Floyd fallout: “Follow black artists and thinkers on social media, people who have good resources, information, opinions and insights. Right now I have two shows you could watch — Desiree’s Coming Early and Tar Baby.”Or you could watch Too Hot To Handle, where Netflix films young people having sex while artist thinker Desiree offers her “insights and opinions”.But she’s clearly too modest to mention her role on that one.THIS week’s winner is Tory MP Andrew Bridgen and Harry Enfield’s Tim Nice But Dim. Sent in by RJ.FIRST job for the Beeb’s new Director General, Tim Davie  Find out how Peter Crouch: Save Our Summer ended up on primetime, Saturday night, BBC. Seriously, how  It’s a late-night ITV show, with no one to bleep out the swearing, but with BBC levels of over-manning.The star, obviously, was Peter Crouch, who’s actually funnier than  per cent of TV comedians and more likable than all of them, but not yet ready to front his own show. So they added Maya Jama, who looked sensational in her Status Quo Blue For You-era denims, the compulsory Horne Section and Chris Ramsey, who was hiding behind a fence at the start. And should’ve stayed there. All deserve our sympathy. SOS was meant to be a Euro  spin-off and when the tournament vanished so did the show’s point. Camera angles also seem to have gone to hell, but that’s maybe an act of socially distanced mercy given what’s happening front and centre.Saturday’s content included: A teabag- flipping contest between Mo Farah and Ellie Simmonds, parachuting with Jermaine Jenas, which was straight off the Alan Partridge script and foul-mouthed football “bantz” from Rio Ferdinand, who said his career was ended by Peter Crouch, so may have been playing keepy-uppy to the Match Of The Day theme tune as some sort of twisted payback.The really alarming thing, though, is the series lasts eight weeks.Save Our Summer  At this rate, there’ll be a dark cloud hanging over autumn as well.For the record, it was the BBC News.SPRINGWATCH’s Steve Backshall wearing a “No planet B” T-shirt like he’s a -year-old student, rather than a -year-old BBC presenter who won’t shut up about his three kids. Bafta giving nominations to The Greatest Dancer and The Ranganation but not a Best Drama nod to Line Of Duty.This Morning’s Phillip Schofield losing his very short temper with John Torode over yoghurt dressing. Anyone who says “chowing down” instead of eating. And the clearly smitten GMB host Susanna Reid making an involuntary groping gesturewith her left hand, just after she says the name Keir Starmer. Easy tiger.PETER Crouch: “It wasn’t all about improving, it was also about getting better.”Ian Wright: “The one thing about Gerrard was his professionalism and the fact he was so versatile.”Paul Merson: “It was definitely half an open goal.”                                 SKY Documentaries’ McMillion, the best show on TV.Ralph’s wedding on The A Word. ITV’s th birthday tribute to the great Bradley Walsh.The GMB spat between Piers Morgan and Donald Trump’s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, which had everything except the obvious reprimand: “Rudy. Stop your messin’ around.”And Channel ’s Murder In The Outback, where disgraced Australian lawyer Andrew Fraser proves, beyond much forensic doubt, Bradley Murdoch did indeed kill Peter Falconio.The only slight glitch being, he’s trying to prove the exact opposite.Watch it, Channel , tonight and tomorrow, pm. The self-delusion becomes hypnotic. A Gillian Burke on Springwatch B Connell Waldron on Normal People C Comedian Tom Allen on nearly everything MOST surprising thing about Britain’s Best Parent  Anita Rani isn’t the most annoying person on this Channel  show.In fact, she’s not even close to a medal position thanks to the other five – two couples and a single mum – who must champion their own style of parenting, whether  it’s “pushy” or “vegan” or mollycoddling or just sort of lying around in bed all day treating their offspring as the hired help.Like the rest of us, Channel  silently understands, of course, listening to strangers talk about their small children is no more engaging or enlightening than listening to a ­scientologist talk about L. Ron Hubbard, so they’ve included a few eccentrics to liven  up the process.On the one hand there’s martial arts enthusiast Robin, who explains: “Our parenting style is influenced by eastern philosophy. Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism,” ventriloquism, egotism, Roxette’s fourth album Tourism.On the other there’s gender fluid feminist nut Joana, who is attempting to bring up five-year-old son Willow as “a free spirit”, by banning the word “boy”, refusing to buy him “militaristic toys” and plastering her house in idiotic Socialist Worker propaganda.Hopefully, little Willow will be a stalwart of his local golf club and TA unit  in about  years’ time.But that’s no real saving grace for the show, nor a reason to watch any part of Britain’s Best Parent, apart from the final vote where, every week, the studio audience has to choose between those “free spirits” who let the kids rule the roost and those couples, like David and Nicky, who run their house more like an SAS boot camp.And every week, I’m happy to report, they vote for the boot camp.All hope for Britain may not be lost.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In her case, it’s not pretty.Where to start  How about son number two who, thanks to his friendship with billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein is now embroiled in an ugly, cross-Atlantic ding dong with an American legal system that kowtows to no one.Clearly, Andrew hoped his royal status might ensure discretion. But the US Department of Justice has other ideas and has now publicly accused him of lying when he says he has offered to co-operate with their inquiries into Epstein’s questionable activities.It’s uncertain whether The Queen and Prince Philip have Netflix in their lockdown lair at Windsor Castle, butthey have watched the documentary Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich — in which their reportedly favourite son is mentioned many times — they will have spat out their popcorn.Aside from the well- documented claim by Virginia Roberts that she was trafficked to London at the age of  to have sex with Prince Andrew , one of the most damning accusations is the alleged sighting of him at Epstein’s private island where airport staff now say that the billionaire, who allegedly killed himself last year, frequently arrived with “underage girls”.Ordinary people staying schtum at the time for fear of losing their jobs is one thing but the silence of the many powerful men who enjoyed Epstein’s hospitality is quite another.Prince Andrew is undoubtedly one of them and, at the very least, he owes it to Epstein’s survivors to sit down with the US Department of Justice and reveal what he does, or doesn’t, know.And asthat’s not enough to give his mother sleepless nights, he and his ex-we Sarah Ferguson are also being sued for a £.million unpaid debt on a Swiss ski chalet.Meanwhile, son number oneis happy enough in his second marriage, but reportedly harbouring a deep sadness that one of his sons has chosen to leg it to the US, along with the baby grandson he can no longer hug.On top of that, he faces forking out millions to help Harry and Meghan pay for personal protection because not only have they chosen to settle down in paparazzi central, but in a country where the gun culture means any nutter can wander into a store and arm up as easily as buying a microwave.Son number threehas just announced that his children won’t use royal titles and will work for a living.But one wonders whether, given the pressure to streamline the monarchy, they jumped before they were pushed.Daughter Anne is a reliable stalwart, but grandson Peter recently announced his marriage to we Autumn is over, and as for grandsons William and Harry, it’s fair to say that the reported fall-out of those two young brothers who walked so stoically behind their mother’s coffin must be causing The Queen great sadness.So, with all that going on with her nearest and dearest, how will she feel when lockdown finally lts and she’s expected to put on a brave face to the world again Will she think, “I’ve had enough” and, as was rumoured prior to the pandemic, abdicate on her th birthday next year Doubtful, given that she pledged she would be of service “my whole le” and that, traditionally, British monarchs occupy the throne until death.But, given her family ructions, who could blame hershe did decide to call it a day If he had bodyguards with him on his ious visits to Epstein, then perhaps they could enlighten the US authorities on Andrew’s movements at the time Andhe didn’t, then why the hell does he need them now Asthe new, -day quarantine rule wasn’t daft enough, it’s emerged that police have been told to take “no immediate action”a passenger gives a  address on arrival in the UK.Right. So the only travellers affected by this ludicrous policy will be the law-abiding and public figures who risk being spotted on holiday then named and shamedthey don’t self-isolate upon .Everyone  can just give their details as Mickey Mouse of Taking The Mickey Street, and go about their le with impunity.Meanwhile, the airline industry is teetering on the verge of bankruptcy because it sends out the message that Britain is closed.Well.

This cost us time and a lot of wasted money which unfortunately we were unable to get back.”The pair found a better-skilled builder who stepped in and “did an amazing job turning the church into our home. “I absolutely adore my home, it’s everything I’ve always wanted to do since I was small,” Hannah said.“I love everything to do with houses and home décor so this was like my blank canvas to do anything I wanted. “Its perfect and just very me in every single way. My favourite areas are the kitchen area and my pink entrance hall. I have lots of bright colours as my job can be quite stressful so coming into a bright happy space really helps me escape.To budding home-decorators, she recommended researching builders thoroughly and getting plenty of quotes before getting the work done to save money and stress in the long-run.She noted: “Seek out people who have done similar projects or renovations, ask their advice as sometimes it’s best to know what to avoid doing as well as what to do.“Don’t be afraid to do something totally unusual and quirky, whatever your style is just go for it.

roughly  per cent of Britains poorest kids had access to packages of material, compared to just over  per cent.But wealthy kids were iniably getting better access to crucial online classes - almost  per cent, compared to  per cent.For those in private school the number was even higher - almost  per cent of privately educated children were getting online classes.The report said: These gaps mean that children from better-off families are not only doing a higher quantity of home learning, they also have access to potentially higher-quality support from schools.The activities that children from better-off families are doing may also require less parental support because they involve a more active engagement from teachers and tutors.The report warned parents of poorer kids were more likely to be overloaded with helping their children as well as trying to work.The report added: It is almost certain that these factors will coalesce to widen an already prominent attainment gap between children from poorer and better-off background in England.According to the IFS this dference in schooling could entrench inequalities and scar kids careers long after finishing school.Children in poorer families have lost more from school closures, and those who would have entered work this year face the potential for long-term scarring from the collapsing labour market.In contrast, iniduals with higher levels of education and higher earnings are more likely to be able to carry out their work activities from their home, to have space at home to educate their children.And to have savings to cover any unforeseen expenditures.Schools have only just opened up this month after closing for everyone but children of key workers in March.Kids in reception, year one and year six are all able toto classes, but the Government recently ditched its plans to get all primary school kids back before the holidays.Childrens Commissioner Anne Longfield accused the Government earlier this week of prioritising the reopening of pubs of kids education.She told BBC Radio : Lets look at some of the things the Government has prioritised over recent months at vast scale and speed - the measures to save jobs, the ,-bed hospitals, propping up the economy.All of those things have happened in a way that is unimaginable.Its that level of will and determination thats needed to overcomer the practicality thats needed nowChildrens education does matter as much as the economy and we need to invest in it because without it theres the risk that childhood is going to be furloughed for months. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--jun-.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--jun-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--jun-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--jun-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--jun-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--jun-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--jun-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--jun-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--jun-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--jun-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--jun-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--jun-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--jun-.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--jun.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--jun.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--jun.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--jun.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--jun.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--jun.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--jun.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--jun.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--jun.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--jun.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--jun.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--jun.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--jun.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It went through three iterations before it came to be the one we recognize today that features a red banner, a blue St Andrews cross, and  white stars that represent the Confederate states. It was flown by several Confederate armies, including that lead by Robert E. Lee, who fought to protect slavery as an institution.The confederate flag has been used in the state since . It is the only state in the country whose flag features the confederate symbol.Several public institutions in Mississippi, including Missississippi State University and the University of Mississippi, have opted not to fly the controversial flag in disagreement with what it represents.The last time the state considered changing the flag was back in , where keeping it was put to a vote. % of voters wanted to keep the Confederate emblem as opposed to changing it to  white stars on a blue banner, signying Mississippis establishment as the th state in the USA.The confederacy began as seven Deep South states including Alabama, Louisiana, Georgia, Mississippi, Florida, South Carolina, and Texas.By the time war was declared in , they were joined by Arkansas, Tennessee, Virginia, and North Carolina. The Confederacy was headed by President Jefferson Davis and Vice Pres. Alexander H. Stephens.The confederates seceded from the Union after the election of President Abraham Lincoln in November , who threatened their right to keep slaves. The war began on the premise of slavery—the Confederacy saw slaves as an integral part of their economy.For so many Americans today, the confederate flag now symbolizes the oppression, torture, and terror of their predecessors.

So we need a strategy. We need leadership, and we need an army of recruits.First, let’s not waste those upcoming summer weeks. There is no need for school to be out for summer.As the Children’s Commissioner Anne Longfield has said, \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"our schools should be open in some form or other over the six-week summer holidays. We can’t afford to leave it all to the autumn and hope for the best.I am not trying to trap the wonderful teachers into another six weeks without a break. They have already been ­working flat out over the past three months, developing home- learning resources.I understand the practical as well as contractual concerns that need to be negotiated.But without overburdening, or ­risking anyone’s health — where there’s a will, there’s a way.There are teaching staff, ex-teaching staff, retired teaching staff and countless volunteers who I believe are ready and willing to step up and help supervise children under the leadership of professionals.Second, we need to think ­creatively about space.I am the leader of a group of  schools around the country.\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"There is just not enough space in any of our school buildings to properly social- ­distance and house all pupils at the same time.We are not alone here.So let’s use other empty buildings — village halls, town halls, hotel conference halls, church halls and closed museums. What great learning opportunities for “bubbles” — those small groups in which all children are taught now.Third, this moment gives us the opportunity to rethink what education is. If it’s true that we are community beings — that we learn in community from one another — then we need to rethink the curriculum.Education has always been about more than maths, English and geography.It is every little bit as much about social and emotional development.Human beings are social beings. We thrive when we are connected and struggle when we’re not. I talked to a GP who lives up our street and is the mother of an ­intelligent six-year-old boy. She told me last week about how concerned she is about him “becoming withdrawn”. She is right to be worried.We have to get used to the fact that “remote” learning will probably be part of the ­equation for the foreseeable future. So, once again, let’s think dferently.Let’s use the days when children are in school with us dferently to the days when they are at home.Leave the academic subjects for days when they can work at home on projects we have set them the day before. While they are with us, concentrate on team-building and emotional and social skills development, making up for the deficit they have suffered through ­lockdown.Through the summer, let’s use lots of play and sports for the same purpose, along with those “catch-up” lessons. We are all going to have to learn how to balance intelligently “remote” home-learning with the “togetherness” opportunities of classroom learning.In a survey by PiXL — a ­national partnership of primary and secondary schools —  per cent of teachers questioned believed the Covid- crisis presents us with an opportunity for root-and-branch reform of educational methodology.So let’s start now.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

One minute we’re cleaning out the shed and the next minute we’re being told to leave our homes because a bomb could potentially go off. Kane was so careful when he put it back in case it exploded.“While we waited for police and bomb disposal experts to arrive, we went out into the street and were chatting to neighbours about it.

Pick For Britain is a national campaign, bringing workers and employers together to match skills and need to help save the farming industry. The campaign brings all recruiters and those seeking work in one place, from pickers and packers, to plant husbandry and tractor or forklt drivers. Pick for Britain is the perfect chance to pass the summer months and earn moneyyou’re a university student, a way to continue workingyou’re on furlough and a great way to meet new people and be part of an extraordinary national effort to get seasonal food on people’s plates.

I would % recommend it to somebody . I’m having a really good time, the people are really nice, and it’s nice to be out in the open air and doing something physical. Though the work can be demanding, farm work is currently considered key work and it’s a healthy and productive way to support local communities during this dficult time. You usually need to be at least  years old to work on a farm, but there may be roles for  to -year-olds depending on the business and for most roles previous experience is not required, with training given by the farms. Ideally farms are looking for people who can work a full working week but days and hours can y by farm and according to the weather.  Pay depends on your employer and the job you do. You may be paid a set hourly rate or a piece rate which ies depending upon how much you pick.  However, you will always be paid the national minimum living wage  for the average of the hours that you work in a pay period.

Asked directly about what their biggest regret was, Boris Johnson dodged the question.But Professor Whitty pointed to the slow development of Britainaposs testing regime.The Chief Medical Officer said: I think there is a long list, actually, of things that we need to look at very seriously. If I was to choose one, it would probably be looking at how we could ... speed up testing very early on in the epidemic. Many of the problems that we have had came because we were unable to actually work out exactly where we were. Professor Whitty added it was important to learn lessons from what had happened in the outbreak. He warned there was a reasonable chance that the virus would have certain advantagesthere was a second wave in the winter. It is something that transmits more easily indoors and therefore things that are working well in summer and autumn may cease to be working as well in winter, he said. The nature of new epidemics is very often they come in waves circling around the world andwe get hit by another wave, at that point we need to understand better what is the optimal mix of things we could do. It came after a former top Government advisor said Britainaposs coronavirus death toll could have been halvedlockdown was introduced a week earlier. Britain has an official death toll from confirmed COVID- cases of over ,, rising to over , cases when deaths from suspected cases are included. Prime Minister Boris Johnson introduced the lockdown on March . Epidemiologist Neil Ferguson, who had to step down from scientic advisory group SAGE after breaking lockdown to meet a woman with from another household, told MPs that the UK had taken the right measures against Covid- but too late. He told the Science and Technology Committee: The epidemic was doubling every three to four days before lockdown interventions were introduced.So had we introduced lockdown measures a week earlier, we would have then reduced the final death toll by at least a half.  He went on: So whilst I think the measures ... were warranted ... certainly had we introduced them earlier, we would have seen many fewer deaths. At the No  briefing Mr Whitty declined to be drawn on a claim by Professor Neil Ferguson that the death rate could have been cut by halfthe country had gone into lockdown a week earlier. I think a iety of dferent people are going to come with dferent answers on the timing question, he said.

A single-adult household can form a bubble with one other household and act as though they live together, permanently. It means two households can finally break the two-metre rule to meet, laugh and love for the first time in almost three months. And some separated couples can finally reunite for overnight stays and sex. Boris Johnson announced the shake-up tonight as he unveiled separate changes from June  - including re-opening non-essential shops and zoos. It will be valuable respite to millions whose mental health has been stomped on by lockdown. But critics may warn itaposs far too soon as the UK still notches up hundreds of deaths per day. And the policy is strictly limited to certain situations - with other lockdown rules very much continuing as planned. That means it will leave some bizarre loopholes and many people will feel theyaposre left out. Meanwhile, million people who are shielding will be unable to benefit from forming a bubble with another household, for their own protection. Boris Johnson admitted people will find “anomalies” in “what people can and cannot do” - but that is “just inevitable”. So what exactly has been announced, who can benefit and how  Hereaposs a full explanation. What has Boris Johnson announced   From one minute past midnight this Saturday  June, two separate households in England will be allowed to join together in a “support bubble” under certain conditions. They won’t need to follow the two-metre rule - meaning they can hug, kiss, share childcare and meals, hang out indoors, stay the night and even have sex for the first time since March . “All of those who are in a support bubble will be able to act asthey live in the same household,” a No spokesman confirmed. It will be the first time in three months that dferent households have been given permission to break the two-metre social distancing rule. But there are strict conditions to this and it does not apply to all households.  One of the two households in each bubble must be a “single-adult household”. This means either a person who lives alone, or a single parent who lives with children under . The other household they are joining with can be of any size, and can have more than one adult in it. However, in total each bubble must only consist of two households - and each household must keep the arrangement “exclusive”. That means a person living alone cannot form multiple bubbles with multiple households. Likewise, a family cannot form multiple bubbles with more than one lonely relative. Where does the policy apply  Only in England. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland form their own rules.  Do both households have to be people living alone  No. Only one of the two households being joined together needs to be a “single-adult household”. As long as one household in a bubble fulfils this criteria, the other household is not limited in size.  No. “You can’t switch the household you’re in a bubble with or make a connection with multiple households,” a No spokesman said. This is because it would create chains of transmission that spread the virus through the community. Can aposshieldedapos people form a bubble   No. The million or so people in England who have been told to shielding because they are “extremely clinically vulnerable” cannot form a bubble. They are still advised to keep two metres apart from other households and avoid all social contact - advice which will last at least until June . They can leave the house, but only with members of their own household - orthey live alone, to meet one member of another household from m away. This is likely to create fresh frustration for the millions whoaposve been trapped indoors for medical reasons, living under dferent rules to the rest of the country. A No spokesman said: “Unfortunately we can’t advise anyone who is shielding to form a household bubble. “We do know how hard it is for people who are shielding and we’re keeping the advice under close review, but we’re not able to advise today that they could form a bubble.” Who will this help - and who won’t it help  HELPED: A widow aged  can go round her daughter’s house to stay with her daughter, son-in-law and three grandchildren. NOT HELPED: Two married grandparents, aged  and , can’t visit their daughter’s house to stay with their daughter, son-in-law and three grandchildren. HELPED: A single mum can go stay with her mum and dad to help with childcare. NOT HELPED: Married parents can’t go stay with the we’s mum and dad to help with childcare. HELPED: A -year-old man who lives alone in a bedsit can go stay with both his parents, who are married and live together. NOT HELPED: A -year-old man who lives in a house-share can’t go stay with his parents, who are married and live together. HELPED: A -year-old man who lives with his mates can stay the night with his -year-old girlfriend, who lives alone in her own flat. NOT HELPED: A -year-old man who lives with his mates can’t stay the night with his -year-old girlfriend, who lives with her mates too. HELPED: A lonely widow who wants to reunite with her -year-old daughter can have her round for the night. NOT HELPED: A lonely widow who wants to reunite with her -year-old daughter and -year-old son has to pick one of them to have round for the night. Whatboth sets of grandparents want to come and stay   Then you have a problem. The rules clearly state each household can only have a bubble with one other household. That meansyour maternal grandma and paternal grandma both live alone, and both want to see you… you have to pick one of them. One of them can form a “bubble” with you, come over, hug, eat and stay the night for months to come. The other one you have to see from two metres away in the park or garden. So it won’t help everyone  No. A No spokesman said: “We fully understand this isn’t going to help everyone, but it is a very targeted intervention there to support those who have been particularly isolated by the lockdown.” He added: “We know there are many lonely or isolated people as a result of the pandemic and the lockdown which has been in place and that is a particularly signicant issue for those people who live by themselves. “So we’re making this change to provide those people with additional support.” Does this affect current rules on meeting outside  No. This policy is separate to other current rules in England, which say you can meet in groups of up to six outdoors in a socially distanced way. That rule is unaffected by this new policy which is designed to let people meet indoors. How far away can each household in a bubble be  There is no limit - as long as it’s in England. The government asks people to stay local wherever possible, but understand there will be instances where they can’t do that. You don’t have to move in with the household you’ve formed a bubble with. Whatsomeone in the bubble gets sick  Once you’ve joined together in a “support bubble”, you must treat the rules as though you’re all in the same household. That means the moment one of you develops coronavirus symptoms, everyone in the support bubble must start self-isolating for  days. Will I be punished for setting up two bubbles at once   No. It will be taken on trust, like many of the other more complex lockdown rules. People will not have to fill out forms telling the authorities who they are forming a bubble with. What about children of orced parents  It remains the case that parents who are separated can continue to move children between households and share the care. These households are not prohibited from setting up support bubbles under the system. Put another way, the children of separated parents could potentially be in two support bubbles at once - one bubble for each parent. So does this all mean the end of the sex ban  "},{"url":null,"title":"fresh blow families summer holiday","story":"NewsFresh blow to families summer holiday hopes amid coronavirus crisisExperts told the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee a foreign break was \"not a good idea\" as the Covid- pandemic continuesShareCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy Political Editor:,  JUN NewsFamilies are still hoping for a summer getaway \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Their intervention came as lockdown-weary families continued to hope for a foreign getaway in July or August, after months of restrictions. Labour MP and committee chairwoman Yvette Cooper told scientists: “As we are approaching the summer holiday season, there is obviously huge pressure not just in the UK but in a lot of other European countries to have the tourist industry ing in some form this summer.” Epidemiologist Sir David Skegg, a former consultant to the World Health Organisation and to New Zealandaposs government, “wouldnapost recommend” Britons going on holiday abroad. “I can understand why people want to go on holiday,” he said. “A lot of people wish  hadnapost happened but the fact is that this virus is still with us and this year is going to be dferent from other years. “I canapost see mass tourism being a good option at the moment.” He added: “Iaposm certainly not in a hurry to book a holiday.” Highlighting the dangers of air travel during the pandemic, Sir David said flying was “potentially a great way of transmitting not just this virus but other infections as well – people are in close proximity, with air being recirculated, using the same toilets and so on”. Tory MP Adam Holloway told Professor Teo Yik-Ying, Dean of the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health at the Singapore National University: “There are a lot of people clamouring that people should be able to take summer holidays in countries with similar rates of infection –you think that sounds like a good idea ”  Prof Yik-Ying said: “No, it does not sound like a good idea.” Prof Gabriel Leung, Dean at Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine at Hong Kong University, warned: “If you donapost actually encourage or facilitate this mass market tourism then it would be safest – I think thataposs making a statement of the obvious. “Itaposs also very dficult to actually imagine that most of these tourists would be lying on private beaches. “What you can imagine is crowded beaches – but I canapost imagine anyone going on a holiday in any kind of destination where you go and enjoy the sun but do very good hand hygiene and put on a mask. “I canapost imagine people sitting around a pool and putting on a mask.” Insisting he “wouldn’t recommend” a foreign break, he went on: “Whatyou get sick while youaposre on holiday   “What about insurance coverage  Who is going to pay for the hospitalisation  “What happens to the rest of your family or your friends who have been travelling with you  “It is not at all clear – the responsibility, the coverage and the availability of care.” However, he said people “most exposed and most vulnerable” to the disease had “already been infected” in the first wave of Covid-. The Government hopes “air bridges” linking the UK to countries with low infection rates could help families enjoy a sunshine break. But Prof Leung warned: “One needs to be extremely aware of the complex web of interconnections, transits as well as connections beyond just air travel, where you have sea and land connections. “That kind of complex web needs to be taken into accountone is thinking about any kind of travel bubbles or air bridges.” Testing capacity would “need to be massively ramped up for any kind of cross-border travel – even within these travel bubbles or air bridges”, he added. The experts also hit out at the timing of Britainaposs quarantine regime, which only came into force this week.  Arrivals from abroad must self-isolate for a fortnight eventhey do not have symptoms. However, they can still use public transport to travel from air and ferry ports and can shop for food. Dozens of occupations are exempt from the curbs. “From the UKaposs point of view, it doesnapost seem very logical to me to be requiring a -day quarantine for people coming from countries with a much lower incidence and prevalence of Covid-,” Sir David said. “Itaposs not clear to me what the UK strategy is for dealing with this disease.” International Network for Government Science Advice vice-chairman, Prof James Wilsdon, believed Britain was in a “minority position” over the timing of its quarantine system. He said: “Where the UK does stand out clearly is in the relatively late introduction of these kinds of measures compared to other countries.” Ministers defended failing to introduce curbs on foreigners coming to the UK at the height of the outbreak by pointing to advice from the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergenciesthat the disease was already spreading in Britain and restrictions would have made little dference.

Sir Keir said the issues facing Downing Street on ensuring pupils were safe toto classrooms were entirely foreseeable and criticised the Prime Minister for failing to meet with opposition parties to put together a plan. There was no plan, no consensus, no leadership, he said in an article for the . Sir Keir said leaving children at home would be damaging not only to their learning but also their welfare. He said: We now have the ridiculous situation where next week betting shops and theme parks will open, but parents are not clear when their children will go back to school. The longer schools are shut, the greater the damage to childrenaposs wellbeing and education and the increasing pressure on parents who are having to juggle childcare and work commitments. The warning from the Childrenaposs Commissioner a few days ago could not have been starker: a generation of children now risk losing out on over six months of education. Bookmakers and non-essential shops are reopening on Monday providing they can safely stick to social distancing guidelines. The criticisms follow on from Sir Keiraposs pointed comments during Prime Ministeraposs Questions, during which he told Boris Johnson that parents had lost confidence in the Governmentaposs schools plan and warned that millions of children could miss six monthsapos worth of education.It is being reported that Boris Johnson is considering dropping the hotly-contested two metre social distancing rule over the summer to free schools to reopen by September.Education Secretary Gavin Williamson was forced to admit defeat this week over plans - set out in the Governmentaposs coronavirus recovery plan - for primary schools to fully reopen.Children in nursery, Reception, Year  and Year  in England began ing to primary school last week after the Government eased lockdown measures. But some schools said they did not have enough space on site to admit all pupils in the eligible year groups, while adhering to Government guidance to limit class sizes to  and encourage fewer interactions. At the Downing Street press conference on Wednesday, Mr Johnson acknowledged he was moving slower than we would have liked in some areas - but he said he wanted all pupils back in classrooms by September. But Sir Keir said that target was in danger of being misseda plan was not put in place soon. Without a plan, there is a risk that even by September many schools will not be able to reopen, and some children could be out of education for an entire year, the former director of public prosecutions said. He argued that creativity needed to be used to utilise the empty buildings across Britain, including theatres, museums and libraries, so they could be repurposed as makesht classrooms.

Campaigners, including the Childrensapos Commissioner, have warned that less well off children are going to be left further behind their rich peers unless something is done to close the gap. Yesterday, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson ditched a plan to get all primary pupils back into the classroom before the summer holidays. Ministers have been urged by some, including Conservative MPs, to look at introducing summer schools to help close this gap. But teaching unions have taken a skeptical approach and warned that putting children into an education setting over the summer could make things more dficult in the following academic year. One proposal has been to draft retired teachers to he[p staff the as yet theoretical summer schools. And while no details  have been announced, No  today refused to rule out asking former teachers toto the profession. A Downing Street spokesman said: “We are working to bring all children back in September and are considering what more is needed to support pupils.” Asked specically to rule out the move, the spokesman refused. He added: “We’ve also said we’re looking at what further support we can provide over the summer It came among calls for grade boundaries should be relaxed so more pupils who had exams cancelled amid the Covid- pandemic receive higher results, MPs have heard. Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union , said the move, which he acknowledged was controversial, was needed to ensure pupils are not unfairly disadvantaged this year. The call from the teachersapos union leader came after MPs and equality experts raised concerns over how the use of teacher-assessed grades this summer could disproportionately impact disadvantaged groups. Addressing a virtual Education Select Committee, Mr Courtney said: Ofqual needs to relax the grade boundaries. There needs to be more children getting all of the higher grades. Where there is doubt, somebody should move up a grade rather than moving down a grade. That will mean the exams will be regarded as not having the same rigour as the previous exam series, but I donapost see how  weaposre going to get through this. Lee Elliot Major, Professor of social mobility at the University of Exeter, has called for a systematic review of GCSE and A-level results once they are published to look at fairness among dferent groups. He said: I think the worry is that unintentionally teachers will underestimate, sometimes, the academic potential of poorer pupils, potentially those from black backgrounds, and potentially boys as well.  Professor Elliot Major told MPs that students who leave their revision right to the last minute are most likely to be penalised under the new system - including summer-born children who are less mature. The social mobility expert also warned of a tsunami of anxiety facing Year  and Year  pupils who are due to sit their GCSEs and A-levels next year despite schools and colleges being closed for  weeks. A combination of teacher assessments and core exams is needed to determine grades next year, he said. Addressing recent reports that students may see their summer exam series disrupted next year, Sally Collier, the chief regulator of Ofqual, said the Government was considering the impact on lost teaching. She told MPs that a consultation process on the  exam series is due in the coming weeks.

Backing this newspaperaposs drive, Treasury money-man Mr Sunak said: “I want to thank the Mirror for doing its bit to help British businesses get through these unprecedented times and urge all readers to back the Shop for Britain Campaign. “Our high streets are at the heart of our communities and will be vital in helping to kickstart the economy as we recover from the virus. “We as a government are doing everything we can to support British businesses through this dficult time, with billions of pounds of cash grants and loans, tax deferrals, and the furlough scheme – and now as the economy reopens, everyone can shop safely and show local businesses their support.” As non-essential stores reopen in England next week – marking the latest milestone on the UKaposs slow creep back to normality – we are urging people to make a conscious decision about where you shop and what you buy, in a bid to help businesses across Britain in tough times.

From midnight on Saturday June , single people living alone in England will be allowed to join together with one other household in a “support bubble” under certain conditions. They won’t need to follow the two-metre rule - meaning they can hug, kiss, share childcare and meals, hang out indoors and stay the night for the first time since March . This means some grandparents who have been separated from their loved ones for months can finally re-unite. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.    However, it doesnapost apply to everyone. A grandparent who lives alone would be able to form a bubble with the household of one of their children, which means they could see them and interact with their grandchildren as normal. But it will not apply to grandparents who live together because one of the two households in each bubble must be a “single-adult household”. This means either a person who lives alone, or a single parent who lives with children under . So grandparents who live together will only be able to see their grandchildrenthey are living with a single parent. The other household they are joining with can be of any size, and can have more than one adult in it. However, in total, each bubble must only consist of two households - and each household must keep the arrangement “exclusive”. This means some grandparents living alone will have to choose between their children and grandchildren that are old enough to no longer live with their parents until restrictions are eased further. Single people living alone will be able to see both their grandparents, but they will then be unable to see any other members of the family as the bubbles must be exclusive.Households with more than one adult can still not mix with one another without observing social distancing and staying outside. Meanwhile, the two million or so people in England who have been told to shield because they are “extremely clinically vulnerable” cannot form a bubble. So grandparents that fall into that category cannot take advantage of the new relaxation, eventhey live alone. The shielded are still advised to keep two metres apart from other households and avoid all social contact - advice which will last at least until June . They can leave the house, but only with members of their own household - orthey live alone, to meet one member of another household from m away.

Chloe Lloyd was driving home from her motheraposs with her eight-year-old daughter Lexi when her Vauxhall Astra left the road and crashed into a tree. She was speaking on a hands-free mobile to her boyfriend Domenico Gugliemucci when he heard a scream before the line went quiet. A worried Mr Gugliemucci rang Miss Lloydaposs mother Emma, who then drove in search of the -year-old and found her daughteraposs body and seriously injured grandchild.  Nurse who died with Covid- developed symptoms after sitting with positive patient Reading out Mr Gugliemucciaposs statement at the Bournemouth inquest, coroner Rachael Grfin said: Chloe said words to the effect of aposhow are you, and you sound tired apos He replied he was fine and asked hershe was driving back from her mumaposs  At which point he heard a scream from Chloe and then other distorted sounds. Then it went quiet, with the only sound the indicators. Miss Lloyd was pronounced dead at the scene on the A at Upton, Poole, Dorset, on January . Her daughter continues to recover from her injuries under the care of her grandparents after receiving emergency treatment in hospital. On the day of the tragic crash, the inquest heard Miss Lloyd had spent time with her mother and daughter before a meal with her father, Martyn. She was last seen alive at around .pm when she set off to drive home. Around  minutes later her parents received the devastating call from Mr Gugliemucci.  A statement from Miss Lloydaposs mother was also read out at the inquest. In the statement Mrs Lloyd said: After the meal Chloe and her father were messing about and joking with one another, as they usually did. She was happy and content and making plans for the future. A post mortem examination show Miss Lloyd, who held a driving licence for  years and had no endorsements, died from multiple injures. Further tests showed she had no alcohol or drugs in her system, and did not have any underlying health conditions. A police investigation found the car had no mechanical defects and that all four tyres were in a serviceable condition. Miss Lloydaposs mobile phone was in her handbag inside the car, connected to her hands-free system via bluetooth, police found. No other vehicles were involved in the collision and witness statements said that Miss Lloydaposs car just lost control, spun around and then careered off the carriageway and collided with the tree. Road conditions were good and police found no evidence of any object in the carriageway or even any animal in or by the side of the road.  Ms Grfin said: Iaposm satisfied from all the evidence before me that the cause of her death is as the result of injuries that Miss Lloyd sustained in a road traffic collision. Following a thorough investigation by Dorset Police they did not find any reason why Miss Floydaposs vehicle left the carriageway that day. She was not driving at excessive speed. There is no physical evidence to account for why her vehicle left the carriageway that day. I know that Chloe was on the phone, but it is clear she was acting within the law and using a hands-free device to make that call. That phone call was very short, her phone was found within her bag - so there was no evidence to suggest she had handled that telephone to make a call.

For the last two months, Natalie and four other volunteers have been forced to survive almost without any aid in one of the worldaposs most remote locations. Natalie and her fellow volunteers were due to be rescued on May  but were left devastated again when their boat was cancelled after Thailand extended its lockdown. The scuba er instructor, who should be back in Devon by now and working as a summer school teacher, is hopeful another boat will arrive to collect them later this month. However, her visa has expired and no new ones are being issued while the coronavirus pandemic holds the world in its grip. Natalie said: The hardest thing for me has been not knowing how long weaposre going to be here. Itaposs kind of up and down, weaposre a very small group of people and weaposre living in a very confined, close situation. In the back of our minds is obviously families back home and stuff, which adds to the tension a little bit. Weaposre just trying to take things day by day. But for now, the tiny group have had to do what they can to survive, using washed up bits of plastic to make their rainforest camp. They share the island with scorpions, snakes, mouse-deer, wild boar, monitor lizards, and slow lorises, and have to forage for most of their food, including yams, jackfruit and other vegetation. There have been sporadic deliveries by boat of food staples, including rice and pasta. But the group are conscious they have to make sure these last as they donapost know when the next one will arrive - and there have been plenty of days where they have gone hungry. Natalie said: We have to be very aware of how much we consume, we are eating very basic food and really having to make it last. Despite the desperate situation the group, which is made up of two women and three men from England, Hungary, Canada, Malaysia and France, find themselves in - they are not totally alone. There is one resort on Kyun Pila, Awei Pila, which is a  minute dinghy sail away and where they can access water, showers and accomodation on portable cabins, as well as a patchy wi signal. This has proved a leline for Natalie, who is concerned for her -year-old father, who lives in Poole in the UK. But the group, who are volunteers with environmental group Ocean Quest Global, have had to adapt quickly to spending so much extra time on the island. Their jungle camp has been constructed from washed up plastic, with each person living in a hut made from bamboo, rice sacks and bottles. They have even managed to erect furniture in their new Robinson Crusoe-inspired le, have dug a well, a fire pit and place to wash.The volunteers have also started planting their own vegetables. There are other challenges for the small group, existing in such extreme circumstances. Natalie explained: Usually in a programme like this there is a regular change of volunteers, which keeps things fresh and interesting, but the other three volunteers have been with each other a long time now and relationships are strained at times. Communal living is always a challenge because you get so little personal space and have to compromise a great deal. One person’s negative attitude or bad mood will affect everyone. The group has been forced to adapt to their change in circumstances, with people learning to hack jungle trails, drive a dingy and build with bamboo. Natalie has earned herself the nickname Trash Squirrel by spending her days combing the beach for washed up waste that can then be put to use to build the structures theyaposre calling home and to be turned into useful tools for surivival. But as spring slowly turns into summer Natalie and her fellow volunteers are facing a new challenge - the tropical rainy season. Already the clouds are coming in faster and the first few drops of rain have started to fall. They are working to do all they can to ensure they are as ready as possible for when the downpours do come.  However, Natalie is still hopeful that a rescue boat will come for them before the rainy season begins in earnest. She says it has also been a useful time for getting to know herself better. Natalie explained: I learned that no matter how Zen and chilled I had thought I was, in moments of solitude and dficult moments of physical and mental tiredness, I still lose control and stop being mindful and calm. That no matter how friendly and cheerful I usually am, when I am locked down on a relatively small island with strangers, I become moody, grumpy and little motivated.

Statues of slave traders are for the museums. Not for the streets of the UK. When I walk past such a statue I feel a bewilderment that we still pay homage to men whose reprehensible actions caused so much pain to my ancestors. Frustration too that, as in Bristol, councils refuse to listen to people who want to do things the right way by lobbying them with petitions to have these statues removed. If the authorities want to drag their heels, then last Sunday is what happens. Why was the statue up in the first place  Why would we immortalise anyone’s role in British or transatlantic slavery  Of course it should come down. All of it.The statue of another slaveholder, Robert Milligan, was removed amid clapping and cheering in London’s Docklands – near where I live – and, believe me, I was so there for that.

Rebecca Harper, , and Sam Harper, , from Fulham, escaped to the woodland tree house in the grounds of Samaposs dadaposs and step-mumaposs house in East Harptree in mid-March, just over a week before lockdown was announced. The couple, who have lived in the capital for a decade and work as chartered surveyors, initially planned to stay at the tree house for a couple of weeks but are still there over three months later after lockdown lasted longer than they expected. And they admit friends have been astounded by their sudden change of lestyle, with Rebecca, who now passes the days tending to their vegetable patch, confessing she struggled to keep a houseplant alive back in London. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.  She said: Our le here is the complete opposite of what it was like back in London. I wake up to natural light and spend my days tending to the vegetable patch then fill any spare time doing watercolour paintings and calligraphy. Itaposs idyllic here and Iaposm happier than ever.  In London, we led such busy lives. We were at workout classes or the gym first thing in the morning, then it was a -minute commute into central London and out for dinner with friends until pm or pm at night. Iaposve always been creative, but thereaposs much more time to pursue my hobbies now. I finally have time to do painting and Iaposve taken up knitting. Around dinner, weaposll go for walks in the surrounding countryside - itaposs so beautul.  Rebecca and Sam made the two-and-a-half-hour drive from their home to the tree house on March , just over a week before lockdown began on March .The ft high tree house is usually rented out as a luxury holiday home by Samaposs dad, Alan Harper, and step-mum Angela Harper, but coronavirus has forced them to temporarily cease letting the property to holidaymakers. Instead, Rebecca and Sam have been enjoying relaxing in the  sq ft woodland retreat, which is fitted-out with a log burner, dishwasher and William Holland copper bathtub and have been sharing their enviable lockdown le on their Instagram page @TreeHouseDiaries. And since moving to their tree house retreat, the couple have been joined by a third member of the family, nine-week-old Labrador puppy, Duke, who will accompany them when theyto London. Sam said: My favourite thing about being here is the simplicity of le and being able to switch off and relax. Thereaposs a sense of freedom here that you donapost get in London.  It has made us appreciate the things that we would pass every day in London, but not notice because we were too busy or distracted by something  going on. Rebecca added: It hasnapost been lonely. Lots of my friends canapost comprehend that we havenapost felt lonely or isolated, but it has brought us closer together. Weaposve been growing cucumber, radish and strawberries among other vegetables. We had our first harvest in the last week.  Back in London I canapost even keep a house plant alive. It has been such a transformation. With lockdown now easing the couple plan on remaining living in the tree house until the end of June, before ing to the hustle and bustle of the capital. The tree house will then open to visitors again provided lockdown restrictions remain ease and will soon be available to book through Canopy  Stars - a travel agency specialising in luxury camping. However, they say their time in the countryside has made them reassess their priorities and for Rebecca, their three months in the woods has brought back fond memories of growing up in the Warwickshire countryside. She said: Itaposs a bit like ing to my childhood being here. The last time I grew a runner bean was with my dad when I was young. Staying here has made us question what we have in London. Weaposll probably stay living in London, but we definitely want more nature around us in the future.

With just one week left for submissions to the ‘Hold Still’ competition, Kate urged the public to send in their pictures to add to , already submitted. The images are asked to represent the three core themes of the project - Helpers and Heroes Your New Normal and Acts of Kindness.The Duchess, , hopes the collection which will form part of a virtual exhibition with the National Portrait Gallery of which she is patron will symbolise the nation’s mood and feelings during the coronavirus crisis.In a video message to encourage more entries, Kate said: “There have been so many amazing entries to Hold Still over the last few weeks. “From families up and down the country showing how they are adapting to le during lockdown, through to some of the most amazing NHS and social care staff who are putting their lives on the line to save the lives of others. “But it isn’t too late to take part. “So please take a moment to capture what le is like for you, because together I hope that we can build a lasting illustration of just how our country pulled together during the pandemic.” Some of the submitted images include one titled Two Sleeping Colleagues Unmasked by Jane Roe - showing two exhausted nurses on the coronavirus front line, wearing intensive care branded unorms, asleep on a sofa. Another called Working From Home by Rosangela Borgese features a man with his back to the camera sitting at a computer while in the foreground a toddler lies sprawled on the ground surrounded by toys. One image chosen by Kate to highlight the project is of a hospital worker decked out in full PPE holding a newborn baby, titled Le Goes On by Matthew Williams. Another titled Glass Kisses by Steph James shows a young child looking at a grandparent through a window pane due to social distancing measures. Launched by the Duchess in collaboration with the National Portrait Gallery last month, Hold Still aims to create a collective portrait of lockdown in the UK, capturing the spirit, mood, hopes, fears and feelings of the nation as we continue to deal with the coronavirus outbreak. Anyone can submit their own photographs until pm on Thursday June  via the National Portrait Gallery website www.npg.org.uk hold-still Participants are encouraged to provide a short written statement to outline the experiences and emotions of those depicted in their photograph. One hundred shortlisted portraits will then be selected to feature in a gallery without walls – a one of a kind digital exhibition open to all. Each image will be assessed on the emotion and experience it conveys rather than its photographic quality or technical expertise.A senior palace source said: The Duchess has been inspired by many of the amazing feats accomplished by so many people that have brought Britain together. From incredible fundraiser Captain Tom to the daily bravery of our NHS workers. The overriding aim of the project is to bring together an unofficial national archive of the crisis, what has touched our everyday lives, the heroes behind the stories and images.

The disturbing incident took place hours after he brutally attacked her in a jealous rage after she innocently hugged another man, she told the Mirror. She claims he repeatedly slammed her head against a wall in the ladies toilets of the Algarve bar where she worked - leaving her a bloodied mess. When the woman ed home she had a “horrible feeling” someone was inside and found Brueckner under her bed. The -year-old believes the German was lying in wait to attack hershe brought another man back to her studio flat. But instead Brueckner, then aged in his late s, chillingly stared at her and said “goodbye” before fleeing.  She said he then embarked on a stalking campaign against the petite barmaid, leaving her too afraid to walk home alone. Portuguese police were twice called out to deal with Brueckner after she complained of the attack and stalking - but he was never charged. The  break-in has eery similarities with Madeleine’s disappearance two years later in nearby Praia da Luz, where he was living. Gerry McCann previously said he believed her abductor was hiding behind a door when he went to check on her. Investigators believe the person who took Madeleine broke into their holiday apartment through a window. The woman, who is still too scared of Brueckner to reveal her identity, today reveals her account of her relationship with the Madeleine suspect.  She tells the Mirror how the German: • Seduced her when they worked together waiting tables in an Algarve restaurant. • Flew into jealous rages when other men paid her attention or even spoke to her. • Branded her a “lazy Brit” when she refused his demands to clean his house. • Chillingly broke into her flat through an open window and hid under the bed after a bust-up. • Now believes her ex, who is in a German prison, could be responsible for Madeleine’s abduction. She said: “Until now I’ve refused to believe someone I was involved with could commit such a horrible and disgusting thing like hurting a child. “But I’m not sure anymore. I’m starting to wonderhe did do it. Andhe did, he needs to be really punished for it.  “It’s chilling to think my ex is suspected of abducting Madeleine McCann. I can’t cope with it.” The woman, from Berkshire, moved to the Algarve town of Lagos in late  after spending several years in the Netherlands. She landed a job in the Taberna de Lagos restaurant - now called Sal e Companhia - alongside Brueckner, a waiter who was two years her junior. “At first I didn’t actually like him that much,” she recalled in a softly-spoken southern accent. “Not for any reason, I just didn’t like him. “I was , he was a couple of years younger than me. Everyone called him Chris. “He liked me, I knew he liked me in ‘that’ way but I wasn’t interested. We slowly became friends in the spring of . “Chris could be very, very charming, very funny and very smooth in the way he talked. “He always dressed nicely, holding the door open for women, that kind of thing. “I was alone here in Portugal, no family around and a bit lonely and I was getting all this attention from this guy. “We got together romantically and at first it was great. The relationship was very nice.” The woman stayed over regularly at Brueckner’s rented farmhouse on the outskirts of Praia da Luz, less than a mile from the Ocean Club.  “I was living in a little flat by myself on the same road as the restaurant where we worked,” she said. “He was living in Luz in the house that has been on the news all week. He was living on his own. “He wasn’t sleazy in the beginning, he was very charming, even chivalrous. “He drove the nice car - the black Jaguar - and was very gentlemanly and spoke properly. “Our sex le was normal. He wasn’t into anything weird with me. “We used to go out to eat a lot. He wasn’t a veggie. He liked to eat Indian food. “He also liked German food. I remember in his house once he made strange German food that I didn’t like at all. “He liked taking me to the beach. He didn’t like the town beach in Lagos. It would always be the West coast beaches, the isolated ones. “He liked those because he didn’t like lots of crowds, that’s what he said. He didn’t like all the tourists in the summer. “At first he seemed very easy-going, very relaxed, but gradually after summer things changed. “During the summer it was good, but during the winter it started to get not so good.” Her first inkling that things were not right came when she bumped into a male friend in Lagos in late .  “We were chatting and suddenly he stopped talking to me, like he was spooked or suddenly remembered something,” she said. “Someone later told me Christian had previously threatened the guy because he’d seen us speaking before. “We also started to argue in the late autumn, early winter. “It would be small things. He would get angry about really small things and I would get upset. “I remember he lost it once because I didn’t clean his house. I said ‘I’ve got my own house to clean, I don’t live here.’ “He was like, ‘You should clean my house, you’re a woman’. “He said he had two Portuguese girlfriends before me and they both cleaned his house even though they never lived there. “I remember saying, ‘but I’m not Portuguese’, and he replied saying ‘English women are all lazy’. “He said he had seen an English girl for a little while and she was lazy like me. “He called her Carol, I think it was only for a few weeks, she was on holiday and they had a fling. “He started to get possessive but it wasn’t to my face, it was behind my back.  “He also began going back and forwards to Germany over that time. He’d stay one week in Germany, then back to Portugal. “I remember feeling suspicious, like something strange was going on, so I looked at his phone. “I found messages in German from someone called ‘B’ saying ‘Ich liebe dich’ - I love you. “It was a German number, and obviously he had been going back and forth to Germany, so I put two and two together. “I confronted him about those and he went crazy, completely crazy. We had a huge fight.” Worse was to come weeks later when Brueckner flew into his jealous rage at theBar - now called Little Breakfast - in the early hours of New Year’s Day. “I started New Year’s Eve working in Taberna de Lagos and then after midnight I worked at another bar,” she recalled. “Chris was at the bar and was drunk. “Some really nice guys I’d made friends with came in from the bar next door to say happy New Year and gave me a hug. “Chris just suddenly came round the bar in a crazy rage and dragged me out in front of everybody. “He grabbed me by the neck, pulled me into the girls toilets and was ramming my head against the wall. “There were people pulling him off me, I think it took four big guys to get him off me.  “They called the police and some officers came. I was on the floor and couldn’t move because I was in shock. “I didn’t talk to the police because I was scared of what he would doit meant he got arrested. “The police soon left after I said I didn’t want to deal with them. “I stayed there the rest of the night recovering and eventually two friends, a guy and his girlfriend, walked me back to my flat. “I went through the security gate and up two flights of stairs, into my flat and closed the door. “Something was really strange inside there. It’s hard to explain, something just felt strange. “I went into the bathroom and the toilet seat was up. I always put the toilet seat down, it’s what I do, so it was another clue. “I was sure someone was either in there or had been in there. “I started looking in the cupboards and then thought I’d check under the bed. “I peeked under and got the shock of my le. He was hiding under there, lying on his back, staring at me. “Can you imagine how that felt  I just froze. I didn’t know what he was going to do to me. “He got out from under the bed, acted like everything was normal, said goodbye to me, walked out and closed the door behind him. “I was there all alone, just shaking and shaking. “I think he was there waiting to see whether I brought anyone home with me. “To this day I still wonder what would have happenedI had brought someone back that night.  “I think, from the previous behaviour, he would have really, really hurt that person and me too.” Despite the vicious beating and break-in, she enraged her friends by rekindling their relationship weeks later. “A lot of people were very, very angry that I went back to him after what had happened on New Year’s Eve,” she admitted. “He begged for my forgiveness, saying he lost control because he was drunk and would not drink again. “He wasn’t a big drinker when we were together, so stupidly I believed him and we got back together with him. “But it was never the same.” The final straw came in mid- when she found women’s underwear in a bag belonging to Brueckner. “I found a pair of knickers that weren’t mine and I got really, really upset about that,” she said. “I confronted him about it at his place and again he went totally crazy. “He drove me back to Lagos. I got out of his car and that was it as far as I was concerned.” But Brueckner had other ideas and began stalking his ex and staking out the restaurant where she worked. “We had to call the police because he kept trying to get in,” she said. “He was stalking me constantly. “One day I was carrying a big tray of drinks and because I wouldn’t talk to him he knocked them out of my hand and they went everywhere. “The police were called and he was banned from coming inside.  “So he would wait outside and follow me. Sometimes it would be begging me to go back with him. “But other times it would be him threatening me or saying I’m going to find out where your parents are and do something to them. “People had to walk me home each night. There was someone each night. Eventually it stopped but it went on for a long while.” She told how Brueckner had a string of ‘relationships’ with older women that led her to believe he could be a gigolo. “There was one lady he used to take out to dinner sometimes, she was a bit older, and he said it was just for company,” she said. “There was another lady, she was much older and I think there may have been something going on between them. “He used to walk her dog and clean her apartment - at least that’s what he told me - and she gave him money for that. “She lived in the centre of town. He took me to her house a couple of times, to see her dog. “He used to go to people’s houses a lot, saying he was going to visit this person and that person. “But the more I think about it the more I wonder what  he was doing. “At the end of the day I never found out who the other underwear belonged to, or who ‘B’ was. “A friend of mine said to me she wonderedhe was some sort of gigolo, doing things for money with older women. “Looking back on it maybe I was very, very naive at that time. I was a lot younger, a lot more impressionable.” The woman moved on with her le but was stunned to get a visit from Portuguese police officers last year. They quizzed her about a rape Brueckner carried out on an American pensioner in Praia da Luz in , shortly after they split. But they never mentioned the Madeleine McCann investigation - even though British and German police already suspected his involvement. “I remember the Madeleine case. I remember being here in Portugal when it happened,” she said. “At first I thought they would find her, but they didn’t and then it became bigger and bigger. “The Portuguese police have spoken to me three times in the past year, but never once did they say it was about Madeleine. “They said it was about him, they were investigating him because they had found out he had raped an old lady in Luz in . “They wanted to know all about him. But I had no idea it was to do with Madeleine also. “They asked me what the relationship was like, what the sex le was like, how he treated me, how he treated women.

A new study, led by infectious disease expert Professor Oliver Pybus and published on Virological.org, analysed genomes of virus samples from , infected Brits. These were then compared to almost , SARS-CoV- samples from around the globe, with  per cent said to have originated in similar strains from Spain. Another  per cent came from France,  per cent from Belgium, and  per cent Italy, while just . per cent of the UKaposs cases came directly from China where the pandemic started, according to the study. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.  The virus is constantly mutating meaning scientists must compare current strains found in Britain with similar ones found where and earlier in the pandemic to estimate where they may have started. It comes as the Institute for Economics and Peacesaid on Wednesday the spread of Covid- was highly correlated with air travel - pointing the finger at Britainaposs constant flights in the early stages as having facilitated contagion. The UK Government’s policies on air travel have faced major criticism during the pandemic.  International arrivals have only been forced to enter a -day quarantine since Monday, but the Government previously resisted calls to restrict flights from high-risk countries. At the time, officials insisted there was no evidence that closing borders would be an effective measure. On March , just one day after the first death in the UK as a result of coronavirus, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government wasnapost considering limiting flights.  The Prof Pybus-led study - which is yet to be peer-reviewed - suggests most of the imported cases occurred in mid-March. However, the study rules out the prospect that Britainaposs crisis can all stem back to a apospatient zeroapos - rather multiple carriers must have introduced it to the country before it spiralled out of control.

Gemma Palmer had her lips injected with a full millilitre of lip filler - double her usual dose - after she trusted a local beautician. But she was left with a lopsided, swollen and painful mouth after the the liquid gathered together on the right side of her top lip. The -year-old had the fillers dissolved and she was pain free for eight months until her lip became hot and painful, doubled in size and then burst - a painful five times. Two years on and support worker Gemma said experts have told her they reckon lip filler is still trapped inside her face. The mum-of-one from Litherland, Lancashire, is awaiting specialist treatment to have it removed, and is warning other women of the dangers of fillers. Gemma said: It was horric, I was in so much pain both physically and mentally. My lip made me cry and I was so upset both before and after my lip exploded as the pain and the swelling affected my everyday le.  I was really scared and worried when my lip exploded - I was so anxious that it could leave me disfigured le. I felt so embarrassed and ashamed to leave my house and also embarrassed to tell people what exactly had happened. All together, Iaposve had about six weeks off of work because of the lip filler problems.  Gemma had previously had half a millilitre of lip filler injected in August  with no problems. Missing her plumped pout, she had her lips injected again in October , this time with a full millilitre of lip filler - and disastrous consequences. One week after her injection, Gemmaaposs lip filler clumped together in a painful lump on the right side of her top lip.  Her lip was so swollen and painful that she couldnapost eat anything but soup and after being unable to massage the filler out of her lip, Gemma was forced to eventually have her filler dissolved a week later. The clump in her lip was finally gone and Gemma ed to normal le but eight months later, her lip grew hot and swollen again in July . Gemma said: I was at home cleaning when I felt a burning sensation and throbbing in my lip.  I knew it was about to flare up again but hoped it would be ok by the morning - how wrong I was! I woke up and my lip had swollen up so much that I could hardly speak. It carried on swelling over the next couple of days until it finally popped open which was both disgusting and extremely painful. Gemma visited her local GP surgery but despite telling them about her previous problems with lip fillers, her issue was dismissed as a cold sore.Sent home with anti viral tablets, Gemmaaposs lip slowly cleared up over the next few weeks but sheaposs had the same problem come back every few months. She has now suffered with her lip swelling and exploding five times - most recently in March this year.  Gemma said: The pain gets more extreme every time and this time round has definitely been the worst. My whole mouth filled with blisters from the swelling which kept popping and filling my entire mouth with blood. I couldnapost eat, I was in constant pain. Tired of being dismissed by doctors she visited a private cosmetic surgery expert who finally told her why it was happening. She told me straight away that there was still lip filler trapped inside my top lip two years after I got injected, she said. She will be putting a dissolvant in my lip and then Iaposll be on antibiotics for a week and hopefully this will be the last time it happens.

The closures come  days after pupils in Reception, Year  and Year  were cleared toto primary school in England as the lockdown is eased. The government is under pressure to resume childrenaposs education after admitting that some pupils will not be able tountil September at the earliest.

The monarch picked out her most-loved steeds showing a deep personal connection to each one. Her choices include tributes to the memory of her late father George VI with Aureole which she inherited from the King, and the moment when her daughter Princess Anne won the European Eventing Championships on Doublet - a horse bred by Her Majesty. The head of state also chose the racehorse Estimate which triumphed in the Ascot Gold Cup, making her the first monarch to win the trophy. Others included Burmese, the mare she rode at Trooping the Colour for  years, her trusty fell pony Emma, and Sanction with whom the monarch had an almost telepathic bond. The Queen has long been known for her love of horses. She had her first riding lesson at the age of three, and now, at , was recently pictured on one of her fell ponies at Windsor while in lockdown. She selected eight special horses that she and her family have loved riding and watching, plus five of the most memorable racehorses of all time that she has bred and owned. The Queenaposs stud groom and manager at Windsor Castle, Terry Pendry, and John Warren, the Queenaposs bloodstock and racing adviser, provided insights into her choices, in consultation with the monarch for the feature in Horse  Hound magazine released today.  Mr Pendry paid tribute to the equestrian mastery of the monarch, who has bred racehorses, carriage horses, hunters, sports and riding horses, and polo ponies. Her knowledge and expertise is well known. She names all of her horses and ponies herself and can remember the parentage of every single one, he said. She still rides to this very day, and it is an important part of her le. Her Majesty has a fountain of knowledge in all things equine, you might say a living encyclopaedia.  Mr Warren heralded the Queenaposs patience as he told how she has continued to work on her understanding of equestrian matters over the decades. Her Majesty has developed a deep, profound knowledge, which she has consistently worked on and thought about throughout most of her le, he said. It takes the same sort of precise expertise as a watchmaker to produce a somewhat fragile racehorse to perform on the big occasions and indeed any occasion at all - especially when they are expected to race at speeds of up to mph. These incredibly highly charged creatures, full of blood and muscle, are developed from birth with kid gloves and the sophisticated jigsaw of trying to put all the pieces together is a constant challenge that continues to intrigue the Queen.  To deal with the constant challenges and disappointments, as all horse people will know, the greatest asset you need to have with horses is patience - which luckily the Queen has in spades. Here are the Queenaposs favourite horses: . BetsyA black-brown mare that Her Majesty used to ride in the s. Mr Pendry said: Betsy was full of character and spirit and much loved by the Queen.  . BurmeseBurmese was presented to Her Majesty in  by The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and the Queen rode the mare in Trooping the Colour for  years. . Doublet Bred as a polo pony, it was the horse Princess Anne won the European Eventing Championships with at Burghley in . Mr Pendry said: The Queen bred both the horse and the rider! . ColumbusThis horse was sired by Colonist, Winston Churchillaposs stallion.  Anne first evented Columbus at novice and intermediate level but found him too strong. He was also a favourite of Captain Mark Phillips and won Badminton in . Mr Pendry said: Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother always said he was the Grand National horse that never was. She would have loved him for herself. . SanctionSanction was a brown riding horse and a firm favourite for many years. Sanction was almost telepathic and had a very strong bond with Her Majesty... Sanction was the last home-bred horse that Her Majesty rode before making the decision to start riding native ponies.  A little closer to the ground, so to speak, Mr Pendry revealed. . Balmoral Jingle The Highland pony was a huge success in the show ring and eventually went on to become a broodmare at the Balmoral Stud. . Balmoral CurlewAnother favourite of the Highland ponies who was also a key show ring performer and became a broodmare. . Emma the Fell ponyA wonderful servant to Her Majesty and is still going strong at the age of  as one of the Queenaposs riding ponies, Mr Pendry said.  The Queenaposs top five favourite racehorses are: . AureoleAureole was bred by George VI and was the first horse the Queen inherited from her late father. Mr Warren said the memorable horse was the Queenaposs first top-class exciting racehorse, and although the animal was feisty and highly strung, the Queen knew how to get the best out of him. . DoutelleThe Chestnut stallion won many races for the Queen.  He retired to the Sandringham Stud but his career was cut short, dying at the age of only eight. . Highclere Another all-time favourite was Highclere, a Dual Classic winner, who was ridden to victory in both the  Guineas and Prix de Diane in Paris, In Paris, an enormous, delighted crowd chanted Vive La Reine after the win.. Phantom GoldWinner of the Ribblesdale at Royal Ascot, St Simon and Geoffrey Freer Stakes.

Buckingham Palace has released details of the Windsor Castle event that will see Her Majesty take two royal salutes from the Welsh Guards on Saturday. The head of state was last seen at a major event on March  when she attended the Westminster Abbey Commonwealth Day service with senior members of the monarchy and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who made their final appearance as working royals. Saturdayaposs ceremony will be carried out by a detachment from the st Battalion Welsh Guards, whose colour - or military flag - was due to be trooped this year at the Queenaposs Birthday Parade on Horse Guards in Whitehall. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.    Stationed at Windsor Castle, the servicemen have played a key role in the military response to the Covid- pandemic over the past few months. When the Queen arrives at the castleaposs quadrangle she will receive a royal salute which will be followed by a set of military drills and a musical performance by a Band of the Household Division. The drills will include the colour being paraded in front of the servicemen and the ceremony will end with a second royal salute followed by the Guardsmen and the military musicians marching from the quadrangle.  The ceremony is expected to last about  minutes and will see the Guardsmen performing their drills two metres apart with the military musicians also observing social distancing.

The former monarchaposs likeness, standing in a park in Leeds, also had the letters BLM - meaning Black Lives Matter - written on the stone base. The bronze monument also had coloniser and racist daubed on it. It comes amid calls to remove statues of slave traders, owners and colonialists. At the weekend a statue of slave trader Edward Colston was torn down during a demo in Bristol, while yesterday slaver Robert Milligan was removed from a podium in East London. The Queen Victoria statue, in Leedsapos Hyde Park, was unveiled in  and originally stood outside the town hall. Among those calling for statues to be removed across Britain is a group called Topple the Racists, which said: “We believe these statues and other memorials to slave-owners and colonialists need to be removed so that Britain can finally face the truth about its past – and how it shapes our present. “Statues are exercises of public adoration. And Edward Colston made his fortune in the slave trade.  “He was part of a system of mass murder, torture and human suffering. “We must learn from, not venerate, this terrible chapter in British colonial history.” Some people in the park have been posing with pictures of the defaced monument which also has words such as “murderer”, “justice” and “racist”.

There are a number of players we are looking at because we know what we need.“We are looking to strengthen the wider areas because we don’t have a lot in there at the minute.“We have a few young ones but senior-wise we only have Paul McMullan and Peter Pawlett.“We would like to add another couple because we feel moving up a level we need that pace in the wide areas to break teams and also to counter-attack at the many tough venues we will encounter next season.“They are all key areas we have been doing a lot of work on, looking at players and we are just waiting to make our move really.”Robbie Neilson admits Dundee United are already looking to snap up their next superstar-in-waiting\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-united-robbie-neilson-transfers embed # secretAGbVqRTtF\" data-secret\"AGbVqRTtF\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

By adding night-scented plants and soft lighting, along with pale-coloured flowers and foliage that appear to glow in the fading light, your garden will become an enticing ‘room’ to sit in at the end of the day.White flowering plants # like big blooms of hydrangeas # have a lovely glow in the evening garden reflecting the last of the light which makes them appear brighter than other plants.  Pale blues and lilacs also look their best in fading light, so sea holly with its tiny blue flowers that sit in rosettes of silvery-grey bracts is a great addition.Bright foliage also creates an evening glow in the garden. Light-coloured, iegated and silver leaf plants reflect any available light. Lambs Earis a popular ground cover plant that has the most wonderful soft, furry, silver-grey leaves.  It’s fairly drought resistant so a good choice for a dry, sunny border.Many beautul flowers only produce scent at night and often have a stronger aroma than their daytime counterparts.  Fragrance is released from night-scented flowers as the heat of the day lingers into the evening.  Petunias may seem be a strange choice for a night garden, but they are night scented. Some smell during the day, but not to the same intensity of the night scent. Night Scented Stocks do just that and have a pastel colour flower palate.It’s best to plant scented night garden flowers where you’ll brush against them or come close to them. Try planting them around doors and paths.  If you are planting in pots make sure you arrange them round seating areas to provide a heady aroma or position them near doors and windows so that the fragrance drts inside.Even though planting the right night-flowering plants in the right place will give you stunning effects,you want to really enjoy your garden after dark, some form of garden lighting is essential.  Try not to floodlight your entire garden. Instead, pick out specic plants and trees to showcase. Up lighting, either set on spikes or recessed into the ground, showcases plants beautully at night.But it’s not just at night time you want your garden to look good so here are some tips for this month from the Royal Horticultural Society."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 15 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A big thank you to whoever has tidied up Ardrishaig Community Garden, mown the grass and repaired and painted the fences.Such a peaceful place to call into while out exercising.

They are doing the same to support other temporary NHS services across Scotland.Our people have worked around the clock with health boards across the country to offer new, technical solutions to help frontline health workers get on with their jobs during this crisis.Our frontline staff in contact centres across Scotland – including Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow and Greenock – have risen to this unprecedented challenge. We’ve received a huge surge of customers asking for faster connections to help with home working, home schooling and running their businesses remotely.These colleagues – most of whom can now work from home when they want to – have performed a critical role keeping our customers, including frontline health workers and vulnerable people, connected.The people in our two  contact centres in Scotland are also playing a critical role, answering lesaving emergency calls.I couldn’t be more proud of how my colleagues have responded to these challenges and their desire to help us all through this crisis.Jane Wood, BT Group director in Scotland, Edinburgh.COVID- is seriously not a jokeGlobally kills thousands of folkYou start coughing, you can#t breatheWithout a respirator, this earth you#ll leaveSocial distancing is now in placeKeep two metres apart, not face to faceWash your hands frequently and well hours on surfaces it can dwellShop infrequently, for essentials onlyDon#t mix with othersyou#re lonelyKeep in touch by text and phoneDon#t put yourself at risk, stay aloneIt#s hoped soon this contagion will peakThen we canto normal, so to speakDon#t travel to other towns by carIt can spread the virus near and farSports, socialising and most work on holdThe alternative could cause damage untoldSupport the NHS, essential workers and neighboursThen we#ll defeat this virus by all our laboursDugald MacGilp, Lochgilphead.Sir,We are looking for people who have the passion to bring communities together, believe in the power of co-operation and who hold the well-being of their community at the forefront of their mind.The successful #Member Pioneers# will receive full training and business support as they help groups and iniduals during the coronavirus pandemic and beyond.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear. Its soft, downy, furry silver-grey leaves are a favourite among gardeners who tend to use it for ground cover in rich soil. As a contrast there is Acuba japonicawhich has smooth, glossy leathery leaves.Flowers # who can resist touching a bottlebrush Callistemon cintrinus – bundles of tiny delicate stamen flowers form a brush that’s soft to touch – or the soft paper-thin petals of a poppy Papaver orientale.Grasses # run your hand over the arching, thread-like leaves of feathery Stipa tenuissima also known as Mexican feather grass or the more robust drought proof ornamental Festuca glauca with thread-like blue foliage that forms dense mounds.Bark – tree bark can also provide a tactile experience especially when it’s the stunning flowering cherry Prunus serrulate with mahogany coloured bark that peels away in bands round the trunk.Landscaping – you can easily y the textures in your garden by choosing dferent hard landscaping options. If you have smooth pebbles surrounding a water feature that you can run your hand over and through, you could place lichen-covered rocks in another area of the garden.Our general well-being is intrinsically linked to the natural world which is why Thrive – the gardening for health charity – has developed the Thrive Gardening Club.For fortnightly tips on getting the most out of your garden, whatever your age or ability, and information on how gardening can keep you healthy and feeling good visit www.thrive.org.uk get-involved keep-in-touch subscribe-to-gardening-clubThrive is the UK’s leading provider of social and therapeutic horticulture programmes using gardening to bring about positive changes in the lives of people living with disabilities, ill health or mental health issues, or who are isolated, disadvantaged or vulnerable."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 22 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Mental Health Awareness Week, now in its th year, runs from May  to May .This year, the theme for the week is kindness and across the country, people will be celebrating kindness in digital and creative ways within social distancing restrictions.The last couple of months, with all the uncertainty of the virus and the impact of lockdown, have been an extremely stressful and worrying time for many people across the Highlands and Islands. People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

any chance of a physical gathering, the showcase ndash which was originally planned for this weekend ndash is set to take a virtual form.Beginning on July , authors will star in events available for streaming from the festival website.Moffat is still in the middle of booking guests, but he has already snapped up some well-known figures, as ever.ldquoIn a way, itrsquos easier for people, he says,

triumph over the obstacles posed by COVID-.But back in March, when the virus began to take hold in Britain, a sense of despondency hung over the group.ldquoWe were absolutely heartbroken, because virtually all of our work had been done by then, says Moffat.As it became clearer that a physical event would not be possible, Moffat and his colleagues realigned their ambitions and channelled their energies into simply making sure that the festival would survive.To Moffatrsquos relief, the idea of an online version found favour with sponsors and the Friends of the Festival.ldquoOnly three people wanted their money back and whatrsquos amazing is we had a tsunami of supportive emails from the public, says Moffat, calling the response ldquovery moving.Everyone will be able to watch the streamed events without paying a penny, says Moffat, with viewers merely invited to make a donationthey can afford it.ldquoSome festivals have charged for these things, but we donrsquot think thatrsquos right, says Kelso-born Moffat, himself an author of more than  books.ldquoWersquoll invite people to donatethey wish, but these are hard times ndash people need to put food on the table.Notwithstanding his delight at being able to run the festival this year, despite the dficult conditions, Moffat is already looking forward to theof a physical format.ldquoTherersquos nothing like being in the same place as Melvyn Bragg or Joanna Lumley or Gordon Brown and being able to ask them questions, says Moffat.,params: .pushThe appeal of the Borders Book Festival, according to its founder, lies in the eventrsquos ldquosociability.ldquoThe famous people are not all herded off into a sealed container ndash theyrsquore there to talk to you, says Moffat.ldquoPeople who are extremely well-known, that all peels away and wersquoll see them standing chatting.Which brings us neatly to comedy twosome Ant and Dec, the showbiz stars whose presence Moffat so dearly craves.ldquoWhat people would see from Ant and Dec is just something completely dferent, he says, admiringly, having known the TV personalities for many years.The pair have a book coming out this year, according to Moffat ndash so perhaps his dream might yet come true.Full details of the virtual events, set to run for  weeks, will be published at:

Frameworkdocument to a wider area in its planned revised framework which is under review.This could pave the way for the creation of the ClimatEvolution Zone which could transform the area over the

travel.It asks people to give their views on its approach to a wide range of issues including access and movement the water environment culture, heritage and leisure greenspace and bioersity strong communities and regeneration and enterprise.However, the vision has already come under fire from Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council which branded it ldquocomplex and unclear.The community council warned that the launch of a new vision for the area three years after the local authority produced its Cockenzie Masterplan document ndash which it has never adopted ndash would leave the public with no confidence in the planning system.East Lothian Council paid consultants to produce the Cockenzie Masterplan for the former Cockenzie Power Station site, which it owns, after a series of public consultations in  but the report remains an informal ldquovisionary document.Now the former power station site could be merged into the new ClimatEvolution Zone with no reference to the original masterplan.Bryan Hickman, community council chairman, said: ldquoThe community council are very concerned by the documents recently published by the council.\"We understood that the changes required for NPF related to the former power station site.\"The y report now extends to Tranent, Prestonpans, Cockenzie and Port Seton, Longniddry and Blindwells as well as the power station site.\"Whilst some of the objectives are to be welcomed, the overall content is complex and unclear and includes such a large area as to be unmanageable in its detail.ldquoThe existing communities have been consulted on the power station site and the result was a masterplan commissioned by the council but not adopted by them.\"We have submitted this masterplan to be included in NPF.\"A number of consultations have taken place in our area and they have come to nothing.\"The feeling is the residents have lost confidence in the system.Neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council also raised concerns about the consultation.Brian Weddell, chairman, questioned whether the proposed train station in the new plan would ever happen, saying: ldquoThere has been no meaningful consultation with local communities who all have concerns about the impact of this development on their communities.The new consultation is based around a study, drawn up in partnership with East Lothian Council, the Scottish Government, The Lothian Drainage Partnership, SEPA, Scottish Water and Scottish Natural Heritage.It considers how the council can take the opportunity of creating a new town at Blindwells and harness the latest technologies to reduce the arearsquos carbon footprint.Among the ideas up for discussion is using groundwater at Blindwells to create waterways and using natural geothermic energy to heat the outdoor water features.Douglas Proudfoot, project leader, said the idea behind the new water features was to avoid putting pipes underground to remove groundwater and utilise it instead as

Hotels require one space per room.I understand that the parking standards have only recently come into effect and all other licensed premises have the benefit of being historical licensed premises and therefore protected. However, I fully believe that a common sense approach should have been taken in this instance, particularly as I submitted a very detailed travel plan which included not only promoting nearby parking options, bus timetables and taxis but actually incentivised travel to and from The Catrsquos Pyjamas by bus, taxi or on foot. When coming up with the concept of The Catrsquos Pyjamas in late summer early autumn  the first thing I did, being a total novice to owning a bar, was to engage with the licensing department.The licensing standards officer advised me I could operate with occasional licences whilst working toward the full premises licence so after submitting the occasional licence applications I was surprised to be told by planning I needed to submit a change of use application for the occasional licences.Bewildered by the conflicting information but just wishing to do what was required, I immediately submitted the application and paid the associated fee.It is frustrating that I was erroneously informed that a change of use was required for occasional licences which stopped me operating and establishing precedent.It is also frustrating I find myself in this situation because I accepted the advice and guidance of East Lothian Council. I am not seeking to apportion all the blame on the council as I have made mistakes, the biggest of which is being naive enough to believe that those who should have and give you the correct information actually do have and give you the correct information. What we have created at The Catrsquos Pyjamas is truly special. Those who have enjoyed an evening with us will validate that.I have had such incredible support from people across Dunbar and beyond that it continues to blow my mind. There is a real desire for The Catrsquos Pyjamas to work and given the chance it could become something truly amazing which is beneficial not only to the town but the county. But this journey has been very painful and costly.There has been a clear campaign against The Catrsquos Pyjamas to the point of it being a vendetta.Objectors have ly contacted the police to report noise when there was none ndash veried by Police Scotland ndash just to get it on the record ahead of the licensing board hearing. I need to take time to reflect on everything that has happened, to reflect on the impact that it has had on myself and my family. I need to investigate whether another location would be better orthe business model should change.At the moment all I can say is sincere thank you to everyone who has supported this venture from the outset and especially to my family for all the blood, sweat, tears and cash they have put into creating this very special place.Ross Hardie,The Catrsquos Pyjamas,Belhaven,Dunbar"},{"url":null,"title":"kids-create-chain-key-workers-tesco-superstore","story":"They were asked to create a window display for the store by its community champion, Jane Shepherd, and were rewarded with some treats.The hub, based at Pinkie St Peterrsquos Primary School, provides learning and childcare.

They are a giant of nature, yet also incredibly intelligent. They feel emotion like we do, in fact possibly more so as the emotional part of their brain is even more developed than that of humans.The old saying that ldquoan elephant never forgets is rooted in this fact. An elephantrsquos emotional intelligence comes from its ability to remember and recall distant memory. Like humans, an elephantrsquos way of being is mostly learned in early le, rather than just based on instinct.They are therefore highly sensitive creatures, influenced and affected by what they experience just as we are.Irsquove heard dferent versions of this tale, and here I have peppered it very slightly with my own style:Once, a king in ancient India owned an elephant. This royal elephant was the joy not just of the king, but also his people.The trainer would ride the elephant every day along the streets. She was a magnicent sight, and children would run out to wave and watch the elephant go by. The trainer took a dferent route each day so people in dferent neighbourhoods all had a chance to enjoy the spectacle.The people felt a real love and affinity for the elephant. Despite her size and strength, she was gentle and affectionate with the people. She would pat children carefully on their heads with her trunk and took care in where she walked.The elephant made people feel safe. More than once she had saved a child from drowning in the nearby river, or from a predator from the jungle. She was a sacred animal to the people.But then people began to notice a change in the elephantrsquos behaviour. She became aggressive and unpredictable. Instead of being patient with the children she knocked them out of her way with her trunk. Instead of being careful where she walked, she deliberately trampled on peoplersquos gardens.The trainer tried his best to control the elephant, but she seemed like a dferent animal. He couldnrsquot understand why she was behaving so dferently.It just got worse, until one day the elephant suddenly set off on a charge and rampaged through the streets, trumpeting loudly as she charged at the terried people, almost killing some of them.The king was horried and ordered the elephant to be confined to her stables. With dficulty she was finally brought under control and locked in.ldquoWhat is going on  asked the king to the trainer.ldquoI have no idea your majesty he replied, ldquoitrsquos asshe is a dferent elephant.ldquoPerhaps the elephant is ill in some way  suggested one of the kingrsquos advisors. But the vet found nothing physically wrong.Then the trainer suggested asking an old man who lived in the jungle as ldquohe is known for his wisdom in understanding animals, perhaps he will know what the cause of this is.So the king sent a messenger and the old man came to the royal palace.ldquoCan you help  asked the king.The old man asked to be left alone with the elephant for a while.When he ed he looked at the king and said: ldquoWhatever is wrong is something that cannot be seen. I must spend some time with the elephant to understand what is troubling her.And so the old man decided to watch over the elephant that night. He smeared himself in mud to mask his scent and hid in a corner of the stable.It was late evening when he heard voices.A group of men had entered the stables from a small side door. They were a gang of murderers. They were using the royal elephant stable as a place to meet and plan their activities. And in so doing they recounted stories of their deeds.Their leader was a man with a cold and ruthless heart. He told stories about his le and deeds, of how hersquod murdered and tortured people he didnrsquot like. Members of his gang laughed and shared their tales too, likewise full of hatred and cruelty.The elephant slumbered as these tales were told, but they were unknowingly heard by her. When the elephant woke the following morning, the tales of hate and violence still swirled in her mind.The old man went to the king.ldquoYour majesty, there are two things you must do to cure the elephant.ldquoThe first is to remove the murderers who meet in the stables at night. The second is you must find the kindest people, who live their lives with love and understanding. Then ask them to meet at night in the stable as the elephant sleeps and tell each other stories from their lives tales of love and understanding. If you do this, then the elephant will be cured.The king looked bemused.ldquoI will most certainly remove the murderers, he said, ldquobut are you saying that stories will cure the elephant ldquoYes, your majesty, replied the old man, ldquobut the right stories. You see we are made from the stories we hear.He went on: ldquoIf we constantly hear tales of hatred and violence then those stories paint our vision of le with fear, loathing and cruelty.ldquoButwe mostly hear tales of love and understanding, then our mind is coloured with kindness for others, and for ourselves.ldquoWe are affected by the stories we hear, evenwe donrsquot realise we have been listening to them.ldquoYour elephant was unknowingly listening to tales of hatred and killing every night as she slept. So her mind was filled with hate and distrust her vision of the world changed and so did her behaviour.ldquoIf she hears good stories then she will eventually become her kind self again.The king nodded in understanding and agreed to act on this. Within a few weeks the elephantrsquos behaviour had changed for the better.ldquoYou are indeed wise in the ways of elephants, the king said to the old man.ldquoThe truth in this is not just for elephants, the old man replied.ldquoPeople are like your elephant the stories they hear will paint their world and affect how they live in it.The king nodded once again.ldquoMy job is done, said the old man, ldquoI will nowto the forest.ldquoBy the way, your elephant will have a calf, and her calf must hear good stories too.ldquoHow can I pay you for your wisdom  asked the king.The old man thought for a moment, then said: ldquoBe a king who tells good stories tales of kindness and understanding. And be a good listener to the stories told by your people.ldquoThen you will be a truly great leader and your kingdom will flourish and be a happier place.ldquoIf you do that, it will be my greatest reward."},{"url":null,"title":"strawberry-moon-2020-time-see-skies-uk","story":"The Strawberry Moon coincideswith summer solstice once every  years when the moon is situated on the opposite side of the Earth as the Sun - whichfully illuminates its round shape.Unfortunately, despite its fruity name, the moon may notappear in warm colours as we would expect.The lunar event got its name fromNative American tribes, who used the moon to help them indicate when fruit would be ripened.What does NASA say about the Strawberry Moon As described by NASA: ldquoThe Maine Farmers Almanac first published Indian names for the full moons in the s.ldquoAccording to this almanac, the full moon in June or the last full Moon of spring is known as the Strawberry Moon, a name universal to just about every Algonquin tribe.ldquoThe name comes from the relatively short season for harvesting strawberries in northeastern North America.The Strawberry Moon has also been referred to as the Hot Moon.So, when can I see it You can expect to see the spectacular lunar event at about .pm BST tonight .According to the Royal Greenwich Observatory in London, the Strawberry Moon will last for up to three orfour days."},{"url":null,"title":"black-lives-matter-donate-help-get-diverse-books-primary-schools","story":"The fund -which has raised over pound, since it was created on Wednesday, June  - aims to help black, Asian and minority ethnicstudents to feel represented by their school libraries.The initiative was inspired by protests that have taken place across the world calling for justice after the death of George Floyd, who died in police custody in Minneapolis on May .Who created the fund Scott Emmons, who created the fund, told the PA news agency:ldquoTherersquos a lack of books in primary schools where not only can teachers teach the white students about these issues, but also the BAME students are severely under-represented in the books that they have.\"Mr Emmons, , who lives in Wanstead, added: ldquoI went to the protest on Wednesday in Hyde Park and came away feeling so energised.

These restrictions are severe and place Scotlandrsquos island communities and tourism enterprises out of kilter with the rest of the country.:Scottish tourism at risk of total collapseldquoIt will not be financially viable to open most tourism businesses with no tourism customer base and we have ready examples to share of businesses that will be forced to make island staff redundant and that will collapse or go into administration and not survive this pandemic.ldquoMany of these businesses are not just for tourists ndash they play a key part in the le and health of locals year-round, are community hubs and support other businesses through local supply chains. The tourism income makes them viable, and without it they will struggle to survive as business entities - with all the serious socio-economic implications this will bring for the inidual island economies.\"He added: ldquoMany of these businesses have fallen through the cracks in support being made available to date. They are fearful that they will get further into debt and collapse. We cannot overstress the anxiety being experienced as a consequence of these new circumstances.ldquoThe islands are being penalised and we believe unnecessarily.

What can be done to make this fair across Scotland :Nicola Sturgeon: Relaxing two-metre rule would likely need stricter face covering guidanceAt her daily briefing, Nicola Sturgeon stressed that there was no scientic evidence to suggest that the two-metre rule can be relaxed.She added: ldquoI understand the challenges that all businesses are going to face in adapting to the Covid world that we are going to be living in for some time.ldquoTo become operational while not allowing the virus to spread is not going to be easy and we are talking to businesses across all sectors of the economy as we work to put guidance in place for how they do that ndash clearly, thatrsquos going to be more dficult in some sectors than it will be in others.ldquoI have had no advice given to me and to the best of my knowledge, although I obviously donrsquot see all the advice that the UK Government gets, Irsquove not seen anything they have had that would advise a change in the two-metre rule right now.

It only came to light following a BBC investigation last month.Dr Smith said genetic analysis had linked a further three possible cases to the conference, but two have now been discounted while the third ldquoshows similarities with those associated with the conference, but no direct or indirect link to the conference has been established.He added: ldquoAll show similarities with a viral lineage found in continental Europe.ldquoHowever, this particular sub-lineage has not been detected in Scotland since the end of March.ldquoThis suggests that the actions taken by the [infection management team] were successful in curtailing spread and have led to the eradication of this particular viral lineage, with no evidence of any wider outbreak associated with it in Scotland since that time.: Edinburgh doctors see big drop in broken bones from assualts and road collisions since start of CovidIt comes as a study from Hard Medical School suggested that the new virus could have emerged in Wuhan, China as far back as September or October last year, based on a ldquodramatic increase in traffic to the cityrsquos major hospitals around that time, and a spike in queries on a Chinese internet for ldquocertain symptoms that would later be determined as closely associated with the novel coronavirus.China did not formally noty the World Health Organization of the new disease until December .Meanwhile, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon stressed that Scotland is continuing to see a ldquoclear downward trend in Covid deaths.

If there was a button marked ldquoreset, many millions of Americans might rush to press it. Erase the last four years, months, weeks, days, hours. Restore Americarsquos factory settings, because something has gone catastrophically awry.The duff sloganeering was not the worst offence the President committed on Twitter. By many a mile that title went to his musings on Martin Gugino, the -year-old who was shoved by police during a protest in Buffalo, New York, over the death of George Floyd.Mr Gugino fell, cracking his head, and as his blood poured on to the pavement the police walked on by. The incident was captured on video. Two policeman have been charged.The presidentrsquos take on this  Mr Gugino ldquocould be a hard left ldquoprovocateur who was carrying a scanner to block out police communications . ldquoI watched, said Mr Trump. ldquohe fell harder than he was pushed. Was aiming scanner. Could be a set up Mr Guginorsquos lawyer called this a ldquoa dark, dangerous and untrue accusation. If you wanted a response red hot with fury one could turn to Andrew Cuomo, the Governor of New York. He thought nothing the President might say on Twitter could surprise him any more. He was wrong. ldquoHow reckless, he said of the Gugino accusation. ldquoHow irresponsible. How mean. How crude. If there was ever a reprehensible, dumb comment hellip and this from the President of the US. Earlier, Mr Cuomo summed up the bewilderment of many when he asked simply, ldquoHow did we get to this place Good question, depressing answers. The appalling treatment of African-Americans did not start with Mr Trump. Nor was he responsible for a virus that has cruelly laid bare the failings of the country, not least in healthcare, and the inequalities that persist.: Letters - leave the statuesBut as the President that famous buck has to stop with him. It would be a test of even the greatest American leader at any time. One can only wonder what a Johnson, or an FDR, would do. That it falls to Mr Trump to act, and in an election year, lays the ground for troubled times to come.It has been a politically disastrous couple of weeks for the President. The events and images have been shocking. A man dying in the street at the hands of police. Peaceful protestors being tear-gassed and beaten so their commander-in-chief could walk from the White House and hold a bible aloft. A security fence erected in front of the White House, something that was not necessary during the worst civil unrest of the s. Threatening to use soldiers against lawful protesters, and being castigated by a former Defence Secretary for doing so. Tales of a president fleeing to a White House bunker. All of it dreadful, much of it used against America by its opponents.Even Mr Trump, a man who never met a setback he did not try to spin, has had trouble ignoring the plummeting poll ratings that have resulted. In a CNN poll published on Monday, % disapproved of his performance as president, with % approving. Those are the kind of numbers Jimmy Carter and fellow one term President George HW Bush racked up.Overall, the incumbent is  points behind his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden. In what should be further cause for alarm, Mr Trumprsquos support among white voters without degrees is falling, and his problem with women has grown worse. In  he was  points behind with women voters. A recent poll put him  points behind.As ever with the defensive Mr Trump, his instinct is to go on the attack. That could signal more sackings, more likely it will mean getting back on the rally circuit, the place he feels comfortable and wanted.His supporters argue the Black Lives Matter protests, which brought hundreds of thousands on to the streets, are a green light for the Trump rallies to restart. The president has suggested the first event could even be as soon as next week. This at a time when , Americans have died from Covid-, and when the White House infectious diseases adviser, Dr Anthony Fauci, has warned the pandemic ldquoisnrsquot over yet.: The truth about Scotlands slaving pastJust when the US might benefit from devoting its considerable energies into tackling its policing and race relations crises, or even simply pausing for a period of reflection after a dreadful start to the year, the President will in effect be firing the starting gun in the race to the White House.Judging by their advertising, both sides will be using the recent protests to boost their arguments. Mr Trump knows it worked for Richard Nixon in , but he was not the incumbent. It is a tactic fraught with danger in as much as it risks fuelling further tension and ision, the last thing the country needs.We know from past experience the kind of candidate Mr Trump becomes when he fronts one of his rallies. Crowds chanting for Hillary Clinton to be locked up, the mocking of a disabled reporter, the harassment of the press his rallies in the run up to the  election set a sour tone for his presidency from the off. Who will be the scapegoats this time Mr Trump could do with some wise counsel at this point, but that looks in desperately short supply, not least from his own party. Too many Republican candidates are afraid to criticise Mr Trump lest his base turns against them. But as of now he has shown himself unwilling to listen to anyone .Whatever campaign slogan he settles on, Mr Trump will doubtless position himself as the man to save America. Who will save America from Mr Trump is the question his Republican colleagues should be asking themselves.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

This is especially true of the capacities on our ferries as it will signicantly impact island economies where tourism is the leblood for so many.ldquoWhilst the package of grant support which has already made available to many small tourism businesses by the UK and Scottish Governments has been hugely welcomed, there remains a good number still in need of immediate grant support to enable them to be in the best possible position to open on  July.ldquoA longer-term support package for the sector will definitely be needed to ensure the survival of many businesses over the coming nine months.

Looking at excess death rates, more than , people have died at this time this year compared to the same time last year.When asked what had gone wrong, Prof Ferguson said: ldquoI think two things ndash one is a paper actually out in Nature, which highlights that around about that time, just before lockdown happened, the first two weeks of March, we probably had , to , infections imported from Italy and Spain, which we just hadnrsquot seen in the surveillance data, until that point.ldquoSo there is much heavier seeding than wersquod expected.He added: ldquoThe key things to determine number of deaths is at what point in your local epidemic you trigger interventions ndash how far in are you when you shut down transmission.ldquoAnd we frankly had underestimated how far into the epidemic this country was, thatrsquos half the reason.ldquoThe second part, which I think would have been more avoidable, is about half of those deaths occurred in care homes.Prof Ferguson continued: ldquoAnd we did all this working under the assumption which was Government policy at the time that care homes would be shielded from infection.He further told the committee: ldquoWe also made a rather optimistic assumption that somehow ndash which was policy ndash that the elderly would be shielded, the most vulnerable would be shielded as the top priority. And that simply failed to happen.Prof Ferguson, whose research helped usher in the lockdown, resigned from his role as a key Government adviser after admitting that he had undermined social distancing rules by reportedly meeting a woman at his home.However, he told the committee he still sits on SPI-M, which advises the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies .Prof Ferguson told the committee that despite border screening at the early stage of the pandemic, probably % of cases imported into the country were missed because checks were not being conducted on people arriving from Europe.Greg Clark, chairman of the committee, asked Prof Fergusonthat was because Sage had advised that it was not necessary to test those people.Prof Ferguson said: ldquoThis is really decisions by the Foreign Office and by the Department of Health and Social Care, not by Sage.ldquoSage recommended that where a country had been identied as having an active transmission, we should check travellers from those countries.He added that the dficulty was that Spain and Italy ndash the source of many infections into the UK ndash had large epidemics before they realised.ldquoWe were just not aware of the scale of transmission in Europe as a whole, Prof Ferguson said.The committee also heard that had the UK had the testing capacity at that stage, then at least screening everybody with symptoms arriving in the country would have given a better impression of where infection was coming from.:Scotlands tourism industry, pubs and restaurants set to re-open for business on July The Imperial College Covid- response team called for a full-scale lockdown in a paper on March  ndash seven days before it was implemented in the UK.When askedhe was disappointed in the delay, Prof Ferguson said: ldquoI said earlier, but in retrospect I would have much preferred it to have been taken a week earlier given that many lives would have been saved.Prof Fergusonrsquos comments were put to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, chief scientic adviser Sir Patrick Vallance, and chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty at the daily Downing Street press conference.Sir Patrick said it would be important to look back and see what measures had been most effective, and would be useful in determining what measures to implement in the future,necessary.He added: ldquoSo I think those are important scientic questions to address, and they havenrsquot yet been fully addressed.Prof Whitty said it was important to learn lessons from what had happened in the outbreak.ldquoI think a iety of dferent people are going to come with dferent answers on the timing question, he said.ldquoPart of the problem that we had at that stage is that we had very limited information about this

three-year pilot, which would cost at least poundm, to understand the impact of a citizens basic incomeon poverty, unemployment, health and financial wellbeing.Under the proposal, around  people would

poundm.It recommends participants are chosen at random, with two study areas where the whole community receives a CBI, one the high level, the other the low.There would be no means testing, but participants would lose access to a range of benefits including jobseekers allowance, tax credits, child benefit and pensions.The idea was worked up by Fe, North Ayrshire, Edinburgh and Glasgow councils with pound, funding from the SNP Government.As part of the feasibility work, the Child Poverty Action Group researched the potential interactions between a CBI pilot and the current social security arrangements.The Fraser of Allander institute also modelled the potential impacts on the economy.Paul Vaughan, Head of Communities and Neighbourhoods at Fe Council, said the feasibility report came at a time ldquoof unprecedented socioeconomic challenges.He said: ldquoGiven the stubborn persistence of unacceptable levels of poverty and inequality in our society, itrsquos important that we consider innovative solutions.ldquoWe are clear that a pilot of basic income is desirable, and we have described how and what would need to be done for this to happen.ldquoHowever, we also recognise that, at this time, itrsquos not currently feasible to progress to a pilot due to the very complex legislative, technical and delivery challenges associated with the institutional arrangements needed for a pilot.ldquoIf these barriers are to be overcome, sustained support across all levels of governmentfor the duration of the pilot and evaluation will be needed.Green MSP Alison Johnstone said: ldquoThis feasibility study shows that whatever the challenges to introducing a universal basic income in Scotland, set at an adequate rate, it would have a potentially hugely positive impact on health, wellbeing, poverty and inequality at a time when inequalities are being exposed by the current public health crisis.ldquoAs the world looks for ways to build back better from this global crisis, Scotland is well placed to take a world-leading role in developing new radical approaches that provide a real safety net for the most vulnerable people in society.ldquoA Universal Basic

At the Sandwick Manse, he kept a daily record for  years, beginning in , and became a recognised expert on Scotland’s weather.After Clouston’s death, the station moved around Orkney but kept going right up until WWII. Magnus Spence ran it in Deerness for almost thirty years,  – . His son, Magnus Thorfinn Spence, was Chief Meteorologist for Bomber Command during WWII. With very neat symmetry, the story now moves to the other end of the world # to the South Orkney Islands. Base Orcadas is an Argentinian weather station but it was founded in  by the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition, led by William Spiers Bruce. His grandmother was Charity Isbister, whose father Caleb owned Ness Farm, Stromness. Spiers Bruce went to the Antarctic as a scientist on a whaling expedition in  and became fascinated by the polar regions. He went on expeditions to the Arctic and, when he couldn’t get there, he went to the top of Ben Nevis, which had snow cover for  days of the year. An Observatory had been built there in  by the Scottish Meteorological Society, to try to learn more about weather patterns. The first Superintendent was RTOmond, the son of Robert Omond from Kirkwall, who became President of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh and Mary Traill, daughter of Professor Thomas Stewart Traill, . Omond was involved with the Observatory right from its planning stages. Ill health forced him down from the summit after seven years, but he remained in overall charge until the Observatory closed in . William Spiers Bruce had applied to join Scott’s expedition to the Antarctic. When, despite being one of the most experienced Polar scientists in the country, his application was rejected, he raised the funds for an expedition supported by the Royal Scottish Geographical Society. The Scottish National Antarctic Expedition of - is not as famous as those of Scott and Shackleton but it has been described as one of the most cost-effective and carefully planned scientic expeditions of the age. As well as establishing the weather station, the expedition brought back a large number of botanical, biological, zoological and geological samples. The house built for the men and their instruments was called Omond House. As well as giving Spiers Bruce a lot of practical and scientic advice, Omond had given a very sizeable donation to the expedition.The Ben Nevis Observatory only lasted eighteen years and only had three observers so it is strange that there is still more Orcadian involvement. According to his entry in the Australian Dictionary of Biography, Charles Anderson, from Moa in Stenness, was the Superintendent there after he graduated in . He quickly realised he wanted to be somewhere warmer and went to work at the Australian Museum in Sydney in , eventually becoming its director.The full version of this article can be found on page  of this week’s edition of The Orcadian. A biography Charles Anderson is available on the #People# page of www.aboutorkney. Patricia Long is a local tour guide based in Stenness, with a particular interest in social and family history.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

These figures do not account for tests undertaken through the UK Government testing system.Mr McArthur who, alongside the local press, has repeatedly appealed for this information to be released, was pleased that figures had finally been made public.He said: “I welcome the decision by NHS Orkney to publish localised information and provide the public with greater clarity on the level of testing taking place in Orkney.“I have been pressing Ministers for weeks to agree to releasing testing data.  To date, despite warm words, the Scottish Government has refused to budge.“I therefore welcome NHS Orkney’s decision to follow the lead taken by NHS Shetland in making public this information.  As we move forward with ‘test and protect’, other types of information will also be needed to give people an understanding of the situation in their local area.“It is clear that transparency is key to building public confidence and the compliance we will need to see as we continue to emerge from lockdown. This move by NHS Orkney is a good step in the right direction.”NHS Orkney has sought to remind the community that testing is available for anyone over the age of five who has symptoms, and to keep up hygiene standards in order to prevent the spread of the virus.Mr O#Brien said: “It is down to the great work and commitment from all those who live and work in Orkney that we have kept positive results so low, but we must not get complacent.#As the lockdown is being relaxed and people begin moving around more freely, we will be exposed again.“To keep safe, our community must continue to stick to the hygiene and infection control guidelines.”These include:copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"more vessels but aprils gross tonnage is well down on last year ","story":"Lerwick Harbour saw a big reduction in shipping tonnage during April compared with the same month last year – although the number of arrivals was actually up slightly.A total of  vessels called, compared with  in April , but the overall tonnage dropped from , to ,grt.The deficit was partly due to no cruise ships callinglast year, although ferries, live fish carriers and oil traffic were all also down considerably.The April arrivals this year included  fishing boats,  workboats tenders,  ro ro ferries,  live fish carriers, eight oil boats, eight tugs, five tankers, five ferries and three pilot boats.The fishing vessels comprised  Shetland,  British, three Danish, two French and one Norwegian boat.For the first four months of the year the overall number of arrivals at Lerwick holds up reasonably well with  – , as compared to , in .

Food stocks are good, helped by food coming in from both the Scottish government through the council hub and from the national support effort organised by Tesco.“These two sources have really helped to boost our normal regular food donations coming in through local shops.“Where necessary we have also been able to buy in additional food and toiletries using the funds which we have received from many dferent sources.”SIC education and families committee chairman George Smith said the figures were “concerning” and urged anyone who thought they may be entitled to free school meals to make the necessary enquiries.Mr Smith said: “It’s obviously concerning and disappointing that there is an increased demand on the foodbank particularly from families.George Smith: #There are probably people accessing the foodbank who have never had to do so in the past#“There are probably people accessing the foodbank that have never had to do so in the past.“I would encourage anybody entitled to free school meals to be making sure they make that application“We are paying £ a day, and that goes into the bank account.”Mr Smith’s comments came as the Scottish government highlighted additional support it was providing from its £ million Food Fund.FareShare, a national network of charitable food distributors, has distributed over , tonnes of food – the equivalent of almost . million meals – since rd March, supported by £, of Scottish government funding.Now, an additional £. million of funding will help FareShare purchase more food for local authorities, community-run initiatives and frontline charities across Scotland.Mr Grieve said: “This is very welcome news as Shetland has been benefiting from the government’s support following the announcement of the initial £, funding and I fully expect that the need for this support will remain for many months to come, even when the pandemic is fully controlled.“The Trussell Trust announced today that nationally there has been an  per cent increase in demand for support during April compared with  and more alarmingly there was a  per cent rise in support for children.”Scottish communities minister Aileen Campbell said: “At this dficult time, it is more important than ever that we tackle food insecurity by supporting the work of community food distribution groups across the country who are best placed to ensure vital supplies reach those who need it most.“By working in partnership with FareShare and their partners in communities across Scotland, this extra funding will help frontline charities and community food groups provide support to even more people in need.” raquoWe were told there was no magic money tree.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappExceutive ministers Swann and Murphy have clashed over the coronavirus response.Jonathan BellTwitterEmailJune   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailFinance Minister Conor Murphy has tweeted a clarication of his claim the Northern Ireland coronavirus lockdown was preventable had the health service been better funded.In an interview on Wednesday morning, the Sinn Fein MLA said Northern Ireland would not have had to go into lockdownthe health service had been more robust and not suffered through years of austerity.That afternoon he tweeted saying the lockdown was absolutely necessary to save lives. He did not sayhe still felt additional funding for the health service would have prevented the introduction of the draconian measures.The UUP described his clarication as feeble.MLA Alan Chambers said it made the situation worse because he singularly fails to explain why he said what he said in trying to blame the UK Government for lockdown and he has failed to retract the comments he made.Conor Murphy#s own party leader said, on more than one occasion, that we should be following the World Health Organisation`s advice on lockdown, so his failure to retract his original comments run directly counter to what they were saying. More people being infected would have meant more deaths.”Austerity policies have severely impacted on the capacity of Health and Social Care services, here and where, to respond to the Covid  pandemic. For clarity, lockdown has been absolutely necessary to save lives.— Conor MurphyJune , The Health Minister Robin Swann dismissed Mr Murphy#s suggestion better funding for his department over the years could have avoided a lockdown.The UUP MLA said no health service could have coped with the outbreak no matter how well it was funded and the measures imposed were based on similar responses from around the world. Read More Murphy claries comments after blaming lockdown on Tory austerityThe impact of the lockdown has been immense in Northern Ireland with the economy suffering a major shock with all sectors in a slump. The rate of decline experienced has been the worst in all the UK.Mr Murphy told the BBC#s Good Morning Ulster: The fact we had to go into lockdown is because our health service has suffered from decades of under investment.Read MoreAlex Kane:Opinion Murphy#s new law: Saying wrong thing at the wrong timeHe added: If we had a very robust health service that was well-resourced then it would have been fit to cope with the pandemic.The reason we had to go into lockdown - and people should understand this - is because the health service has been under resourced through austerity cuts for many, many years. So any attempt to restructure the health service is a big challenge as we still suffer from nine years of austerity.Read More Revealed: Blueprint for post-Covid healthcare in Northern IrelandLater in a tweet he said: Austerity policies have severely impacted on the capacity of Health and Social Care services, here and where, to respond to the Covid- pandemic. For clarity, lockdown has been absolutely necessary to save lives.Health minister Robin Swann said he agreed his department was under resourced but said the only way to manage the spread of the infection in NI was to go into lockdown. He said he took exception to Mr Murphy#s claim they could have coped better had the funds been available.It was not because our health service was not fit to cope. No health service was fit to cope. When we look at the pictures coming out of Italy at the time and New York - which is supposed to be world leading - no health service could have kept going in its day-to-day operations and coped with Covid at the same time.Read More Stormont let the health service down over the last decade – Robin SwannHe added: Our health service has been under resourced and is still under resourced. It#s not [the reason NI went into lockdown].The reason we went into lockdown was how we were to manage the spread of Covid- and that was the method that was used across the world.No health service could have coped.The Finance Minister was called to clary his remarks, with SDLP MLA Matthew O#Toole describing them as ‘bizarre and inexplicable. “Years of austerity have undoubtedly degraded the quality of our public services and have placed immense pressure on hard-worked public servants, he said. “But there is, to my knowledge, no evidence suggesting that the reason for the Covid- lockdown is the financing of our health service. It’s baffling, therefore, that the Minister in charge of financing our response to the Covid- pandemic, seems to have a view at odds with most other countries in Europe and the scientic community.Public messaging during a health crisis is important and, on this occasion, it seems to have gone wrong again.Read MoreLisa Smyth:Opinion Swann takes first steps to ensuring a healthy future for our ailing NHSMr Swann has in the past blamed Stormont for running down the health system to an extent a scramble was necessary to find the capacity to cope with the virus.“Vital services have been underfunded, short-term decisions were preferred over long-term planning, dficult choices were ducked, staff were left to feel unappreciated, social care was particularly neglected,” Mr Swann told MLAs in May.Deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill, a former health minister, responded by accusing the Conservative government of having “stripped the Executive of funding over  years”.“The impact that’s had on our health service and our public services are well rehearsed and well known to everybody. Even the fact and the condition that we were in as a health service to be able to respond to Covid- was greatly diminished because of the impact of Tory austerity over many, many years,” she said.Belfast Related ContentNews Analysis PremiumLisa SmythOpinionSwann takes first steps to ensuring a healthy future for our ailing NHSWhen Robin Swann took the job of Health Minister in January, it was dficult to imagine he could face a greater challenge than addressing Northern Ireland#s hospital waiting list shame.GalleryNorthern IrelandRevealed: Blueprint for post-Covid healthcare in Northern IrelandRobin Swann has published his plan for rebuilding the health service in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Education Minister sets target date of August  for some pupils to go back to schoolFuneral of Liam Neeson#s mother Kitty held in BallymenaNorthern Ireland firms moving jobs to Republic due to Brexit, MP told Belfast mum Nuala Mackel loses fight for le after being struck by carNI Finance Minister Murphy tweets #clarication# on coronavirus preventable lockdown claim,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He said reopening retail tomorrow had been another boost. Having an earlier date to reopen than anticipated has been a huge, huge help in terms of getting going again. Had restrictions stayed in place and retailers remained closed in the summer then chances of quite a high number of job losses would have been quite severe, he said.Mr Hamilton was addressing the Assembly#s economy committee on Wednesday.He said that retail had been one of the sectors hardest hit by restrictions during lockdown.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseSupport: Simon HamiltonPA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappSupport: Simon HamiltonMost retailers with a door opening onto the street are able to trade from tomorrow, but Mr Hamilton said units within shopping centres now required a definite opening date.He said that in many cases the centres themselves were open, as they housed the essential retailers allowed to trade all through the crisis. He added: I#m aware of one of our members who has % of their shops actually open because they are deemed essential.They are well-versed and experienced in how to open safely and keep premises safe and clean and have queuing systems in place.Mr Hamilton said that while retailers were pleased to be able to reopen, the sector was still entering a dangerous period and would require ongoing support from the Government.He said that to maintain social distancing, shops would have lower footfall, and were also having to absorb the costs of measures such as Perspex screens. Mr Hamilton said he wanted to offer support to chamber members in the hospitality industry, which is still awaiting a reopening date. Hotels, restaurants and bars in the Republic are due to reopen on June . The Executive is expected to consider whether to reopen the hospitality sector here when it meets on Thursday. It is also due to consider whether a plan to reopen hotels here on July  can be brought forward in tandem with the Republic.Mr Hamilton said: There#s a real symbiotic relationship between retail, hospitality and tourism. We don#t want to see our industries here falling behind our neighbours in the south.Aodhan Connolly, director of the NI Retail Consortium, also gave evidence to the committee and repeated calls for a date when retailers in shopping centres can get back to business. He said: It seems a little bit arbitrary that they#re not open, since a lot have gone that extra mile to ensure safety of staff including using personal protective equipment , social distancing and hand sanitisation. We need that final piece of the jigsaw to be opened as soon as possible, or at least a date for it to be opened as soon as possible.Glyn Roberts, chief executive of Retail NI, warned recovery of the sector could take some time.We are making progress but it is a long, long road back, he said. If we are in the midst of a very serious recession over the next few months, and possibly years, what impact that will have on consumer confidence and spending is a whole other issue.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Education Minister sets target date of August  for some pupils to go back to schoolFuneral of Liam Neeson#s mother Kitty held in BallymenaNorthern Ireland firms moving jobs to Republic due to Brexit, MP told Belfast mum Nuala Mackel loses fight for le after being struck by carNI Finance Minister Murphy tweets #clarication# on coronavirus preventable lockdown claim,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The extended studio, which was due to be finished next year, was to bring  construction jobs and support around , creative industry roles.When combined with the existing studio, the extension would create the largest studio complex outside the south east of England.Cult fantasy series Game of Thrones, filmed at Titanic Studios and a string of other spots in Co Down and the north coast, has been the local industry#s biggest success story. The existing Belfast Harbour Studios was to host filming of Viking revenge film The Northman, starring Nicole Kidman, during the spring. Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseNicole Kidman who was due to start filming in Belfast FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappNicole Kidman who was due to start filming in BelfastBut film production has ground to a halt in Northern Ireland and further afield as a result of Covid-. A spokesman for Belfast Harbour said: We#re still finalising the consenting process through Belfast City Council for the new extension to Belfast Harbour Studios and in parallel we will keep our investment under review, taking into consideration the timing of recovery in the sector after the current crisis. Along with our partners at NI Screen, we continue to engage with production companies to keep the profile of Belfast as a filming location high.Richard Williams, chief executive of Northern Ireland Screen, the publicly-funded body which supports the film industry here, said he#s hopeful that the continued rise of on-demand services such as Disney, Amazon Prime and Netflix will ensure demand for more studio space. As with all sectors of the economy, it is extremely important that the planning and development of future infrastructure is kept on track, he said.With the era of the streamers only beginning, there is no reason to believe that demand for screen studio space will diminish in the medium term.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseGame of Thrones FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappGame of ThronesMeanwhile, the lockdown has also meant a slowdown of work on building sites and, in some cases, doubts over the future viability of developments such as large-scale offices and flats.Today#s residential housing market survey by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyorsand Ulster Bank says that surveyors expect a growing desire for properties with gardens or balconies, and towards homes located near green spaces.Many surveyors also say there will be a fall in the appeal of tower blocks and % feel properties located in highly urban areas will be less enticing.The Belfast Harbour spokesman said: Regarding City Quays , a residential development, we continue to engage with the market around this opportunity to develop our plans and hope to be in a position to submit a planning application at some stage in the next  months but, again, we will keep this under review as we emerge from the Covid- crisis.It#s believed that the Harbour still expects the projects to go ahead but that they may be delayed.Meanwhile, Rajesh Rana, chief executive of Andras House, which operates six hotels and serviced apartments in the city, said its Bedford Street aparthotel is still in the planning approval stage. We have secured a brand for the operation and, once planning is secured, we will work up detailed plans, he said.We will review the market conditions at that time and we are keen to start this exciting project but it is likely that the start date will be delayed by around six months.Simon Hamilton, the chief executive of Belfast Chamber of Commerce, said he believed that some developers were reassessing plans in light of Covid-. It#s probably fair to say that in a few cases there has been maybe some re-evaluation of the nature and extent of some schemes in light of what has happened, he explained.But I haven#t detected any retreat from redevelopment or schemes being taken off or stopped. Certainly there has been a look at the configuration of developments, and questions like what square footage do we need to give to an activity, and that#s a positive thing to do in the circumstances.People may askthere are lessons they can learn to make developments more robust and resilient. That#s sensible and there may be a bit of delay as people see the economy settling down. That will have an impact on the pace of development but I don#t see schemes not happening, though they make take a bit longer.Despite the delays in Belfast Harbour#s future plans, other developments are still going ahead. Business advisory firm PwC said its move into new-build offices at Merchant Square in the city centre is on course.Tribeca, a major redevelopment of the Cathedral Quarter, is progressing through the planning system, while it#s understood the Bywater and Ashmour redevelopment of the Gresham Street area is also going ahead. Co Tyrone-based construction company McAleer and Rushe, which is working on developments including the revamp of Ewart#s Warehouse on Bedford Street, said: Construction resumed in early May on our , sq ft landmark Bedford Square project and we#re proceeding towards completing the development in late . Our project on the site of Norwich Union House received planning permission in March, with timing of the commencement of work to be confirmed.Belfast City Council, meanwhile, said it#s continuing with plans for regeneration. During lockdown, our Planning Service has adapted to minimise any delays caused by the pandemic, and given the green light to a number of new developments, a spokesperson said.

In her response, Dianne Dodds could not give that commitment.

Sinead McLaughlin was disappointed with that response, she said: “Northern Ireland has serious inequalities and removing these must be a priority for the Department for the Economy and its minister.

We know from experience that in recessions it is the areas with the weakest economies that usually suffer the most. “There must be additional investment in skills and infrastructure to support the North West achieve a proper economic recovery. The Economic Advisory Group must have the courage and independence to say that and as a core part of their work to identy the sectors which offer the best prospects for increased employment, productivity and growth.

On Friday, the GAA released theirto action procedures, that will allow collective training from Monday, July  and competitive games to commence  days later. There has been mixed reaction over the weekend, due to safety, the ious procedures clubs would need to enforce including the appointment of a Covid Supervisor and Health Questionnaires to be completed for any activity. The County Derry Post conducted an anonymous survey yesterday with adult club players across all codes. googletag.cmd.push Over  responses – from  dferent clubs - were received, with  percent stating they had not read the extensive document outlining the guidelines for ato play. When askedthey wouldto games on July ,  percent indicating that they would do so. Eight percent said they wouldnt, with the reminder said they were unsure. The figures are almost the same for theto training date of Monday, July , with  percent of players saying they will, with  indicating they wont and rest are undecided. Some of the reasons given ranged from not being convinced social distancing would be feasible, working on the front line and the risk it would be to both themselves and their families. googletag.cmd.push One response said that amateur players should not be playing during a global pandemic. The final question on the survey was directed at one of the greatest talking points in recent weeks, whether the GAA shouldve wiped out the entire season. Of the replies,  percent felt the season shouldve been cancelled,  percent had the view that county activity should cease to allow clubs a better window. The remainderwere content with the GAAs stance. Ballerin manager Brian Deighan commended the GAA for their handling of the lockdown, but felt there was now an element of rush with an element of risk. He admits that there is a dference of opinion within his squad, which never exceeds  players. “The younger lads dont see the risk, but older lads in certain jobs or with family members in certain jobs arent keen on it . As a management team, we are dead against it...it is either safe to play or it isnt.” Brian continues by pointing to a comment he saw on social media over the weekend. “Mickey Donnelly hit the nail on the head with a tweet at the weekend, a small club will struggle to resource all these protocols and tests.” Derry CCC are set to finalise their club championship arrangements this week, following meetings to explore the options. Nothing has been confirmed, but they structures are likely to change to allow club players at least one championship game. RELATED - The GAAsto action explained. More...

On Friday, the GAA released theirto action procedures, that will allow collective training from Monday, July  and competitive games to commence  days later. There has been mixed reaction over the weekend, due to safety, the ious procedures clubs would need to enforce including the appointment of a Covid Supervisor and Health Questionnaires to be completed for any activity. The County Derry Post conducted an anonymous survey yesterday with adult club players across all codes. googletag.cmd.push Over  responses – from  dferent clubs - were received, with  percent stating they had not read the extensive document outlining the guidelines for ato play. When askedthey wouldto games on July ,  percent indicating that they would do so. Eight percent said they wouldnt, with the reminder said they were unsure. The figures are almost the same for theto training date of Monday, July , with  percent of players saying they will, with  indicating they wont and rest are undecided. Some of the reasons given ranged from not being convinced social distancing would be feasible, working on the front line and the risk it would be to both themselves and their families. googletag.cmd.push One response said that amateur players should not be playing during a global pandemic. The final question on the survey was directed at one of the greatest talking points in recent weeks, whether the GAA shouldve wiped out the entire season. Of the replies,  percent felt the season shouldve been cancelled,  percent had the view that county activity should cease to allow clubs a better window. The remainderwere content with the GAAs stance. Ballerin manager Brian Deighan commended the GAA for their handling of the lockdown, but felt there was now an element of rush with an element of risk. He admits that there is a dference of opinion within his squad, which never exceeds  players. “The younger lads dont see the risk, but older lads in certain jobs or with family members in certain jobs arent keen on it . As a management team, we are dead against it...it is either safe to play or it isnt.” Brian continues by pointing to a comment he saw on social media over the weekend. “Mickey Donnelly hit the nail on the head with a tweet at the weekend, a small club will struggle to resource all these protocols and tests.” Derry CCC are set to finalise their club championship arrangements this week, following meetings to explore the options. Nothing has been confirmed, but they structures are likely to change to allow club players at least one championship game. RELATED - The GAAsto action explained. More...

The plan was to bring entertainment to the war weary inhabitants of the town.This meeting would lead to the formation of St Patrickrsquos Operatic and Pantomime Society and their first production was Phyllis, the Farmerrsquos Daughter mdash a title that has dated somewhat.The public responded by volunteering as actors, stage hands, working with costumes and music.Principals and chorus rehearsed separately. Only one week before opening night did they merge, coming together for the first time on the stage of St Patrickrsquos Hall.It was advertised as lsquoA Feast of Music, Song and Dancersquo boasting  voices. Rehearsal took place in the McLean home, the cast rehearsed upstairs, while machinists and costumiers worked downstairs.Phyllis, the Farmerrsquos Daughter was performed on Sunday, May , and Monday, May , .It proved successful enough to be followed in  by other productions such as Tangles, The Enchanted Rose and Quest of Olwen.The performances, in the absence of film footage and photographs, appear to be lost in the haze of time.Tangles, described as a grand musical comedy, was performed in St Patrickrsquos Hall on Monday, June , the night before the Normandy Landings. The performance was in aid of the Down County Infirmary.The programme included cast and production notes. The actors, credited as lsquoMortalsrsquo included Michael Tomelty as Lollipop, Sally King as Princess Pansy, Lillian Lundy as Dame Mouldy, Leslie Rice as Lord Humbug and Master Michael Rea as the Inn Keeperrsquos Son. lsquoImmortalsrsquo included Peggy Halloran as Titania, Maura Blaney as Nona and Mary Gilmore as lsquoCinderellarsquo.Also included was an array of guardsmen, a chorus of fairies, village chorus, court dancers, innkeeper chorus, fairy partners, bunnies and a chorus of gnomes, who included Maureen Dorrian, Annie Murphy and June Doyle. In all, the cast numbered .The scenic artist was Mr James Maguire and the costume designer was Mrs OrsquoKelly. In charge of actors make-up were Mrs Maguire, Kathleen Branf and Mrs Gilmore.But, what was the story  With appearances from gnomes and Cinderella it may have had a little to do with fairyland.Is there anyone out there who remembers  At this distance, it is just a forgotten show, one of many that enter-tained people at a most dficult time in history.Around Lecale and where, there were a number of amateur dramatic companies, many more than today, who performed many shows. Here are but a sample.Old King Cole by May King, with nine scenes and a chorus of , was a three-hour show, staged in St Patrickrsquos Hall, Downpatrick, at pm on Sunday, February , .Reserved tickets were on sale from Mr Breen, Mr Fox and Mr Doris.Ballykilbeg Dramatic Society gave the public a production of Paul Twyning by George Shiels on Sunday, March , and Tuesday, March , , with a repeat performance in St Patrickrsquos Hall, Downpatrick, the following Sunday.Kilclief Parish Amateur Dramatic Club staged Shielsrsquo new comedy, The Fort Field, in St Malachyrsquos Hall in the village on Sunday, May , . They also performed it in the Stella Maris Hall in Strangford the following Friday.Killyleagh Dramatic Society presented St John Ervinersquos lsquoBoydrsquos Shop at the Belfast Dramatic Festival during the first week of September , having staged it during the late summer of that year in Strangford.On the night of Sunday, November , , you could treat yourself to Stars over Ballynoe, an all-star iety concert in St Patrickrsquos Parochial Hall, Ballynoe, with Alister Dick, the famous Irish tenor, Alfie Donnelly, Irelandrsquos funniest comedian, the Legamaddy Dancers and the Portaferry Hawaiian Band.

Hopefully, therersquos more to come, he said.Joersquos latest work is QUINN - No Place to Hide, a standalone follow-up to a successful launch of the first in the series. The title is dedicated to his great grandfather, Sam Quinn, a man Joe admired for the way in which he dealt with the harshness of le in Downpatrick at the turn of the twentieth century.ldquoHe worked -hour shts, six days a week, as a yard foreman at the Rearsquos bottling plant in Market Street, Downpatrick. It was backbreaking work for which he earned a pittance to feed a large family. He never complained, never took a holiday, and never ventured outside the confines of the town. He lived through two world wars, the creation of the Irish Republic, and countless other momentous times, yet he kept his head down and simply got on with his own le.Joe is quick to point out that the character in his latest book is nothing like his ancestor. ldquoAll Irsquove taken is his name. My version of Quinn is that of an international assassin who leaves Downpatrick to join the Irish Rangers and later becomes a gun for hire in America. Talk about two dferent worlds! Perhaps though, therersquos a bit of parallel in that I transferred old Sam Quinnrsquos stoicism and relentless nature into a make-believe cut-out who lives his le by those very ideals.With a -year background in journalism, it was hardly surprising that Joe wanted to keep writing when he switched careers in  to head up Down Business Centre, a support enterprise agency to help promote start-up businesses.He said: ldquoI loved the interaction with local entrepreneurs, but the writing bug doesnrsquot go away. I had always an idea for a book and couldnrsquot stop scratching the itch. After a few years, I decided to put it into action.That first book mdash SOMEONE HAS TO PAY mdash was a product of the Northern Ireland Troubles. It is set in the unlikely surroundings of Bishopscourt, a former RAF base just outside Downpatrick, and features a British government elite squad assembled under the relative anonymity of the old complex for the purposes of waging a final shoot-to-kill war against the IRA.Joersquos own assessment of the story brings a wry smile. ldquoItrsquos a far-fetched idea, isnrsquot it  It couldnrsquot have happened, could it  Thatrsquos the essence of the storyteller and I guess itrsquos why I love doing it.A recurring theme in Joersquos books is that he likes toin a mention of his hometown whenever possible. Yoursquoll find Downpatrick cropping up a lot in background narratives, or as the setting for a few hair-raising episodes that attempt to weave their way into the history and fabric of the area.ldquoItrsquos just something I like to do. Irsquom a Downpatrick man and I have the urge to shout about it when the chance arises. Wersquove a lot going for us in this area and it can only do good to let the world know wersquore here.One of his other books SPENT FORCE, which was a crime thriller set in the West of Ireland and featured a fading Garda detective, attracted praise from two signicant sources. One was Ken Bruen, the international bestselling author of the Jack Taylor Irish crime series, who wrote: ldquoSometimes a book comes along that you instantly know......damn, I am now going to have to read this all over again for the sheer joy of the narrative. It means that I will have to swear off other books for a time as very few can provide the utter joy and delight of Joe McCoubreyrsquos superb novel.Another unexpected source was a serving Garda sergeant who posted a glowing review on the Amazon . ldquoA top-class novel which deserves high praise. I am from Irish law enforcement and this novel is as close to a real-le investigation as you can get. Gripping from start to finish, totally believable characters, strong storyline, Highly Recommended.Joe admits he was floored by the feedback. ldquoOn the one hand there was an endorsement by perhaps Irelandrsquos foremost crime thriller author, while on the other there was vindication from a policeman that the research and effort to get things right had paid off. Itrsquos what any author craves, and itrsquos what makes you want to get back over the keyboard and start into the next adventure.That next adventure is taking Joe back to the West of Ireland to team up again with his favourite Garda detective. The sequel is provisionally titled FORCE OF NATURE which delves into the murky world of a serial killer. Not surprisingly, Downpatrick features heavily again.ldquoYes, the killerrsquos first three victims are young girls from Downpatrick. The story will move from here to Westport and back again. Irsquom still not sure how it will end, and thatrsquos as much an appeal to me as it is to the reader.Joe explains that hersquos not a dedicated story plotter. ldquoI use a broad brush. I get an idea and just run with it. I donrsquot like to be confined to structure from start to finish, with the result that Irsquom not quite sure where Irsquom going from one chapter to another. I think of it as being spontaneous, which means I usually go off on tangents that keeps things fresh and moving along. Itrsquos a seat-of-the-pants alternative to being a plotter.Joe publishes all his books under his own publishing house, Inishfree Communications, which also offers support to local writers. To date, he has helped eight others to complete their author journey ndash between them they have published more than  titles. He provides proofing, formatting, and design services, including suggestions on the most effective covers for inidual books.ldquoItrsquos a big part of what I do these days, says Joe. ldquoThere are lots of budding writers and independent authors out there who just need a bit of extra help and encouragement to bring their work in front of the masses. I get as much of a kick out of seeing these books go on sale as I do from my own works.Joe McCoubreyrsquos books are available as paperbacks or eBooks on the Amazon and Barnes  Noble s..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Call for hedge removal after near miss  ","story":"AN overgrown hedge close to a BT exchange in Killyleagh is being blamed for a near miss involving a pedestrian and a bus last week.A woman who was forced to step on to the main road to avoid the hedge was almost struck by the vehicle as it passed, leaving both her and the driver shaken.BT has confirmed that it plans to cut the hedge this week, but local councillor Billy Walker said the telecoms giant must go further and remove it completely.He said there was a wall behind the hedge, suggesting that once the hedge is removed, BT would only have to build a small fence on top of it to secure its base.ldquoThe overgrown hedge has been an issue for many years and there have been countless near misses involving people who have had to step off the footpath to pass, including mums with prams. What happened last Friday is the final straw as far as I am concerned, declared Cllr Walker.ldquoThe only sensible solution is to remove the hedge in its entirety. To do so would not cost a lot of money, but would save lives as at this time of year as people would not have to walk on a busy main road to pass.Cllr Walker says he has raised the issue with the telecoms company over the years, but was told the hedge could not be cut back as it was the nesting season.ldquoMy biggest fear has always been that someone could end up getting killed or seriously injured at this part of Killyleagh. While I am thankful the woman who stepped off the footpath last Friday was not seriously injured, this must be the last incident of this kind, said Cllr Walker.ldquoI am appealing to BT to do the decent thing and finally remove the hedge. We have been fortunate up until now no one has been injured, but I shudder to think what could happen at this location.Cllr Walker added: ldquoThis situation is a major accident waiting to happen, but it can be avoided by simply removing a hedge. It is s no brainer and I hope BT will agree to my request.A BT spokesperson said the organisation was sorry to learn of the distress that the hedge may have caused and would be in contact with Cllr Walker directly.ldquoThe hedge is scheduled to be trimmed back this week.

Some people have looked at Everest and thought climbing it is necessary. Others call those people crazy.Everesting is described as ldquofiendishly simple, yet brutally hard. Ride hill repeats on any hill anywhere in the world mdash or on Zwt, the virtual cycling simulator mdash in a single activity until you climb the equivalent height of Mount Everest.The concept was created by Hells , who also control the induction into the Everesting Hall of Fame. Website Everesting.cc contains the rules to follow.Well, call me crazy, but I did it. No, I didnrsquot fly to Nepal and climb the actual mountain. Irsquom not a former pro athlete or extraordinarily gted human, nor am I an adventure adrenaline junkie looking for a fix. Irsquom just a  something mdash  to be precise mdash son of God who has a family, a job, a dog, a bicycle, and I landed myself in the Everesting Hall of Fame. And you can too.I decided to use the challenge to help raise funds for mental health organisations Aware and Ballynahinch Counselling Service, or The Hub, as itrsquos known locally. My initial target was pound but I was astounded and humbled by the generosity of people. In the end donations totalled pound,.I chose to start at am so I could have family support at the finish. Despite the early start I was joined by my we, Jennie, and through the day she was a great support, bringing me fresh drinks and relaying messages of support.I turned on my favourite music playlist and hit the hill with a measured effort that I thought I could sustain for hours. I planned a bidon of sports drink for each ascent, as well as -g carbs per hour. Real foods early in the ride and gels and sugary drinks for later in the ride.The first three or four ascents felt strangely comfortable, averaging  minutes up each time. I was almost an hour ahead of my estimated -hour schedule by midday. I later noticed some friends,, who were tracking my progress, were saying how strong I was riding and hoped that I wouldnrsquot pay for it later.They were right! Ascents six and seven were so tough, even to the point where I felt physically ill, and my times were now over  minutes per climb.vEveresters add the tag lsquovEverestingrsquo to their Zwt profile name which means anyone on the course that sees it knows you are vEveresting and many will ride with you, congratulate you, give you a thumbs up, or just encourage you to keep going.These wonderful sherpas made it a much more enjoyable experience, especially during the sixth and seventh ascents when it was dficult to want to keep riding and my butt was telling me that I was crazy to push on.Despite wanting to reach the finish as soon as possible, I had to listen to my body, and so I stopped for some food and a bit of a rest. Another quick shower, kit change and application of chamois cream, and I was ready to continue.I was joined online this time by good friends Nathan Mullan and Stephen Hanna, both from Dromara Cycling Club, and Sam Carmichael and Nigel Bradley, from my old club, Northwest CC. Seeing them there gave me a real boost and that combined with knowing I had the end in sight really spurred me on to the finish.The final  metres of climbing were the best - I was getting messages of encouragement from Zwters from places as far away as Germany, USA and Colombia. I finished shortly after pm, over  hours after I first leapt into the saddle and boy did I sleep well that night.So to finish, Irsquod like to say a huge thanks to everyone for their support, to those who donated in such hard times mdash Irsquom so grateful and Irsquom hopeful we will make le that little bit easier for others.I havenrsquot put any thought into the next challenge mdash on Sunday I said never again mdash but the beauty of cycling is therersquos always the next time.

Thatrsquos something our whole extended family embraces.ldquoItrsquos going to be bittersweet but we are happy for Mary and the lovely couple who are adopting her. Itrsquos good to know that she will be going to her forever home and will have a lovely little le. Thatrsquos always the ultimate aim for a child, particularly a younger child.ldquoHowever, one of the challenges is trying to teach her about adoption. How do you teach a three year-old that she will be leaving us and going to a forever family  We had to be creative and came up with the idea about the Christmas elf. Like many houses, we had Bauble the elf at Christmas, who was then lsquoadoptedrsquo by Mary and now lives with us all year round and is part of our family. We even made an adoption certicate to show her it was real.ldquoWhile Covid- has put a hold on this for now, we still have to prepare both Mary and ourselves, as it will be hard to say goodbye. But, as our daughter keeps saying, itrsquos part of foster care and what is right for Mary.ldquoEveryone has been writing their goodbye letters to her. We have prepared a book about her time with us and videos so that she wonrsquot have any gaps when shersquos looking back on her le.The Dicksons have been fostering since  and have looked after eight children so far, ranging in age from one to eight. They do respite fostering ndash temporary childcare for another fosterer or family ndash and short-term foster care.Itrsquos something that the couple have wanted to do for a long time.ldquoI wanted to foster for as long as in my early twenties and my husband felt the same, said  year-old Tanya. ldquoWe both came from family backgrounds where close relatives were in the caring professions.ldquoWe were very united in knowing that we would foster one day, even from the day we were married. However, when our daughter Hannah came along, we wanted her to be part of it, obviously, and to wait until the time that we were sure she understood the impact of it.ldquoWe waited until she was about  before we contacted the South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust. Thatrsquos where our journey started, and we havenrsquot looked back once. The Trust has been with us every step of the way. The only regret we have had about fostering is not doing it sooner.The Dicksons have also been supported by their nearest and dearest in doing something that many other people consider doing.ldquoWe were lucky that our families were always on board with us regarding our fostering, Tanya said. Our employers have been amazing, our church family and even the village family of Crossgar. Everyone has really embraced our fostering journey.After making contact with the Trust Tanya, who works at Kilmood Early Years Playgroup, said that after a period of assessment and training they began to foster six months later.ldquoI think the assessment can put people off, but I believe itrsquos an invaluable tool as you come out of it knowing yourself better, she explained. You know your own personal qualities better and your skill base.ldquoItrsquos also essential as it helps the Trust match children with dferent needs with dferent foster carers. The only thing we stipulated is that any child we cared for would be at least two years younger than Hannah as we wanted her to be the eldest child in the house.Hannah, who is a student of Saintfield High School, has been integral to the couplersquos success as foster parents and has relished her role as lsquobig sisterrsquo.Mrs Dickson said: ldquoHannah has been so great with the children. With Hannah maturing, she is showing her experience of fostering in a very positive and beautul way by showing empathy to others.ldquoThatrsquos something she would never have experienced had we not fostered and she feels more grateful for her family le. She wants to be a nurse and I can see that great caring spirit being fostered in her care of Mary. Itrsquos been so rewarding and has changed us completely for the better.Unlike many first-time parents, Tanya said foster parents always have help and support available.She said: ldquoEvery child that comes through our door is dferent and you adapt accordingly for whatever that child needs. We have the support of a link worker, who has had a lot of training. Yoursquore never on your own.ldquoWe have learnt to take things at a childrsquos pace. Some children who have been looked after before are used to being more independent and self-sufficient.

Republicans are already planning a memorial on council property in Castlewellan and it is believed that loyalists in Ballynahinch may erect a memorial to dead UVF terrorists on council land at Langley Road.KILLYLEAGH ndash A new community forum, to represent the interests of a wide range of groups in the Killyleagh area, is to be set up.The umbrella organisation will represent what has been described as the ldquoimpressive level of community activity in the area.The idea to create the new group was floated at last weekrsquos annual meeting of the Killyleagh, Shrigley and District Town Committee by secretary Peter Bryson.He said the new group is vital to enable better communication and planning and help with the compilation of joint funding applications to a range of funders.He said the creation of the new group could provide the perfect  on which to develop partnerships of shared interest in the Killyleagh area.SAINTFIELD mdash As the controversy over the dangers of mobile telephone equipment continues, Saintfield residents have found themselves at the centre of the most recent debate.Parents and councillors met in the local library last week to discuss their fears of two telecommunications masts at Comber Road, which they believe are casting a shadow over the local high school.The public meeting was called by mother-of-three Laura Bill in the wake of the independent Stewart report which advises parents not to allow their children to use mobile phones, and pointed to children as being most likely to be affected by possible health risks.Leukaemia is one illness which reports have suggested could be caused, or aggravated by, radiation from mobile phone masts.One woman told Thursdayrsquos meeting that a pocket of seven children under  years of age suffer from childhood leukaemia in the Saintfield area, leading to parental fears that this could be aggravated by the existence of the masts.BALLYGOWAN mdash A shooting incident in Ballygowan during the early hours of Monday is being linked to a paramilitary feud.The house at Comber Road was sprayed with automatic gunfire by four men who smashed a number of windows. One of the weapons police believe was used in the attack was an AK  assault rle.No one was injured during the incident which is being linked to an ongoing feud between the LVF and UVF.A police spokesman confirmed yesterday the gunment made off in a white-coloured Ford Mondeo car which had a taxi sign on the roof.The vehicle drove off along the Comber Road in the village and into Comber where it was abandoned and set on fire at the rear of the Leisure Centre.Detectives investigating the incident have issued an appeal for information and want to hear from anyone who may have seen people acting suspiciously in the vicinity of the house at Ballygowan to contact them.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Members of Edengrove Presbyterian Church in Ballynahinch have said farewell to the Rev Trevor Steele, who is taking up a new appointment in Ohio.Last Sunday morning, Mr Steele and his family were presented with a number of gts by the congregation to thank them for their service and contribution to the le of the church.Along with his we Carol and children Andrew and Joanna, Mr Steele is moving to the United States after accepted a call to McCord Road Congregational Church in Toledo where he begins his ministry next month.Mr Steele has been in Ballynahinch for the past five years after accepting a call to join the congregation at Edengrove while he was assistant minister at Carrickfergus Presbyterian Church.GAA mdash Peter McGrathrsquos job as Down football manager is safe, for the time being.

likely to delay the redevelopment of the huge site, traders and politicians are keen to see work starting on the eagerly-awaited economic regeneration of this historic part of the town.The local council and the Department for Communities are spearheading an ambitious regeneration project with the new brochure mdash understood to be still in draft form ndash designed to provide potential developers and other interested parties with an overview of the sitersquospotential and secure expressions of interest.A number of Irish Street businesses have already invested in upgrading their respective shop fronts while the former police base was recently given a fresh coat of paint as part of a revitalisation scheme.The development site stretches as far back as St Patrickrsquos Avenue and is also adjacent to the Irish Street car park, with council officials looking to make the brochure available to the pubic virtually.Described as a strategic and prominent location in the heart of Downpatrick, senior council officials, politicians and members of the business community are excited at the Irish Street sitersquos development potential.While the imposing former police station enjoys protected status and cannot be razed to the ground, it is hoped that potential developers will be able to come with an imaginative plan for the building.It has been identied as a development opportunity site in the Down Area Plan, with the area to the front included in Downpatrickrsquos conservation area.While it has been suggested that housing could form part of any redevelopment proposal, the building has been touted as a potential base for offices.Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Department for Communities are keen to revitalise Irish Street and hope its redevelopment will act as a catalyst for the wider economic and social regeneration of the town.They are keen to retain Irish Streetrsquos uniqueness where residents and traders live and work alongside each other and ensure that there is adequate parking. There have already been suggestions that an underground parking facility at the current Irish Street car park would allow retail units to be built on top.Work was recently completed on a protracted public realm scheme in Irish Street and it is hoped that the redevelopment of the former police base will complement this project, which resulted in the provision of new granite paving, street furniture and lighting.Downpatrick councillors are keen to see the redevelopment proposal increase the number of shoppers to the town to provide a boost for existing traders who have been at the heart of the townrsquos economy for many years.It is also hoped to regenerate the town centrersquos night time economy with politicians eager for the Irish Street scheme to create a number of much-needed new jobs.Earlier this year, a number of Downpatrick councillors were given the opportunity to view the inside of the former police base and the expansive grounds to the rear.Local council officials say they are committed to working with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the Irish Street site and had been planning to meet with them to discuss the way forward prior to the coronavirus pandemic.In addition, the local authority aims to work alongside local people on the redevelopment proposal.Leading High Street brands including Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains have previously expressed an interest in the Irish Street location which is the last large scale development site remaining in Downpatrick town centre. However, it remains to be seenthat interest remains given the current economic climate.Downpatrick councillors say that they recognise the Irish Street regeneration project provides an opportunity to regenerate the town centre and provide a boost for existing businesses and hope that the project can be progressed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Minister asked to give assurances on bypass  ","story":"STORMONT roads minister Nichola Mallon has been asked to make it clear that delivering Ballynahinchrsquos multi-million pound bypass remains one of her key priorities.The appeal has been issued by South Down MP Chris Hazzard mdash a former minister at the Department of Infrastructure mdash who is keen to see work starting on the poundm project.When he was at the helm of the Stormont department, Mr Hazzard signed off the eagerly-awaited bypass in December .Since then, there has been major progress to deliver the near two-mile scheme to link the Newcastle and Saintfield roads, with work already completed on a major archaeological investigation along parts of the route.Work was due to complete on the schemersquos economic appraisal before the end of last year, with roads engineers confirming recently that in order to advance the bypass schemersquos state of readiness, preparatory work on contract documents was ongoing to ldquominimise the time required to initiate a procurement competition, should funding become available for construction.The bypass, which would be the single biggest road scheme ever constructed in the district, is expected to take in excess of  months to build, with major new roundabouts proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road.Mr Hazzard said while the coronavirus pandemic has consumed much time for all government departments, he does want to diminish Ms Mallonrsquos role in working constructively with her executive colleagues in mitigating the worst effects of the global emergency.But he said since that taking over the reins at the roads department five months ago, the minister has issued statements on electric bikes and hydrogen buses and what he described as ldquoplenty of positive soundings on other capital projects, but there hasnrsquot been a single word on the long overdue Ballynahinch bypass.ldquoThis is a relatively low-cost, yet strategic infrastructure scheme that is shovel ready. Yet it hasnrsquot featured in any of the ministerrsquos public commentary on her departmentrsquos priorities for the time ahead since taking office in January, said Mr Hazzard.ldquoIt is unsurprising then that local businesses and commuters are beginning to question the infrastructure ministerrsquos commitment to deliver this scheme.The MP says he has once again asked Ms Mallon to definitively set out that the Ballynahinch bypass remains a priority for her department and set out a timeline for commencing construction.He added: ldquoIn light of the severe economic impact of Covid- and ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the successful delivery of this project will be a vital step in improving both our local economy and the wellbeing of our local community in these dficult times.In a letter to Ms Mallon, the South Down MP said the bypass scheme is at an advanced stage and is as close to ldquoshovel ready as any other project in the government departmentrsquorsquos capital programme.He has asked the ministerthe Ballynahinch scheme remains a ldquopriority capital project, what stage is it currently at and when will construction work be signed off Responding to Mr Hazzard, a spokesman for the roads minister said that while she is currently faced with ldquoserious and challenging budget constraints, she has already stated that she is committed to working to find solutions that deliver better for communities and improve lives across the North.ldquoShe very much recognises that many in the local community support the provision of a bypass in Ballynahinch, the spokesman continued.ldquoIn finalising budget decisions, the minister is focused on addressing the need to fund essential infrastructure work, promoting a green recovery and getting other strategic projects underway.The spokesman said that in particular, Ms Mallon is considering her long term priorities for strategic road improvement schemes and how they might facilitate complementary improvements to promote sustainable travel choices, connecting people and communities, creating thriving and liveable places that enhance opportunities and our economy.The spokesman added: ldquoThe minister understands the frustration among the people of South Down at the failure of previous administrations to deliver important projects.ldquoShe has already set out her ambition to address regional imbalance with the delivery of projects and hopes elected representatives from across all parties and across the Executive will support her in securing the money to deliver strategic projects which improve both our economy and the wellbeing of our local communities in South Down and across the North in these dficult times..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"National Trust sites reopen  ","story":"A NUMBER of local National Trust properties reopen from today.The National Trust has confirmed that Saintfieldrsquos stunning Rowallane Garden and Castle Ward and Mount Stewart mdash both on the shores of Strangford Lough mdash will be welcoming visitors after being closed for a number of weeks as part of the coronavirus lockdown restrictions.In total,  properties are reopening across the province, with Trust officials confirming that advance bookings will be required in order to limit numbers and maintain public safety.

Funding opportunities are being explored and while this work will also have been interrupted, I hope that it will resume in the near future.ldquoTourism is the districtrsquos number one offering and

But, despite, a large amount of public land and pathways available to link these community assets, these attractions are poorly connected.Mr Hazzard said he has asked the local authority to ldquourgently look at rediscovering the public value of disused railway lines, abandoned riverside paths and overgrown public spaces in developing a Downpatrick greenway project that would help breath new le into redundant community infrastructure.ldquoLinking these wonderful local attractions would also help create exciting new public spaces where people can relax, enjoy nature or exercise, he continued.ldquoDelivering a greenway initiative would not only represent an exciting investment in our local tourism offering, but help create multiple, long-term employment and entrepreneurship opportunities, providing a strong  to build a much-needed, vibrant weekend and evening economy in the town centre.Mr Hazzard believes that developing greenways has the potential to make a huge dference to the lives of local people by providing the opportunity to enjoy traffic free access to fresh air and exercise.He is also confident that the initiative would encourage more workers and children to commute to work and school on foot or by bicycle and help provide a vital leisure resource for local people and visitors alike for generations to come. ldquoThe Covid- pandemic and subsequent lockdown restrictions has exposed the importance of community trails and public spaces to our collective well-being as a society, Mr Hazzard continued.ldquoOver recent weeks, our country roads and parks have been full of people seeking respite from isolation in the green, community infrastructure that ordinarily binds our communities together.However, it is clear that this infrastructure lags well behind many comparative regional, national and international locations.ldquoThankfully, however, unlike most major infrastructure projects which can be quite expensive and take the best part of a decade to complete, community green infrastructure can be delivered much quicker and at much less of a cost to the public purse.Mr Hazzard says he is confident that a new greenway project in Downpatrick represents an ldquoexciting opportunity on so many levels and deserves serious consideration.He added: ldquoI look forward to discussing this proposal with senior council management in the weeks ahead..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11434767.jpg","title":"stay safe meeting group latest lockdown rules","story":"Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced last week that in EnglandIn ScotlandIn WalesAnd in Northern IrelandEstablish ground rulesKeep everything outdoors where possibleKeep your distanceAvoid sharingMasks, wipes and sanitiserThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Photo: PA WireArticle  of the Detention of TerroristsOrder  authorises a secretary of state, minister of state or under secretary of state to sign an ICO. As minister of state, I was one of the ministers authorised by that order to sign, and thus to make, ICOs. The Supreme Court’s judgment does not say which minister of state signed the ICO in relation to Gerry Adams. As I say, it may be that my signature was on some of the ICOs made in this period, although they could have been signed by David Windlesham or Paul Channon. Most likely, they would have been signed by David Windlesham as he was specically assigned by Mr Whitelaw to oversee security issues, although we all worked together as a team on all aspects of Northern Ireland’s administration. I note that it was David Windlesham who on  December  moved the motion in the House of Lords that the  Order be approved. He remarked then that “applications for interim custody orders are by no means automatically granted by the secretary of state.Lord Kerr of Tonaghmore, a Justice of the Supreme Court of the UK and former Lord Chief Justice in Northern Ireland, who read out the unanimous judgement in the Gerry Adams case. Photo: Supreme Court PA WireThere is a thorough process of scrutiny before he, or anyone on his behalf, decides whether or not to sign one at all.”It is clear to me that the Supreme Court has misinterpreted the nature and scope of the  Order. The court misunderstands the signicance of Article , which specically provided for a minister of state or undersecretary of state to sign an ICO in the name of the secretary of state.This provision was understood by government in making the order and in exercising it, and by Parliament in the debates about whether to approve the order, to authorise the minister of state or under secretary of state to decide whether an ICO should be made. In so doing, weacted in the name of the secretary of state, who was responsible for the Northern Ireland Officeand the ministerial team and who was, of course, closely involved in many ICO decisions himself, as well as directing which ministers should oversee which aspects of Northern Ireland’s administration.The fundamental failure of the Supreme Court’s judgment is its total misunderstanding of the nature of ministerial and departmental government and methods of operating. A junior minister on duty at Stormont is in effect the persona of Her Majesty’s government and is thereby empowered to act for and as the secretary of state in the latter’s absence. And the secretary of state was often unavoidably absent. In relation to Northern Ireland, it was inherent in the nature of direct rule that the secretary of state had to be frequently in London – in Parliament or the cabinet – and that his responsibilities would often have to be exercised by a junior minister on the ground.On the weekends, one of us was always the duty minister. One minister always had to be available to Parliament, including to answer urgent questions. And those of us who were members of the House of Commons had also toto London frequently to vote .When the order was made, on  November , and when it was approved by Parliament in December , it was certainly contemplated that there would often be cases in which an ICO would need to be made by the minister of state or under secretary of state rather than by the secretary of state himself. The order clearly provides for this to happen. The high number of ICOs that the government anticipated would have to be made, and were in practice made, also helps explain why the order provides that junior ministers may order temporary detention. The Supreme Court’s assertion that it would not have been dficult for the secretary of state to consider each case personally and to make each ICO himself simply does not match the reality.As it happens, almost all signing of ICOs, where the actual signing of the document took place in Stormont Castle, was discussed directly with other ministers and usually with the secretary of state by telephone or message,he had to be in London or his constituency home in Penrith.The secretary of state could not always be directly involved and even when involved in some cases it would often be the minister of state or under secretary of state, in Stormont, who had reviewed the grounds for making an ICO in detail and who was satisfied that an ICO should be made.The minister on duty in Stormont was fully entitled to act in the secretary of state’s name. Other ministers were consulted, to the extent possible, not because this was what the law required, asthe junior minister were simply the mouthpiece of the secretary of state , but because that is how any team of ministers, operating as a team, would act in relation to important matters with political implications for which the secretary of state would have to accept constitutional responsibility.In any case, in relation to Gerry Adams one can be absolutely sure that it would have been discussed most fully and confirmed by the secretary of state before the ICO was made.The political salience and security implications of detaining Mr Adams would have made this unavoidable.I do not know whether there is a record of the secretary of state’s involvement in this case or any other case in which his signature does not appear on the ICO itself. The Supreme Court’s judgment implies not.This may be unsurprising in view of how ICOs were often made, which is to say by a minister of state or under secretary of state in Stormont, with the secretary of state often consulted by message or telephone from London or Penrith, but without a record of that involvement necessarily being kept or now being available. There would have been no reason, and perhaps no capacity, to record the secretary of state’s personal involvement, save in those cases where he himself signed the ICO, because Article  authorised the minister of state to sign the ICO and this signature had itself to be sufficient to authorise detention on the ground in Northern Ireland.But it is a travesty to conclude that because ministers complied with the terms of the  Order, and did not go above and beyond it to somehow record the secretary of state’s involvement, the ICO must now be quashed and the detention ruled unlawful.It is quite startling to see the Supreme Court reasoning that the prosecution had failed in Gerry Adams’s case to prove that the secretary of state had personally authorised his detention. The shape of the  Order makes very clear that an ICO signed by a minister of state or snder secretary of state is the same as an ICO signed by the secretary of state himself and authorises detention. It would have been utterly unworkable for the Royal Ulster Constabulary to have refused to detain suspected terrorists unless and until proof had been provided that an ICO signed by the minister had also been personally considered by the secretary of state. Or for commissioners determining whether there should be continuing detention to have held that they did not have jurisdiction unless and until the secretary of state had provided evidence that he had personally considered whether to make the ICO in question.This would have made the scheme of the  Order simply unworkable. The Supreme Court’s reading of the  Order was not what government intended, or understood, or what Parliament approved. The whole point of the signature requirement in Article  is to make clear who is authorised to make an ICO and thus whose signature on the face of an ICO makes it lawful to detain the person in question.The making of ICOs in -, which the Supreme Court has now denounced as unlawful, was entirely in line with the law, with the wishes of Parliament, with normal ministerial practice and with the immediate security needs of protecting the public from acts of appalling violence and bloodshed . Like Professor Ekins and Sir Stephen, I take the case for legislation to overturn the effect of the Supreme Court’s judgment – to make clear that ICOs signed by a minister of state or under secretary of state were lawful — to be overwhelming. In so legislating, Parliament would be reaffirming its clear, obvious and original intentions and the absolutely normal practices of departmental governance and ministerial responsibility.• Lord Howell of Guildford is the last surviving member of the ministerial team in the Northern Ireland Office, with responsibility under the Detention of TerroristsOrder .

in one of his articles that such a progressive town as Penarth was without an operatic and dramatic society, writes Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Societypresident, Mary Gardner.The response to his outcry was quickly taken up and within three weeks the Penarth Operatic Society was formed.The Societyrsquos first production was Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe, played at The Hippodrome which later burnt down, and what a glittering opening evening it must have been as the audience wore evening dress.The review featured next day read, ldquoBrilliant Initial Performance.More newsVale council issues warning over the use of parksFines increased for coronavirus lockdown breachesMarie Curie Great Blooming Tea Party goes virtualA few years later in , the drama section came into being and with it a new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch

make face masks compulsory public transport","story":"Mark Drakeford said Englands decision to bring in a requirement for coverings had raised issues for people commuting between the two countries.It came as Public Health Wales said a further four people had died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to ,, while the number of positive cases grew by  to ,.More NewsLuxury car manufacturer Aston Martin to axe  jobsMans efforts toWorld War One Penarth soldiers plaque found in New ZealandPenarth RNLI leboat crew rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public transportthe journey is essential and theres no other travel

decision to bring in a requirement for coverings had raised issues for people commuting between the two countries.It came as Public Health Wales said a further four people had died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to ,, while the number of positive cases grew by  to ,.More NewsLuxury car manufacturer Aston Martin to axe  jobsMans efforts toWorld War One Penarth soldiers plaque found in New ZealandPenarth RNLI leboat crew rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public transportthe journey is essential and theres no other travel alternative.\" article_url   content_id
