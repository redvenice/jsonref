[{"url":null,"title":"Only 10 people plan return living exactly did Covid 19","story":"Share this articleThe study by UCL was launched in the week before lockdown began to capture how adults are feeling about the impact of Covid-19 on their own lives.More than 70,000 people have participated in the study, answering questions on their mental health and wellbeing and adherence to government guidance.  Respondents have been asked whether they feel they will change the way they live their lives once the pandemic is over compared to their lives before Covid-19.They rated their feelings on a scale from one to seven, with seven being: \u0027I will entirely change the way I lived compared to before Covid-19\u0027.Findings published today reveal that a fifth (22 per cent) of respondents felt they were more likely to change their lifestyle after Covid-19.This rose to around a quarter for those aged 30-59 (25 per cent) and those with a diagnosed mental illness (26 per cent).Around 16 per cent of people aged over 60 said they would return to living exactly as they had before, more than double (7 per cent) compared to the population below that age. One factor that people were most likely to change was increasing their support for local businesses (40 per cent), with around a third of people also saying they would save more money (33 per cent), exercise more (35 per cent) or make more use of online shopping (33 per cent).A quarter of adults planned to work from home more, which increased to 29 per cent for 18-29 year-olds and 32 per cent for those aged between 30-59.It comes after a study found this week that British workers are the most reluctant in Europe to return because of fears of a second wave of coronavirus.It\u0027s feared that with less people going into work, shops in town centres and business districts will be left without customers for months to come. UCL researchers also found 26 per cent of people across all age groups wanted to spend more time with family outside of their homes or holiday more in the UK. Just under a fifth (18 per cent) of people aged 18-29 expressed a desire to find a new romantic relationship once the pandemic is over. People with a diagnosed mental illness were more likely to report that they would make changes to their lives after Covid-19.Graphs show that those least likely to report lifestyle changes were those who lived alone, are on lower household incomes, and are without children.Cheryl Lloyd, education programme head at the Nuffield Foundation, which is funding the study, said the findings raised important questions about how feasible it is for people on lower incomes to make lifestyle changes.They were \u0027more likely to be in precarious employment and have less disposable income\u0027, which could affect whether they could change their circumstances.Ms Lloyd said: \u0027To be effective, policies should be targeted, and designed in consultation with at-risk groups, to ensure they do not exacerbate existing health and social inequalities.\u0027The study team has received support from research charity Wellcome to launch an international network of studies called Covid-Minds, which will see dozens of scientists and clinicians collate and compare results from mental health studies from around the world.

They are anything but a celebration of national music, like so many lesser festivals.Those eccentrics with their little rituals whom viewers always see at the front of the Last Night crowd are very serious about their music.I have interviewed a few of them over the years. They are an eclectic bunch but the last thing you can accuse them of is jingoism. They might sing Rule Britannia with gusto but they will have been just as enthusiastic for the French, African, Indian – even Finnish – music at other concerts over the season.Besides, Rule Britannia has nothing to do with \u0027enslavement\u0027 as its critics claim. Indeed, the words are an exhortation, not a triumphalist boast. Note that the words say \u0027Britannia, rule the waves\u0027 – not \u0027rules\u0027.The song was written for an 18th-century royal masque about Alfred the Great defeating the Vikings. It acquired its popularity not as a military marching tune, like, say, France\u0027s unashamedly brutal Marseillaise, but as a catchy musical number sung by barmaid-turned-West End star, Kitty Clive. In other words, it\u0027s a Georgian X-Factor hit. It then went on to be a favourite tune of the Royal Navy – the same navy, of course, which abolished slavery.Similarly, Elgar\u0027s Land of Hope and Glory was called no such thing when it was first performed at the Proms in 1901 – because Arthur Benson had not yet got round to writing any words. It was just Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1.These songs have never been imposed on the British public – like a national anthem or school song – but they endure through their universal appeal. The Germans, Brazilians and Japanese whom I have seen singing \u0027Rule Britannia\u0027 at the Royal Albert Hall, while waving their EU flags, had no more enthusiasm for British imperialism than Dalia Stasevska, Jeremy Corbyn or Karl Marx\u0027s cat. Like all the other Prommers, they were there for the music and for the occasion.It is often said that the BBC is far too sensitive to the prevailing wind on Twitter. So the Broadcasting House high-ups must have been mortified to see that the most popular Twitter thread yesterday lunchtime was \u0027#DefundtheBBC\u0027 followed closely by \u0027#RuleBritannia\u0027. Then, the Prime Minister weighed in for the second day running, accusing the BBC of \u0027cringing\u0027 and \u0027wetness\u0027.They need not cringe. Rather, they should point out that it was the BBC which saved the Proms from insolvency in 1927 and which has kept it all going ever since with generations of great musicians, conductors and presenters. Then they should tell their critics on both sides to pipe down and enjoy the music.But perhaps, we should have seen this coming. For last year\u0027s Last Night, the BBC commissioned a new work to open the concert. It was entitled, simply, \u0027Woke\u0027. "},{"url":null,"title":"Half entries Scots Wikipedia revealed work teen doesnt speak language","story":"Share this articleI’ve discovered that almost every single article on the Scots version of Wikipedia is written by the same person - an American teenager who can’t speak Scots : Scotland"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8dcdba061bcc4b105b682ba61814f740807bddd/0_700_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8eaec064a2b44cfab546d9d13684e439","title":"americans and their dreams in pictures","story":"In his new book American Dreams, the Canadian photographer Ian Brown has collected 170 portraits of Americans along with handwritten statements of what the American dream means to them.

At 29, Rijneveld is the youngest winner of the International Booker, and narrowly older than the youngest Booker winner, Eleanor Catton, who was 28 when she won the 2013 prize for The Luminaries.A bestseller in the Netherlands, The Discomfort of Evening follows Jas, a girl in a devout Christian farming family, whose brother dies in an accident after she wishes he would die instead of her rabbit. Lost in grief, her family falls apart as she becomes involved in increasingly dangerous fantasies.Like Jas, Rijneveld grew up in a strict religious community in a rural area of the Netherlands like Jas, their 10-year-old brother died when they were three. Already an award-winning author in the Netherlands, Rijneveld continues to work on a dairy farm, although not that of their parents. “Farming keeps me grounded. The cows are my best friends I like cleaning out the stables and shovelling the shit,” they said in an interview earlier this year.Receiving the prize on Wednesday, Rijneveld said: “I can only say that I am as proud as a cow with seven udders” and called it “a great honour”.In their acceptance speech, Rijneveld said they wrote the words “be relentless” on the wall above their desk while writing their novel.“Today, when the world has been turned upside down and is showing its dark side, I often remember those words. So, write, read, win, lose, love each other, but be relentless in this,” they said.Although the book was published in Dutch in 2018, Rijneveld’s parents had yet to read The Discomfort of Evening, the author told the  in March this year.“I hope that my parents will read it one day and be proud that they will understand it’s a novel, it’s not all about them. But it is probably too soon,” Rijneveld said at the time. In April, they told the New York Times that their mother had finally read it.Rijneveld describes themself not as trans, but as “in between”. “As a small child I felt I was a boy, I dressed like a boy and behaved like a boy, but children at that age are still neutral in their gender. In adolescence, when the separation became clear, I dressed like a girl and became a girl, then at 20 I went back to the boy I was at primary school,” they told the . “It’s difficult for my parents to understand that I’m not the girl that they raised. It’s not in the Bible.”Ted Hodgkinson, chair of the International Booker’s judges, said it had been an immense task to choose a winner from an “exceptional” six-strong shortlist, but that the judges were “unanimous in appreciation” for Rijneveld’s “visceral and virtuosic” novel. Altogether, the panel considered 124 books, translated from 30 languages. The novel “absolutely arrests your attention” from its first page, said Hodgkinson: “There’s something both in the intensity of that creative vision and that perspective of a child, but also the translation, that allows you into that world so immediately and so completely. It’s not a book that you can sit back from.”He called The Discomfort of Evening “shocking”. “It does deal with some very difficult aspects of life – the sudden death of a brother, a family grieving, some of the more unyielding aspects of a religious upbringing, the quite stark backdrop of a Dutch dairy farm, which can be quite a tough place for a child,” he said.“And yet, there’s something about the inquisitive gaze, that poetic perspective on those things, the ability to see in the everyday something remarkable, extraordinary. Even though it is a book that takes you through some difficult and unsettling cases, it has that ability to make the world new. And I think that is something, especially in our distracted and unsettled moment, to find fiction that has the ability to absolutely root you where you are in the irreducible truth of another life.”The International Booker is given every year to a novel or short story collection translated into English and published in the UK or Ireland, and has been won in the past by titles including Celestial Bodies by Omani author Jokha Alharthi, translated by Marilyn Booth from Arabic, and The Vegetarian by South Korean author Han Kang and her translator Deborah Smith.Hodgkinson, head of literature and the spoken word at Southbank Centre, was joined on this year’s judging panel by Lucie Campos, director of the Villa Gillet, France’s centre for international writing Jennifer Croft, who previously won the prize in 2018 for her translation of Olga Tokarczuk’s novel Flights author Valeria Luiselli and writer, poet and musician Jeet Thayil."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f693dedaa1666d79c7db7e831f60558e135180b0/0_1002_4262_2557/master/4262.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=a83aeffbdf3b7cc7cc2b410664b83a84","title":"businesses and customers share your experiences of eat out to help out","story":"We’d like to hear to from staff, owners and customers on how they feel the scheme has beenThe government’s ‘eat out to help out’ scheme has meant more than 64m meals have been claimed since the beginning of August.When introduced, its aim was to incentivise the public to dine at restaurants by allowing customers to claim a half-price discount up to a cost of £10.

The amount of time a home is put up for sale before it finds a buyer has fallen to just 27 days since restrictions were eased, compared to 39 days over the same period in 2019.Big homes in the countryside are shifting fastest, while urban flats typically aimed at first-time buyers are now the slowest market segment.The robust property market is in sharp contrast to the state of the UK economy, which contracted far more than that of any other developed country in the second quarter of 2020, according to figures from the OECD. Richard Donnell of Zoopla said: “The ‘once in a lifetime’ re-evalution of housing requirements on the back of the lockdown is a counterweight to the impact of the recession on the UK housing market.”The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) on Wednesday issued fresh guidance to mortgage lenders, telling them to extend forebearance to householders who are coming to the end of their payment holiday but are still in financial distress.Around two million people have taken a mortgage holiday since the pandemic began, equal to around one in six of all mortgages in the UK. Applications under the mortgage holiday scheme can be made until 31 October.Charlotte Nixon, mortgage expert at Quilter Financial Planning, said: “Assuming that the payment holidays are not extended past October, the guidance is clear that the onus is still very much on lenders to help customers get through this difficult period.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ffe873ffe801fee8b233a19ca11fccf3d127d35c/111_220_2059_1236/master/2059.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93ccd25f06ede2617e4a7a459d063a61","title":"ftse 100 jay jerome powell speech federal reserve inflation targeting coronavirus covid 19 economy business live","story":"Rolling live coverage of business, economics and financial markets as investors anticipate new approach to inflationThe pandemic caused a surge in online shopping in many major markets, and particularly for groceries that had seemed (oddly) resistant to the trend before then.But Delivery Hero - a German rival to Anglo-Dutch Just Eat Takeaway, the UK’s Deliveroo and the US’s Uber Eats - clearly thinks it will be a growth area: it announced a $360m (£270m) deal for InstaShop, a grocery delivery company.The company only operates in the United Arab Emirates, Lebanon, Egypt, Bahrain, and Greece, the home country of the founders, Ioanna Angelidaki and John Tsioris.The company had only ever raised $7m from investors previously, according to TechCrunch, so it is a huge gain for the founders and early investors - not to mention an eye-catching moment for the Greek tech scene.One of the big business news stories from earlier this morning was the resignation of the boss of TikTok, the Chinese social network that has found itself at the middle of a geopolitical struggle.Tik Tok’s chief executive, Kevin Mayer, has quit just months after his appointment, amid a “sharply changed” political environment after Donald Trump accused the platform of threatening national security.The Financial Times reported on Thursday that the former Disney executive would be replaced in the interim by Vanessa Pappas, the general manager. In a letter to staff, parts of which have been seen by the , Mayer said he had decided to leave after Trump ordered TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance, to sell its US assets to a US company within 90 days.You can read the full report from the ’s Helen Davidson here:There’s more from WPP, the world’s biggest advertising agency, which announced a big writedown on the value of previous acquisitions, and a big loss, but still beat market expectations.Chief executive Mark Read was speaking to reporters this morning. Asked if the multi-billion pound write-down was the fault of Sorrell, who has always had a penchant for making the big deal, Read said:I don’t think we are saying that. It relates primarily to Y\u0026ampR Group, before my time, which was acquired in 2000 at the height of the market in a stock transaction when both Y\u0026ampR and WPP group’s stock were also high. Andy Golding, the bank’s chief executive, said:We expect to deliver double digit underlying net loan book growth for the full year.The share price bump has gone at least some way towards making up for recent share price falls - although it’s nowhere near pre-pandemic levels.John Cronin, banks analyst at Goodbody, a stockbroker, said:Another data point for investors and central bankers to add to the mix from earlier: an apparently strong rebound from Chinese industry.China was of course by all indications the source of the coronavirus outbreak, but a very strict lockdown relatively early on has meant that much of its industry has reopened.This is from the Reuters report:Profits at China’s industrial firms grew for a third straight month in July and at the fastest pace since June 2018, marking a bright spot in the economy as the manufacturing sector slowly recovers from its coronavirus slump.The eyes of the oil industry are on the US east coast at the moment to see what will happen with Hurricane Laura and its effect on production, but in the UK there has been another reminder of the chaos in the industry as prices have plunged.British oil well drilling tools company Hunting has revealed that it has cut 624 jobs during the first half of the year with the closure of multiple sites in the US.WPP has reported a £2.6bn loss in the first half after the impact of the pandemic prompted the company to wipe billions off the value of expensive advertising acquisitions made by founder and former chief executive sir Martin Sorrell.However, the world’s largest advertising group, which has shed 5,000 jobs in the first six months, surprised investors by re-instating its idend declaring that the worst is now behind it, assuming there is no second wave of the virus. WPP’s loss was mainly down to the decision to write-down the value of certain advertising agency assets in light of the impact of Covid-19. The majority of the £2.5bn non-cash write down of ad assets relates to purchase of Young \u0026amp Rubicam in 2000. The global agency group was acquired by Sorrell in a $4.5bn stock deal, which propelled WPP to become the world’s biggest marketing service group. Assuming there is no second wave nor major lockdowns, the second quarter is expected to be the toughest period of the year, although we remain cautious on the speed of the recovery.The company, which is seeking to make cost savings of £700m to £800m this year, said that its headcount has dropped from 106,000 to 101,000 in the first half due to voluntary leavers who haven’t been repacked and redundancies. Stock markets have also retreated across Europe after an initial flurry of positivity (in Germany and France at least).Jet engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce is the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 after revealing a £5.4bn loss and a plan to sell assets to shore up its creaking balance sheet.Rolls-Royce has been hit hard by the decline in air travel, which has caused a massive hit to the revenues it earns from servicing jet engines. Total revenues fell by a quarter to £5.8bn in the first half of 2020.The company is in the middle of its biggest ever restructuring of its civil aviation business. Some 4,000 employees have already left out of an expected 9,000, and the company will close sites in Lancashire and Nottinghamshire. That has been criticised by Unite, the union, after Rolls-Royce said it would move some of the work to Singapore and Germany.The massive loss included a big £2.6bn write-off related to currency hedging and £1.1bn in other impairments, but its underlying loss before tax was still £3.2bn.Good morning, and welcome to our live coverage of business, economics and financial markets.It is the day investors have been looking forward to throughout August: US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell will make a much anticipated speech in which he is expected to address the central bank’s future approach to monetary policy.US stocks had hit new record highs last night, but now investors are now mostly positioned ahead of the Powell speech, which will also coincide with more detailed second-quarter GDP figures from the US and pandemic-hit initial jobless claims: it could be a bumpy opening on Wall Street later.Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at AvaTrade, a trading platform, said:There is an element of caution among investors as the Fed chairman, Jerome Powell, will deliver a speech on a monetary policy framework later today. Dow Jones and the S\u0026ampP 500 futures are likely to experience higher volatility on the back of this. The future of the coronavirus stock market rally is highly dependent on the Fed’s monetary policy stance.Oil market investors will also be closely watching news from the Louisiana coast, where Hurricane Laura has just made landfall. The strength of the hurricane has prompted fears of a large human cost amid the pandemic, and it has also forced a shutdown in oil production that rivals Hurricane Katrina 15 years ago.Brent crude oil futures prices have edged up this morning to $45.70 per barrel for the North Sea benchmark.

It shouldn’t have to be such an act of courageBritish television is failing us. It’s excluding stories, talent, on and offscreen, and promoting only a “pathetic” number of people from minority-ethnic backgrounds to positions of power.These are not my contemporary thoughts. They’re the verdict of broadcasting chiefs back in 2000, when I was still in my teens. Twenty years ago all Britain’s major broadcasters were together promising to radically improve ersity and representation, to stop the “endless meetings” and to reflect the “plain realities of life”.It was an era when David Olusoga – a man now recognised as one of the best historians and presenters on British TV – found himself, in his own words, “sidelined, dismissed and desperately unhappy”. Giving the MacTaggart lecture at the Edinburgh TV festival this week, he disclosed that the racism and prejudice he encountered had left him “so isolated and so devalued that I twice slipped into clinical depression”. Olusoga’s candour and courage prompted widespread media coverage. That he described his experience so eloquently on such a prestigious platform was certainly news yet the content of that experience, for many other minority-ethnic people who work in TV, was not.The subtext was important. Olusoga admitted his reluctance to expose himself so honestly before what he described as “the tribes of television”, because it was a genuine unknown to him if, at the end of it, he would still have a career. That speaks to the penalty attached to drawing on your lived experiences of racism, in an attempt to make things better. These acts of public service – offered in a spirit of tough love for the media industry we so value – can prompt summary punishment. In order for the industry to progress, it seems, we must take the personal risks.This is a conversation that the Alternative MacTaggart, a companion event to the one featuring Olusoga, echoed when I met the presenter, activist and actor Jameela Jamil. Our discussion, which is broadcast today, centred on Jamil’s experience of being vilified by the media for calling out the body shaming, racist, ableist and non-inclusive practices that still remain standard. Having lived with mental ill health, disability and a near fatal accident, she felt she had sufficiently little to lose to do it anyway. That doesn’t explain or justify the personal abuse she faces for telling the truth.Jamil and I first bonded online as members of the small but vocal group of people of colour attacked by Piers Morgan. That he and other powerful white gatekeepers are rewarded for degrading minority voices is the flipside to understanding why Olusoga felt he might be penalised for simply using his.One of the favourite activities of these gatekeepers is manufacturing fake culture wars, as a device to claim minority communities are trying to erase the history and identity of white British people. That ploy made another comeback this week in a faux debate about Rule, Britannia! being performed on the Last Night of the Proms.Despite no evidence of any group – minority or otherwise – trying to “ban” the song from the annual BBC music festival, newspapers were reporting a “battle”, pitting an imagined army of black and brown people against the perceived decent, white classical-music-loving folk on the other side. “Confident, forward-looking nations don’t erase their history,” said the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden.Curious then, that historians such as Olusoga who promote knowledge of our past have faced so many decades of hostility.It’s bad enough that Olusoga was once told by a white TV colleague to behave more like a drug dealer (true story), and that Anne Alexander – the ITV political producer who has, for 20 years, been the only black woman in that position in Britain – was assumed by an MP to be a waitress. It’s a normal experience to show up on set for a live show or scripted series and find, as Noel Clarke revealed this week he had, an all-white crew.This won’t change while we have a government more interested in its invented culture war than in taking the steps needed to improve the industry. This is not a favour we are asking.

They want to know what will be done to eliminate future risks over the 25-year regeneration project.“There has been no proper investigation into how this contaminated site is affecting our health,” said Angela Fonso, of Cash, which wants the government to initiate a detailed study on the impact of the site in the context of the local population, one of the most deprived in London. “I don’t believe this environmental injustice would happen in a more affluent white area.”It is thought that living in areas with toxic air is one of the reasons people from ethnic minorities have suffered a disproportionate number of deaths from Covid-19.A Public Health England (PHE) spokesperson said: “The local authority is responsible for the health of its local population and any public health studies or analyses are for the local authority and its public health team to either carry out or commission.”The site of the former gasworks and chemicals factory has been dogged by controversy since Boris Johnson used mayoral powers in 2010 to overrule Ealing council’s decision against development. Since work began in 2016 to clean the 88-acre site of hydrocarbons including benzene, naphthalene and cyanide, dozens of residents in local streets have complained that a petrol-like smell from the site has been making them sick.Berkeley cleaned – or remediated – the soil on the site of contaminants in an open-air “soil hospital”. It was decided cleaning the soil was safer than transporting contaminated material along residential streets.In July 2018 the Environment Agency (EA) was called in and ordered the Berkeley Group to take steps to mitigate the odour, which the developer complied with.Campaigners claim the problems have persisted and last year crowdfunded for consultation to pursue legal action against the developer. The Berkeley Group has said “any legal action, if and when it materialises, will be vigorously opposed”.“No one wants to take responsibility for us and we’re paying the price with our lives. We’ve been knocking on the doors of the council, PHE, EA and politicians for years,” claimed Joginder Singh Bhangu, a campaigner. “Our community has fallen through the cracks.”Because of its scale, the gasworks redevelopment has multiple regulators: it is up to the EA to regulate the soil and advise Ealing on management of land affected by contamination Ealing has responsibility for investigating complaints of statutory nuisance and PHE are supposed to protect the health of the public. “Covid is showing that health is not just about numbers but about people,” said Araceli Camargo, co-founder of Centric Lab, whose report argues that the health risks of the site can’t be determined by the regulatory limits. The specific challenges to the health of people in Southall, such as overcrowding, stress and poverty, should have been evaluated before introducing a major new source of air pollution, she said.On Beaconsfield Road, a long artery from the junction near the station along the site boundary to a primary school, Bhangu regularly checks on the health of neighbours. Many gardens adjoin the site, where almost 4,000 homes will be built. “Of course we are more worried about coronavirus here, with all the chemicals,” he said. has interviewed dozens of residents of Beaconsfield Road and nearby streets to ask about their health since 2016. Of 48 who returned questionnaires to the , all said they had suffered breathing problems, and 42 said symptoms had led them to the GP. Other symptoms reported included eye problems, headaches, mental confusion and nausea. Arevik and Ashok Martirosyan invited the  to see an oxygen chamber they had rented for their seven-year-old daughter after she began having fainting fits. Around the same time both parents said they had experienced vomiting attacks, and suggested the symptoms were linked to “this very bad smell from the site”.That data – the only available – was provided by consultants for Berkeley, but residents believe Ealing should have conducted its own for comparison. The lack of any legal requirement for the council to do so, or for any of the regulators to act after PHE findings about chemical levels in March 2019, raises questions about the accountability to residents next to one of the UK’s biggest brownfield sites.Last March PHE found that levels of naphthalene, a possible carcinogen, needed to be “reduced urgently” to protect residents’ long-term health. PHE told the  to “get in touch with Ealing council to find out what actions have been taken as a result of the findings in the public health risk assessment”. Ealing council leader Julian Bell told residents in a virtual meeting on 16 July 2020 that chemical levels have been dropping since the soil hospital was dismantled last April.Dr Onkar Sahota, a London assembly member and GP, said that – as the planning authority with the duty of care to residents – Ealing must establish its own independent monitoring of the site for the next phase of development. “The cost of the independent monitoring consultants should be borne by the developer. Representatives of Cash should be on the appointment panel in equal number to those from Ealing council for appointing the new independent consultants to monitor for air quality, carcinogenic and noxious pollutants in the atmosphere,” said Sahota, who said work should stop while the health impact is investigated.Ealing council said it was “determining the criteria for establishing an independent air quality monitoring network around the development”.In any case, the data PHE looked at does not exclude risks to health. Air quality expert Prof Roy Harrison from the University of Birmingham told the : “The VOCs here are much higher than you would expect to see in normal streets,” adding that there would be little dilution of air pollution from the site at homes on the boundary and that naphthalene is “efficient” at getting indoors.Data he saw “well exceeded” PHE’s own guidelines for naphthalene, he said. “In one report, consultants had performed a calculation to estimate the likely annual average concentrations of pollutants, including naphthalene. This gave an annual mean in excess of the WHO recommendation of 10 micrograms per cubic metre. Notably, in a recent report, PHE recommended a lower guideline of 3 micrograms per cubic metre.”Prof Alan Boobis, a toxicologist from Imperial College, said many chemicals, including naphthalene, could explain residents’ symptoms, and stressed the mental toll of worrying about the air they breathe. “Once people are aware that chemical levels are excessive and associated with harm, they react badly to this toxicity and the behavioural response is real,” he suggested, likening this to post-traumatic stress disorder.Residents are now bracing for the next phase of the Southall Waterside development, when National Grid will remediate soil around the blue gas-holder that once signalled the way for planes arriving at Heathrow. It said it had taken “significant control measures” after seeing residents’ video testimonials about the impact of the site.Fonso said: “We want work to cease at Southall Waterside for mitigation measures to be improved during any remediation and for Berkeley to follow the lead of National Grid, which is erecting enclosures, air-filtering systems and removing contaminated soil from the site to protect residents from harmful odours, vapours and dust.”Berkeley did not comment on any plans for further remediation, saying: “This is a highly regulated activity and all work has been closely monitored and approved by the authorities, including the London Borough of Ealing and Environment Agency.”Residents worried about the planned Berkeley St William gasworks developments in East London, and in Brighton, have contacted the Southall campaign for advice.Bhangu, stopping to talk to an elderly neighbour on Beaconsfield Road, said: “What would I say to the other communities where there will be a gasworks redevelopment? Get ready for the nightmare.”Prof Kevin Fenton, London regional director for PHE, said: “The Southall Waterside air quality data provided to PHE has been compared to a variety of available health-based air quality guidelines … for the detected chemicals. The results from our assessments show that there is unlikely to be a risk to the long-term health of the nearby population from chemicals detected.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32ca53495a95a93169ceca94a31be17bf0dcd10e/0_343_5315_3191/master/5315.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=5df82387da36065ad30b5a5d47134567","title":"no stampede for seats as blockbuster returns to bristols cinemas","story":"While cinemas said film fans were ‘flocking back’, the mid-morning screening of Christopher Nolan’s Tenet was by no means fullJack Twell, a 24-year-old film student, was first to arrive for the mid-morning screening of Tenet at the Showcase Cinema de Lux in Bristol city centre. His was no dramatic entrance for Christopher Nolan’s high-concept action romp: he arrived on a folding bike and patiently waited for the doors to open. But still, it felt significant.“It is an important moment,” said Twell. “I’m super-excited. I don’t know if this is the film that will save cinema but it is wonderful to be here waiting to see a new Christopher Nolan film.”Twell and his film school friends have been watching old favourites at the cinema, including Lord of the Rings and Star Wars movies in recent weeks. “But it’s great to be here seeing something new and big,” he said.The 10.30am screening was by no means full. About a dozen film fans, mostly young men, arrived. They were greeted by friendly staff telling them the rules – face coverings had to be worn, don’t go within 2 metres of anyone not in your party, use the hand sanitisers and so on.Cinemas reopened in July but have struggled to get people through the doors. Staggered screening times, empty seats to enforce social distancing and deep cleaning routines have hampered recovery.After several studios pulled their summer releases as a result of Covid – including the new James Bond and Disney’s live action Mulan – Tenet is the first blockbuster to be released during the pandemic.Even before coronavirus, Tenet, which stars John David Washington, Robert Pattinson and Kenneth Branagh, was set to be one of the biggest releases of the year. Now, theatre chains are seeing it as their saviour.Showcase was keen to talk the launch up, of course, describing Wednesday as “the biggest day for UK cinema since lockdown” and said film fans were “flocking back” to cinemas nationwide.By lunchtime Bristol was packed with shoppers and diners but it was clear that many more people seemed interested in queuing for coffee or pizza than the Nolan film.Pam Green, who was visiting family in Bristol, paused to look at the screen times (Tenet was being shown every half an hour up to 9pm). “I think I’ll give it a few weeks and wait until everyone has seen it,” she said. “I know they’re spacing people out but I think I’ll wait until the fuss has died down.”Up at the lovely 1920s Everyman cinema on Whiteladies Road, film fans were being tempted back. Here the clientele was more mixed – families and couples.Mother and son Margaret and David Evans were among the first up the steps and through the doors making use of the sanitiser (‘Lights, camera, hand gel’ was the message on the cleansing station).The last film the family saw was Parasite, at the Everyman. “That was a different world,” said Margaret. “We’ve really missed it. This is the first time we’ve been inside to see something. I’m keen to get back to normal life as much as possible. This is a big part of that for me.”David, 16, added: “It’s an important film. They need to try and get people back. There’s nothing like the cinema. Hopefully it will be good, too.”Jon Older, an assistant director of film about to start work on the new series of the television crime drama Vera, could not remember the last movie he saw at a cinema.“I usually see a film at the cinema once a week. I like Christopher Nolan’s movies and expect great things. It’s extremely important for the industry. We’re all staggering back to work. Releasing this film now seems a bit of a gamble but you’ve got to start somewhere.”The audience figures will come later but Everyman described its pre-sales as “very encouraging” and said its teams across the country were looking forward to welcoming people back.On the Bristol harbourside, the independent Watershed venue has opted not to show the Nolan film when it reopens next week.Instead it will screen movies including the acclaimed Bait, about life in a Cornish fishing village, and classics such as Sunset Boulevard and North by Northwest.The Watershed cinema curator, Mark Cosgrove, said he had counted 77 screenings of Tenet in and around Bristol on day one. “Tenet is readily available for anyone who would like to see it,” he said. “It’s got enough exposure. It’s not all about tentpole releases. There are other kinds of cinema being made and other film cultures happening. That’s what we want to show.”Cosgrove said Watershed’s advance ticket sales were healthy. “It’s a nervous time but the sales are giving me confidence.”Almost three hours after his arrival, Twell was back out in the sunshine, blinking and suitably bowled over. “It was great, really gripping and entertaining, brilliantly shot.” And happily for the cinema industry: “I’ll have to go back a second time to try to completely understand it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0cd21cd4f81cd256b7c0466911469cbe98fa49df/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=acbfbec05503144590a382727a60f396","title":"grassroots groups hold beirut together yet big ngos suck up the cash lebanon","story":"Local charities work constantly to support Lebanese society. It’s time they had a fair share of foreign aidEvery person in Lebanon has probably been asked: “Where were you during the Beirut port explosion?”My response is always the same: I was here, in Beirut.On 4 August, when the explosion ignited our skies, I was here – fighting for my life as windows, doors, and buildings collapsed around me. I was still here in the painful hours that followed, working with fellow activists to spearhead clean-up efforts, distribute food and rescue neighbours trapped under the rubble. And when it was revealed that our government’s alleged negligence led to the fatal blast, I remained here – on the streets with my sisters – to demand justice. We were among the first to respond to this disaster. We were here before international aid workers arrived, before France hosted an international aid conference for the humanitarian response, and before the dust settled on our now devastated city.In Lebanon, the critical contributions of local groups to humanitarian action were clear well before Beirut’s port burst into flames. Grassroots organisations have played a vital role in our country’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic, including sharing health information with LGBTQ+ people, refugees, migrant workers, and other marginalised populations. When we recorded a rise in cases of domestic violence during the lockdown, feminist groups stepped in to provide protection and psychosocial services for survivors.Donors must also work collaboratively with organisations to ensure funds are flexible and accessible – especially given Lebanon’s current economic crisis, where bank limitations and high fees create barriers to receiving money quickly. At the same time, international organisations must ensure local organisations – including feminist groups – can attend humanitarian coordination meetings and participate in other decision-making processes in response to the explosion. This means conducting meetings in Arabic.Decisions made now in response to the Beirut blast will affect my country’s destiny for generations. As trusted community leaders and local experts, we must be included in decisions that will shape our country’s future.• Hayat Mirshad is the head of communications and campaigning at the NGO Lebanese Democratic Women’s Gathering, RDFL"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0b7e2a1fbea15ad4cc66f2794378f2a83cb1cc7/0_0_2953_1772/master/2953.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=dda4b12101d9051fca2dcc1620cf15e0","title":"living in the uk are you planning to move out of a city or urban area","story":"We would like to hear from people who are moving to smaller towns or more rural areas and what their reasons areAre you planning on moving out of a city?Some have noticed an increase in people wanting to move out of cities amid an increase in home working and a desire for more outside space.Whether you are buying or renting, if you are moving out of a city centre to a more suburban or rural area, we would like to hear from you.

She also got widespread support from the party’s LGBT+ group.Strategically, both will have to contend with an altered political landscape where Labour’s disenchanted supporters may drift back to the party under the leadership of Keir Starmer.Moran said: “I am immensely proud of the positive and hopeful campaign my team have run, and I have sent my heartfelt thanks to all the volunteers who helped me.“Both Ed and I have committed to implement the general election review and improve ersity in our party.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e1d4a28013dbd7f7a32ae796f9538797936d9c9/0_266_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=20bc79fa81376ce3e4d9e1c4b805cbb0","title":"a post pandemic guide for retailers think of your customers as your biggest fans","story":"Lockdown has shown us that people will support the brands they want to succeed – a business expert’s advice to store ownersThe retail sector has been in flux for some time and, post coronavirus, there’s more uncertainty to come.“There is a lot of talk about ‘returning to normal’ or of the ‘new normal’, but prior to the pandemic the only normal was that everything was changing,” says business consultant Neil Gibb. The pandemic has simply accelerated that transformation, he said ahead of a British Retail Consortium webinar on the impact of Covid-19.Even an industry that has weathered its fair share of storms has never seen an event of this size and significance, and it’s becoming clear that the rules of engagement are changing. As retailers navigate uncharted waters, these are the rules that matter right now:Put safety firstAbove all, responsible businesses have to prioritise safety, both for staff and customers. According to Kyle Monk, head of retail insights and analytics at the British Retail Consortium, retailers are working hard on both implementing safety measures and communicating them clearly. Luckily, technology is on our side when it comes to designing systems that put safety first, but not at the expense of the customer experience. He cites a technology company that has shop assistants available by video screen in-store. The remote shop assistants can engage with you in a similar way in which they would normally.While it may seem at first that the new retail environment will not make the most fun of shopping experiences, with creativity, innovation and by utilising tech, companies can get the balance right.Be collaborative“The scale of the pandemic and the speed with which we’ve had to adopt a new way of living has left many of us feeling uncertain – especially retailers,” says Andrew Lawson, senior vice-president EMEA for Zendesk, a customer relationship management software company. The good news, however, is that a sense of optimism is emerging as businesses deal successfully with unstable operating conditions. “We’ve seen incredible stories of resilience coming out of the pandemic, as retailers and their suppliers band together to maintain the flow of goods,” says Lawson.This collaborative spirit will be important for the industry if it is to retain momentum, share best practice and agree about what support may be needed from the government. “It’s kind of unprecedented,” says Monk. “I don’t think, to be honest, any other industry is coordinating in the way that retail is at the moment.”PrioritiseWhile some retailers have launched e-commerce platforms in record time – one European chain that had around 1,000 stores but no e-commerce platform, managed to launch one in 13 weeks – Lawson suggests that incremental digital transformation might be the better way forward. Zendesk is finding that many of its customers are reluctant to invest time and money in total digital transformation when there is still so much uncertainty. “The priority is to identify solutions that can deliver returns on investment quickly,” he says. “For example, by looking at an omnichannel approach, you can bring all the information you have on a customer together in one place. This will provide your marketing and sales teams with invaluable insights.”Support your staffWe may never return to business as usual but, according to Lawson, companies can move forward by supporting and listening to feedback from staff. He also emphasises the connection between a happy and valued workforce, and the ability to be agile, scalable and resilient. “By helping employees adapt to new systems and processes through training and regular communication, and by really listening to feedback, the new styles and systems that we work under really can work for everyone,” he says.Appeal to your fansThere has never been a better time for companies to revisit their core purpose – building a trusted and valued brand. Research from Zendesk shows that customers have been more patient during the pandemic. While the volume of service requests and wait times have gone up, customer satisfaction remains fairly steady, indicating brand loyalty. Customers will support the brands that they want to succeed, says Monk.And Gibb believes successful retailers won’t have customers going forward, they’ll have loyal fans – people who care deeply about what that brand really stands for. For decision-makers in the retail business, who feel that the ground is constantly shifting beneath them, focusing on purpose could provide a much needed stable foundation.Things are changing fast.

Managers can boost their own productivity and that of their team by being clear about their priorities for any given day or week, and encouraging others to do the same.Aligning those priorities with the company’s objectives will keep even a remote team moving in the right direction, says Chris Bailey, author of Hyperfocus: How to Work Less to Achieve More. “The greatest challenge that businesses face in normal times is orienting what everybody’s working on toward what the purpose of the business is … and that’s still the case,” he says. “The more intentional we are about how we work and what we work on, the more productive we become.”Where priorities have changed, it’s important to communicate that effectively to staff, says Sarah Manning, senior HR director at Zendesk, a customer relationship management software company. “I can’t imagine many organisations didn’t have to pivot in some way in lockdown. Leaders need to be really clear now about what the expectation of their teams are going to be and put in measures to help people adapt.”Empower staff to find their way of workingProductivity can be difficult to measure, but focusing on the tasks achieved rather than the hours someone is at their desk can boost efficiency. Despite reports that lockdown led to an upsurge in demand for workforce surveillance tools, Eyre-White says that such an approach is unlikely to be effective. “Inidually, everyone needs to do different things in order to be productive,” she adds. “I just do not see how a surveillance system is compatible with that.”Instead, businesses should be encouraging staff to find what works for them – some people might be most productive if they go for a walk in the morning, others might take short breaks after 45 minutes of focused work, while some team members might need to work around a young family at home.Projecting empathy for the circumstances many of us find ourselves in is important, says Manning. Particularly at present. “Life is crazy right now. I think employers need to acknowledge that.”Promote good communicationWhen it comes to managing virtual teams, good communication is key to ensuring staff feel supported and informed. “Once a company has made a decision, communicate it clearly,” says Manning. “You need to be careful not to go out with half a message and cause a whole lot of anxiety for people.”Keeping communication channels open can promote a culture of collaboration.Apps such as Zoom, Slack, other digital tools and internal help desks can help ensure “people still feel engaged, connected and therefore invested”, says Manning. Zendesk, for example, has held remote quizzes, yoga classes and Friday night drinks during lockdown. There are other examples of companies holding digital book clubs, remote murder mystery games, and scavenger hunts.“Anything you can do as a manager to foster meaningful connections between employees will go a long way,” Bailey says.It’s OK to have down timeStaff may be working from home, but it’s important not to encourage an “always on” culture that blurs the boundaries between work life and home life, Eyre-White says. “There’s this idea of e-presenteeism and needing to be seen,” she adds. “Staff can’t be seen in the office so they may feel they need to be replying to their emails or messages instantly. And that’s not how you get productive work done. You need time away from those things. Businesses need to be clear that it’s OK.”One way to set the tone is to offer training to managers to help them adapt to working with, and supporting, remote teams. Simple measures can set an example, such as resisting the temptation to email outside work hours, and blocking out time for breaks on a calendar that the team has access to.No one should feel guilty about taking a break from work, says Bailey. “Focusing on things all day long is one of the worst things we can do because our mind just needs a chance to wander. Mind the guilt that you experience around relaxation and know that it’s a phenomenon most of us experience.”Embrace flexibilityAlongside the difficulties of the past few months, for many firms there have also been opportunities for lasting change.“If going remote didn’t kill a business, companies are going to have to decide their answer when employees ask: ‘Can I work from home?’” Manning says. “There are huge benefits from a cost perspective … and I do think companies can potentially attract more candidates and more ersity.”Staying flexible – and that might mean some staff work remotely in the long term – will help foster an inclusive, productive culture that has broader benefits.“This has definitely opened our eyes up to those different possibilities,” Manning adds. “We are going to have a much more flexible approach to where people can work and how they work.”Things are changing fast.

A huge drop in sales during March seemed to sound the death knell for at least some sectors of the industry. Online sales, on the other hand, have rocketed and new approaches are emerging among those retailers that are learning to be agile.“Covid-19 has really accelerated a bunch of inevitables. A lot of things are just happening a lot faster,” says Steve Hewett, global vice president for retail customer experience at the tech and consultancy firm Capgemini.For many companies, online is exploding. “This was already happening,” says Hewett. “But some companies are achieving the sort of online growth in weeks that they expected in three or four years.”This has implications for how companies do business, and it’s likely to be crucial to be able to deliver a hybrid onlineoffline experience to the post-Covid-19 customer. Here are five trends currently reshaping the retail sector:Brands are getting chattierIt seems that customers engaged with brands more during lockdown. “For years, buying something meant going to a physical place, seeing the branding in the store and understanding who that brand is,” says Adrian McDermott, president of products at Zendesk, a customer relationship management software company. “We need to establish the digital equivalents of finding, meeting and having those conversations.”Prices could remain “sticky”Rajesh Bhargave, a consumer behaviour expert, suggests that retailers need to be wary of changing their prices – whether up or down. “Consumers tend to remember what they paid previously and would view price increases as unjust in poor economic conditions.”Dropping prices is not always the answer either. Many consumers will have taken a financial hit and their wallets will be closed for concessionary spending. A knee-jerk reaction might be to cut prices to bring back that demand but, says Bhargave, associate professor of marketing at Imperial College Business School in London, this could have negative long-term effects and erode pricing power: “If you’ve been paying £10 for a meal and suddenly that’s £8 you start to wonder about the quality of the meal.”Brands have to add valueInstead of dropping prices, brands are likely to start looking at different ways to add value, says Bhargave. “If people want to dine at restaurants, they might want a more private and safe experience,” he says. “So how can you start offering a different service that charges a higher price and offers better value?”Video calling is another area that business is only starting to explore. “With so much taking place on Zoom, is there a higher-end service you can provide in this area?” Selfridges, for example, is offering online beauty and styling appointments, with products then delivered to customers at home.This is part of a move towards getting more revenue from fewer people, and appointments for in-store shopping also fall into this category. “It’s all part of offering a more customised, high-end experience,” says Bhargave.To bring the joy back into shopping, some stores are putting their energies into their window displays to encourage browsing and others are providing queue entertainment.The need for a new kind of agilityThings may never be the same. “We’ve almost got to hit the reset button,” says Hewett. “People are returning to school and the office and there’s no playbook on what the wants and needs are.” Moreover, whatever they are could change dramatically again. Hewett adds: “There’s an organisational need for agility that wasn’t there before, as brands aren’t able to be as tactical as they would like.”Things are changing fast. But you can be faster.

Despite government support, having to close their doors for months had a crippling effect on many and forced them to take action to keep afloat.For Steve Sanderson, founder of the independent menswear retailer Oi Polloi, lockdown pressed fast forward on an already tough situation for small businesses. The company’s store in Manchester has always been at its heart, but it also has a strong online and social presence. “Bricks and mortar operations are really difficult,” he says. “What’s going on at the moment is sort of a super fast wormhole journey into the future.”Sanderson says that things are going to be particularly tough for fashion stores, with an inevitable drop in footfall, plus the issues of being Covid-19-secure, such as being unable to let customers try on clothes unless the items are quarantined or cleaned afterwards. “If people can’t try things on, why would they come in to a clothes shop?” he asks.There are, though, some rays of hope. “We have a good connection with customers through our bricks and mortar business, and certain people will always like that. But we can’t afford to just be open – we have to find a way of making it work.“We’ll have to adapt and become something else, something people can’t get from anywhere else. I like the idea of click and collect because you can do something quite interesting with that. You could then also narrow down the time the store itself is open.”For Michelle Drew, co-founder of Established 25 Atelier, which sells fashion and home accessories, the coronavirus crisis forced her to reassess her ambitions. Before lockdown, Drew, who started in 2017 making scarves and bags for friends and family, was selling at a quarterly design market in Greenwich and had a monthly stall at Spitalfields market. When Covid-19 brought things grinding to a halt, her first thought was that she needed to get her website up and running, and really engage online. “I didn’t have a choice,” she says.Since then, Drew has joined online workshops and used the time to rethink her plans. “Previously, I thought I’d love to collaborate with other designers and have a premises. I’m now wondering if that’s the way forward, because so much has changed and I’m not sure things will ever be the same.”While Drew plans to return to physical selling at some point, she sees her business relying more on online trading. “It’s still a precarious situation. I definitely will return to the markets because I enjoy the contact, but I’m looking at other ways to move the business forward.”Bigger retailers, too, have faced challenges, for all their greater resources. Some have come through with flying colours, though, particularly if they had the right technology to hand.For Tesco, the coronavirus crisis brought an unprecedented surge in demand, but the company was well placed to react quickly. It already had emergency plans in place thanks to a “doomsday” management exercise four years ago. It had also embraced remote working, and had the technology to handle communication with 460,000 staff, suppliers, people services and security operations. These systems allowed the company to double its capacity for delivery and click and collect in just six weeks. Improvements to the computer algorithms used to drive picking technology – plus the army of pickers hired to cope with the increased demand – mean that whatever the future brings, the chain appears to have the flexibility to deal with it.Similarly, the online flower delivery company Bloom \u0026amp Wild proved its resilience. For its founder Aron Gelbard, protecting jobs by staying open was important, as was providing people with a way of showing they care for the loved ones they couldn’t see in lockdown.With its tailored CRM system, which manages queries from a range of channels, Bloom \u0026amp Wild now employs more than 25 customer service agents who manage between 3,000 and 3,500 inquiries every week – rising dramatically during peak times such as Valentine’s Day, Mother’s Day and, undoubtedly, lockdown.The company uses Zendesk to manage its customer relationships, allowing agents to deal with inquiries across Twitter, email, phone, online chat, Facebook Messenger and SMS. Alongside this, analytics help the company forecast customer demand and plan for peaks.As a business that exists purely in the virtual world, it’s an example to retailers everywhere of what can be achieved by clever use of technology.Things are changing fast.

It’s definitely impacting on mental health for so many girls and young women.“It’s just such a shame that girls have to resort to coming off social media, and doing things like trying to change the way they look just to make themselves feel more confident, when in reality most of the things they see aren’t realistic at all.”Eight out of 10 respondents aged 11-21 had considered changing how they looked, with more than half thinking this would improve their confidence or make them feel better about themselves.Three-quarters would like cosmetic procedures, such as lip fillers and Botox, banned for under-18s, while two-thirds would like new legislation preventing them from being exposed to adverts for diets or weight loss.Girlguiding’s chief executive, Angela Salt, said: “Young people are an important part of our recovery, but they are undoubtedly one of society’s hardest hit by the impact of the pandemic.“We are proud to be able to offer girls and young women help and support to navigate these relentless pressures and aim to extend our reach further, so even more can benefit from the support Girlguiding provides.”Girlguiding has submitted evidence to this year’s women and equalities committee inquiry into body image."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce88fa59252d3813211fe8f51d71790aa547616d/0_0_2265_1359/master/2265.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80c53a302f94923e79d5f4cdafc5ddd4","title":"extremely radical martin luther king jr children george floyd","story":"Martin and Bernice King have continued their father’s legacy, protesting for civil rights. They discuss Black Lives Matter, their ongoing grief and the upcoming March on WashingtonWhen footage of George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis, under the knee of a white police officer, was beamed around the world, Bernice King wept. She was five years old in 1968 when her father, Martin Luther King Jr, was killed by an assassin’s bullet on a hotel balcony in Memphis. She was a year younger than Floyd’s daughter Gianna.“You feel the pain of the loss,” she says over a video call, a framed photograph of her father on the mantelpiece behind her. “Because you know what it did to you, too. And you can only imagine what it’s doing to that little girl.”It is easy to trace the lines from the US’s latest reckoning on race and police violence to the civil rights struggles of the 60s. Floyd’s death started the largest wave of protest in the US since King’s murder. But for some, the connections are as much lived reality as a point of historic reference.Bernice’s elder brother, Martin Luther King III, was 10 at the time his father was killed. In June this year, he bowed his head in front of Floyd’s golden casket during a memorial service. He also reflects on the children left behind. “When you are grieving, you appreciate all the love that the world provides for you,” he says from his living room in Atlanta, in front of a large image of his mother, Coretta Scott King. “But, at some point, most people go back to their homes and you’re all alone, grieving by yourself. And you have to figure out how to navigate through the terrible pain.”In the aftermath of Floyd’s death, as buildings burned in cities across the country, familiar arguments invoking King’s legacy of nonviolence and civil disobedience were used to question the validity of mostly peaceful protests. Republican senators quoted King’s words out of context and memes circulated with images juxtaposing peaceful marches in the 60s and looting in 2020. A pundit on Fox News said the unrest was “definitely not about black lives”.King’s children are used to this rewriting of history. Since his death, he has been repositioned in the mainstream American imagination as a unifying figure who defeated the segregationist south with peaceful nonviolence, driven by dreams of a future where his four children would “live in a nation where they will not be judged by the colour of their skin, but by the content of their character”.There is truth in that depiction, but it also nullifies King’s radicalism: his demands after the Civil Rights and Voting Rights acts were passed in 1964 and 1965 for universal income and a higher minimum wage the brutality he and thousands of others endured as they put their bodies on the line the surveillance he was placed under by J Edgar Hoover’s FBI and ultimately his assassination, which the King family believe was connected to a higher conspiracy. King was not popular among the broader American public at the time of his death.“I think most people focus on ‘I have a dream’ and they don’t even focus on the entire speech,” says Martin. “You know, what got him killed was not talking about riding in the front of buses. He talked about a living wage … he talked about a radical redistribution of wealth, which definitely was frightening to those pursuing money.“But the message has been sanitised by mainstream media, because if you keep him in that sanitised version then you never realise the part of him that talked about a revolution of values. The irony of it is here we are today and we still need a revolution of values.”Perhaps the apex of this distortion has come during Donald Trump’s presidency. In January, the president – who recently declined to praise the late civil rights crusader John Lewis – used the annual holiday celebrating King to boast about low unemployment among black Americans. During Trump’s impeachment trial in the US Senate, his lawyer Kenneth Starr referenced King’s pursuit of “freedom and justice” as he defended the president against corruption charges.Bernice raises an eyebrow when I ask about this. “I’ve lived most of my adult life with people taking my father’s legacy out of context, so I’m beyond getting angry,” she says. “I frankly don’t spend the same amount of time as most people do focusing on what Donald Trump says or doesn’t say, because that is fodder to him.”But how do they believe their father would have interpreted this moment, with its complicated entanglement of nonviolent protest, direct confrontation and a militarised police response?“You know, Dad would never have condoned violence ever,” says Martin. “But he didn’t condemn it, either. Saying ‘a riot is a language of the unheard’ is saying: ‘I understand why people are forced or pushed to riot.’ People are so frustrated. People are so dehumanised and have been so abused that they have resorted to this.”The point was driven home to Martin when, shortly after Floyd’s death, his 11-year-old daughter, Yolanda, informed her parents that she was too scared to go outside alone and play in case a police officer entered the back yard.“That broke my heart – that our daughter would be afraid of those that are supposed to protect and serve,” he says. “We now have to sit down with her and figure out how she can differentiate between some policemen who are not good and the many who are good.”How does he think her grandfather would have felt? “He would be greatly disappointed that his granddaughter is having to filter this, when he and his team worked so hard to eradicate it.”Although none of King’s children knew their father as adults, his life’s work inspired Martin and Bernice to continue the struggle. Bernice is a pastor and in 2009 was elected president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) founded by her father (although she did not take up the position). She spoke at Lewis’s funeral last month and in June she delivered a eulogy for Rayshard Brooks, an unarmed black man killed by police in Atlanta.“Rayshard Brooks’ death will not be in vain, because justice will roll down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream,” she told a congregation at Ebenezer Baptist church in Atlanta, from the pulpit where her father regularly delivered sermons.Bernice gave her first public speech on racial justice at the age of 19. In 1985, aged 22, she was arrested with her mother and Martin as they protested against apartheid outside the South African embassy in Washington DC. She spent the night in jail and recalls being comforted by her mother in a basement holding cell as she quivered with anxiety. “She said: ‘Baby, you’re going to get out of here imagine the thousands of people who don’t.’”Thirteen years later, Bernice delivered a sermon at the White House during Nelson Mandela’s visit to the US. She has since delivered sermons and eulogies at many major civil rights commemorations and she appears as a pundit on cable news.Her activism has sometimes been criticised by progressives in 2004, she marched in a protest against same-sex marriage. She has since said she is not homophobic and has “love for everybody, period”.Martin, who served as SCLC president for seven years, will on Friday lead a recreation of his father’s 1963 March on Washington, alongside the Rev Al Sharpton. Among many other public appearances, he delivered an emotive speech at the 2008 Democratic convention, when Barack Obama became the party’s first African American presidential nominee.“I could not help thinking how proud my father would be: proud of Barack Obama, proud of the party that nominated him and proud of the America that will elect him,” Martin told the convention in Denver, Colorado. In 2014, he continued in his father’s tradition by appearing at a rally for Michael Brown, the unarmed black teenager killed by police in Ferguson, Missouri.As the oldest surviving sibling (Yolanda, King’s first-born, died in 2007), Martin has the most lucid memories of his father. He recalls days at the local YMCA where he and his brother, Dexter, were taught by their dad how to swim afternoons on the lawn where he taught them how to throw a baseball. “He didn’t have a large quantity of time,” Martin says. “But the quality of time was remarkable.”But, even as children, they were aware of the dangers their father faced. Martin recalls picking up the house telephone to hear “an ugly voice making threatening remarks”. He travelled with his father on a number of occasions and vividly remembers the snarling police dogs in St Augustine, north Florida, when they visited the city as part of King’s campaign for desegregation. He can still see the face of one woman involved in nonviolent protests, her face bandaged and her nose broken.He remembers the night his father died in 1968. Bernice was asleep, but the other children were comforted by their mother. “She said: ‘Your father is going home to live with God. When you see him, it will be as if he is asleep, but you won’t be able to wake him up. He won’t be able to hug and kiss you as you so often experienced.’” It remains one of the most traumatic moments of his life.The King family endured further tragedy in the immediate years after. Their uncle, Alfred Daniel King, died the year after his brother in an incident determined to be an accidental drowning. Their grandmother, King’s mother, Alberta, was murdered at Ebenezer Baptist church in 1974.Bernice, who learned of her father’s significance to the world from her mother’s teachings, experienced the trauma a little later, in early adulthood. “You have issues of abandonment and distrust,” she says. “I think for me that has expressed itself in different phases of my life, where I’ve had a lot of walls up.“I’ve developed, under the core of me, this whole issue of: ‘Are you going to stay with me? Are you going to leave me?’ In my 30s and 40s, it took a lot for me to build relationships that I trusted.”Although their father was killed more than half a century ago, Martin and Bernice still mourn him. The 50th anniversary proved particularly difficult to navigate. “I don’t even know what triggers it, but there are still times that I grieve,” says Martin. “I’ve heard many of his speeches so many times that often I’m hearing them but not really listening. But if I’m really hearing and listening, that’s when I will grieve.”For Bernice, it can also be triggered by acts of racism and violence. “Just looking at the state of our world and kind of wishing that he and my mom were here, I have those moments over and over again where I just tear up and cry,” she says. “It never leaves you.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9524811f3fd952e7e972c047c8e63aae44815caf/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23ce412ae9d418a45384f5078c9af34d","title":"milwaukee bucks boycott nba playoff game orlando magic jacob blake","story":"On an extraordinary day for the NBA, the Milwaukee Bucks boycotted Game 5 of their playoff series against the Orlando Magic in protest of the police shooting of Jacob Blake, leading the NBA to reschedule all other Wednesday night playoff games.Milwaukee’s baseball team, the Brewers, also confirmed they would not play their game scheduled for Wednesday evening.Blake was shot in the back by police, apparently in front of his children, on Sunday, and his family say he is now paralyzed from the waist down. The shooting occurred in Kenosha, Wisconsin, which is 40 miles from Milwaukee.The Bucks had been due to come on court for 4pm ET on Wednesday afternoon, but did not emerge from the locker room. They released a statement on Wednesday afternoon calling for action and justice for Jacob Blake.“When we take the court and represent Milwaukee and Wisconsin, we are expected to play at a high level, give maximum effort and hold each other accountable,” they said. “In this moment, we are demanding the same from our lawmakers and law enforcement.”The Bucks demanded the Wisconsin state legislature reconvene after months of inaction to “take up meaningful measures” on police brutality and criminal justice reform.“We encourage all citizens to educate themselves, take peaceful and responsible action, and remember to vote on Nov. 3,” they concluded.Two NBA playoff games – between the Oklahoma City Thunder and the Houston Rockets and the Portland Trail Blazers and the Los Angeles Lakers – were also postponed on Wednesday.The Seattle Mariners and San Diego Padres baseball game as well as a San Francisco Giants-Los Angeles Dodgers game were also canceled Wednesday night.Gabe Kapler, manager of the San Francisco Giants, put out a strong statement in support of the team’s strike.“I don’t think it should require athletes needing to boycott playoffs games to remind us that Black Lives Matter, and that police brutality is unacceptable, and that systemic racism to be eliminated,” he said.The WNBA also postponed its three games on Wednesday, just hours after the NBA.“We know it’s a very emotional time for our players. They are struggling with what’s been happening in this country for months, if not years,” said Cathy Engelbert, WNBA commissioner, who added that the league supports its players’ decision to not play on Wednesday night.“I think this world has to change. I think our police department has to change. Us as society has to change. And, right now we’re not seeing any of that. Lives are being taken, as we speak, day in and day out, and there’s no consequence or accountability for it, and that’s what has to change.”Shortly after the postponements were confirmed, the NBA’s biggest star, LeBron James, tweeted: “FUCK THIS MAN!!!! WE DEMAND CHANGE. SICK OF IT.”Members of the Bucks have spoken about problems of racism and police brutality in the Milwaukee area before. Peter Feigin, the Bucks’ president, offended some fans in 2016 when he said Milwaukee was “the most segregated and racist place” he had known. Meanwhile, in an interview with the  last year, the former Bucks player Malcolm Brogdon spoke about similar problems.“Before I came to Milwaukee I’d heard the city was the most segregated in the country,” he said. “I’d heard it was racist.

It is a moderate to strenuous walk of almost five miles (longer if you choose the circular walk back to Fowey), but you will be rewarded with the discovery of secret beaches en route, where you can stop for a swim and take in the beautiful views. Another highlight is the shipwreck that inspired Daphne Du Maurier’s Rebecca at Polridmouth cove. End the walk with a seafood lunch at Sam’s on Polkerris beach (booking recommended) or a drink at the Rashleigh Inn next door, and watch the sunset on the beach. Natasha CouttsMy favourite clifftop walk is in Lerwick, Shetland. If you start along the Knab towards Sound, it is the most relaxing way to start or end the day. There are sheep who bleat like an old man, seals who are curious and playful and even an egg honesty box at a B\u0026ampB along the way. The colour of both the sea and the sky is grey-blue – sometimes it is hard to tell where the sky ends and the sea begins. If feeling brave, the pebbled beach offers an opportunity for a refreshing swim with the seals.Marie BourneMy tip isn’t so much a walk as a climb: the Elie chain walk. You edge your way along ledges and up and down steps in the cliffs, clinging on to chains anchored in the rock for the more precipitous sections – and there are lots of them. Consider it a via ferrata for beginners. I managed it with five- and eight-year-olds although, in truth, it’s probably unsuitable for most youngsters. But, then again, it’s so refreshing to come across this sort of exploration that hasn’t (yet) been stymied by the health and safety police. You will never forget the experience. Oh, and watch out for the tide times!Paul KirkwoodStart your walk in Bridlington – parking is free on the south side. The walk begins along Belvedere Parade and continues south along a path, past the hamlet of Wilsthorpe, then opening out on to a cliff edge path (which is sometimes awash with butterflies), eventually coming to an excellent coffee shop, the Cow Shed at Fraisthorpe beach. It’s about three miles to there. After coffee and cake with a superb view of the bay, return on the wide-open beach, easy underfoot and with sightings of seabirds and waders, as well as second world war sea defences. Six miles, great coffee, wide open views, an extensive beach, nature and history – all the ingredients of an excellent walk.Sarah VernauWhen adventuring with my family, access is our first consideration, as our little girl has a disability. My partner and I have always adored coastal walks, so we were blown away by the breathtaking circular walk called Baggy Point, just east of Croyde beach in north Devon. It is largely accessible (with the rare rocky patch) and has no shortage of jaw-dropping scenery. • nationaltrust.org.ukStephanieExpect to see wildlife along the picturesque Royal Military canal before crossing to Hythe seafront and enjoying the boardwalk and dramatic sea towards Sandgate. Check out the village’s short stretch of quirky shops, then cut back to the beach to spot some residual artwork from the Folkestone Triennial. Have a lolly at the beachside Mermaids Cafe when you reach Folkestone, then let the kids go wild in the amazing, free adventure park at the Lower Leas Coastal Park. Don’t miss the fabulous coastal planting, then zigzag your way back up the path for afternoon tea at the Grand. Promenade harbour-wards and take in the Channel views, pass the water lift and memorial arch, then finish at one of the vibrant new pop-up bars on the Harbour Arm.KateThere is an easy five-mile stroll on the Isle of Sheppey, beginning in bustling Leysdown-on-Sea. Heading eastwards, the rows of caravans drop away and the vast expanse of muddy sand is bequeathed to flocks of gulls and oystercatchers. The neat breakwaters of Leysdown give way to lines of jagged wooden posts, sticking up like shipwrecks out of the sand. Take a break at Shellness beach, made up entirely of tiny pastel-coloured shells. Then head through the bleakly beautiful Swale nature reserve, keeping the sparkling Swale estuary in view – a great place to spot seals basking on the sandbanks. After an afternoon of soul-cleansing isolation, finish at the Ferry House Inn for outstanding local fare.Alexandra McLanaghanI usually catch the train from Porthmadog to Criccieth, it’s only a few pounds. From Criccieth station head to the nearby castle (currently closed) before dropping down on to the beach path and past the glass-fronted, art deco Dylan’s restaurant, which is always worth a visit. The pebbly beach gives way to easier walking underfoot as you circumnavigate the headland, with fantastic views over Blackrock Sands and an easy walk along the beach, picking up the Welsh Coastal Path to the beautiful beaches before Borth-y-Gest (where the Sea View Cafe does great ice-cream) before finishing your walk into Porthmadog. It’s about five miles, three hours maximum, great at any time of year.Ian OwenThe Norfolk Coastal Path is best known for vast sandy beaches, tidal marshland and pine woods. But one outstanding section climbs from the pretty fishing village of Weybourne and stretches along clifftops overlooking the always dramatic North Sea. This walk defies the reputation of “flat Norfolk” with spectacular views across rolling fields, gorse, heather and woodland. Catch glimpses of steam trains puffing along the Poppy Line to Holt. Follow the path up to the lifeguard lookout point before dropping down into Sheringham. Ride the cute little Coasthopper bus back to Weybourne for lunch at the Ship Inn.NikkiSilecroft, on the Cumbrian coast, has a great beach, and this is a quiet and easy walk – close to the southern fringes of the Lakes, but well away from the tourist crowds. Famous for the opening credits of BBC’s Countryfile, with the horses running through the waves. At high tide there are pebbles but at low tide there’s a flat expanse of sand, as far as the eye can see to the north and south. If you’re lucky, you’ll see no one else. If unlucky you might have to share it with maybe 20 others. Head south for an easy walk on the sand for about four miles, enjoying the views across the sea to the Isle of Man, or inland to the local fells, until you get to the quiet, peaceful village of Haverigg.

I know how to take responsibility.”Von der Leyen tweeted that she respected his decision and was grateful for his work.The leaders of Ireland’s three governing parties welcomed the resignation in a joint statement. “We believe that it is the correct course of action given the circumstances of the past week. We all have a responsibility to support and adhere to public health guidelines and regulations.”Earlier on Wednesday the government signaled it wanted Hogan to quit or be sacked after concluding he flouted coronavirus regulations. The taoiseach, Micheál Martin, said Hogan had undermined public confidence in public health guidelines.Hogan’s fate rested in the hands of his boss, Von der Leyen, who requested a full account of his movements in Ireland.She was under pressure to sack the commissioner, an Irish political veteran who moved to Brussels and became the EU’s key figure in Brexit talks, but doing so would have set an awkward precedent.The Irish public has seethed at revelations about Hogan’s behaviour but some business groups fear Ireland will lose a key ally in Brexit talks. The head of the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association compared ousting Hogan to “cutting off our Brexit nose to spite our Covid face”.Ireland’s foreign minister, Simon Coveney, has been tipped to replace Hogan as Ireland’s EU commissioner. David O’Sullivan, who served as the EU’s ambassador to Washington, has also been tipped.Dublin hopes to retain the trade portfolio at a pivotal time for Brexit and US trade talks but that will be a decision for Von der Leyen.Hogan attempted to defuse public anger and save his job on Tuesday by publishing a timeline of his movements in Ireland from 31 July to 22 August, and gave about 20 pages of documents with additional details to Von der Leyen.The row erupted after it emerged the commissioner joined more than 80 people, including politicians and a supreme court judge, at a golfing dinner in Clifden, County Galway, on 19 August.The event breached Covid-19 regulations and prompted public outrage. Several attendees resigned from their positions, including Dara Calleary, the government’s agriculture minister. Police are investigating the event.Hogan admitted the gathering was wrong and he should not have attended but initially refused to resign, insisting he respected regulations during the rest of his three-week visit to Ireland. Drip-drip disclosures, however, undermined that claim.He said he had arrived in Ireland on 31 July and travelled to his temporary residence in county Kildare before being admitted on 5 August to a Dublin hospital, where he tested negative for Covid-19 before being discharged on 7 August.He returned to Kildare, which was in lockdown because of a surge in infections, and over the next two weeks visited counties Limerick, Roscommon, Kilkenny and Galway before returning to Brussels.However as a traveller from Belgium, a high-risk country, rules state he should have remained in self-isolation even after a negative test."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb4dbad553203ad2ecadc1e8aa3473530974fcca/69_205_3110_1865/master/3110.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=011555bdd2a4817870aaad5cf5c5fd0e","title":"bame britons less likely trust covid health officials survey","story":"Exclusive: findings raise fresh questions about pandemic’s disproportionate impactBlack and minority ethnic people trusted government scientists and public health officials less than white people did at the height of the UK’s coronavirus outbreak, according to a study that raises fresh questions about the pandemic’s disproportionate impact.BAME people were more likely to believe their employers’ advice than anything Boris Johnson or the government said, and trusted the NHS and Public Health England (PHE) less than white people did, the research suggests.At the same time they felt more vulnerable to the impact of Covid-19 and were far more likely to say it was difficult to follow the restrictions in place to prevent the spread of infection, according to the survey for the Wellcome Trust carried out in March and April as the virus reached its peak.The findings prompted questions about whether more could have been done to better communicate with different communities, with one council leader querying the impact of daily Downing Street briefings that were frequently presented by three white men.A PHE review found black people were the ethnic group most likely to test positive for coronavirus, and white people were the least. People of Bangladeshi ethnicity had about twice the risk of death than that for white people and mortality rates were higher for black and Asian groups when compared with white people. The study found socioeconomic factors, including more cramped housing, jobs that require increased human contact and greater use of public transport were key.“As Europe teeters on the brink of a second wave and we see more local lockdowns, these findings show that a more targeted approach to messaging will be key to ensuring that different groups can access, understand and trust government guidance,” said Carla Ross, a research and evidence lead at Wellcome. “We hope that local authorities and policymakers can use these findings to inform their public health strategies as we enter this critical period.”Arooj Shah, the deputy leader of Oldham council in Greater Manchester, which this month recorded the highest infection rate in the country, highlighted a possible barrier created by the daily Downing Street press briefings that often involved “three white men behind a podium telling you what you are doing”. She said: “You need to start looking like the people you represent.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/644fce9c4a3c28af89f2db8b2fd72980c6963b37/0_1225_2614_1567/master/2614.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=0756d66165bec4144c11564bd3365c60","title":"lawyers for detained zimbabwe journalist in new move to free him","story":"Hopewell Chin’ono held for over a month as international concern grows over crackdownLawyers representing the Zimbabwean journalist Hopewell Chin’ono, held in prison for more than a month pending trial on charges of inciting violence, will make a fresh attempt to free him on Thursday.Chin’ono was arrested without a warrant at his home in Harare almost five weeks ago after publishing a series of investigations into corruption in Zimbabwe. He has since been held in Chikurubi high security prison on the outskirts of the capital, and repeated bail applications have been rejected.The new effort to free Chin’ono comes as international concern grows over an ongoing crackdown in Zimbabwe, during which between 50 and 100 opposition party officials, writers, labour activists and others have been arrested and often detained.The US, UK, EU and others have condemned the repression. Local clergy also published a scathing open letter accusing the country’s president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, and his government of rampant corruption and an abuse of power in what they described as an unprecedented crackdown. Images of political detainees being led to court in leg irons have caused outrage.Trial documents reveal appalling conditions in the prison. Chin’ono is held with 40 others in a cell designed to hold 12 inmates, and is the only unconvicted prisoner, which is a breach of international law.“I will be strong. I am fine,” he said from inside a prison van as he arrived at court on Monday, but his legal team say overcrowding and unsanitary conditions in Chikurubi make it a disaster and a Covid-19 infection risk.Zimbabwe has 6,000 confirmed cases of the virus and more than 166 people have died of the disease during the pandemic, though the figures are thought to be a fraction of the true totals. No soap or masks have been provided to detainees in Chikurubi and there is no running water in the cells, making washing impractical.The director of health in prisons and correctional services has also indicated that social distancing in the prison system is impossible, according to legal documents.Chin’ono, a respected documentary maker who has worked for a number of international organisations, faces a lengthy prison sentence. The charges against him are based on a series of tweets he sent to encourage attendance at an opposition rally that was due to take place on 31 July. The authorities banned the protest, citing Covid-19 regulations, and deployed the army and riot police to disperse any demonstrators.“What we have seen with Hopewell is unprecedented in the last 20 years. The crackdown speaks of a regime that is insecure, unstable and is lashing out against anyone it sees as a threat,” said Doug Coltart, one of the lawyers representing Chin’ono. “As the government become more and more unpopular, more and more people are going to take action and more of them will become targets of the regime.”Mnangagwa came to power in 2017 following the military-led ousting of Robert Mugabe, whose dictatorial rule lasted almost 40 years. A former spy chief known as “the Crocodile”, he promised political and economic reform leading to major investment from overseas.The ruling Zanu-PF party has becoming increasingly authoritarian, but the ided opposition parties have been unable to mobilise sustained protests. There are also widespread reports of systematic corruption and infighting within the country’s political elite.At Harare magistrates court on Wednesday, the trial continued of three women, including an MP, who were abducted, sexually assaulted and badly beaten in March. They have been charged with fabricating the episode.More than a dozen protesters, including the award-winning author Tsitsi Dangarembga, were arrested on 31 July and later freed on bail. All have been charged with inciting public violence.More recent arrests include that of Job Sikhala, an MP for the main opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change, who had been in hiding for weeks after being accused of mobilising anti-government protests.Another opposition MP, Prince Dubeko Dube, has been charged with inciting violence after he gave supermarket employees two face masks marked with the words “Zanu-PF must go”.A bail application for Sikhala was also refused on Wednesday. Outside court, armed riot police maintained a heavy presence, violently dispersing opposition supporters who had gathered to sing and shout slogans.Evan Mawarire, a civil society activist imprisoned at Chikurubi in 2016 and 2019, said the facility was designed to dehumanise inmates.“It is designed to kill your spirit. It removes a sense of being a worthy human being,” he said. “There is no way out. The sense of fear is there, because you are constantly being watched. It is illegal to speak about politics or anything to do with the governance of the country. That will warrant solitary confinement. You live in constant fear of the prison officers.”There have also been various reports of assaults by police and other security agencies in recent weeks.Soldiers assaulted Talent Jara, 63, at Munyuki shopping centre in the poor Harare neighbourhood of Epworth early this month. “I was beaten by soldiers and lost money and other valuables. I sustained injuries on my buttocks and back. I could not work for two weeks,” Jara said.According to the Zimbabwe Peace Project (ZPP), 171 violations were recorded in Harare in July, with more elsewhere in the country.Government spokesmen have blamed unidentified foreign agents and states for fomenting unrest in the country.“Zimbabwe, like most countries in the world is currently grappling with challenges attendant to illegal sanctions, drought and the coronavirus pandemic,” the information secretary, Nick Mangwana, told the government-run Herald newspaper. “There is no ‘crisis’, political or otherwise.” He said a “bandwagon of iniduals and entities” were seeking to “manufacture ‘crises’ in the country with the sole aim of achieving known political goals”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/081585e8b87d493938d30192a01638948d91ace8/0_38_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=f7e7bff792f2a407c8e2ebff8b25133e","title":"south china sea us unveils first sanctions linked to militarisation","story":"The latest US move against Beijing cracks down on firms whose goods may support Chinese military activities The United States has blacklisted 24 Chinese companies and targeted iniduals it said were part of construction and military efforts in the South China Sea, its first such sanctions move over the disputed strategic waterway.The US Commerce Department said the companies played a “role in helping the Chinese military construct and militarise the internationally condemned artificial islands in the South China Sea”.Separately, the State Department said it would impose visa restrictions on Chinese iniduals “responsible for, or complicit in” such action and those linked to China’s “use of coercion against south-east Asian claimants to inhibit their access to offshore resources”.The move on Wednesday was the latest US move to crack down on firms whose goods may support Chinese military activities and comes in the run up to the US presidential election, in which both Donald Trump and Joe Biden have been sharply critical of China.The US accuses China of militarising the South China Sea and trying to intimidate Asian neighbours who might want to exploit the area’s extensive oil and gas reserves.US warships have sailed through the region to assert the freedom of access to international waterways, raising fears of clashes.A US defence official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told Reuters that on Wednesday China launched four medium-range ballistic missiles that landed in the South China Sea between Hainan Island and the Paracel Islands.The official added that an assessment was underway to determine the type of missile launched.The Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post newspaper quoted a source close to the Chinese military as saying that China had launched two missiles, including an “aircraft-carrier killer”, into the South China Sea on Wednesday morning in a warning to the US.On Tuesday, China complained that the US had sent a U-2 reconnaissance plane into a no-fly zone over Chinese live-fire military drills.The Pentagon said a U-2 flight conducted in the Indo-Pacific region was “within the accepted international rules and regulations governing aircraft flights”.The Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately reply to a request for comment on US announcements, but in July, Beijing said it was not afraid of any sanctions the US might impose and accused it of stirring up trouble and destabilising the region.Washington warned last month it could respond with sanctions against Chinese officials and enterprises involved in coercion in the South China Sea after it announced a tougher stance rejecting Beijing’s claims to offshore resources there as “completely unlawful”.China claims virtually all of the potentially energy-rich South China Sea, but Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also lay claim to parts of an area through which about $3tn of trade passes each year.“This is the first time the US has levied any type of economic sanction against Chinese entities for behaviour in the South China Sea,” said Greg Poling, a South China Sea expert at Washington’s Center for Strategic and International Studies."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31eac10f521b77bf3c551c3c2164d3c45d9f20e2/0_178_3508_2104/master/3508.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=939aec2e624ab749c7e98eabac49cd72","title":"uk coronavirus live people on low pay to get covid isolation payment","story":"Health secretary questioned about announcement that people on low incomes will be paid £13 a day if they have to self-isolate for 14 days The number of passengers arriving in the UK by air increased more than six fold month on month in July as lockdown restrictions were eased and travel corridors were introduced between different countries, writes Jamie Grierson, the ’s home affairs correspondent.There were 1.2m arrivals to the UK by air in July, compared to less than 200,000 in June, Home Office statistics reveal.From 8 June, all arrivals in the UK were required to self-isolate for 14 days but this was significantly relaxed on 10 July with the introduction of so-called travel corridors, which allowed quarantine-free travel between designated nations. Since then, a number of popular holiday destinations, including Spain, France and Croatia, have seen mandatory quarantine reimposed. Half of Britons want the government to extend its job retention furlough scheme for an extra year, in a move that would mirror longer protections to be put in place in Germany, according to a poll commissioned by the trade union Unite. The UK’s economy has taken the biggest hit of all the G7 major economies and is facing job losses at a level not seen in living memory. In a press release, Unite said it was particularly concerned that vital strategic sectors, such as manufacturing and aviation, will shed tens of thousands of jobs unless the UK adopts extended job support measures.This poll is a clear indicator of the public’s fear for the near future. Little wonder that Britons feel so uncertain about what is round the corner. More people in this country have fallen victim to Covid-19 and the UK’s economy has shrunk by more than twice as that of our major competitor, Germany.Tens of thousands of jobs have gone over the summer, and as the end of the job retention scheme grows ever closer, we’re extremely worried that UK employers will shed even more. The extension of the scheme would calm nerves and put a solid floor under an economy that is braced for a certain storm this autumn. Despite Germany’s relatively optimistic economic outlook, Angela Merkel has extended her country’s version of the job retention scheme to further boost economic growth. Other European countries including France, Spain and Italy have or are going to do the same. We urge Boris Johnston to show support for Britain’s workers and follow suit.Westminster is also lagging behind Scotland and Northern Ireland, where the eviction ban has sensibly been extended until March next year. At things stand, hard-up families in England and Wales face being turfed out of their homes next month in the midst of an economic contraction the like of which has not been seen for generations.During this time of national crisis and severe economic disruption, people need leadership that will provide security for their homes and livelihoods and the economy. We are only asking the government does for its citizens what nations across Europe are doing, which is to take action to prevent vital industries and jobs from going into a tailspin and to ensure communities are able to weather the worst impacts of the pandemic. The workers of this country expect the UK government now to do the same.The level of financial support for offered by the government to people who have to self-isolate is “nowhere near enough to provide real support” and “a slap in the face for those people who sadly test positive” that offers no incentive to stay at home, council leaders in areas where the scheme is being piloted have said. The Pendle borough council leader, Mohammed Iqbal, said the level of financial support is “not acceptable”. The Labour councillor told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: The figures that the government have introduced are really a slap in the face for those people who sadly test positive and there is no incentive in my opinion for those people to self-isolate.If you’re a manual worker who’s not able to do their job from home, normally getting paid the living wage or the minimum wage, the government are now going to say to you we’ll pay you £4.55 an hour. Not acceptable.I am pleased that the government have agreed to at least provide some financial help for those being asked to self-isolate in Oldham. Sadly this offer is nowhere near enough to provide real support, and it shows how out of touch with ordinary people this government is. I stand with the Time Out To Help Out campaign in asking government to support people across the country to self-isolate on full pay. People should not have to worry about loss of income whilst being asked to self-isolate. Oldham residents have pulled together to face this crisis we now need Government do to their bit. We need a real and meaningful offer of support for Oldham residents, who deserve better.More from Matt Hancock, who has been put through the wringer of broadcast interviews this morning. The health secretary has denied claims in the Times this morning that the NHS has a “hidden waiting list” of 15.3 million patients who need follow-up appointments for health problems.The paper had reported the figure was gleaned from what it described as “the first analysis of its kind”, adding:The official waiting list, which stands at 3.9 million, shows how many patients are yet to have their first hospital appointment after a GP referral.However, the total number who are on hospital books in England and need appointments is not collated centrally. A new calculation, based on freedom of information requests to NHS trusts and seen by The Times, puts the figure at 15.3 million.Responding to the report, Hancock told LBC radio: I’ve looked into this research since it arrived in the Times overnight, and it is total rubbish. It is actually a count of the total number of appointments that there are ... what they’ve done is counted all the appointments that there are in the NHS. If you have an appointment, that is not because you’re on a waiting list, it is because you are going to go and see someone in the NHS. We measure waiting lists very rigorously and obviously a really important part of the recovery of the country post-coronavirus is getting those treatments that had to be delayed, getting them dealt with. But let’s deal with the facts rather than a spurious survey.Jet engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce was the biggest faller on the FTSE 100, after revealing a £5.4bn loss and a plan to sell assets to shore up its creaking balance sheet.Rolls-Royce has been hit hard by the decline in air travel, which has caused a massive hit to the revenues it earns from servicing jet engines. Total revenues fell by a quarter to £5.8bn in the first half of 2020.Meanwhile, WPP reported a £2.6bn loss in the first half after the impact of the pandemic prompted the company to wipe billions off the value of expensive advertising acquisitions made by its founder and former chief executive, Sir Martin Sorrell.However, the world’s largest advertising group, which has shed 5,000 jobs in the first six months, surprised investors by re-instating its idend declaring that the worst is now behind it, assuming there is no second wave of the virus.Read more of the latest business news and market moves on our business blog, anchored today by Jasper Jolly.Matt Hancock has suggested there was potential for the new self-isolation support payments to be rolled out beyond initial pilot areas of Oldham and Blackburn with Darwen and Pendle, which have local lockdowns.Asked on BBC Breakfast why people outside these areas were not entitled to the money, the health secretary said: This is where we’re doing it in the first instance, firstly to make sure that the systems work, that we can get the money fast to people, because obviously if you’re asking somebody to self-isolate for a fortnight we want to try to get the money to them at the start of that rather than afterwards.He said the payments were being introduced in areas which have “the most acute need”, adding: “We’ll see how that goes and we’ll get the feedback, with the potential to roll it out further.” The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said providing increased financial support to those asked to self-isolate in areas of high Covid-19 prevalence would help the NHS test and trace programme meet its target. He told LBC radio that local lockdowns were “working” but further support was required to help encourage those contacted by NHS tracers to stay at home. We talk to all these people because NHS test and trace phones them up and has a conversation, and one of the things, especially in areas of low income, that is causing some people to say: ‘I can’t do that’ or ‘I can’t give you the contacts’ is because they need to go to work. Bringing in extra support, in addition to the universal credit they get, if people self-isolate is one of the things that people have been asking for to get those rates up because it really matters that the people that need to self-isolate do because that’s how we stop the spread of the virus.However, he faced a stiff challenge from LBC presenter Nick Ferrari on whether £13 a day would persuade people to stay at home, when they had families to feed. Restaurants are extending their offer of discounted meals in the government’s eat out to help out scheme after it ends on 31 August because of its popularity with diners, although the businesses will have to cover the costs themselves, writes Joanna Partridge for the  business desk.In September, consumers will be able to take advantage of reduced prices at nationwide chains including Harvester, Toby Carvery, Tesco Café, Bill’s, Pizza Hut and Prezzo.The scheme has drawn people back into restaurants, bars and cafes, providing a much-needed boost for hospitality businesses hard hit by the coronavirus crisis. More than 64m meals have been claimed in total since it began at the start of the month – the equivalent of one for almost every person in the country.Matt Hancock said the extra financial support for people on low incomes in lockdown areas required to self-isolate was “set at the level of statutory sick pay”. Asked during an appearance on BBC Breakfast if payments representing £13 a day were enough, Hancock said they were “in addition” to other benefits that people on low incomes receive. When it was put to him that people self-isolating would be losing income from their jobs, Hancock said: Only in some cases, but absolutely we acknowledge that. It’s set at the level of statutory sick pay in order to make sure that people don’t lose out from doing the right thing.The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has said that the additional financial support for those living in lockdown areas on low incomes who are asked to self-isolate was about addressing some of the “challenges” with the NHS test and trace programme.The big picture is we have to make sure we get as many people as possible successfully going through that NHS Test and Trace system and one of the challenges that has come back on the ground is to get that figure even higher for people on low incomes to make sure they get extra support if they’re going into self-isolation.He denied that the development was evidence that universal credit was not enough to live on, arguing that “in fact the levels of universal credit were increased from the previous rates that were in place under the old system”. Addressing this week’s other big story, Hancock said schools would need to be certain distancing was in place between teachers and pupils to ensure coronavirus was not spread between schools by supply teachers. When asked about whether extra guidance was being given to schools about supply teachers working in multiple establishments, Hancock said: The principle is that we want to keep certain teachers socially distanced from the pupils because there are all sorts of circumstances where a teacher might need to teach classes that are in different bubbles within the school. The pupils are put within bubbles and the bubbles shouldn’t meet. The goal is to keep the teachers socially distanced. This is just one example of how challenging it is for all sorts of parts of society to minimise the impact of Covid. My answer to you is that it is the social distancing between the teacher and pupils which is the goal here, but our total focus is on getting the schools back.He said the government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, and the chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, were consulted on the decision to make it mandatory for secondary-aged pupils to wear face coverings in communal areas in schools which are in so-called coronavirus hot spots. Also in the ’s coverage this morning is the news that black, Asian and minority ethnic people were significantly less likely to trust public officials and government scientists at the height of the coronavirus outbreak. Arooj Shah, the deputy leader of Oldham council in Greater Manchester, which this month recorded the highest infection rate in the country, highlighted a possible barrier created by the daily Downing Street press briefings that often involved “three white men behind a podium telling you what you are doing”. She said: “You need to start looking like the people you represent.”Following the coronavirus lockdown, more than half of young people have developed anxiety about social interaction and six in 10 are concerned about being able to maintain social distancing at school, according to a survey. Some 1,009 young people aged 11 to 16 in the UK were surveyed by the charity between July 24 and 27. Denise Hatton, chief executive of YMCA England \u0026amp Wales, said that without significant reinvestment in youth services, including safe spaces, mentors, mediation and mental health support, young people risk becoming a “lonely, lost generation with nowhere to turn”. She said:The introduction of lockdown has accelerated and exacerbated the situation, with young people forced to stay at home, isolate themselves from their peers and be without access to positive activities. A generation which was already at a disadvantage have been dealt a further blow by Covid-19 and face deep uncertainty about what is next for them in its wake. What is essential to support young people through the easing of lockdown and beyond are safe spaces like youth services. They can be utilised to carefully and positively build young people’s confidence, provide much-needed support and guidance, and ultimately help them to get back on track.There is a mixed bag across today’s national newspaper front pages, with every one picking a different story to splash.

Good morning, this is Damien Gayle bringing you the latest updates and headlines from coronavirus-related UK news this morning. So far today we have learned of a new government scheme to pay people on low incomes in areas with high coronavirus infection rates up to £182 if they have to self-isolate. Under the scheme, being trialled from Tuesday in Blackburn with Darwen, Oldham and Pendle, low-paid people who test positive for Covid-19 will receive £130 for their 10-day isolation period. This rises to £182 – or £13 a day – for people they have been in close contact with, including members of their household, who have to isolate for 14 days.The move follows weeks of campaigning by regional mayors, councils and trade unions who said millions of people across the country could not afford to isolate without pay for a fortnight.Later on we will be expecting the latest weekly Covid-19 epidemiology statistics from Public Health England, and the latest weekly statistics from the government’s test and trace programme. The Office for National Statistics will also be publishing data and experimental indicators on the impact of the pandemic on the UK economy and society.There may be a meeting between Boris Johnson and the families of people who have lost loved ones to Covid-19, although this is to be confirmed. The government’s Joint Biosecurity Centre is also due to hold a meeting."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4339485.1598461311!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin family s five allows rural school to hold on to teachers","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Purcell family pictured with principal Mary Warde, deputy principal Deirdre Meehan  and teacher Amanda Shevlin at Kilmovee National School, Co Mayo. Photograph: Keith HeneghanA Dublin family’s desire for a safer, simpler life in the countryside has resulted in a “godsend” of extra pupils for a primary and a secondary school in east Co Mayo.Staff at Kilmovee National School on Wednesday welcomed five beaming members of the Purcell clan – Dale (11), Devon (10), Casey (9), Tate (8) and Rudi (6).At the same time, three other members of the same family – Scott (16), Sasha (15) and Ruby (12) – were being shown their new classrooms at the St Joseph’s secondary school in nearby Charlestown.In recent months, the Purcell clan, comprising Diarmuid and Sandra and their eight offspring, have happily settled into a bungalow on a half-acre site which they purchased in the townland of Carralackey, a few kilometres from Ireland West Airport, Knock. Diarmuid and Sandra are natives of the Navan Road and Glasnevin areas of Dublin.“We absolutely adore it here,” explained Diarmuid, a former Dublin taxi driver, on Wednesday. “There’s peace and tranquillity, no crime, no drugs. Our kids have a better chance here than they do in the city.”At three-teacher Kilmovee National School, staff have welcomed the newcomers like manna from heaven.The arrival of the Purcells means that school enrolment is now 54 instead of 49. The latter enrolment would have left the school one pupil short for the retention of a third teacher.School principal Mary Warde explained: “We heard just before lockdown that five extra pupils were on the way.”“It’s huge for us,” said Ms Warde. “We were always a three-teacher school, never slipped back to two. Now we will be remaining that way.”Covid-19 measuresIn advance of the school reopening, Ms Warde, along with deputy principal Deirdre Meehan and class teacher Amanda Shevlin, put extensive Covid-19 mitigation measures in place.Frequent handwashing, ventilating classrooms, the provision of sanitising stations and the reconfiguring of toilet areas to avoid any cross-movement between classrooms are now the order of the day.Says Ms Warde: “We have also identified designated isolation areas so that if a child or staff member becomes ill they can be isolated.“We have purchased a ‘fogging’ machine which sprays a sanitising liquid every evening in a short space of time.“Parents seem happy enough about our precautions. We keep them well informed. I think that where there is a void of information concerns might arise.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4339400.1598455165!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"first day back in school we re all finding our way","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFirst day back at St Hugh’s NS, Dowra, Co Leitrim. Photograph: Brian FarrellThe “We’re all finding our way today,” principal Pádraig Kenny assured four-year-old Emily Feeney as she hesitantly made her way towards one of the two entrances to St Hugh’s primary school in Dowra on Wednesday morning.Emily was the first of the four junior infants to arrive at the Co Leitrim school, which is a stone’s throw from the Cavan border, and she was happily ensconced at her desk long before most of the 48 pupils arrived.Five-year-old Keva Wynne Flynn was next in the door and her parents Louise and Kevin were feeling “fortunate” as they lingered by her desk, a first day indulgence that might not be repeated.Signs on one door warned: “No Parentss beyond this point.” But there was a relaxed atmosphere as the two-roomed school reopened after more than five months.While social distancing might not be too hard with only 48 children, breaks will be staggered to ensure no mixing between the two classrooms.A big clearout was organised to help facilitate social distancing in the senior room, where perspex screens separate pupils who face each other across double desks.“We got a skip in. A lot of stuff was heading in that direction anyway but this hastened its demise,” said the principal.The children had cheered loudly on that day way back in March when they and the teachers heard then taoiseach Leo Varadkar on the radio announcing the immediate shutdown of all schools. But all, bar one – junior infant Ryan Gilrane who couldn’t be coaxed inside – seemed happy to be there. They bounded up the path – separate routes for each of the two classrooms – taking the teachers’ visors and the hand sanitisers in their stride. Ryan’s reluctance to go to school was definitely not Covid related and his parents, Enda and Christina, had no worries about the health implications of having their three youngest back at St Hugh’s.As Ryan backed away from the door, and teacher Jacinta Greene went in search of toys to entice him in, his big brothers Fionn and Daniel revealed that he hadn’t wanted to get out of bed. “He’ll be sound in an hour,” predicted Ryan’s father who attended St High’s when it had 110 pupils. “We’re lucky. It is a great school. They have a new Astro Turf and lots of space,” he added.A song for the occasionDavid and Patricia O’Rourke from Dowra were dropping off junior infant Kyle (4) and his big brother Daniel (8) .“My biggest heartache is that they are in different rooms and because of the new rules Daniel can’t go in to Kyle if he needs him,” said Patricia.Daniel, who had written a song for the occasion about being reunited with his two best friends, Darragh and Daithí (“the three best Ds”) sang it with gusto when asked.Just as upbeat, his father David said that working in a local supermarket meant he was well used to meeting people during the pandemic. “I’m not nervous about them being back.

Photograph: Julien BehalPA WireAs schools finally reopen their doors to pupils under very changed circumstances, many principals, teachers and parents say they are still trying to get firm answers to key questions. Here are just some which are dominating the opening days:School assembliesA number of schools have staged assemblies or orientation events for 100-plus students since they opened this week.These events have sparked controversy among teachers and parents who say they are posing an unnecessary Covid-19 risk.Official public health guidance is mostly silent on this issue while it outlines physical distancing requirements for pupils, it does not set a limit on pupil numbers for such events.In response to media queries earlier this week, the Department of Education did not answer the question.Instead, it said that as part of the range of public health measures, “limits were placed on gatherings in other settings in order to support the reopening of schools which by its nature involves significant numbers of staff and students in school buildings.”Minister for Education Norma Foley was clearer during a Prime Time interview on Tuesday night when she said she would prefer if students were placed in smaller cohorts.High-risk teachersTeachers’ unions say they are dealing with a surge in queries from worried members with conditions such as cancer, heart conditions and diabetes who had been refused the option of staying at home.The Department of Education has told teachers and other staff categorised under HSE guidelines as “very high risk” for coronavirus that they may work remotely.But those classed as “high risk” have been told they “must attend the workplace, unless advised otherwise” after a risk assessment by an outsourced occupational health service.These include people with heart failure, chronic kidney disease, liver disease, cancer, weak immune systems and obesity, according to unions.While doctors can provide reports on their patients for risk assessments, it is the role of the occupational health service to determine whether teachers should return to work or not.The Department of Education has said more detailed guidance to support schools in implementing these arrangements will be published shortly.Special needs assistantsThousands of students with additional needs receive support from special needs assistants. They play a crucial role in assisting children to be included in class and with care needs.This support cannot be carried out at a distance so the guidelines advise wearing a visor or face mask.However, many SNAs says the guidance is vague and does not take account of the fact that most nowadays support several children across different classrooms.Many have questioned whether they will be permitted to move outside of a classroom, when all public health guidance is aimed at creating “pods” and “bubbles” of students which cut down the risk of cross-contamination between classes.A new official induction training video gives a fleeting reference to the need to take extra care when moving between classes, though many SNAs say this raises questions over how the integrity of class bubbles and pods and can be maintained.Covid-19 casesMost acknowledge that Covid-19 outbreaks in schools are inevitable. What is less clear is whether a pod of pupils, an entire class or the entire school might have to shut in the event of a positive diagnosis.If there is confirmation of Covid-19, public health authorities will step in to establish what close contacts a child had. Schools will be expected to assist by referring to their seating plans and attendance records.The question of how many other pupils will need to self-isolate will be one for public health authorities. There is no certainty about how this will play out. We can only speculate that school closures will only be triggered based on the extent to which a child with a positive diagnosis had contact with others in the school.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Dismantling of protections \u0026lsquois making it harder for future administrations to use science\u0026rsquoLoss equivalent to an ice sheet over landmass of Ireland to a depth of 300 metresDiesel and petrol consumption fell as transport restrictions took hold, report shows"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"The by-the-wind sailor\u0026rsquos sworn foe, the violet sea snail, floats upside-down alongside itMichael Viney: North Atlantic\u0026rsquos top predator now shares island with 13 other speciesMichael Viney: The wayside ashes of the west stand as defiantly healthy emblems of their kindInidual ants are certainly not smart, but their group wisdom may exceed our ownMichael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Stephen Donnelly, has warned that Ireland is at a tipping point with regard to Covid-19 and that the country may be locked down again.

The public health advice is that we are at a tipping point and we are doing everything we can to suppress this virus to stop a second lockdown”.He said that if a second lockdown were to happen, healthcare services will be “severely curtailed”. Currently, the strategy is to use “targeted measures to suppress the virus while keeping as much of our society and our economy open as possible”. He argued that the experiences of Kildare, Laois, and Offaly showed that suppressing the virus through this strategy was possible.He warned, however: “If there is a second wave the Government will have to consider the blunt instrument which we know works, that is, a lockdown. We are doing everything we can to avoid that.”He raised the prospect of lockdown measures still in place in Co Kildare being lifted, if the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) agrees. The profile of the disease will be discussed at a meeting of the team on Thursday.“If the restrictions can be lifted early based on public health advice, they most certainly will be,” he said.‘Comprehensive winter plan’The warning came as the Department of Health confirmed a further 164 cases of the disease had been diagnosed in the State, and no new deaths linked with the virus. As of midnight on Tuesday, there have been a total of 28,363 diagnoses, and 1,777 deaths in the Republic.Mr Donnelly said that the winter plan for the health services is being produced several months early, and will be the “most comprehensive winter plan that has ever been launched”, but he warned that “because of the costings involved . . . it will not be cheap”.At an earlier Committee session, Health Service Executive head Paul Reid said that the plan was “not just about a winter plan”, and that the HSE board is finalising plans “for a set of funding that will see us through the winter and through 2021”.This will involve a range of significant, different approaches aiming to keep people out of hospitals,” he said.Mr Donnelly also said that “we may well end up at a public inquiry” into deaths in nursing homes in the State and that he is “open to the idea”.

File photograph Nick Bradshaw Insisting that he “broke no law”, Ireland’s European commissioner Phil Hogan bowed to mounting pressure last night and resigned, becoming the latest casualty of an extraordinary political controversy stemming from last week’s Oireachtas Golf Society dinner.Mr Hogan departed after conversations with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen yesterday, though he insisted that the decision was his own and he had not been asked for his resignation.It was clear in recent days that there was growing unhappiness in the commission at Mr Hogan’s incomplete explanations of his movements around Ireland in advance of last week’s golf dinner in apparent violation – though he denied it – of coronavirus restrictions.The uncompromising attitude of the Government – which made clear since the weekend its view that Mr Hogan should resign, while conceding it was a decision for the commission president – further added to the momentum against the Irish commissioner.Earlier yesterday, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said Mr Hogan had “undermined the whole approach to public health in Ireland”.The announcement was greeted with relief in Government circles last night with sources hoping that the Coalition could now put the Oireachtas golf controversy – which has dominated politics for the past week and aroused huge public anger – behind it.The Government faces huge challenges over the coming days as schools reopen for the first time since March.Mr Hogan’s resignation brings to an end a colourful and impactful political career ning nearly four decades as Fine Gael councillor, TD for his native Kilkenny, minister and – since 2014 – Ireland’s EU commissioner.He was regarded as one of the genuine “big beasts” of Irish politics – a fierce champion of his own party who often raised the hackles of his opponents.In a statement, Mr Hogan said the controversy was becoming a distraction from his work as a commissioner and would undermine it in the key months ahead.Regret“I deeply regret that my trip to Ireland – the country that I have been so proud to represent as a public servant for most of my adult life – caused such concern, unease and upset. I have always tried to comply with all relevant Covid-19 regulations in Ireland and had understood that I had met with all relevant public health guidelines, particularly following confirmation of a negative Covid-19 test,” he said.“I reiterate my heartfelt apology to the Irish people for the mistakes I made during my visit. The Irish people have made incredible efforts to contain the coronavirus and the European Commission will continue to support you, and all EU member states, in defeating this terrible pandemic.”He also said he recognised and appreciated the devastating impact of Covid-19 on iniduals and families.In a brief statement, Dr von der Leyen paid tribute to Mr Hogan’s contribution as Commissioner.“Commissioner Phil Hogan has submitted his resignation. I respect his decision. I am very grateful to him for his tireless work as a trade commissioner since the start of this mandate and for his successful term as commissioner in charge of agriculture in the previous college. He was a valuable and respected member of the college. I wish him all the best for the future,” she said.Government Buildings also paid tribute to Mr Hogan, saying he had served Europe and Ireland “with distinction”. In a joint statement, Mr Martin, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar and Green Party leader Eamon Ryan also said he had made the “correct decision” to stand down.Sources in Brussels said Mr Hogan’s resignation began to look inevitable yesterday when it became apparent to officials in Dr von der Leyen’s office that his lengthy explanation of his movements during his time in Ireland – supplied at her request – was incomplete in some respects, damaging trust between the president and the commissioner.Mr Hogan’s itinerary revealed he had not completed 14 days of self-isolation according to the rules for incoming travellers, and contradicted earlier statements from a spokeswoman for the commission that claimed he had isolated for the full two weeks. This raised questions about whether he had misled his employer about his movements.In addition, eyewitnesses came forward to say that in the week after his arrival in Ireland he had not been isolating, but instead had been using the public restaurant, bar and library of the K Club hotel and golf resort in Co Kildare.Ireland will now have to nominate a new commissioner to replace Mr Hogan. It is unclear whether Ireland will retain the key trade portfolio, as this is at the discretion of Dr von der Leyen, who may choose to reshuffle her commissioners.His departure is also likely to increase pressure on newly appointed Supreme Court judge Séamus Woulfe, who also attended the dinner in Clifden last week. His attendance is the subject of an investigation by the former chief justice, Susan Denham."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4340148.1598520755!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"von der leyen asks government for man and woman as candidates to replace phil hogan","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFormer European commissioner Phil Hogan and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Photograph: Stephanie LecocqEPA.European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen has asked the Government to suggest a man and a woman as candidates for the position of Irish commissioner following the resignation of Phil Hogan. Dr von der Leyen said that she had “respect” for Mr Hogan’s decision to resign, which came after days of discussions with him to establish his movements in Ireland in which it emerged he had not observed the 14-day period of self-isolation required for incoming travellers from Belgium. “Over the past days I discussed with Phil Hogan about his movements in Ireland, in light of information that emerged regarding respect of public health guidelines in Ireland,” the president said.“In the current circumstances as Europe fights to reduce the spread of the coronavirus and Europeans make sacrifices and accept painful restrictions, I expect the members of the college to be particularly vigilant about compliance with applicable national or regional rules or recommendations.”Dr von der Leyen said it was now up to the Irish government to “present suitable candidates” to serve in the Commission for Ireland, and that she would ask for a man and a woman to be forward for her consideration.Achieving a gender balance among the commissioners was a goal set by President von der Leyen when she took up her post at the end of last year.Ireland is not guaranteed to retain the influential trade portfolio that Mr Hogan held as she can opt to reshuffle her cabinet, and this is understood to depend on the experience of the candidates put forward. President von der Leyen said she had not yet decided on the issue.“At a later stage I will decide on the final allocation of portfolios in the college of commissioners,” she said.In the interim, the trade brief will be managed by the Latvian official Valdis Dombrovskis, who is executive vice president of the European Commission."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4339585.1598474805!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"who is in the frame to replace hogan as ireland s commissioner","story":"Chatter about Phil Hogan’s possible successor as EU commissioner began shortly after he was first named as one of the attendees at the Oireachtas golf dinner last week, demonstrating among other things the unsentimental nature of politics.Then, Hogan’s removal seemed a remote prospect as the controversy escalated, the level of speculation about his successor increased in due proportion.The first important conversation will take place between Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Tánaiste Leo Varadkar, and then between the two men and the Green Party leader Eamon Ryan.They will have to decide if a serving politician should take the role - as is usually the case, politicians being in favour of giving politicians jobs - or someone with an official background but who understands how Brussels works.On Wednesday morning, the Brussels based politico.eu website reported that David O’Sullivan, formerly the highest-ranking official in the Commission, could be a possible replacement for Hogan if he goes, while others have suggested that Catherine Day, who succeeded O’Sullivan in that role, might fill the gap.Another name mentioned on Wednesday night was Andrew McDowell, a director of the European Investment Bank and former Fine Gael economic adviser. A technocrat like Day or O’Sullivan could perhaps hold on to the trade portfolio, Brussels sources say, though politicians in Dublin wouldn’t like it.Appointing a serving politician from Dublin to the role presents the problem of a byelection. No government ever wants a byelection, but this Government will want to avoid one even more than most. On the other hand, a contest does not have to take place immediately it could be put off until early 2021, and the Government – assuming it is still in office at that point – has a solid enough majority to survive a defeat.Fine Gael sources insist that any replacement would be a “Fine Gael nomination”, assuming that Martin and Varadkar have agreed that the next Commissioner – due to be appointed in four years – would be a Fianna Fáil appointment. If this sounds rather like vying up the spoils of office in advance, this is an important part of making a coalition government work.Fianna Fáil sources, however, say this not not been discussed and most definitely not agreed.Fine Gael politicians whose names are circulating include Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney and Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe, who was recently elected as head of the Eurogroup of finance ministers. The loss of either would be a domestic blow to the party.The Covid-19 pandemic has seen Simon Harris grow in stature, but his appointment would be a surprise, while Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has European experience, but is new to Cabinet.There has been recurrent speculation that Varadkar himself might seek the Government’s nomination – in which case he would surely be granted it – but while he is very much at home in Brussels and fascinated by its power politics, it is hard to see him turning his back on both Irish politics and his party at such a relatively young age.Coveney seems a more likely emissary – as a former MEP and current Minister for Foreign Affairs, he knows Brussels and is known there.Some of his Fine Gael colleagues believe he might be tempted, though it would mean giving up his domestic political ambitions, generally reckoned not to have been totally extinguished by the victory of Varadkar in the 2017 Fine Gael leadership contest.One Government source suggested that Richard Bruton, the vastly experienced former minister, could slot in to the role, although if Brussels sources are correct that an Irish politician would be unlikely to retain the trade portfolio, his appointment would bring the danger of a byelection without the benefit of creating an extra Cabinet place for a Fine Gael minister.Gossip in Brussels also suggests that the name of MEP Mairead McGuinness could be in the frame, though Fine Gael sources play down the prospect.\u0026nbspOthers press the case for former Taoiseach Enda Kenny, though the prospect is dismissed among contemporary Fine Gaelers.With Hogan gone, the Government is likely to want to name a successor quickly to draw a line under the affair. The Commission will want someone who can be confirmed by the European Parliament without controversy.The question of who is getting the big job always transfixes the political class, though the public largely don’t care about it, or are actively hostile to protracted public discussion on the point. Many of them see politicians as only out for themselves anyway.This sorry episode will have done nothing to persuade them otherwise."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Brenton Tarrant killed 51 Muslim worshippers at two mosques in New Zealand last yearLong-serving president already general secretary of the party and head of the militaryTed Hui and Lam Cheuk-ting detained as part of crackdown under new security lawVictims and relatives seek life without parole for man who killed 51 in 2019 attackResearchers say man had no Covid-19 symptoms the second time, suggesting immune system kept virus somewhat in checkLocals and police search the debris after five-storey structure crumbles in MahadLuon Sovath, who has spent decades fighting for human rights, was the victim of a vicious smear campaign this summerFears that country teetering on edge of major outbreak supported by data on rise in daily casesWhite supremacist killed 51 worshippers at two New Zealand mosques in March 2019Health condition \u0026lsquovery worrying\u0026rsquo after drinking tea that allies believe was laced with poisonDecision to transfer Kremlin critic ill with suspected poisoning after day of lobbyingProtests over last two months most serious threat yet to prime minister\u0026rsquos administrationLack of foreign visitors has facilitated increase in poaching and loss of revenueReport by US intelligence agencies sheds light on actions \u0026ndash and inactions \u0026ndash that created global crisisTens of thousands evacuated as record-breaking rains hit country\u0026rsquos southwestCountry entering dangerous new phase of rising infections in small towns and villagesUS president \u0026lsquopatently wrong\u0026rsquo when telling Minnesota crowd New Zealand situation \u0026lsquoterrible\u0026rsquoPolling put back by four weeks as 49 Covid-19 cases recorded in AucklandStudent-led demonstrations gain momentum testing laws protecting royal familyCovid-19 outbreak spreads to more than 30 people and extends beyond capitalStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4335701.1598013937!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit uk time wasting makes deal unlikely says barnier","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBrexit negotiator Michel Barnier: “Frankly I am disappointed and I am worried.”  Photograph: Yves HermanPOOLAFP via Getty ImagesThe EU’s Brexit negotiator has warned that valuable time is being wasted in trade talks with the UK as he accused his British counterparts of failing to make progress on topics of key interest to Europe during the latest round of trade negotiations. Michel Barnier said he was disappointed, concerned and surprised by the lack of progress displayed in discussions that took place in Brussels this week, reiterating that at this stage an agreement between the two sides still looked unlikely and that there was a risk the two sides would fail to ratify a deal by the end of the year. “Too often this week it felt as if we were going backwards more than forwards,” Mr Barnier said at a press conference following the conclusion of the latest negotiations. “I simply do not understand why we are wasting valuable time.” The failure to advance the discussions that began on Tuesday evening leaves only a narrow window in which to agree the text of a trade agreement, translate it into multiple European languages and obtain ratification before the post-Brexit transition period ends on December 31st. While both the UK and EU insist they want a deal, EU officials decried a lack of momentum on the British side in the wake of Thursday’s session, with one describing it as “puzzling”. David Frost, the UK’s chief negotiator, acknowledged in a separate statement that there had been “little progress” during the week’s talks, but he also insisted that a deal remained possible even if it would not be easy to achieve.State aid and fisheriesThe EU wants the two sides to push towards a common understanding on the topics of state aid and fisheries, rather than leaving these highly sensitive topics until later in the talks, but British negotiators are seeking to advance to a legal text in other areas where the two sides are closer together.Lord Frost criticised the EU’s approach on Friday. “The EU is still insisting not only that we must accept continuity with EU state aid and fisheries policy, but also that this must be agreed before any further substantive work can be done in any other area of the negotiation, including on legal texts,” he said. “This makes it unnecessarily difficult to make progress.”Mr Barnier complained that he was not seeing any willingness on the UK side to take on board the EU’s priorities, adding that the need for a “level playing field” that ensures fair competition in areas including state aid would not go away and was a non-negotiable precondition to any trade deal.“No international agreement was ever reached without the parties agreeing to common rules,” he said. The notion of a zero-tariff, zero-quota agreement without level playing field provisions and a balanced deal on fisheries was a “non-starter” for the EU, and the absence of progress in these areas was blocking everything, he warned.British negotiating officials said the talks were stalling due to the problematic issues of fishing and state aid, over which they accused the EU of seeking to maintain the status quo.“What is frustrating is that Barnier wants to see us continuing arrangements very like those we had as members of the EU. The principle of ‘Brexit means Brexit’ is a good one and should be applied across the board,” the official said.“The process block now is that we must accept their position on state aid and fisheries before we can talk about anything else. We’re obviously not going to do that, so we’re frozen.”Key concernsMr Barnier confirmed that the UK had presented a draft legal text for the trade deal during the round of talks, but he added that this had not addressed the EU’s key concerns, serving instead as a reminder of the UK’s existing positions.Lord Frost added that the UK was seeking a relationship that ensures Britain regains “sovereign control of our own laws, borders, and waters” and is similar to other agreements struck by the EU elsewhere. “When the EU accepts this reality in all areas of the negotiation, it will be much easier to make progress.” A dinner between Mr Barnier and Lord Frost was held on Thursday evening after negotiations concluded, which officials suggested was tense following the lack of progress. “It was a very nice dinner, we had courteous and friendly discussions but we didn’t hide the difficulties between us,” one inidual said. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Olivier DoulieryAFP via Getty ImagesIt was late afternoon on February 2nd, the eve of the Iowa caucuses. We were jammed into a high-school gymnasium in Des Moines, the state capital, for Joe Biden’s closing rally.No one thought he would win the primary season’s talismanic opening contest the following day. Nor was he expected to come close to beating Bernie Sanders, the socialist Vermonter, in New Hampshire the next week. Though he was still ahead in the national polls, the 77-year-old former vice-president was treated as yesterday’s news.A crowd of several hundred was waiting unexpectantly. Biden entered roughly half an hour late, accompanied by a phalanx of retired politicians: John Kerry (76), the former secretary of state Chris Dodd (75), the retired senator from Connecticut Tom Vilsack (69), former governor of Iowa and Harold Schaitberger (73), president of the International Association of Firefighters.The oxygen seemed to drain from the room. As Biden’s surrogates spoke one after the other, the air got progressively thinner. By the time the candidate got up to speak, it was positively embalmed. “This is like a wake,” joked one veteran television anchor. Biden’s low-key soliloquy did little to lift the energy.Such are the limits of conventional wisdom. Twenty-seven days later, Biden grabbed the Democratic mantle after sweeping the South Carolina primary. With the notable exception of Sanders, who fought on for another five weeks, most of the rest of the field dropped out and endorsed him. It was a breathtaking twist.With hindsight, Biden officials say they always knew he would be the Democratic nominee. They were playing the long game. “We made a decision from the start not to listen to the loudest voices on Twitter,” says Stef Feldman, Biden’s policy director. That was not how many sounded at the time. When I asked a Biden staffer in Des Moines about the campaign’s mood, he used the TV anchor’s same funereal analogy.Who could blame them? Biden’s long history of running for the White House offered no cause for hope. Over a  of more than 32 years, he had not won a single primary. In 1987, he crashed out months before the voting began, having been accused of plagiarising a speech by Neil Kinnock, leader of the British Labour party.In 2008, he quit after having won just 0.9 per cent of the Iowa caucus vote. “At that point, most people thought his presidential career was over,” says Shailagh Murray, then a journalist with the Washington Post, who went on to become Biden’s deputy chief of staff. He had at least another 12 years to go. Nobody that night imagined that Barack Obama, winner of the Iowa caucus, would go on to pick Biden as his ­running mate.Ceremonial presidentThe vicissitudes of Biden’s 50 years in politics ought to make anyone sceptical of forecasts for this November. In the absence of time machines, we can only go by the numbers. Both the betting markets (about two to one in Biden’s favour) and the polls (an average eight-percentage-point lead over Donald Trump) suggest Biden will be America’s 46th president.What manner of president would he make? Half of Washington claims to know the man well. At a year above the median US male’s life expectancy, many expect him to be a ceremonial president. Even Biden’s close friends admit his energy and power of recall are not what they were.His would be a restorationist presidency – an erasure of what he is fond of describing as the Trumpian “aberration”. Others, notably Trump, depict him as a geriatric prisoner of the Democratic Party’s left. Most agree that whatever his agenda, and whatever the time of day, he would probably still talk too much.The word “logorrhea” (a tendency to extreme loquacity) has recently come into fashion. Biden’s campaign is keen to emphasise he would not, like Trump, be the “Twitterer-in-chief”.Those who know him the best – many of whom spoke to me for this profile – are in little doubt about the character he would bring to the presidency. Their Biden may stray too readily into schmaltz. But his empathy for people is real. In this pandemic-blighted election year, that quality could count for a lot.“Biden is the same guy I first met in 1969 – he was full of piss and vinegar,” says Louis Susman, a Chicago-based investor and former ambassador to the UK. “He doesn’t suffer from inner demons, he doesn’t bear grudges and he loves being around people.”Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. No other serious figure has tried this long to make it over the finishing line in recent history.A majority of Americans were not born when Biden first entered national politics. At 30, he was the fifth youngest senator in the country’s history after he won office in 1972. Biden’s 48-year political career is older than John F Kennedy, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama when they were elected.Yet he sounds remarkably similar today to the ambitious, blue-collar Irish-American that he was then. Staffers tried and failed to get him to avoid using words such as “record player” during the 2020 primaries. Calling someone a “horse’s ass” is no longer thought to be cutting. In an interview with Kitty Kelley in 1974, Biden worried about being seen as a “gay young bachelor” around Washington – by which he meant “happy”, not “LGBTQ”.So popular are Biden’s anachronisms that there is even a “Biden insult bot” – a Twitter algorithm – to which fans can turn. “You got something stuck in your craw, you milk-swillin’ circus peanut,” reads one tweet. “Shut your piehole, you hood-winked britch soiler,” reads another.‘Amtrak Joe’Most American voters already know of the ­tragedy that struck Biden in his early career. A few weeks after he was elected to the Senate, he lost his wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter, Naomi, in a car crash while they were Christmas shopping in Delaware, his home state.His sons, Beau, aged three, and Hunter, aged two, survived but were hospitalised with severe injuries. Most people would have disintegrated. Biden considered not taking his Senate seat. In the end, he was persuaded to be sworn in at the hospital beside one of his sons. He said he could only continue in politics if he saw his kids every morning and night.Thus was born “Amtrak Joe” – the senator who took the 90-minute journey each evening from Washington to Wilmington to say goodnight to his sons. He commuted until 2008, long after the boys had grown up. Subtracting a tenth of nights for other travel, and nearly half the year for recess and weekends, I calculate that Biden spent at least 21,000 hours – or three years of his life – on that train.“He knew the names of every conductor and they all loved him,” says Paul Laudicina, Biden’s legislative director between 1977 and 1982. “Often, he would still be talking when he boarded, and I would go to Wilmington with him and then cross the platform and come straight back.”In the 1974 Kelley interview, the famously acerbic journalist said Biden “reeks of decency”. He nevertheless managed to sound almost Trumpian about his deceased wife. “Let me show you my favourite picture of her,” he says, holding up a snapshot of Neilia in a bikini. “She had the best body of any woman I ever saw. She looks better than a Playboy bunny, doesn’t she?” Kelley described his office as a shrine to Neilia.Biden recently conceded that he has been too invasive of women’s personal space – “handsiness” has also entered the DC lexicon. Unlike some of his contemporaries, however, he has not been dogged by rumours of infidelity. A former Senate staffer, Tara Reade, accused him earlier this year of sexually assaulting her in a corridor in 1993. Biden denies it and her story has been criticised as inconsistent.In 1977 Biden married Jill Tracy Jacobs, a teacher based in Wilmington. On their first date he dressed in a jacket. When he dropped her back home he shook her hand. According to What it Takes, the ­celebrated 1988 campaign book by the late ­Richard Ben Cramer, Jill said she could not believe such men still existed. “Jill is Biden’s least appreciated strength,” says Susman, who often hosted the Bidens for Thanksgiving in his Nantucket home.Much of Biden’s sense of gravity comes from her. Even when her husband was vice-president, Jill Biden continued to teach every day at a community college in Northern Virginia. When he left office in 2017, the Bidens’ net worth was less than $500,000. They still hadn’t paid off the mortgage on their Wilmington home.Irish-Catholic and handsomeUntil he was rescued from near-certain genteel decline by Obama, Biden was defined by his disastrous 1988 presidential bid. Most of the people who helped him on that jinxed quest, including Ted Kaufman, his long-running chief of staff, Michael Donilon, his chief strategist today, and Donilon’s brother Tom, Biden’s foreign-policy adviser, are still around him.They are mostly Irish-American and very tight-knit. Cathy Russell, Tom Donilon’s wife, was Jill Biden’s chief of staff when she was “second lady”. Her husband is tipped as a possible secretary of state. Kaufman is running Biden’s presidential transition – that long and rickety bridge between victory and inauguration.In the 1988 campaign, Biden tried to present himself as the new John F Kennedy – young, Irish-Catholic and handsome. It never quite took hold. Then he saw a video of Kinnock’s soaring oratory – “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university?” That was the middle-class poetry Biden had been lacking – the story of how the sons and daughters of coal miners had been lifted up by the welfare state, Britain’s version of the New Deal.“He grabbed that tape and took it home he inhaled the thing,” wrote Cramer. “It was like when Barbra Streisand came on the radio – Kinnock was singing Joe’s song.” For the most part, Biden credited Kinnock’s words. But the rival Michael Dukakis campaign found one tape where Biden had not. They leaked it.Suddenly, Biden was inundated with calls asking whether his grandfather had been a coal miner (none of his forebears had been). “It looked like Joe didn’t just steal the words, it looked like he ripped off Kinnock’s life,” Cramer wrote. A few months after dropping out, Biden had a near-fatal ­aneurysm. Then another. He was given a 50-50 chance of ­surviving the first nine-hour operation.“Joe wouldn’t be alive today if he had still been running for president,” says Kaufman. “He wouldn’t have had the time to get his headaches checked out.” Or, as Biden said when he emerged from the anaesthetic: “Now I know why the campaign ended like it did.” For what it’s worth, Kinnock’s Labour Party lost the election too.Emotional antennaeBiden’s 2008 loss left less of a mark on him, partly because he became vice-president less than a year later. “How could you begrudge losing to Barack Obama?” says Murray. “Obama was like The Beatles.”The campaign Biden still regrets was the one that he didn’t fight in 2016. His reluctance stemmed from another tragedy, the death in 2015 of his son Beau from brain cancer. But he had little encouragement from Obama, who had already committed to backing Hillary Clinton. Biden’s internal polls show that he would have beaten Trump. But he had little chance of wresting the crown from Clinton, whose machine he could not hope to match.In his memoir Promise Me, Dad, named after Beau’s request that his father stay in politics, Biden recounts his anger following a Politico story that he was exploiting his son’s death for electoral purposes. “It exceeded even my worst expectations of what the opposition was going to be like,” he wrote. In truth, he could not discuss running without breaking down. “He would literally start to cry every time we raised the subject,” says a Biden ­confidante.In another cycle, Biden’s lachrymosity might have been an albatross. During coronavirus, his emotional antennae look like a virtue. More than 165,000 Americans have now died in the pandemic. That toll is likely to be approaching a quarter of a million by early November.Trump’s inability to express condolences for America’s grieving families could not be further apart from Biden’s. In 2016, anger was the dominant political emotion. In 2020, it feels more like sadness. “If Trump were matter, then Biden is anti-matter – their characters are opposites,” says Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor who has been advising Biden on constitutional matters since the mid-1980s.When Biden was vice-president, Norm Ornstein, a veteran Congressional watcher, lost his son in a tragic accident. “The moment he heard, Biden telephoned and spent an hour on the phone with me and my wife, talking us through it,” says ­Ornstein. “The next day I received a handwritten letter of condolence from him. There is nothing fake about his sympathy. He feels it deeply.”Andrew Yang, the maverick hit of the Democratic primaries, says: “When most people hadn’t figured out who I was, Joe took me aside and was very gracious and friendly. This was just as true when things were going badly for him – he’s always steady and good-natured, in public and in private.”‘Shoot. Me. Now’Some in Biden’s world admit they have one or two concerns about the election and beyond. Chief of these is his tendency to make gaffes. In that sense, the lockdown has a silver lining: there is no campaign trail to avoid. Zoom is easier to manage.When Obama was elected to the US Senate in 2004, Biden invited him to join the foreign relations committee, of which he was chairman. Having listened to a trademark Biden disquisition, Obama scribbled a note and handed it to a staffer. It read: “Shoot. Me. Now.”When the two men were discussing how they would handle their White House relationship, Obama said: “I want your advice Joe, I just want it in 10-minute, not 60-minute, increments.” For the most part, Biden complied.Sometimes, he could not help himself. The term “Bidenism” – self-inflicted public humiliation – has long been in currency. “Stand up Chuck, let ’em see ya,” Biden once said to a Missouri state senator in a wheelchair. “Folks, I can tell you, I’ve known eight presidents, three of them intimately,” he said in praise of Obama, adding: “I promise you, the president has a big stick, I promise you,” in a mangled rendition of Theodore Roosevelt’s dictum about speaking softly and carrying a big stick.Fear of such miscues saw the Obama camp “quarantine” Biden for most of the 2012 re-election campaign. This year’s actual quarantine could thus be helpful.Many in Biden world are betting that his choice of Kamala Harris as running mate will immunise him against a record of racial gaffes. Earlier this year, Biden apologised after saying that “you ain’t black” if you would consider voting against him. As a mixed-race American of Indian and Jamaican heritage, the Harris pick will buy Biden more protection.Given Biden’s age, she is far likelier than most running mates to become president. As Biden discovered in the primaries, she also knows how to throw a punch.It is hard to find anyone in Biden’s circle who is losing sleep over three debates with Trump later this year. As Biden showed in 2008 with Sarah Palin and in 2012 with Paul Ryan – the Republican running mates of John McCain and Mitt Romney – he is a surprisingly taut debater.Trump, meanwhile, seems to be afflicted with his own severe dose of logorrhea. His recent boast in a Fox News interview that he recalled five words in order in a cognitive test was greeted with mockery. “I have two words for you,” says a senior adviser, when I ask about Biden’s age and prolixity: “Donald Trump. ”Biden’s peopleNor is the campaign worried about Twitter. When I asked two Biden officials whether he composed his own tweets, or would know how to send one, I got an unexpectedly constipated response: “No one has ever asked us that.” It turns out that Biden does not physically send his own tweets but is involved with their substance.Their second concern is ageing. At 74, Trump is only a smidgen younger than Biden. The difference with Trump is the people with whom Biden would surround himself. Chief among these is Ron Klain, a long-standing Biden aide who is likely to be White House chief of staff. Tony Blinken would probably be his national security adviser.Other top-job contenders would include Tom Donilon and Susan Rice (successive national security advisers to Obama), Kurt Campbell (who ran Asia policy for Obama), Jake Sullivan (who leads Biden’s campaign policy), Nick Burns, a former under secretary of state, and Bill Burns (no relation), a former deputy secretary of state. Michèle Flournoy, a former under secretary of defence, is tipped as a likely Pentagon chief.One adviser predicted that Biden would choose Romney, the Republican senator from Utah, as his secretary of state. That would annoy Vladimir Putin’s Russia, whom Romney described as America’s “number one geopolitical foe”. It would also upset most Democrats for very different reasons.Either way, the contrast between Biden’s friends and the parade of often bizarre cameos that have staffed the Trump administration is glaring. The current president is now on his fourth chief of staff and sixth national security adviser. By contrast, most of Biden’s coterie have known him for decades.“What leaps out about Biden’s people is their competence,” says John Podesta, a senior official in both the Clinton and Obama White Houses. “Neither he nor his team need training wheels.”There are also lingering worries about Hunter Biden, who has long been a source of concern for his father. “Joe has a total blind spot about Hunter,” says a close family friend.Hunter was discharged from the US Navy because he tested positive for cocaine. He launched various business ventures while his father was vice-president. He was accused of monetising the Biden name and subsequently got a seat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.Trump’s attempts to extort Ukraine to supply Biden opposition research resulted in his impeachment last year (though he was acquitted by the Senate). “The campaign just has to keep Hunter out of the picture,” says the friend.Radical platformWhat would Biden actually do in office? Tackling the pandemic would be the first, second and third priority of any incoming president. Little can happen while the US economy is under semi-­permanent lockdown.Beyond that his economic platform is radical by the standards of any recent Democratic president, including Obama. “We would have the largest mobilisation of investments since world war two,” says Feldman. “We would start by putting pandemic logistics and supply on a war footing.”Some people compare the gargantuan challenges of today to 1932, when Franklin D Roosevelt won the election in the middle of the Great Depression. In spite of running a fairly bland campaign, FDR then embarked on a streak of “bold, persistent experimentation” that would remake America.But the differences are more interesting. For all its ravages, coronavirus is not as intractable as the Great Depression. By next January, the world should be closer to having a vaccine. Biden would also be fulfilling the first rule of any job – always follow an under-performer.He could achieve a lot in his first 100 days simply by covering the basics, such as launching a national coronavirus plan, shunning Twitter and not insulting foreign leaders. “If you have an American president at foreign summits eating with his mouth closed and not throwing cutlery around, the world will give him a standing ovation,” says one adviser and friend.Low-hanging foreign-policy fruit that Biden would pluck in his opening days include rejoining the World Health Organisation, the Paris agreement on climate change and the Iran nuclear deal, says Jake Sullivan. He would also convene a global summit to tackle Covid-19.Domestic steps would include stopping work on the US-Mexico border wall (such as it is), setting up a daily coronavirus briefing led by Dr Anthony Fauci or Ron Klain (who led Obama’s Ebola team) and picking an attorney general who would embrace planks of Black Lives Matter’s criminal-justice reform agenda.In his dealings both with Republicans and foreign leaders, Biden would place great stock in personal chemistry. Enjoying the company of people is one area where Biden is as different to Obama as he is to Trump. “The thing that Biden most likes is what Obama liked the least – the ­personal stuff,” says Podesta. Nick Burns says Biden revels in the “constant gardening” of diplomacy – talking frequently to his counterparts.Wishful thinkingSceptics point out that today’s Republican Party is unrecognisable to the one with which Biden grew up. Should he emerge intact from transition with a paranoid Trump, the chances of the defeated party working with him will be slim. Woke nativism will prove a more durable pathogen than Covid-19.Moreover, Biden’s global honeymoon would be unlikely to last long. Most people view his musings about restoring the status quo ante – going back to the world before Trump – as wishful thinking, not that geopolitical trends were particularly stable during the Obama years.China looms far larger today than it did in 2016. Biden’s favourite European, Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, is due to retire by next year. And Biden will neither be inclined – nor likely in a position – to offer Britain’s Boris Johnson the US-UK trade deal he craves.Tony Blinken, Biden’s senior foreign policy adviser, says Biden’s scepticism about Obama’s ineffectual Afghanistan surge looks better and better in hindsight. “I respect Gates tremendously but he just wanted approval for his Afghanistan plan and Biden disagreed,” he says. Biden was in favour of US intervention in Bosnia in 1995, he adds, to convey that Biden is not some ­inveterate peacenik.But Biden’s biggest migraine would probably be at home. In the coming weeks, Trump is likely to make a lot of Biden’s “socialist” agenda – the hundreds of billions he has pledged to spend on everything from college education to rural broadband.Should Biden follow Obama’s example and pick Wall Street-friendly economic advisers, the left’s distrust would soon resurface. Last week, Lawrence Summers, Obama’s chief economic adviser and Bill Clinton’s Treasury secretary, ruled out joining a Biden administration. “My time in government is behind me,” he told the Aspen Security Forum.Happy passengerTo many people’s surprise, the left has largely fallen into line. Bernie Sanders dropped nearly all his most-cherished demands to agree a joint platform with Biden. This is in stark contrast to Sanders’s stand-offish – and simmeringly uneasy – ceasefire with Hillary Clinton in 2016.An estimated one-fifth of Sanders’s supporters in 2016 either sat on their hands or voted for Trump. Biden has not adopted a universal basic income, Medicare for all or a wealth tax – Sanders’s top three priorities.Yet the Vermont senator seems to be a happy passenger on Amtrak Joe’s train. Their policies may differ but their values are not miles apart. “Biden believes that his ultimate calling is to make life better for the middle class,” says Jared Bernstein, an economic adviser. “His watchword is ‘dignity.’” Ted Kaufman adds: “Biden and Bernie may disagree ideologically but they respect each other’s integrity.”Might such charms work on Republicans? I spoke to many people in Biden’s world and none thought the Republican leopard was likely to change its spots. One said: “Joe is still a romantic about the Senate. He will have to learn the hard way.”The omens for old-fashioned Biden-style bipartisanship are not cheerful. Yet there is an improbability to Biden’s odyssey that should give anyone pause. The lyrics may be corny. The music is not. It is an odd mix of Shakespearean tragedy and Shakespearean comedy.I have heard people describe Biden as the embodiment of America’s can-do spirit. Shailagh Murray called him a “spiritual optimist”. A campaign official talked of his “strategic empathy”. I have also heard people call Biden a “clown”, including a former Obama official.Biden loves to talk of when “the man meets the moment”. The joke is that he has said this about himself every time he has run for office. There has never been a moment where Biden does not think he should be residing in the White House.But like a stopped clock, perhaps this time he is right. “Life is about choices, right?” says a former senior CIA official who has interacted with Biden over more than three decades. “Biden or Trump?” He admitted that he occasionally saw Biden as a “mediocre” politician. But he added that Biden always struck him as fundamentally decent, which sounds like a subversive quality in today’s Washington.“Even if you thought that Biden was mediocre,” he continued, “you would take mediocre over catastrophic every time.”– Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Full coverage of the US presidential election 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"air bridge london new york possible top level talks held","story":"An “air bridge” between London and New York to enable travellers to sidestep quarantine is being discussed in top-level UK-US Government talks, The  understands.Ministers are studying plans for regional “air bridges” which would enable business and other travellers to come to the UK from “low-risk” areas like New York city within countries like the US which are “red listed” because of their continued overall high coronavirus rates.New York, which introduced one of the toughest lockdowns, has brought its seven-day infection rate down to just 7.2 cases per 100,000, which is below England’s 11.3 yet remains “red listed” forcing any American visitors to the UK to automatically quarantine for 14 days.“There are discussions going on at a very senior level around opening up London and New York. They are at a very early stage but it is vital to get business going with a major trading partner especially as we near Brexit,” said a source.Last week Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, confirmed ministers were examining the possibility of “regional travel corridors” which could allow quarantine-free flights from “low risk” areas within countries with high coronavirus rates.Asked about the US-UK talks, a Department for Transport spokesman said: “Conversations between Governments in other countries on a whole range of issues take place regularly. “Public health remains the UK’s top priority and we are committed to tackling this virus while enabling a sustainable and responsible return to international travel. We keep the data for all countries and territories under constant review and will not add a country to our travel corridor list unless safe to do so.” BDL, Germany’s main aviation industry group,  is already preparing with the US to launch a pilot project to  link US airports in Chicago, Boston, Los Angeles and New York’s Newark with Frankfurt and Munich. It would rely on Covid-190 testing already in place in Boston and German airports.Paul Charles, chief executive of the travel consultancy The PC Agency, said the US-UK talks would increase pressure on the Government to introduce Covid testing to enable incoming passengers to sidestep quarantine.“The US will only agree to this if there is proper testing in place in the UK. The delay in establishing a testing policy is in danger of holding up the opening of commercially-important travel corridors,” he said.An airport industry source added: “New York is the financial centre of the most powerful economic force in the world so we need to be able to fly there.”It comes as the US’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lifted the requirement for travellers returning to the US to quarantine for 14 days after visiting overseas destinations with a high number of confirmed coronavirus cases.Agreeing a travel corridor with the US would also likely require Donald Trump to lift the US travel ban, which was imposed at the outset of the pandemic.The moves come as the Government is expected to confirm that Switzerland is to have quarantine re-imposed following similar moves with France, Spain, Belgium, and the Netherlands. It is understood, however, that Cuba may be included on the quarantine-free “green” list.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"flaw governments plan masks schools children","story":"Lab technicians wear masks properly. Children do not. To make an accurate judgment of how successful masks would be in a school, you need to be aware of how children behave in large groups. I have been working in schools for over 20 years and I know what our children get up to. I love children. That’s why I work with them. But I’m not willing to pretend that they are angels.Children will swap their masks, ping them, lick them, spit in them and pass them around for fun, will shout obscenities through them, will bully each other over not having the right type of mask, will lose them, will wear them incorrectly and, most of all, their masks will encourage them to touch their faces dozens of times throughout the day. They are children, not lab technicians. That’s why we should ask whether masks in schools make children less and not more safe.The Government’s own safety guidance issued to schools in July said that Public Health England does not recommend using face coverings in school. As pupils will be in their own separate “bubbles” there is no need for them, and the guidance warned that misuse of masks could “inadvertently increase the risk of transmission”. This was wise advice.Do we really imagine a world where our teenagers turn up every day to school with a freshly washed mask? What about those who rarely wash their uniforms? And those children who come into school hungry every day? Will their parents forget to feed them but remember to give them a fresh mask?I am also left wondering what these pro-maskers think kids do when they leave the school gates. Do you really imagine they are wearing masks to go home? Or are many of them playing tongue tag in shopping malls instead? Does no one remember what it is to be a teenager?Have we thought about the impact masks will have on behaviour in schools? Teachers need to be able to see the mouths of their charges in order to hold them to account for chatting, swearing and the like. Mask them up and teachers won’t have a clue who said it.Bad behaviour increases incrementally and so slowly that it is hard to track the demise of a classroom. Think of the frog who, when you turn the heat up, gradually boils to death. First the chatter increases. With the teacher’s authority undermined, others chat even more. Eventually you have chaos in the classroom. The teacher is unable to teach properly. And that teacher will never get that behaviour back again. It is just how schools and kids work. Culture is everything.Let’s remember why we are sending children back to school. We want to them to catch up on all of their missed schooling. But if bad behaviour is through the roof, no one will be learning anything because teachers will not be able to teach.What we need is children washing their hands regularly and not wearing masks so that they aren’t encouraged to constantly touch their faces. Masks make us feel better because they are an obvious change to which the Government can point and say, “Look! We are keeping you safe!”.Sadly, masks mean we are now far less likely to take handwashing as seriously and this will be tenfold the case with children. Handwashing, social distancing as much as one can and keeping children in bubbles is the way to go in schools.Let’s not forget: The Office of National Statistics says that only 0.05 per cent of the population currently has the virus. Many studies also demonstrate that children do not pass the virus on to adults.Our Deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr Jenny Harries has said that car crashes on the way to school are a greater risk to children than Covid.Children connect with each other and with their teachers through smiles. Schools are built on relationships. Head teachers and senior leadership teams in our schools need to think very carefully before we ban our children from smiling. It is far from obvious that mask wearing in schools will make children safer, and head teachers should not be swayed by how things appear ,and rather look seriously at how things really are.Katharine Birbalsingh is the headmistress and founder of Michaela Community SchoolMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed top baby names england wales 2019 popular name","story":"It can be one of the most difficult decisions new parents have to make - choosing the name of your child which they will carry through life, shaping how they are perceived by their peers or even their opportunities in life.The question is  - do you play it safe and walk the tried and tested route or go out on a limb? An ordinary name that doesn\u0027t draw attention or something more outlandish?The Office for National Statistics (ONS) have now revealed the most popular baby names for last year, with detailed stats on exactly how many children were given each name in England and Wales.You can search for your name via the interactive tool below to see whether a name is going in or out of fashion.Did parents in 2019 beat Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds to the name Wilfred - which languished in 143rd place in the 2018 rankings of boys names with just 383 births?Amid the Royal fallout have British parents followed Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s lead after the birth of Archie last year? In previous years new parents in Britain have been generally reliable in their most common picks for the top names, and this year is no different.For the three years to 2018 Oliver and Olivia were crowned the most popular baby names in England and Wales, and this year they cemented that status.Oliver has been the most popular boys\u0027 name since 2013 while Olivia replaced Amelia in top place in 2016.Among the top boy\u0027s names Alfred, Chester, Hudson, Ibrahim and Oakley entered the 2019 top 100 - replacing Alex, Dexter, Dominic, Kai, Sonny and Tobias.Lara and Mabel replaced Aisha and Francesca in the top 100 girls’ names Mabel has not been in the top 100 since 1924.In 2019, Freya and Lily entered the top 10 replacing Ella and Emily. This is the first time Freya has been in the top 10 most popular girls’ names, while it is the first time Emily has not been in the top 10 since 1984. Margaret and Mary were the only girls’ names to have featured in the top 10 for a longer period of time than Emily.In contrast to the top 10 girls’ names, there were no new entries in the top 10 boys’ names. Arthur continued its recent rise, now at its highest position since records began in 1904 as the fourth most popular boys’ name, 11 years since returning to the top 100.The regional variation in top boys’ names continued in 2019 when, despite Oliver being the top name in England and Wales overall, it was only top in the East Midlands, the East of England, the South West and Wales.Muhammad remained the most popular boys’ name in the North West, Yorkshire and The Humber, the West Midlands, and London while Harry and Arthur were the most popular boys’ names in the North East and South East respectively. Of all the Arthurs born in England and Wales, a fifth were born in the South East.David Corps, vital statistics outputs branch at the ONS, said: “Oliver and Olivia continued their reign as the top boys’ and girls’ names in 2019, but analysis shows choices in baby names can differ depending on the mother’s age. We found younger mothers opted for more modern girls’ names like Harper, which has seen a rise since the Beckhams named their daughter so in 2011, and shortened boys’ names like Freddie. In contrast, older mothers chose more traditional names such as Jack and Charlotte.”Which names have been driven by celebrity and popular culture? Has the rise in popularity in some names been born out of new music and films, and which names have faded into obscurity?Since 2016, when the Amazon Alexa was first available in the UK, the girls’ name Alexa has decreased in popularity from 2016 when there were 332 girls named Alexa to just 39 in 2019.In contrast, a girls’ name that may have increased following the rise to fame of a celebrity is the name Dua. Dua Lipa, the popstar, had her first UK number one single in 2017. In that time, the number of girls named Dua has doubled from 63 in 2017 to 126 in 2019 this is the highest number since our annual records began in 1996.Similar trends have been seen in boys’ names where the name Taron has increased in popularity, with 48 boys born in 2019 being given this name, the most since detailed records began in 1996. This choice in name might be influenced by the actor Taron Egerton who starred in the 2019 award-winning Elton John biopic, Rocketman.Continuing the cinematic trends, the name Kylo appears to have increased in popularity since the release of the new Star Wars sequel trilogy. Kylo Ren, a leading character, first appeared in 2015. Since then, the number of boys named Kylo has risen from 10 to 67 in 2019.Despite the last season of Game of Thrones leaving fans disappointed, names from the fantasy series are still cropping up on birth certificates, with four girls named Daenerys in 2019.Looking back to 1996, when detailed annual rankings of baby names first became available, we have seen names rise and fall and some all but disappear completely.The first name Corbyn faded into obscurity in 2019, with fewer than two babies named Corbyn in the same year the former Labour leader crashed to a devastating election defeat.The ONS suppresses any figures fewer than two, and it is the first time there have been no entries for Corbyn since 1996. In 2018 12 baby boys were named Corbyn.The girls’ names Brittany and Kerry were reasonably popular 20 years ago, with Brittany the 101st most popular name in 1999, and Kerry was 136th in 1996. However, in 2019, there were two or fewer children given these names.There were similar cases for boys’ names. In 2019, there were two or fewer boys named Kieren or Glenn for the first time since our detailed annual rankings were first available in 1996.Kieren’s highest rank was in 1997 when it reached 169th position. The more popular spelling of this name, Kieran, has declined too, decreasing from 89th position in 2010 to 374th in 2019. Meanwhile, Glenn was once the 95th most popular boys’ name in 1964.The steepest fall from the top 100 boy\u0027s names in 1996 is the name MacAuley, which held 95th spot but has since fallen to rank 2,488, with eight births in 2019.For the first time this year there were no entries for the boy\u0027s name Neville, suggesting the name is facing extinction. There were also two or less baby girls named Debra, though there were four girls named Debbie.Other names thought to be extinct have clawed their way back this year - notably Nigel. Not a single baby had the name on their birth certificate in 2016, but last year nine new Nigels came into the world.  The statistics are derived  from the names as they appear on the birth certificate of the child and, as such, don\u0027t factor in differing or similar pronunciations. Grouping names with similar pronunciation would change the rankings.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"europe last waking lockdown folly","story":"Did you hear it? Beyond the second wave sirens and the schools debate, the sound of the penny dropping on the global stage. In recent days, world leaders have hinted at an extraordinary admission: lockdowns are a disaster, and we can’t afford to repeat the mistake.Still, when that spiritless reverend of the global order Angela Merkel delivered this confession a few days ago, she was so officiously ambiguous that the world paid no attention. “Politically, we want to avoid closing borders again at any cost, but that assumes that we act in coordination,” she droned at a summit in the Mediterranean. And with that, an earthquake: saving lives “at any cost” has been excised from the lexicon of liberal internationalism. Instead the aim is to save the economy. This means “acting in coordination” to kill off second lockdowns.Emmanuel Macron was the first leader to drop this little bombshell. Last week he said that France can’t cope with the “collateral damage” of a second lockdown, explaining that “zero risk never exists in any society”. Italy joined in three days later, with the health minister hinting that the country will not return to national hibernation. Meanwhile, after lauding China’s draconian lockdown, the World Health Organisation (WHO) is imploring countries to avoid battening down the hatches again.About time. Lockdowns are officially indefensible. Sweden has won the international experiment, as its firms outperform even the German Großunternehmen while Covid deaths plummet in line with the rest of Europe. Scientists caution that it may take years to develop a vaccine. Economists warn that even the richest economies in the world cannot afford national lockdowns costing up to 3 per cent of GDP per month.Perhaps even doom-mongering politicians have twigged that civilisation threatens to evaporate into a mushroom cloud of psychoneurotic delirium. Polling reveals that Westerners on average believe 6 per cent of their national populations have died from Covid-19. The real figure is around 100 times lower.Or maybe global leaders have been terrified by their instinct to protect the status quo. After all, seasonal travel shutdowns are an existential threat to a borderless Europe. Italy’s collapse following another lockdown would bankrupt the Eurozone. The banal rituals of cosmopolitanism are under threat – from the professional class’s daily pilgrimage into the cities to Starbucks lattes in reusable cups.The trouble is, if Britain is any guide, leaders will struggle to persuade the masses to keep calm and carry on. Risk-averse statesmen aren’t ideal poster children for the message that we must all learn to live with more risk.More importantly, no leader dare tackle the toxic relationship between mass panic and “the science”. Take the problem of dodgy Covid statistics. The bizarre failure of politicians to explain to people the basic fact that “rising” cases could partly reflect an increase in testing is a scandal. So is their inability to point out that, far from being cause for alarm, mild upticks may be an encouraging sign that testing and tracing is working, as the system becomes more effective at picking up localised spikes.Nor do governments have a handle on the spurious second wave modelling that could yet drive us into another lockdown. It is, however, a myth that politicians are helpless against the judgment of career scientists. In Britain and beyond, politicians have never followed the modelling modelling has always followed the politicians.As the pandemic hit, officials across the world requested forecasts for long-term worst-case scenarios, even though it is widely held in expert circles that statistical models are only accurate for roughly two-week stretches. Worse, part of the reason the science has come up with ridiculous solutions is that politicians have asked ridiculous questions.As government adviser Prof Mark Woolhouse recently told a parliamentary committee:“We are not aiming the models at the right target we are aiming them at everyone when in fact the burden of this disease is very concentrated.” Perhaps the number crunchers would do better to model social distancing measures directed at the vulnerable rather than population-wide lockdowns.Sadly, world leaders are less interested in taking the science debate forward than in covering their backs. Their expediency will only fuel paranoia. After an intriguing U-turn from the WHO, face masks are being rolled out as a mass market placebo from Britain to Spain. The notion that they reassure more people than they alarm – let alone the evidence that they work – is risible. Still, they usefully distract from the incompetence of Western states when it comes to the routine mass testing that could genuinely quiet hysteria and avert new lockdowns.And so the Covid saga rumbles on.

If the Republicans lose the White House and control of the US Senate, as some polls suggest they will, a reckoning over the party\u0027s future seems inevitable. On the other hand, an election victory could cement the Republican Party\u0027s position as the party of Trump for years to come.But in the event of a resounding Trump victory, the president\u0027s natural successor may not be his deputy Mr Pence - but his eldest son, Donald Trump Jnr, who also addressed the convention this week.An articulate speaker, Donald Jnr has publicly hinted at his interest in a future run for office, and shares his father\u0027s talent for connecting with the party\u0027s voter base.The younger Mr Trump has previously been called Trumpier than Trump on account of his bellicose rhetoric and willingness to delve into controversies when it comes to his discussions of racial tensions and other sensitive topics.One thing is clear: win or lose, President Trump could play a decisive role in who succeeds him.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/07/22/10/britney-jamie-lynn.jpg","title":"britney spears jamie lynn trustee conservatorship father free","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Younger Spears sister\u0026nbspis now attempting to gain more control over ‘Toxic’ singer’s assetsJamie Lynn Spears was made a trustee of Britney Spears’s estate two years ago, according to newly seen court documents.According to court documents obtained by the LA Times, the younger Spears sisters is now attempting to gain more control over Spears’s assets amid an ongoing battle over the “Toxic” singer’s conservatorship.In a court filing made last week, Jamie Lynn Spears, who starred in Nickelodeon series Zoey 101 as a teenager, requested that all the assets from the singer’s trust be relocated into new accounts with Fidelity Brokerage Services, of which she is a custodian.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIf approved, this would move Spears’s financial assets from the trust, which was established in 2004, and into those accounts, with a judge’s approval being needed to remove them.Under the amendment, Jamie Lynn Spears, 29, would be able to administer Spears’s assets to her children upon her death. Jamie Lynn Spears signed the documents last week.According to the LA Times, the filing does not seem to be directly related to the battle over her conservatorship.Last week, it was determined that Spears’s father Jamie would retain control of her personal life, career and estate until at least February 2021, despite the singer having requested that he be removed as her conservator.Jamie Lynn Spears has recently spoken out in defence of her sister, telling a follower who asked why she didn’t speak about “her sister’s obvious mental illness”: “You have no right to assume anything about my sister, and I have NO right to speak about HER health and personal matters.”“She is a strong, badass, and unstoppable woman, and that’s the only thing that is OBVIOUS.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Citriodiol is already known to kill other types of coronavirus.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe DTSL was asked by the surgeon general and former NHS chief executive Peter Homa to examine whether the insect spray would work against the virus.The scientists applied the chemical directly to the virus as a liquid drop and separately as a spray on synthetic latex skin.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyAccording to a report published on Wednesday, in both experiments the insect spray was able to kill the SARS-CoV-2 virus.The study found that at a higher concentration (90 per cent), Mosi-guard Natural destroyed the virus completely.While viral studies on latex indicated that the spray had anti-viral activity, the report said the latex skin was impregnated with Mosi-guard, and while latex was a representative surface, it was unlikely to behave exactly as treated human skin.The scientists wrote: We have no data relating the concentration applied experimentally to the latex to that resulting from a spray and rub application of Mosi-guard on human skin.When used as a spray it was less effective and while it still killed the virus and reduced its survival time, some virus survived.The spray is unlikely to offer sufficient protection against Covid-19 droplets but could be used as an additional measure alongside face masks, gloves and other protective clothing.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I’m no longer a kid, that’s my job.”In a further tweet, he also suggested that he is due a midlife crisis, and pondered whether he should take up surfing.Bette Midler responds to backlash after tweets mocking Melania TrumpDaniel Ings: ‘I don’t want to be part of the posh club’Culkin’s fans were quick to express their horror at the former child star hitting 40, with one joking that he ought to star in “Nursing Home Alone”, and another being forced to come to terms with their own age.“You’re 40?!?!? Jesus, then what does that make me???!!!” a fan tweeted in response.Thor actor Kat Dennings joked: “Please post your skincare routine.”This Is Spinal Tap star Michael McKean also took the opportunity to riff on Culkin’s tweet, replying: “Have a happy one, gramps.” Culkin became one of the most recognisable child actors of all time courtesy of his early-1990s wave of hits. Home Alone 2, released in 1992, earned him a $4.5m (£3.4m) salary at the age of 12.Following years of semi-retirement from acting, in which he fronted the comedy rock band The Pizza Underground, Culkin revealed earlier this year that he had started auditioning for parts in film and television again.While he claimed that his audition for Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood was a “disaster”, he will soon appear in the 10th season of American Horror Story.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The use of time travel in Tenet explainedChristopher Nolan films ranked, from worst to bestOn the surface, the film’s structure brings to mind the filmmaker’s earlier films – namely Memento (2000) and The Prestige (2006). The former, just like Tenet, played around with time, moving backwards from its starting point.Meanwhile, The Prestige plays around with the fact that there are two of the same character walking around in the same timeline, a fact that is originally unbeknownst to the viewer. Tenet also deploys this clever tactic.The other references are more plain to see. Firstly, the film’s opening line could itself be a reference to 2010 blockbuster Inception, which many originally believed could be related to Tenet in some way.What is the opening line? “Wake up the Americans.”This would no doubt have excited supporters of the the above theory it suggested that the the devices Leonardo DiCaprio’s team uses to “incept” people’s dreams – while they sleep – could be the same used by characters in Tenet.Considering there are no direct links between the two presented in the film, it seems to be nothing but a nod to his decade-old head-spinner. Then there is The Dark Knight (2008), a film that saw Heath Ledger win a posthumous Oscar for his performance as the villainous Joker.The primary antagonist in Tenet is Kenneth Branagh’s Russian oligarch, Andrei Sator. We know he’s bad from the get-go, but we first see his evilness in action in a scene that sees him attack his wife, Kat (Elizabeth Debicki). This scene sees him bellow the words: “Look at me.”This might make you recall the Dark Knight scene in which the Joker holds a member of Gotham’s police force hostage, and a video tape of his torture is broadcast on the news. These are the exact words the Joker bellows at the poor soul.The scene in Tenet in which The Protagonist (John David Washington) and Neil (Robert Pattinson) form part of a convoy in Tallinn to transport Sator’s plutonium also has similarities to The Dark Knight.Using a fire engine, Washington and Pattinson’s characters eventually ambush the convoy to steal it.Could this be a callback to the Batman sequel scene in which Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is being transported by a convoy comprised of Gotham’s police force after being taken into protective custody?As you’ll remember, it’s the Joker and his goons that hijack that particular convoy, a sequence which is spearheaded by... a burning fire engine.It’s unknown whether Nolan intended these to be references, but their memory certainly looms large when watching the film thanks to these particular moments.Tenet is in cinemas in select countries around the world nowThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them. Aren’t they beautiful?Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Announcing his departure on Wednesday, the DFE made clear the decision to force him out had been made personally by Mr Johnson, who demanded “fresh official leadership” in the department.Former civil service chief Lord (Bob) Kerslake told Radio 4’s The World Tonight that his dismissal was “a complete disgrace”, adding: “I know Jonathan Slater and he’s a very capable, experienced, conscientious senior civil servant.“I’m afraid what’s happened is they’ve decided that someone has got to take the rap here, and it’s going to be the civil servant“I think the issue is the quality of the ministers. We can’t get into a situation where the buck is passed every time something goes wrong.

A summary sacking of the permanent secretary at the instruction of the prime minister is a very unusual way for the government to be meddling in the civil service.”Ms Hayes said: “If there are problems within civil service departments, there is due process for that. What\u0027s concerning about this is a constant meddling and summary sackings taking place to distract from the responsibility that Boris Johnson and his government bear for their lack of political leadership on these issues.“The chaos that we\u0027ve seen around exam results has been a consequence of the political decisions that the government has made and it is really ministers who should be accountable for those decisions.“Gavin Williamson had two jobs - to get our schools back open for our children and to ensure that they received their grades fairly - and parents across the country have seen the chaos, the incompetence and indeed the distress which the government\u0027s handling of these issues has caused.“But this is a wider issue than simply about Gavin Williamson. We have a prime minister who promised a world-class education for every child, who said that the buck stops with him.“The reality is that he seems prepared to blame absolutely everybody but himself. Yesterday he was blaming an algorithm for the consequences of his own political decision-making.“So this is a much wider question than any one inidual and the buck stops with the prime minister.”Department for Education\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Usually there is at least a soloist,not a full choir leading the audience, but of course this year the public seats in the hall will be empty because of the virus, and the voices on stage silenced.Now, the lyrics of both songs are pro-colonial. If you ban them from the Last Night of the Proms, ending a tradition going back decades, what consequences will that have Certainly, someone  years from now will say we shouldn’t have done that.It is the same argument for not taking down statues. If you remove statues because that person stands for something evil in their past, you are removing the deed too.Manipulating history only adds to mistrust among the black community.I would like to see the survey that says the public want these two songs taken out of the Proms programme, because it appears to me that the public hasn’t been consulted.Rule, Britannia! was written by Scottish poet James Thomson and he features on the famous Scott Monument in Edinburgh, near where I live.He is also commemorated in Westminster Abbey’s Poets’ Corner, next to William Shakespeare.If we say we must remove his words from the Proms, do we then remove the memorials too Rule, Britannia!, written and set to music in , was mentioned in James Joyce’s novel, Ulysses. It is part of my history and my culture. If we take it away, we take away part of my culture.It’s a song about the power structure at the time, and the arrogance and hypocrisy of Britain vowing to “never be slaves” while at the same time owning and benefiting from about , black chattel slaves in the West Indies who were called ‘property’.Of course, people are sensitive to its meaning, as well as Land Of Hope And Glory, the music of which was written by Edward Elgar.It doesn’t mean we should hide it.I personally don’t find the lyrics offensive because they are a true representation of the terrible truth at the time.If you take that away, then you are replacing history with a fairy story.There is also the possibility that it was written to show the evil of the time, rather than glorying it.The objection is that Rule, Britannia! is used by flag-waving “prommers” as a jubilant finale at the Proms.It is used in the wrong context, and that is part of the ignorance of our society of our history.It’s the same with Amazing Grace, which was written by a slaver of black people and is sung as a religious anthem.Recently, it was proposed that we should ban Swing Low, Sweet Chariot at rugby matches due to its link to slavery. That came to nothing.Instead of banning such songs or stripping away their lyrics, we need to educate people on the history of slavery, starting with putting it on the history curriculum.From speaking to people about slavery, the one constant reaction is always: “Why didn’t anyone tell us this before ”At the Proms, instead of taking the words away, we should put an explanation in the programme. We should tell people it’s about enslaving black people, making money from them, giving them a short le span and then compensating the slave owners when it was abolished because slaves were regarded as ‘property’.If they want to sing it after reading that, then fine, go ahead and sing it. But I bet they won’t sing it as joyfully as they might have done before.When I worked in research, I once had a lovely technician who worked for me. She looked after me so well, and she went to the Proms.If she knew the history of those two songs, being my friend, I doubt she would have sung along.It wasn’t her fault that she didn’t know the history.Those songs didn’t have a place in the Proms in the first place, they are there because of people’s ignorance. I would challenge anyone to know their meanings and still sing them in a frivolous capacity.But we shouldn’t be bothering ourselves about whether those songs should now be removed.What we should be bothering ourselves about is increasing the representation of black people who are the descendants of slaves. We should be concerning ourselves about making sure black people from the Windrush generation get compensation. And we should also be ensuring ourselves that every child is taught the history of slavery so that they can make their own minds up about whether to sing songs like these.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

At last, after an unprecedented lockdown of six months, all schools are due to re-open, representing a giant leap back towards normality. But the damage caused by the Coronavirus disruption has been severe.Many parents have been prevented from ing to work. Young people’s education has been badly undermined, especially because the quality of online learning has been so uneven. One study found that a fth of pupils had less than an hour’s instruction a day. Moreover, social activities and friendships – which are a vital part of growing up – have been heavily restricted.The exam chaos over the last fortnight was a fitting symbol of the vacuum created by the absence of proper schooling. No advanced society canwhen a vital sector like education is temporarily paralysed. That is why it is so important that the Government succeeds in its goal of seeing a fullto the classroom. As Boris Johnson put it at the weekend, “it is vital for pupils’ education. It is vital for their welfare. It’s vital for their physical and, indeed, mental well-being.”Given the Government’s mixed record on its management of the Covid crisis, this will be a big test. From the inadequate supply of protective gear to the botched imposition of quarantine rules, Ministers have got it badly wrong at times. They cannot afford another fiasco next week.But to do that, they will have to curtail the influence of militant teaching unions, which thrive in a climate of scare-mongering and grievance. Full of negativity, these hardened left-wing operators turn every pebble of dficulty into a giant boulder of obstruction. They are the abominable no men and women, the ultimate “can’t do” brigade.To overcome the unions’ capacity for trouble-making, reassurances about safety will be absolutely crucial. Most teachers are keen to go back to work, but they want to know schools will not be dangerous environments. That is why the recent upbeat advice from medical experts has been so welcome. It is clear from the Covid experience around the world that not only are children less likely to transmit the disease than any other group, but also that schools are safer than most other workplaces. Yesterday, the Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jenny Harries pointed out that a child is more likely to be involved in a traffic accident or die from flu than to be harmed by Coronavirus.That message was also spelt out by her boss Chris Whitty, who said on Sunday that the damage to health caused by a continued schools lockdown is potentially greater than the impact of Covid. “The balance of risk is very strongly in favour of children going to school,” he declared, adding the chances of catching the disease “are incredibly small.” In fact, there is now hard evidence to prove this. Although the vast majority of schools were closed since March, over one million pupils – such as the children of essential workers – went back to the classroom in June. Yet a comprehensive study by Public Health England showed that in the subsequent weeks until the end of term, just  children and  staff tested positive for Covid- – and nearly all these infections occurred outside the school. There were hardly any cases of children passing on the disease to each other, or to their teachers. Other research from around the world has come to the same conclusion.But none of this seems to matter to the teaching unions, eager to exploit anxiety in pursuit of their anti-Tory agenda. These are the organisations which for decades have blocked every major reform of the education system and have defended every outdated working practice. With depressing inevitability, they have continually put their own narrow interests before the wider needs of pupils. They want the respect due to trained professionals but they frequently display the rebellious spirit of the permanent agitators. “Strike action is a very powerful tool,” said Amanda Martin, the President of the ,-strong National Education Unionin an interview with the Communist Morning Star newspaper in , adding, “I’ve run demos and rallies and worked with trade councils to bring everyone out and that’s brilliant.”Led by the NEU, the unions have brought the same attitude to the Coronavirus crisis. Instead of looking for solutions, they have endlessly exaggerated problems. One Whitehall insider says of Dr Mary Bousted, the £,-a-year joint general secretary of the NEU, “it’s all about the union, to hell with the teachers who want to get back into the classroom – let alone the children.” A left-wing radical, Bousted jokes that the word “strike” was one of the first she learnt as a child. Hers is not the voice of co-operation and enterprise, so it is hardly surprising that the Government has struggled to get schools reopened.In June, a planned majorwas thwarted by the unions, dealing a severe blow to Gavin Williamson’s credibility. One left-wing website gushed that the continued shutdown was due “to the hard work of NEU branch secretaries and rank and file militants galvanising the members.” In the months since, an alliance of unions – including Bousted’s NEU and Unite led by the notorious Merseyside militant Len McCluskey – have fought a y battle against a swt re-opening. Central to this effort at sabotage was a vast -point checklist of detailed questions which the Department for Education was told it had to answer. Dubbed by critics “a wreckers’ charter”, the list included queries such as “will lidded bins with double bagging be available in every classroom”, “will dedicated space be available for any breastfeeding women to express milk” and “has behaviour policy been reviewed to acknowledge the increased level of trauma and anxiety experienced by pupils ” Some Tories complained that the union was playing politics. Robert Halfon, the chairman of the Education Select Committee was amazed at the warped priorities: “It is incredible that not one of these nit-picking questions asks the most important thing of all – what’s best for the kids ”Even as September approaches, the whining and resistance has not ceased. “The unions need to stand firm and protect their members,” argues socialist teacher Martin Powell-Davies. In the latest ruse, the public sector outfit UNISON not only wants its members to wear masks in the classroom – something for which there is no scientic evidence of any need – but also to have extra funding for deep cleaning. “Schools need more money to pay for specially trained cleaners, rather than relying on other staff who are busy enough already,” says Jon Richards, UNISON’s head of education. The moan about over-stretched budgets is a favourite of the union movement but it is an empty accusation. The Government is pouring an extra £. billion into education, while this summer it was announced that teachers’ pay is to go up by an average of . per cent, a bigger increase than any other public sector workers received.But that did nothing to stop the combination of whingeing and shroud-waving. The mentality of the hardliners was embodied in a recent statement from the NEU’s far left “Education Solidarity Network” which set out a series of demands to “make sure safety comes first.” Among them were: “smaller class sizes to allow adequate physical distancing” arrangements “for rotas and home learning to be produced in consultation with parents” “local risk assessments to include staggered outdoor breaks, sanitising, provision of transparent coverings to enable access to lip reading and facial expression” and “weekly onsite testing of staff”. Above all, the Network called for extra funding “to implement these measures.” If there were any question of a risk to safety, the union should “prepare for a national strike ballot.”That was so typical. This lot seem to feel more comfortable on the picket line than in the classroom. The Solidary Network might be seen as extreme, but its carping outlook runs right through the unionYesterday, the NEU’s joint general secretary was bleating on the airwaves about the risks of new Covid spikes: “Staff, parents and pupils are being sorely let down by the government because of a lack of a Plan B and of ensuring robust track and trace is in place throughout the country. We believe the Government is negligent in the extreme.” The charge of negligence might be applied with more force to the NEU, whose hostile stance has made thesuch an exhausting obstacle course.

Pictured is, apparently, a pair of “size ” jeans from online giant Asosin front of my old size sI couldn’t get them up one leg and, quite frankly, Kate Moss would struggle too. So they’re going back.Then a beguiling ad for summer dresses popped up on my Instagram account and I clicked through to a site called “Cinderear” showing a wide range of very pretty frocks on tanned and shapely models.I ordered what was described as a “Printed Folding Holiday Swing Dress” in what looked like an airy cotton, cinched in at the waist with a brown leather belt. The colour was described as apricot.What arrived — several weeks later — was a beyond-hideous sartorial aberration that was “Made in China” , out of a paper-thin polyester that would make me think twice about standing near a naked flame.What’s more, the colour was more camel and blue than “apricot”, it swamped me, and the brown belt in the photo was nowhere to be seen.It cost me  — approx £ — and the s policy is so ­unintelligible that it’s not worth the bother. More fool me.Buying a bookshelf or bog brush online is fine, but clothes is another matter. I like to feel the fabric and see the fit.So a couple of weeks ago, I masked up and ventured out on a shopping trip to West London’s vast Westfield where I felt like a ­Hollywood superstar having a ­personal shopping experience. It was am on a Monday morning and virtually empty.Little wonder when the ­government guidance says retailers must “discourage customers from handling products while browsing, and keep fitting rooms closed”.One store let me try on a dress then sanitised the cubicle afterwards, another told me thatI tried something on they would have to then take it off display for  hours.In LK Bennett, the fitting rooms were closed and I askedI could try on a blouse over my clothes, just to seeit actually fits. No, they said, you have to buy the item, take it home to try it on, then bring it backit doesn’t fit. Needless to say, I ed home empty-handed.So,our High Street clothes shops are to survive the pandemic, two things need to happen.Unless classed as vulnerable, those of us who actually enjoy clothes ­shopping need to get back out there as soon as possible and actively support them. And the Government needs to relax its strict rules and let retailers and shoppers take inidual responsibility for what happens in store.If I have to wear a mask and gloves to try on a pair of jeans in a cubicle, then I’m happy to do so. I’ll even wipe it down afterwards with my newly repurposed “apricot” dress.SPORTED by the likes of Chris Waddle back in the day, the mullet is apparently enjoying a resurgence during the pandemic.Oh dear.

And part of my job is to also help people.If theres somebody hurt, Im running into harms way and thats why I have my rle, to protect myself obviously.Protesters were heard screaming early this morning in Kenosha, Wisconsin as the shots were fired.Shocking footage shows a man being chased by demonstrators after he had already allegedly shot someone in the stomach a few blocks away, TMZ reported.The man in the video can be seen falling as hes chased before firing his gun, fatally hitting two people.As police arrive, the gun-slinging man they suspect to be Rittenhouse puts his hands up in the air and the cops pass him.The lead up to the fatal shooting isnt clear but police think it may have resulted from a gas station cojnflict.Cops said self-styled militias were defending local businesses from looters but the sherf didnt confirm that the gunman was one of the armed citizens patrolling the streets.Koerri Elijah told Insider that the teenager, later identied as Rittenhouse by cops, appeared to be on edge before he ran past him and shots rang out.I noticed him the entire time. He didnt seem like he was there with anyone, Elijah said. He was armed. He didnt seem like he was a threat, but I thought maybe I should keep an eye on him.Hours before he was identied as a suspect, social media sleuths named the teen boy and posted his picture online.Last night, the first shots were fired just after midnight, as a group of protesters faced off police in riot trucks on Sheridan Road.People were then seen chasing the man before another round of rapid-fire shots were heard.People on the streets were seen dragging the injured to the side of the road before performing CPR.After being shot in the head, a protester was loaded into the back of an SUV and rushed to a nearby hospital.Shocking pictures emerged of people tending to a wounded person during the vicious clashes.Other residents attempting to protect local businesses as fires raged throughout the city.Devin Scott, , told the Chicago Tribune he was in a group chanting Black Lives Matter when the gunfire began and that he tried unsuccessfully to revive one of the victims.He told the Tribune: This guy with this huge gun runs by us in the middle of the street and people are yelling, He shot someone!

I was trying to keep this kid alive and he wasnt moving or nothing. He was just laying there.Carol Badoni, from Burlington, Wisonsin, spoke to the girlfriend of one of the victims, she said his name was Ben Wis.Carol, , said: “He definitely was not breathing,”“His eyes were rolled back in his head. There was no pulse.”But she added that she saw no blood, before cops arrived and took Ben to hospital.In another clip, a man was seen removing his top to help another victim of the shooting.Meanwhile, other protests erupted across the country in response to the shooting.Police in Portland, Oregon, also declared a gathering of hundreds of anti-racism protesters outside City Hall as a riot, ordering the crowd to disperse or face arrest.People at the Kenosha protest were heard shouting: Theres people getting shot everywhere.Kenosha has been riddled with violence, looting, criminal damage and fires in response to the death of Jacob Blake, a -year-old black man who was shot by police.Blake was shot several times in the back by police as he stepped into his car.His horried children were in the car at the time and would have seen the attack.On Tuesday, Blakes family confirmed that he is still alive but in a critical condition and is paralyzed.Jacob Blake Sr. said: They shot my son seven times. Seven times. Like he didnt matter. But my son matters. Hes a human being and he matters.While his family have pleaded for peaceful protests, they have hit out at police, saying they systematically brutalize black peoplePolice attempted to boarder off Kenosha after Monday nights protests led to buildings being set on fire and stores looted.Seven exit ramps were closed from Interstate- from the Illinois border to Racine, Wis. which is about  minutes north of Kenosha.In downtown Kenosha, a huge crowd of protesters gathered around the barrier at Kenosha County Courthouse.One protester, Nathan, , who didnt want to give his full name said: A lot of fear in the air because of threats to protesters.“I worry a lot about the misinformation,” he said after explaining he didnt think national movement to bring greater police accountability will lead to real change.Although, he said locally, his city will never be the same.“It’s hard to see now, but it will be a positive thing,” he said of the protests.“It’ll bring Kenosha back together. Kenosha has always been a resilient place. It’ll continue to happen.”Thousands joined the protest on Tuesday, with some carrying handguns, AR- rles, knives and dressed in military flak jackets.Dennis, , from Racine, was carrying a pistol he claimed was for protection for himself and other protesters.“Nothing is going to change,” he said, hanging back from the crowd. “This is all for nothing.”A group of the protesters began violently shaking the barriers and launched fireworks at the police officers.Cops were seen firing tear gas pellets and rubber bullets into the crowd.One officer was heard shouting: Yall better have gas masks on! Get ready!Before another cop was seen opening the hatch of the vehicle and throwing the canister in their direction.Another man was heard shouting: F**king p**sies!By pm  policwe officers dressed in riot gear formed a chain across the park nearby the court house.There were  fires associated with the unrest, with  businesses destroyed or damaged along with an unknown number of residences, Kenosha Fire Chief Charles Leipzig told the Kenosha News.On Tuesday, President Donald Trump urged Wisconsin officials to call in the National Guard to quell the unrest, despite troops already being on the ground.Governor should call in the National Guard in Wisconsin.

Ultimately we aim to make a vaccine that will not only protect from Sars-CoV-, but other related coronaviruses that may spill over from animals to humans.”  He added that manufacturing of the vaccine should be cheap and said that it does not need to be refrigerated.This means that the vaccine will also be accessible to people in hotter countries.Prof Heeney said it’s unlikely that the new vaccine will trigger a bad immune response.The first trials will take place at the National Institute for Health Research Southampton Clinical Research Facility at University Hospital Southampton.Director of the facility, Professor Saul Faust said: “It is critical that dferent vaccine technologies are tested as at this stage no one can be sure which type of vaccine will produce the best and most long-lived immune responses.”It comes just days after Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty said he would be surpriseda vaccine was available before .The daily increase in fatalities and cases across the UK has continued to slow this month however health authorities are on high alert for any spike in the deadly bug.Prof Whitty today said he would be delighteda vaccine came early.But the CMO said: I’d be quite surprisedwe had a highly effective vaccine ready for mass use in a large percentage of the population before the end of winter, certainly before this side of Christmas.”He added: I think it is unlikely we will have a vaccine that is highly effective and ready to deploy at scale this winter meaning  .I think there is a reasonable chance that we will have vaccines, not a certainty, in the period before the following winter of  .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But the policy proved controversial, leading to the worlds sixth highest per capita death rate - with care homes hit particularly badly.New research, reported by The Times, showed that levels of combined T-cell and antibody immunity could be more than  per cent. Dr Tegnell insists that this level of immunity makes it easier to control the outbreaks than when there is no immunity at all among the population.Scientists assumed, at the beginning of the pandemic, that around  per cent of people would need to be infected for the disease to fade away. But Henrique dos Santos Pereira, a scientist at the Federal University of Amazonas, said there was no “concrete explanation” for the mysterious drop in cases in Manaus.Brazil, meanwhile, has suffered one of the worst outbreaks in the world, with ,, cases and over , deaths. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I cannot remember any government being so devoid of direction, leadership, policy, conviction and — frankly — intelligence.And I had to endure Ted Heath AND John Major’s attempts to run the country. Oh, and the shaft of glorious sunshine that was Gordon Brown. Those guys have nothing on Boris. He is the clear leader in the field. If you ever wanted to know what a country would look likeit was led by Frank Spencer, here you go. Yes, I know — I’m showing my age. To be honest, under this administration I’m feeling my age.For those who don’t remember, Frank was a bumbling, dithering, halfwit from the s sitcom Some Mothers Do ’Ave ’Em. The only dference with Bojo is that Frank was thinner. And, mercully, a fictional creation. Boris is all too real. Many kids will be going back to school wearing face masks. For ages, this government insisted that they would not have to do so. Now they’ve changed their minds. Face masks and grouped in “bubbles”. Probably getting only about half of their usual education,that. Any kid who coughs will be pounced upon, exiled to the Outer Hebrides and the entire school shuts down. Never mind that there has been no recorded case of a schoolkid passing on the virus to a teacher.Never mind that our economy needs the schools fully open with a proper, normal, timetable, so people can get back to work.After six months of no lessons , the kids now have to endure insufferable conditions at school.This is because Boris and the rest have proved utterly incapable of standing up to the teaching unions .Other U-turns have involved the wearing of masks in shops, the usefulness of masks in general, whether there’s any point in closing our borders, the schools due to re-open in June, the scrapping of an expensive track and trace system, the re-grading of GCSEs and A levels . . . oh lordy, the list goes on and on.Sometimes the U-turn appears only a day after the original decision.Sometimes we have to wait a week or so. But come they surely do, a long parade of staggering ineptitude. In fact, I think even Frank Spencer would have been more decisive. Maybe the right comparison is with Benny from Crossroads. Yes, it’s my age again. For those who don’t know, Benny was a cast-iron moron.We know that dealing with this horrible pandemic can’t have been easy. We know Boris has had a dficult year.But the utter lack of planning and resolve has been astonishing. Slow to take the virus seriously, bizarrely refusing to close our airports at the peak of the outbreak, hopelessly lost over track and trace and what do with our poor kids.This has been mismanagement on an almost heroic level. My guess is that Boris will not survive as Prime Minister: His party will get shot of him when the opportunity arises. Because here’s the crucial, damaging question.Could Jeremy Corbyn have handled this crisis any worse I DON’T think those smug monkeys at the BBC realised the fury they would unleash when they banned singing our favourite anthems at The Last Night Of The Proms.A petition reached , names in just  hours.And Dame Vera Lynn is suddenly at No in the iTunes chart with Land Of Hope And Glory.The BBC apparently agreed with the Finnish conductor, Dalia Stasevska, that the “jingoistic” words of Land Of Hope And Glory and Rule Britannia would not be heard this year.I wonder what convinced Ms Stasevska to agree to conduct an evening of patriotic songs when she hates patriotic songs Money, you would guess. Meanwhile another BBC bureaucrat, Cat Lewis, likened singing the songs to Nazis singing about gas chambers.Silly woman. The BBC – its entire staff – has no understanding of the British people. It despises them. Support for the corporation is at an all-time low. And yet the BBC is still up to its tricks. Pulling off the unusual feat of being already in a coffin, but reaching out somehow to hammer more nails into its own lid.A TEAM of British scientists has been studying dreams and what they mean.And they’ve discovered they mean sod all. They are just a continuation of memories from the previous day.Other recent studies showed the same thing. So,you dream you’re flying around your house with some bats, it means you were probably thinking about bats when you were awake.It doesn’t mean you’re neurotic or sexually repressed. So – that’s all the work of Sigmund Freud in the bin. It can go in a black bin liner along with the idiocies put forward by that other drongo of the th Century, Karl Marx. But given that we know all this, why are there still psychoanalysts plying their trade  Is it just to give Britain’s couch-makers plenty of work ANOTHER stupid, virtue-signalling British firm has run into trouble.Avanti West Coast made a big fuss about its new “pride train”, which runs from London to Manchester.The engine is painted in the colours of the LGBT rainbow flag.And it has the word “Pride” written in big letters – just in case anyone doesn’t get the message. There have been thousands of angry comments on social media.My favourite was from John James McGivern: “As a gay man, I don’t want a ‘pride train’, I just want to get on a train that runs on time like everyone .” Quite. Well said.Every time companies pull a stunt like this, the nation cringes.I don’t want a bloody voucher. You cancel the train I’m booked on, then refund the ticket.So I complain to them and they say nothing we can do.So I complain some more and tell them they’re acting illegally.Bingo – money back! I know a lot of people have had similar problems with airlines cancelling their flights and offering “vouchers”.It pays to pester these buggers. Pester and pester until they give in.POOR old slabhead, then. Manchester United’s Harry Maguire found himself uttering the most stupid words in the English language.“Do you know who I am ” And then explained to the Greek police officers who had arrested him that he was “very rich”. Then he tried to bribe them.⚠️Click here for the latest news on Harry MaguireGod help us all.I have always admired Maguire’s heading ability.It now seems to me that he gets so much force behind each header because he has reinforced concrete between his ears. Footballers are not renowned for being terribly bright.But Maguire has lowered the bar still further.One of the problems is the one to which the footballer alluded. He has too much money. So much that he doesn’t know what to do with it.And as a result is completely insulated from the real world. And when he does venture out into the real world it is to be continually abused by halfwits who do not like the club he plays for.Say sorry to the Greeks, Harry. And then shut up and play football.Andlouts give you abuse in the street, just smile at them.CHILDREN from working families were much better behaved during lockdown, according to a study from three British universities.I know that will come as news to some of you.A lot of kids seemed to be climbing the walls out of sheer boredom.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has promised to get all of England’s pupils back to class full- time next week.The ex-schools supremos warned that No cannot fail in this test.Lord Baker,  — who was Education Secretary under Margaret Thatcher — said that the Covid education crisis could be as bad as the recession.He said: “This is the Prime Minister’s biggest challenge now, getting all children back to school.“You will find that some parents are anxious, and that some children won’t want to go back — but we have got to get them into the routine of schools.“Once you lose out on a stage of your schooling like this, you may end up losing out for ever.“It affects a child’s entire future. It is very, very important and it must happen.” Ms Greening, , who was Education Secretary under Theresa May, said the past six months have been “hugely damaging” for kids.She said: “Parents have done their level best home-schooling but we urgently need schools open safely so children can get back to full-time education. We also need a catch-up plan to help them recover lost ground.”Mr Hinds, , Education Secretary until July last year, said: “Kids desperately need to get back to school.“In the immediate term, mental and physical health are supported by the routine of going to school, interacting with friends and teachers and accessing purposeful activity.”Mr Laws, , Schools Minister during the Coalition, said: “Given the huge learning loss during lockdown, particularly for the poorest children, it’s vital we do everything we can to ensure a fullto school next week, provided this is supported by the health advice.”It is a crucial test for Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, who is clinging on to his job by a thread in the wake of humiliating U-turns on mask wearing in schools and A-level results.Fuming Tory MPs have urged No to sack himhe fails to get schools reopened on time.Perhaps an adult wearing a mask in a lab makes them safer but I believe children in a school will be less safe with masks. Do we really imagine a world where our teenagers turn up every day to school with a freshly washed mask which they will wear without issue throughout the day  They will swap their masks, ping them, lick them, spit in them and pass them around for fun. They will shout obscenities through them, bully each other over not having the right type, wear them wrong and they will encourage them to touch their faces dozens of times a day.And teachers need to be able to see the mouths of their charges to hold them to account for chatting, swearing and the like. Mask them up and teachers won’t have a clue who said it. Eventually you have chaos in the classroom. Hand-washing, social-distancing as much as one can and keeping children in bubbles is the way to go. Headteachers should not be swayed by how things appear and rather look seriously at how things really are.Schools in Wales are also reopening next week, while they have been open for a fortnight already in Scotland.All of the UK’s chief medical officers have declared that it is safe for children toto school.On a visit to a school in Leicestershire today, Mr Johnson said: “This is an absolutely invaluable time for them — they must get back into school.”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This shouldnapost be necessary to say, because we all had history lessons and we were awake for some of them. But Britannia has never ruled the waves.We had officially-approved pirates who stole gold from the Spanish and started the slave trade. We had glorious navies that had a habit of sinking, we dodged U-boats, we provided the first circumnavigation of the globe, and the first man to do it alone. But we also had a king who told the waves to go away, and collective amnesia about the point he was trying to make.King Cnut did not get his feet wet in the th century just so he could be a cipher for a swearword on Twitter , years later. He tried to rule the waves in order to prove that, despite being a warrior king with  North Sea countries beneath his heel, waves do their own thing. Britannia was around before him, was revived as a bit of Elizabethan militarist propaganda, and in  got nicked by a prince who wanted a song to impress his dad, George II. At the time, our ruling of the waves was centred on what became known as the War of Jenkinsapos Ear, about slave trading rights. We lost. The Prime Minister, who likes to give the impression he knows more history than anyone , must know that Rule Britannia is a silly song. He must, surely, realise that these islands did not pop up from an azure main, has noangels, and especially that not only has it got one of the smallest navies of all time, but is about to have a cavalry without any tanks.He probably does think, as verse  does, that foreign nations must, in their turn, to tyrants fall, that we are the envy of them all and our cities shall with commerce shine as verse  proclaims. But itaposs bollocks. Mainly because anything you tell George II in  to keep him happy is bound to be, but also because Boris Johnson has put this country on a course to - let me just check this official government document - ah yes, complete economic and social meltdown. That is no reason for the PM not to make a fuss about the BBC being too wet to let us sing a jaunty tune. Because otherwise we might notice that Dominic Cummings has given £m in uncontested government contracts to his mates, that a misogynist Aussie with no business experience has been put in charge of our Brexit trade deals, and that heaposs u-turned so often the PM is technically doing doughnuts in Downing Street. Of all the things that should be making anyone, of any political bent or age or race, steaming mad today, the fact that an empty Albert Hall will not be shaken to the rafters by , people who only know the chorus anyway is the very least of them.Get angry about Cummings gting a total of £m in contracts to colleagues and friends to find out what the public think of the government, when he could ask his neighbours for free.Fret, why donapost you, about how a shadowy group of Right-wing conspiracy theorists who claim to be protecting children marched on Buckingham Palace to shout paedophile! at Prince Andrew, despite the fact not a single Royal was in residence and the crimes he is accused of, while heinous, do not include paedophilia. Such stupidity is expected, by Brits, in other countries - itaposs pretty worrying to see it manest in The Mall.Or you could be infuriated by shame at the country being run by people who genuinely believe the Board of Trade should be graced by a man of without business experience, but who sent refugee children to sicken and starve on a Pacic island and whose reputation, such as it is, was savaged in the most devastating political speech Australia has ever witnessed.  Second thoughts, letaposs not. Merely boiling with fury does not seem to change much. If it did, Piers Morgan would be God.Letaposs ask ourselves, instead, whether to mask, or not to mask that is the question. Whether apostis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of these absolute cockwhistles, or to take arms against a sea of troublesome twits, and by opposing, end them.Letaposs remind ourselves that weaposre arguing about masks only because incompetents who have spent decades arguing about bendy bananas and how many children theyaposre responsible for are now in charge of keeping us safe, and are arguing about that, too. The question to ask is whether you put up with all this, or arm yourself with the knowledge and facts they would rather you didnapost have. Like the background to Rule Britannia, the lyrics you never knew, and wondering how it is that this country has forgotten it started, and ended, slavery fought just, and unjust, wars honoured, and destroyed, countless wrongaposuns. History will tell you that Britain is not all bad, and not all good. Richard the Lionheart was a magnicent warrior, and brutal Islamophobe and anti-Semite. Elizabeth I was feted as a great beauty, and ended her days a crone with blackened teeth. Queen Victoria was thick as mince, Bazalgetteaposs sewer and WT Steadaposs th century sensationalist journalism did more to improve public health than any -word slogans, and our last  Prime Ministers have been an ever-decreasing circle of ineptitude who have deprived this nation of everything it still had that was great. Common sense went out the window with austerity. Historical perspective, the ability to see the past and future and our place in it, was pissed up the wall in the Brexit referendum. And irony, Iaposm afraid, is sobbing quietly in a little ball under Nicola Sturgeonaposs Holyrood throne, from whence she is ruling the entire United Kingdom.

Digital infrastructure minister Matt Warman and local government minister Simon Clarke have written to councils to promote a new guide which can be handed out to worried constituents in an effort to dispel the misleading theories taking hold on social media. The information pamphlet, G Mobile Technology: A Guide, explains how G works and states that watchdog Ofcom found the wave emission readings taken from the masts are a small fraction of the amount permitted by the International Commission for Non-Ionising Radiation Protection . The guide, published on Thursday, says: Companies have been rolling out G in the UK since . However, some people have raised concerns that the introduction of G could affect peopleaposs health and have even linked it to the coronavirus pandemic. These claims are completely unfounded and should not be used as a basis to block or delay G rollout. Mr Warman and Mr Clarke, in their letter to local authorities, also called for more to be done to help find sites for masts and the installation of full fibre broadband. Telecoms companies need to secure rights to install their infrastructure on public sector land and buildings but there are concerns some deals are not progressing quickly enough. Boris Johnsonaposs Conservative Party manesto vowed to bring full fibre and gigabit-capable broadband to every home and business across the UK by . The Government is encouraging councils, which are obliged to get best value when agreeing land access agreements, to take into account non-monetary benefits such as enhanced connectivity. Mr Warman said: Councils have a vital role to play in the roll-out of digital infrastructure and while there is good work going on up and down the country, there is more we can do. Today Iaposm writing to local authorities with new guidance and advice to help them break down some of the barriers to roll-out and give them the tools they need to quell quack theories about G.

Ministers had insisted there would be no recommendation for children to wear face coverings in communal areas, and said the scientic evidence backed them up. But late last night, after the Scottish Government had issued obligatory guidance that pupils should wear face coverings when moving around schools from Monday, the Department for Education issued a change in advice. But what are the new rules  When and where will children have to wear masks - and will it apply to all schools  Hereaposs everything you need to know about the new changes. What measures are being introduced in England  From September , and in secondary schools in England that are within areas under local restrictions, face coverings should be worn when moving around corridors and communal spaces. This does not include classrooms and does not apply to primary-aged pupils. Why are face coverings not required in classrooms   Guidance from the Department for Educationsays that it will not usually be necessary in classrooms, as protective measures mean the risks are lower - such as grouping staff and students in bubbles. Face coverings can have a negative impact on learning and teaching and so their use in lessons should be avoided, it adds.So in which areas should face coverings be worn in secondary schools  Additional precautionary measures apply to places defined as areas of national Government intervention, as listed on the gov.uk website, according to the guidance. Local restrictions are currently in place in areas of Greater Manchester, Lancashire, and West Yorkshire, Leicester, Luton and Northampton. Can schools recommend face coveringsthey are where in England  Schools and colleges outside of local lockdown areas will have the discretion to require face coverings in communal areas where social distancing cannot be safely managed, the guidance says. It gives the example of a school or college which has a layout that makes it particularly dficult for people to stay apart. Are there any exemptions  Yes. Those who cannot put on, wear or remove a face covering because of a physical or mental illness or impairment, or disability, will be exempt. Guidance says that exemptions also apply to people who provide assistance to someone who relies on lip-reading, clear sound or facial expression to communicate. Could the measures be changed further  Education Secretary Gavin Williamson ruled out the requirements for face coverings in Englandaposs schools being extended further. When askedthe measures could be extended, he told the BBC: No, no, thereaposs no intention of extending it beyond that because as bothsaid andsaid is that actually that isnapost what is required. What has the Scottish Government announced on face coverings  Face coverings should be worn by staff and pupils when moving around secondary schools in Scotland from August , according to Holyroodaposs Education Secretary. John Swinney said that the rule will apply on school transport for primary school pupils aged five and above, and all those at secondary school in communal areas, but not in classrooms.

Michelle Tomlinson turned to the media after she and husband Ashley were separated when he flew to Yorkshire from Australia to be by his dying dadaposs bedside - and was told he could not fly back.It was only after reporters from Australiaaposs News had contacted the Australian Border Forcethat Ashley was given an exemption - but Michelle had already resigned from work and packed up their Perth home ready to leave for the UK to be reunited with her husband.Ashley flew to the UK to say goodbye to his dying dad Owen in March - just as Australia closed its borders to all but citizens and permanent residents. His dad died from cancer a week later. Nurse Michelle and prison officer Ashley have lived in Australia for almost eight years on a skilled visa, News reports. This meant he was barred from reentering the country, but Ashley was hopeful he would be allowed back home. Ashley booked a flight the day after the announcement but he was not allowed to fly. He put his first appeal for a travel exemption in as he sat at Manchester Airport waiting for his flight. In all, the couple has had seven applications to the ABF rejected. Michelle was set to fly out to Yorkshire yesterday, and said she felt they had been treated cruelly by the Australian government. She told news: I feel really let down. We have lived here coming up to eight years. We have paid our taxes. We have both been working full time. We have contributed to the Australian economy, and nobody seems to care. Itaposs almost like youaposre not permanent residents so you donapost matter. But after the Australian media site approached the ABF for comment, Michelle received a notication hours later from the Department of Home Affairs that Ashleyaposs travel exemption had been approved.  Michelle said the couple have been left in absolute turmoil...somewhere between angry and destroyed right now. The exemption seems to have come to late, and Michelle claims to have spent , shipping belongings to the UK and buying flights for herself, two dogs and three cats.

Mum Tina Trott, , was on holiday with her two sons,  and , in Palermo in what was meant to be a special trip because it was their first grown up getaway together. They were three days into their two-week, post-lockdown break when the manager allegedly told Tina, from Hull, the sink in her room had been damaged and she would have to pay for it. Tina claims she had to seek help from the local police force after the manager threatened to kick the family out of the hotel and throw your stuff out unless she gave him €on the spot and pay for repairs to a blocked sink, HullLive reports. The mum said she had been washing swimwear in the sink, but suspects the damage was caused by previous guests. She said: We went to the beach on the first day and on the second day we went to the catacombs. On the third day we went to a dferent beach. We washed our things in the sink each day. On the third day we came back and [the manager] stopped us at reception and said aposwhat room are you going to apos He said aposthereaposs been damages to the sink upstairsapos and weaposre going to have to pay for it. Even though she denied damaging the sink, Tina offered to pay the €, but told the manager she didnapost have enough money and she would transfer the amount when she ed to England. She said: I offered to pay the bill but couldn’t until I got back to England and he refused saying apos you don’t pay € I am going to throw your stuff outapos and had to leave today. I said aposIaposm not paying it and canapost pay it until I get backapos. I have spoke to some plumbers and theyaposve said that it must have been a backlog but that it couldnapost get that bad that quickly.  I showed him my purse and even my online banking to show there was nothing in it but he said we could go out and sleep under a bridge. He said that when we left the room he would throw our stuff out so I left my sons in there and I managed to get help from an Italian policewoman. She said the officer told her to call the policethe hotel kicked them out and someone would come and collect them. Tina added: I even said apos we go can I have a part of a refund so we can find somewhere apos but he said aposnoapos.  I did offer about  times to pay when I got back to England. I just thought you canapost do that. Especially in coronavirus times it is out of order. It was awful. It should not have happened. The family ended up staying in the hotel for the rest of their trip after the travel firm they booked with stepped in to mediate. Despite the incident, Tina said she wouldto Palermo, on the island of Sicily. Just not to that hotel, she added. About three million British nationals visit Italy every year, and most visits are trouble-free, according to the Foreign Office.

We know that some of these young people had no symptoms, and so carried on as normal, including a night out in Plymouth’s bars and restaurants, until they became aware of the risk.  That means more people could be infected. While young people might have fairly mild symptoms, and sometimes none that you would notice, our big concern is that we know it can be very serious for people who have existing health problems or are older. “We are in contact with all the pubs and bars across the city to remind them of their front line role in stopping the spread of this virus. They need to help us to protect the city. But it also needs everyone to help too. If you think you’ve been in contact with someone who has tested positive, you need to stay at home. If you get any symptoms, get tested as well as isolate. There’s no two ways round it.

Workers’ leaders representing . million staff warned they were being “fobbed off” by the Treasury, which left many health service employees out of a recent wage-hike announcement. Unison said that nearly a month after asking for more information about how the pay process will work, it was yet to get a response.Unisonaposs head of health Sara Gorton, who chairs the NHS staff trade unions, said: “NHS staff have done everything to keep us safe. “It’s time the Government showed its appreciation by giving all NHS workers a decent pay rise and proved they were serious about valuing the health service.  “Many committed health service workers are already feeling burnt out by the pressures of dealing with the pandemic, putting further pressure on a heavily understaffed service. “A signicant pay rise will do wonders for morale, improve recruitment and may stop people leaving the jobs they love because they don’t feel valued. “It’s not enough to sort this out at some point in the future – staff need certainty now. “As the next parliamentary term begins, the Prime Minister must put NHS pay at the top of his to-do list.” Health workers are currently in the final year of a three-year deal. They are due a pay rise next April but unions want the Government to bring it forward to this year. Ministers failed to commit to an early wage hike when increases for , workers where in the public sector were announced last month. Unison pointed to the “huge array of jobs” carried out by NHS staff beyond frontline care provided by doctors and nurses. It highlighted the vital roles of paramedics, healthcare assistants, porters, cleaners, kitchen staff, radiographers and operating department practitioners. Some % of people quizzed for a Unison Savanta ComRes poll last month said all NHS staff should get an early pay rise before the end of this year. More than  NHS workers have died in England alone after contracting coronavirus. Mr Johnson, who was struck down by coronavirus in April, is among those whose lives were saved by devoted workers.  Ms Gorton added: “As the Prime Minister will know, thousands of people who owe their lives to NHS staff who helped them through serious illness as a result of Covid-. “Health workers around the UK put their lives on hold for months. “The Government made a big deal of pay rises for many public sector jobs, selling it as payback for their efforts in keeping the country running during the pandemic. “But it’s failed to confirm health workers can expect an early and signicant wage rise. “Noises from the Chancellor about pay restraint have also caused alarm bells to ring. “It looks likely a y ‘pay review body’ process will start, taking months. “Instead the Government could easily make an immediate promise that the contribution of health staff will be recognised in their pay. “Confirming an early pay rise would help give the NHS the morale boost it needs to get through the tough winter ahead.” Daniella Pritchard, , a day surgery sister in Harlow, Essex, was preparing to move from her regular role to care for Covid- patients in a high dependency unit when the pandemic struck. However, she contracted the virus and was ill for five weeks.  Although Daniella avoided being admitted to hospital, she still bears the physical and mental scars of the disease. Despite suffering pain and breathlessness, she has ed to work. But the virus has left her too vulnerable to go back to her frontline role and she now helps staff who had been shielding toto work. She said: “Nurses don’t do the job because of the money, we do it because we’re passionate about looking after patients. “But many struggle on the pay.  “If there’s a chance to get a rise, people deserve it — not just because of the pandemic, because of the hard work all year round.” Keelie Barret, , a maternity support worker in Yorkshire and Humberside, juggled a full-time job, being a single mother and caring for shielding relatives during the pandemic. She said: “I’ve always loved working for the NHS and being a maternity support worker has always been challenging but rewarding. “Working during the pandemic was even more challenging – the pressure was immense.

Josh Chapman from Telford in Shropshire leapt into action when he found his mum laying unconscious on the floor of their home. Josh spotted the phone number  - the European emergency number with the same purpose as  - on the side of his toy ambulance, which connected him through to a police operator. Thanks to his speedy response, officers were able to quickly locate Josh and his younger brother, and called paramedics to the scene. Mum-of-two Caroline, , said Josh managed to call for help despite never using a phone before. According to Daily Record she had been sitting in the living room with Josh and her -month-old son Harry when she collapsed. Caroline said: I had just been playing cars with the boys and I suddenly blacked out. I woke up surrounded by paramedics - and a lot of toys - and they explained to me that Josh had called them and given them our address. I couldnapost quite believe it. He has never used a phone before. He had looked at the number on the side of his toy ambulance and dialled . I didnapost even know that number was on there but it worked and I am so proud of him. Usually I feel my levels dropping but this time I didnapost. He said he went to fetch some sweeties but there was none in the jar so he called an ambulance. He told them aposmummy was playing cars and now her eyes have closedapos. They stayed on the phone with him until they got here.  He loves his cars and the emergency vehicles are his favourites. So he went straight to his favourite toy for assistance. There were toy cars everywhere by the time police and paramedics got here and my youngest son had fallen asleep on me. It must have been quite a scene but the emergency services were great. Carolineaposs husband Neil, , an RAF photographer ed home to find emergency services surround their home. Caroline added: A neighbour had to rush out and tell him not to worry. He was amazed Josh knew what to do as well. Hero Josh told how his quick-thinking had been inspired by his favourite toy ambulance. He said: Mummy had been playing toys and then suddenly she stopped. Her eyes closed and then she was asleep on the floor. I thought I better call the doctor. I tried the sweetie jar but it was empty so I looked on my ambulance for the doctoraposs number. I called them and they came to our house to make mummy better. I stayed on the phone all the time and told them our address. Now mummy is ok. I like fire engines and police cars - but the ambulance is my favourite. Josh was later invited for a tour of his local police station where he was shown around by officers.

The house, belonging to -year-old Paul, had to be cleaned by specialists after piles of rubbish and mountains of collections reached the ceiling. His bathroom and kitchen had been completely unusable for years but Paul said he got around this by eating outside, going to cafes and going where to have a shower. Paul and his mother bought the three bedroom house in Crosby, Merseyside,  years ago, after his father died, for £,. On Channel  documentary Hoarders, which airs on Thursday night, he said: We had a nice modern kitchen, nice garden as well, it was a very attractive house.  But hoarding is often triggered by traumatic le events and the problems in Paulaposs home began after the said death of his mum, Liverpool Echo reports.He said: Four and a half years after my mother died, in , thataposs when I started collecting. I think in the back of my mind, I thought aposthat will look nice in the houseapos a bit like what my mother had. And then it began to overwhelm me over time and got too much. The books are the first thing that started to pile up and Iaposve got a couple thousands books now. During the programme, George Mensah of Merseyside House Clearance was called in to clear Paulaposs home.  Unable to even enter the property, George was forced to climb over the mounds of belongings that Paul had accumulated and even used a special camera to be able to see further into the home. During his survey, the master cleaner found rats that had become trapped in the house and then died, being left to rot and stfen amongst the rubbish. Some of the most commonly hoarded items, such as papers, books and clothing, were all found in the rooms of the house as George made his way through. This had filled up every room in Paulaposs house, including the hallway, but some other items that Paul had collected were slightly more unusual. Roman artefacts, weapons and armour were also discovered during the clear out. One bedroom was the only area of the house that George could properly access. Paul hoped that cleaners could sht his hoard for him and he would be able to sell the home, which lies on a quiet street in Sefton, to fund his retirement. During the clean up process, Paul found it dficult to let some of his items go and could be heard telling Georgeaposs colleagues not to throw books away and saying he wanted to keep a part of the Roman wall in York.  After some of the hoard was cleared, Paul was informed that due to the damage he had caused to his home by the hoarding, it would only be worth £, on the market. It took eight skips and nine days in total to clear Paulaposs house before potential buyers were able to come and view the property. Hoarding disorder is the mental health problem that has led people to leave their homes in filthy conditions, piled high with rubbish and has even led to a number of court cases over the years. The Royal College of Psychiatrists and the NHS have signicant information about hoarding disorder and what it can mean for people day-to-day but also explains that hoarding can lead to signicant problems, such as those above. Here are some of the most common questions about hoarding disorder, what it means, and how to stop it getting out of control. What is hoarding disorder  Hoarding disorder is where someone acquires an excessive number of items and stores them in a chaotic manner. This usually results in unmanageable amounts of clutter and in some cases hoarding in your home. Most common items that people hoard Some people with a hoarding disorder will hoard a range of items, while others may just hoard certain types of objects. Items that are often hoarded include newspapers and magazines, books, clothes, receipts and household supplies. Some people also hoard animals, which they may not be able to look after properly. More recently, hoarding of data has become more common. This is where someone stores huge amounts of electronic data and emails that theyaposre extremely reluctant to delete. Why do people hoard  The reasons why someone begins hoarding are not fully understood but it can often be a symptom of another condition. Mental health problems associated with hoarding include severe depression, psychotic disorders and obsessive compulsive disorder. In some cases, hoarding is a condition in itself and often associated with self-neglect. These people are more likely to live alone, be unmarried, have had a deprived childhood or have a family history of hoarding. How can hoarders be treated  Hoarding disorders are challenging to treat because many people who hoard frequently do not see it as a problem, or have little awareness of how itaposs affecting their le or the lives of others. Many do realise they have a problem but are reluctant to seek help because they feel extremely ashamed, humiliated or guilty about it. Itaposs really important to encourage a person who is hoarding to seek help, as their dficulties discarding objects can not only cause loneliness and mental health problems but also pose a health and safety risk. Hoarding makes it dficult for a person to move around their home, and it can also cause their work performance, personal hygiene and relationships to suffer as it takes over their le. So much clutter in a home can be dangerous and unhygienic. It can lead to rodent or insect infestations, be a fire risk and block exits in the event of an emergency, cause trips and falls, or even collapse on peoplekept in tall piles. To help a person with a suspected hoarding disorder, try to persuade them to go with you to see a GP, the NHS says. It adds: This may not be easy, as someone who hoards might not think they need help. Try to be sensitive about the issue and emphasise your concerns for their health and wellbeing. Reassure them that nobody is going to go into their home and throw everything out. Youaposre just going to have a chat with the doctor about their hoarding to see what can be done and what support is available to empower them to begin the process of decluttering. The main treatment is cognitive behavioural therapywith a therapist who will help the person to understand why they are unable to bin things and allow clutter to build up. Antidepressant medicines called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have also been shown to help some people with hoarding disorders, the NHS says."},{"url":null,"title":"lucky dad wins lottery after","story":"AdvertorialLucky dad wins Lottery after le-saving operation - and his reaction is brilliantThrilled Graham was overjoyed to scoop a share of £, playing Peoples Postcode LotteryShareByDave Masters:,  AUG AdvertorialThrilled Graham Forrester has gone from le-saving surgery to a le-changing fortune after winning a share of £, on People’s Postcode Lottery.

I love that when he just came in he said, ‘You know that I’m a feminist too, right Gloria ! It’s really important to me that you know that. She continued: I look at our son and what a beautul example that he gets to grow up with a father who is so comfortable owning that as part of his own self-identication. That there’s no shame in being someone who advocates for fundamental human rights for everyone, which of course includes women. She added thanks to Harry their son Archie will grow up knowing itaposs OK to be loving and nurturing. The location of the interview has not been revealed but thereaposs speculation it may have taken place at the back of Meghanaposs new multi million pound home - and at one point her beloved dogs wander into shot. The clip is part of a session recorded by feminist media  Makers, and is the latest in a series of videos the Duchess has released to encourage people to go to the polls ahead of the US presidential election in November.

But telling a few white lies to get a sale is not an accusation that can be levelled at one mum who has put her caravan on the market - and was probably a little too honest about its condition.Katie Perkins posted an advert on Facebook Marketplace to find a buyer for her aposancient -year-old caravanapos and the listing quickly went viral thanks to her hilarious and expletive-laden description.She explained her family of seven had called the caravan home for seven years while they were building their dream house aposwhich turned into a f***ing nightmareapos. It states: It is a tin shed on wheels. It is f***ing hot in the summer. It is f***ing freezing in the winter. It even grows icicles on the inside. It has a s*** oven. It has a s*** hob. It has a s*** fridge. Kids were potty trained in it. Dog was potty trained in it. It has been used as storage for the last  months. Next stop, the f***ing chickens are going in it. Katie says the caravan could do with a full set of new carpets and a good bleach clean throughout, but does come with a pretty decent microwave from Morrisons.  There are some positives, as the property comes with: Couple of old shoes in the wardrobe. Abstract art, one of a kind, courtesy of the children. Old bottles of booze under the sink. Pretty sure thereaposs even a slow cooker that was only used once  Beds that have been destroyed and I cannot be f***ed to remove. Katie finished it off by saying: I want offers... I donapost expect a lot but something would be nice.

The performance, belted out by singer John Park for the last  years, ends in rousing renditions of English favourite Jerusalem, Rule, Britannia!, Land of Hope and Glory and a spirited finale of God Save the Queen. The pm event on each day of the five-day Berkshire festival has become synonymous with Royal Ascot. Her Majesty attends each day with huge sums being placed on the colour of hat as more than , racegoers pack into the course over the festival.This year’s meeting was cancelled due to the coronavirus crisis with the Queen tuning in from isolation at Windsor Castle.Now festival organisers have confirmed they will potentially scrap the controversial songs from the bandstand setlist, in light of the furore over their inclusion in the upcoming Last Night of the Proms Festival in light of the Black Lives Matter Movement. Campaigners have argued the songs should be fazed out of their perceived association with colonialism and slavery after the BBC announced it would play an instrumental version at the Last Night Of The Proms next month.  There will be no live audience to sing along and wave flags at the September  concert because of coronavirus restrictions. One well placed racing insider said: “Much like the move to remove Rule Britannia! and Land of Hope and Glory from the Royal Albert Hall festival, there is a rising level of unease among the organisers who are certainly fearing a backlash because of those particular songs’ perceived association with colonialism and slavery. “Despite all the traditions of the past, the feeling at the moment is that it would be most unwelcome attention for the festival, the Queen and the rest of the royal family and a decision to remove the singalong is expected to be ratied.” A spokesperson for Royal Ascot said on Wednesday: “The pieces selected for the meeting are a mixture of traditional and more modern songs.  “As in previous years, these will be reviewed in the run up to Royal Ascot.” One option on the table is to ban Mr Park from singing the two songs but to allow the band to play the music. Our source said: “Most people don’t know the words anyway so it was muted that there would potentially be no singing, although they are particularly rousing numbers which does add to occasion.”Prime Minister Boris Johnson yesterdayagain waded into the controversial row, amid heated debate over the songs’ historical meanings. During a visit to Castle Rock School in Coalville, Leicestershire, he insisted it is politically acceptable to sing Rule Britannia! Meanwhile, Andrew Lloyd Webber has suggested his collaborator Sir Tim Rice could “fix the offending couplet” in Rule, Britannia! as the row over the Last Night Of The Proms rumbled on. New, orchestral versions of Rule, Britannia! and Land Of Hope And Glory will be performed on the final night of the Proms this year, but Lord Lloyd-Webber said the anthem will sound “ordinary at best” without lyrics. The outgoing director-general of the BBC, Lord Tony Hall, has said the decision to remove the lyrics was a “creative” one, but confirmed that the issue of dropping songs because of their association with Britain’s imperial history had been discussed.

While Storm Francis and its mph winds have moved on, large parts of the UK will still be subjected to unpleasant conditions for much of today and Friday morning. Thursday begins with a chilly start before heavy downpours move in from the west and hit Northern Ireland. As the morning continues the showery bursts will move into England Scotland, covering much of the UK. Its the south westaposs turn in the afternoon as the rains come down across Devon and Cornwall, the Bristol Channel and Plymouth. Met Office forecaster Claire Nasir said: Another spell of wet weather will be upon the UK as we head through Thursday. All courtesy of yet again another area of low pressure. Not as deep or as potent as Storm Francis, even so, it will track across the UK bringing with it that wet weather.We could see some heavy showery bursts through Northern Ireland towards northern England and southern Scotland through the morning, and northern parts of Wales. And then another batch of rain comes through more southern areas through the morning and into the afternoon. Some high rainfall totals possible on the south coast through the latter part of the day. Despite the mostly sodden conditions, London and the Midlands are forecast to see temperatures of C and C. But the wet weather will continue into the night, bringing thunder on Friday morning ahead of the bank holiday weekend. Ms Nasir continued: A wet night on Thursday, wind will start to pick up in north and west in the early hours of Friday. As it moves towards the North Sea it will introduce a northerly wind and that wind will be cool so temperatures will struggle on Friday with again some outbreaks of rain and even some thundery showers.

The Met Office aposs current forecast only goes to Wednesday, predicting C in London, C in Cardf and C in Belfast and Edinburgh. BBC Weatheraposs long-term forecast predicts highs of -C in the south and -C in the north on September  and , and As for the rest of this week, the Met Office said Thursday morning will be mostly dry and bright, but any rain will become more persistent through the afternoon with some heavy downpours. It will feel warm in any sunshine, and the highest temperature is likely to be C in the south. Further outbreaks of rain are expected on Friday, and Saturday is likely to be windy with spells of showers. Sunday and Monday will bring some sunny spells, but it will remain cool and the nights will be chilly. Met Office forecaster Bonnie Diamond said there is still some disruptive weather to get through on Thursday and Friday before things become settled but more chilly for the bank holiday weekend.  She added: The latter part of August has been dominated by Storm Ellen and Storm Francis, both of which had wind warnings which is unusual for August, but thenyou rewind to the beginning of the month, we had no wind at all. We had high temperatures, light winds and exceptional heat which lasted for about a week. It has been an interesting month, starting out with a hot summer and seeing its way out with more autumnal weather. By Friday night onwards, many places will struggle to get temperatures that are in the double digits, she added. In its long-term forecast for Monday  August to Wednesday  September, the Met Office said: A largely dry day for most on Monday with warm sunny spells at times.Generally light to moderate winds, but perhaps turning cloudier and breezier from the west later with possibly some outbreaks of rain reaching the far west in the evening.Looking further ahead into next week, overall conditions look to turn more unsettled with spells of rain and strong winds, most likely across southern areas.It should become drier and less windy throughout the period, though there is a risk of further outbreaks of rain arriving in the far west later on."},{"url":null,"title":"voice mirror parents crying out","story":"NewsopinionVoice of the Mirror: Parents crying out for clarity met with conflicting advicePrime Minister Boris Johnson did not take the time to meet parents of pupils during his visit to a school in Leicestershire yesterday amid concerns over conflicting coronavirus adviceShareCommentsByVoice of the Mirror:,  AUG NewsopinionBoris Johnson failed to speak to parents of pupils when he visited a school in Leicestershire \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

It is a shame the Prime Minister did not find the time to talk to the parents of the pupils during his visit. He then would have heard first-hand their frustration and dismay over the confused guidance on reopening schools next week. Parents, teachers and unions are crying out for clarity. Instead they have been given conflicting advice, not least on face masks. Earlier this week ministers were adamant there was no need for secondary school pupils in England to wear face coverings. Now they are being told they have to wear them in certain circumstances. This farce comes just days after the exam gradings fiasco. Little wonder that many parents have concluded the Government is making up policy as it goes along. The Prime Minister should spend less time posing for the cameras and more time addressing their concerns. MP class snub Two years ago a report found that bullying and sexual harassment was a signicant problem in Westminster. At the time we were promised a change in the culture at Parliament.  Key to that was MPs attending anti-sexual harassment training. But so far,  Conservative MPs have failed to take the course. This includes the Prime Minister and  other Cabinet ministers.

Shannon Davies, , was prompted to go under the kne in Istanbul, Turkey, after seeing online influencers recommend the clinic - which cannot be named for legal reasons. The salon owner initially forked out £, for a Brazilian Butt lt , breast uplt and augmentation in  but has since ed twice due to shocking results. Shannon, from Pontypridd, Wales, pleaded with the surgeon to remove the excess fat from her bottom but woke to find she had simply undergone another BBL. She is now forced to wear size  trousers as her aposlumpyapos and aposunevenapos bottom doesnapost fit into her old size  jeans. She said: Iaposve always been up and down with my weight and my boobs started to sag. I had no bum and I just wanted a nice curvy body to fill out my clothes. But now I am left with a lumpy bottom and super wide hips as the fat which was injected for the BBL has leaked into my thighs and hips. I regret ever going ahead with the surgery but I just wanted a quick fix.  It seemed like the easy option but I should have just gone to the gym. Shannon recalls feeling like she was in an aposovenapos when she woke from the first surgery in July . Her nipple was purple and she felt like her chest was going to burst open. She adds: I woke up from surgery and I was screaming in pain - it was unbearable. aposI knew something was wrong and I could tell by the look on the surgeons face when he saw my nipple. He removed my nipple and left it hanging on by one thread - I am not too sure how this was supposed to help but I was willing to do anything to avoid losing my nipple. Shannon visited her local nurse every two days to have the stitches and dressing changed for four months after the surgery. She said: I couldnapost wear a bra as it was so painful and my boobs completely dropped. I wasnapost happy at all with the results. A cone had formed on the right side of my leg so I asked the clinicI can have it revised - they eventually agreed after eight months. In March , Shannon flew to Turkey again for three days - she requested another uplt and for fat to be removed for her bum. She claims she was injected three times with general anaesthetic as the dose was initially not enough. She said: The second time was a living nightmare. I was injected in the lt on the way down to theatre but I didnapost fall asleep, nor the second time.  The surgeon told me to get onto the metal bed and then he strapped me down - I was so scared. I wasnapost weighed so they didnapost determine the appropriate dosage! I woke up and my bum was bigger than the first time - he didnapost remove the fat as discussed - he filled it again. Shannon says her botched surgery has left her with a bruised body and an uneven bottom. She flew home after three days and could barely look in the mirror as her new body left her aposhorriedapos. After complaining, the clinic blocked Shannon on social media so she was left to her own devices to try and find someone to revise it. Surgeons have refused in the UK as a BBL is illegal. She said: I was desperate to have everything removed. I just wanted my old body back. In October , Shannon flew back to Turkey for three days to have the implants and fat removed from her bum by the surgeon. However, she claims she awoke to discover no dference. She said: He took my money and all he did was stitch up my boobs again. I have been left with horrendous scarring and barely any confidence. I wanted surgery so I can feel good in my own skin but now I dread summer as I have to cover up. My nipples are too high up and my bottom half is too big.

I never even went into the attic at all. As he got up the ladders he said aposyour last tenants have left you a little present - go up and have a lookapos.

The Toroja community of Indonesia pull their dead relativesapos corpses from their tombs, clean and clothe them before spending time with them, chatting and lighting cigarettes for them. Itaposs an annual tradition and happens every August before planting season in the community in Panggala, Nort Toraja, South Sulawesi, but the photos never fail to astound. The annual Toraja death rituals - or Ma’nene ritual - are inspired by the communityaposs belief in an infinite link between le and death. This year, two men are pictured with the mummied corpse of a dead relative, who has had a baseball cap stuck on his head and a cigarette in his mouth, which the men are lighting. The tribe consider the ritual a celebration of le and an act which honours the spirits of their ancestors. They interact with the mummied corpses asthey were alive, and clean their graves and replace decorated coffins before putting them back. The whole act is seen as something of a second funeral and steps are taken to prevent the bodies from decomposing. They are usually reentered with gts in their colourful coffins. And in the modern era, tribespeople use their smartphones to take pictures with their dead relatives.  In one picture, community member Roni Pasang hugs the corpse of his dead cousin. Families often keep the mummied corpses of the recently deceased in their homes for months - sometimes years - as they mourn and prepare and save money for the burial, which they find hugely signicant. Sometimes they use a ‘Tongkonan’ - a building specically designed to house the dead before burial.  The Torajans often get into crippling debt from funerals, as they place so much importance on death as the most important aspect of le. The dead are interacted with asthey are alive, often being included in family meals. In one image, the corpse of a little girl is seen newly clothed in a purple dress, shoes, a hair band and even a wig while Lin Arensia poses with her.  In a later picture, Lin takes a selfie with grandfather Ne Potta. The dead relatives are laid in their tomb in the fresh clothes, and every year knives are used to cut them away so it can be replaced. One picture shows a pair of Adidas shoes being placed on a relativeaposs foot.  Another corpse is given a new hat, sunglasses, shorts and a watch. Sticks are used to hold them up and the corpses are cleaned with dry paint brushes. Conversely, the Toraja people are a largely Protestant Christian community, living in a country where the majority of the population are Muslim.  But the annual tradition remains entrenched in their culture down the centuries. For Torajans, the death of the body isn’t seen as an abrupt event and attempts are made to keep them part of the family. According to their ancient belief system, the spirit of a dead person mustto his village of origin.  Soa person died on a journey, the dead person would be walked back home from the scene to the village. Torajan Eric Crystal Rante Allo last year told The Sydney Morning Herald: Toraja people believe the spirit of the dead lives among us, the living, looking out for us, blessing us. That’s why, before the ritual of the burial is performed, they are called to’makula, or just sick, not yet dead. Toraja’s people highly respect their dead.  Now Bartolomeus, a rice farmer, said: It’s like when you come home for Christmas, it’s that feeling of joy meeting someone you haven’t seen for a long time. A lot of people would consider a graveyard a scary place.

Ksenia Puntus, , at first could not recall how she fell from his Moscow apartment - but then insisted there was nothing suspicious, reports said. Her ex-boyfriend Andrei Bakov, , has since begun a relationship with a more high-profile Russian model. Mr Bakov was reportedly ever-present at her hospital bedside following the fall. But according to local media he is now dating model and artist Zhenya Makarova, , better known as Jolie Alien. Russian showbiz guru Yulia Baburina said Mr Bakov had switched from Ms Puntus to the younger catwalk star. She is said to be still scarred by her ft fall which left her unable to walk for six weeks. In January, Ms Puntus was found by a street cleaner on the ground at am dressed in light clothes, “groaning” and writhing in agony in temperatures of minus C. She suffered head and chest injuries as well as broken ribs, legs and pelvis shortly before she was due to leave for Paris on a modelling assignment.  Another top Russian model Alesya Kafelnikova, , claimed on social media there had been foul play and a cover-up which Ms Puntus later angrily denied. The injured model - who has posed for Vogue and Tatler - claimed she had been browsing her iPad on a window ledge after drinking wine. She praised Mr Bakov - who was “sleeping” when she fell - as her “strongest support”.  The fall was “an absurd accident that will serve as a huge lesson for the rest of my le”, said Puntus, who has been pictured surfing as she recovers from the fall.

A photo of the cake was shared online and it was slammed as gross and trashy, The cake shows the bride in her wedding dress armed with a rle under her right arm, while dragging her husband, wearing camouflage, away. The cake was designed to look like a tree stump, with other decorations displaying large bullets, a deer, and leaves. A sign on the strange cake read: The Hunt Is Over.The picture, which was posted on Redditaposs Wedding Shaming forum, left users stunned.One comment read: A trashy idea, but well executed. Canapost say itaposs a graceful wedding cake though.. Another said: Came to say this. Well made cake but omg so tacky. At least the groom isn’t bloody , said another. Did she... shoot him  Thataposs not a good way to start a marriage another said. Others though explained what they thought the idea behind the unique wedding cake was. A commenter explained: The hunt means she was looking for a husband and finally found it. The bride aposbaggedapos herself a husband. Thataposs why aposThe hunt is overapos. The Hunt for her husband is over. I guess you could look at it as the bride murdered the groom, but itaposs really missing the whole point of it. Itaposs meant to be playful. I still would never use it as a wedding cake myself, but maybe the groom they are just really into hunting and who are we to judge that  Another said: I don’t think she murdered him I think she’s dragging him away from hunting to get married.

Linkage with regional long-distance routes will also be evaluated.Initially the project will focus on the northern coastal path corridor from Peterhead to the boundary with Moray.It is anticipated that funding applications resulting from this initial phase will support an ongoing work programme covering other sections of the path in subsequent project phases.Officers are seeking notes of interest from potential project leads by the deadline of pm on Sunday, August  via the Public Contracts Scotland website.Chair of the council’s Infrastructure Services Committee, Councillor Peter Argyle, said: #I am delighted to see the Coast Aberdeenshire Project commencing and I am confident it will help promote our paths network and generate increased user uptake in the fullness of time.#Through this project we will be able to spotlight our rich and erse culture and heritage within the path corridor to a wider audience which will be of great benefit to our communities and businesses.#Vice-chair Councillor John Cox added: #This is an innovative project which will see the creation of an exciting programme of events of cultural, natural and heritage interest to stimulate activity in the coastal corridor.#Identying gaps such as linking Moray Way through the rest of Banffshire Coast to Buchan would open up huge opportunities not only in economic terms such as tourism, but adding to this area already described as one of the best coastlines in the country.#In addition to these activities which will support and improve both the local and visitor experience in relation to cultural, natural and built heritage interest, the project will also present opportunities for our coastal businesses to be showcased to a wider audience.#Meanwhile, further information and guidance on how to apply for monies through the Coastal Communities Fund and the criteria of each programme can be obtained by visiting the BRASS or NESFLAG websites.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Our key priority throughout has been to improve upon the previously approved plans for the land.“We are aware that there has been concern over the removal of trees on the land, however as we seek to progress and improve the previously agreed development in partnership with the Estate, we have been very mindful of the unique surroundings of the location and remain committed to ensuring any development is sympathetic to the natural environment.“Our new proposals see a net improvement of . acres of trees versus the previously approved scheme. A further . acres of woodland is also proposed for planting, supplementing around  acres planted by Meldrum House over the years – something which was not part of the existing consents.“Our proposal also sees smaller, less intrusive pockets of homes than those previously approved, reflecting our desire to safeguard the character of the area.“We look forward to the Council’s decision in due course.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

This reflects the dedicated work of education, health and community services in giving young people more choice, support and advice.“I’m particularly pleased that the gap in teenage pregnancy rates between the most and least deprived areas is narrowing too.“We are continuing work to implement our ‘Pregnancy and Parenthood in Young People Strategy’, focusing on supporting young people who are vulnerable to pregnancy in key areas including education and attainment, training and employment and emphasising the importance of positive relationships to help them to achieve their potential as young people and as parents.“We have also continued to roll out the Family Nurse Partnership programme since , to offer direct support to young, first time mothers and their families from pregnancy until their child reaches two.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

There will be no crowd due to the pandemic and the opponents are Faroese minnows.He said: “It’s going to be a bit dferent this year with no fans allowed into the ground, but that’s out of our hands.“We can only play who is in front of us as well, so you just have to focus on the game and give a good account of yourself.”Watkins’ decision to reject a potential move to Aberdeen in favour of ing south of the border saw him win promotion to the Championship with Barnsley.He then earned a switch to Norwich City before completing a £m transfer to Bristol, where he is contracted until summer .Capped twice by Wales, playing in the Europa League is another box to be ticked in his career.He said: “Playing at this level is going to be good experience, you want to get as many of those as you can in your career.“When Aberdeen came in for me, having Europe and the semi-finals of the Scottish Cup was a great incentive.“This club is synonymous with Europe from the past. All round it was a good move for me.”Aberdeen were unable to have a presence at Runavik’s - preliminary round defeat of Barry Town United in the Faroe Islands last Thursday due to government advice.However, they have studied footage of their opponents in action.Watkins said: “We had a team meeting about Runavik on Wednesday morning. We watched clips of them, looking at their strengths and their weaknesses.“I think the biggest thing is we have to just focus on ourselves, concentrate on how we’re going to play and take it from there.“Hopefullywe are able to do that, we will win and get through to the next round. We are ready for the game coming around now and want to put on a show.“The aim is to get through this round and hopefully a few more then see where it takes us.”The Aberdeen board sanctioned the emergency loan signing of Watkins in response to a striker crisis in which McInnes had no senior centre-forwards for the - win at St Johnstone. Watkins’ loan was completed just  hours before a debut against Livingston.He sought some advice from Bristol team-mate Zak Vyner who was on loan at Aberdeen last season. Vyner’s loan was cut short in January due to injury.Watkins said: “Zak said he really enjoyed it, that it was a great club with great people and I am seeing that already.“I am really happy to be here.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"if walls could talk","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStrachur Smiddy opened its doors again on Saturday, August , after an uncertain few months due to Covid-.The museum will only be open on Saturdays and Sundays, until Sunday September , but for now families can again enjoy stepping back in time in the th-century blacksmith’s smiddy, which has been carefully repaired and restored to its original state and now acts as a working museum with with forge, bellows and anvil, cobbled floor, tools of the trade and beamed ceiling.Browse through the Smiddy’s collection of fascinating artefacts and tools.

So many people are intimidated by other vehicles.

The village#s fire engine was used to demonstrate to the youngsters how dficult they are to see from the cab of a large goods vehicle, particularly to the rear and near side at junctions.They also learned about primary and secondary road positions, right of way and good observational skills.They were even encouraged to ask their parentsthey do the #Dutch Reach# to keep passing cyclists safe. The Dutch Reach is a simple change of habit to help you open your car door safely. Instead of using the hand closest to the door, it means reaching across to open the door with the hand furthest from the door # your left handyou are the driver. This naturally turns your body towards the window, helping you spot approaching cyclists.Mr Catterwell added: #Thanks to Scottish Fire and Rescue Service for the use of the appliance and the drill yard, the Bike Bothy for administrative assistance and training materials and Graham Love for his excellent mechanical services. Also to residents and holiday makers around Craignish who were mostly respectful of the learner cyclists.#P S pupils Fergus Bennett, Beth Gregory, Magnus Hampton, Kay Neville, Harry Whittle and Reiley Van Der Zel received their Bikeability  badges.

The decision was taken to send me to the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, and Neil Newman and Billy McArthur drove very carefully on the ersion route to Paisley, avoiding the recently damagedRest and be Thankful route.I am grateful to all those who delivered care to such a high standard, ensuring that my recovery was so successful after excellent treatment at the RAH.Jeremy Houston, PoltallochSir,As I read Councillor Alastair Redman’s letter in the August  edition of the Advertiser I thought how sad it is that a young man should always have such a pessimistic and depressing outlook that he chooses to share regularly with your readers.While we live through a pandemic we have seen the very best in people in our communities working to support and care for each other.Only last week the council publicly thanked the thousands of volunteers for their amazing efforts during the past months.The volunteers throughout our communities worked tirelessly and optimistically, always offering encouragement and kindness helping those who were at home to stay positive during such an anxious time.Local businesses provided an excellent service and continue to do so, enabling people to shop locally without making long journeys.If Councillor Redman cannot see the confident and positive support in all of our communities perhaps he should book an eye test, and he most certainly doesn’t have to travel to Barnard Castle to visit an optician.Councillor Anne Horn, TarbertSir,I was delighted to see the piece in a recent issue of the Argyllshire Advertiser featuring a reader from Tayvallich, setting out his case for #Time for Change#. I share many of his concerns, and commend the series of articles.It would be good to hear from a range of Argyll and Bute residents with their ideas for how we get from #here# towards a better #there#. My personal pet project would be an Argyll and Bute Citizens’ Assembly, that would bring people together to generate real strategies to bring about just and #green# change for our area.A good start would be better transport links, via enhanced road and ferry services.A permanent solution to the Rest and be Thankful would be welcome, of course, but it was really heartening to see how Western Ferries rose to the challenge on Friday Auust .  They magicked away that endless queue at Gourock with great patience and goodwill and double service, showing what can be done.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,Following the latest landslide and road closure at the Rest and be Thankful, once again the road closure signs were placed at the wrong place on the Arrochar side.Having spoken to several of the local businesses owners, the main issue around the signs are they are too far away from the incident. There are information signs from Balloch to Tarbet advising of the closure at the Rest.Surely moving the signs to Ardgartan would make more sense. Should anyone have to turn then there is ample space to do this. We cannot continue to render two villages effectively closed in case someone has failed to read the signs or cannot turn.Transport Scotland and BEAR Scotland must guarantee that the signs will not be put back in the same place when further disruption occurs, and it will.Jane Ireland, Slanj restaurant, Tarbet"},{"url":null,"title":"news from the districts august 21 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMull of Kintyre music festivalhas taken its virtual  event to new heights by beaming a unique Scottish rendition of David Bowie’s #Space Oddity# to the International Space Station.The annual music festival teamed up with the Machrihanish Airbase Community Company , in the running to become the UK’s first spaceport, to record the unique set, featuring local band Slainte Davaar Allstar’s cover of Bowie’s iconic track.With the festival moved online this year the organisers came up with the idea of partnering with the local base and its unconventional location for the exclusive gig.The set was performed on the former top-secret RAF base runway # nearly two miles long and one of the longest in Europe – for current Commander of the ISS Chris Cassidy and Cosmonauts Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner, as they orbit the earth at ,mph.Event manager Iain Johnston of JIG Events said: #The Mull of Kintyre Music Festival has encouraged people to visit Kintyre from all parts of the globe since its inception  years ago and we were naturally disappointed, like every other event organiser up and down the country, to have to cancel this year.

Control system builders ITI will undertake the design, installation and commissioning of the upgrade across the station’s four units.The power station, constructed in a cavern within Ben Cruachan on the shores of Loch Awe, plays a critical role in stabilising the country’s electricity system throughout the Covid- pandemic due to its flexibility. The plant can generate power in less than a minute when needed and can also store excess electricity from the grid like a giant battery, a service which was called upon when the low electricity demand during the lockdown coincided with periods of high wind power in Scotland.The plant’s reversible turbines pump water from Loch Awe to an upper reservoir on the mountainside to store excess power from the grid.

and those around us.However, people wearing face coverings every day have been noticing that they have started to break out in acne, rashes and skin irritations.Have you had more breakouts since you started wearing a mask We have spoken to Dermalogica skin care expert and beautician Ashley Richards to find out why this happens and how you can protect your skin.What is ldquomaskne Maskne occurs when sweat, oil and bacteria are trapped on your skin while wearing a mask, creating the perfect breeding ground for breakouts.What causes it Maskne is caused by friction, rubbing, and occlusion of the skin by outside forces.Wearing a mask can trap dirt, oil, swear and humidity around the skin.Friction and irritation from the mask pushes bacteria into the skin, which creates micro-tears, and allows the bacteria and dirt to enter the skin more easily.This will lead to blackheads and whiteheads along the bridge of your nose, cheeks and chin. Masks can trigger ious types of skin irritationsand redness .How can you combat maskne There isnrsquot a prevention for maskne, as we need to continue wearing our masks, but there are ways that you can help combat the issues.Skin Care routineIf you want to combat the impact of maskne then having a good skincare routine is essential.It is just as important to cleanse your skin before wearing a mask as it is to cleanse after wearing a mask.To help your skin heal, Ashley would recommend using a squalane or balm cleanser so help remove make-up, dirt and debris.However,you are experiencing chapped, irritated skin or suffer from sensitivity then a gel based cleanseradvised.Dermalogicarsquos UltraCalming Cleanser helps to calm and cool sensitised irritated skin.ExfoliatingExfoliating is key to clear clogged pores and remove dead skin cells which will help reduce the impact of maskne.There are thousands of dferent types of exfoliators available from chemical, physical and masks but it is always important to follow the recommended application and how often you should use the product.Over-exfoliating your skin can compromise your skins barrier , damage the skins capillaries and dehydrate the skin.Ingredients such as glycolic acid, lactic acid and salicylic acid are great exfoliating athelping fight breakouts.Spot treatmentsUsing targeted spot treatments with ingredients such as salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide will help remove dead skin cells and decongest pores.Hyaluronic AcidsHyaluronic acid can hold , times its weight in water - so it is like a magnet for moisture.,params: .pushUsing hyaluronic acid regularly will leave the skin feeling super-soft, radiant and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.Hyaluronic acid has antibacterial properties meaning it will help soothe and protect chapped, irritated skin.FoundationsOpt for tinted moisturisers rather than a heavy foundation or go bare faced to help cause less clogging in your pores - but donrsquot forget your SPF!MoisturisersHeavier moisturisers will sit on the skin for longer due to the humidity of wearing the mask which can cause further clogging and irritation of the skin.However, donrsquot want to stop using a moisturiser all together as our skin still requires hydration and moisture.Instead try using a light and soothing moisturise such as Charlotte Tilburyrsquos Magic Cream light.Chapped SkinFor those suffering from chapped skin try using a physical barrier cream such as Dermalogicarsquos Barrier Repair.Barrier Repair shields against environmental pollution and helps forty sensitive skin with a damaged barrier."},{"url":null,"title":"health-secretary-credits-surfing-holiday-cornwall-tanned-complexion","story":"Health Secretary Matt Hancock has credited a weekrsquos staycation in Cornwall for his healthy summer glow.The Cabinet minister confirmed to LBC radio that his brown complexion was down to a week spent surfing in the South West of England.Asked ldquoWhere did you get that tan  during an interview on the station, Mr Hancock replied: ldquoCornwall.The former culture secretary added: ldquoYou canrsquot beat a holiday in Cornwall.

Itrsquos not so easy to access, but the fact the trees are now under threat made me want to discover the place before it might be too late. As I write, the decision has yet to be made on the fate of the trees.Irsquom a lover of history and totally understand the need to create a safe, weather-proof home for these historic planes, and to keep the museum as much an authentic visiting experience as possible. But there is a huge amount of space in the existing museum area, so the destruction of woodland seems unnecessary.The museum argues that any additional modern structures near the runway will undermine the historic look of the airfield. The proposed new visitor centre will, they say, create much-needed new jobs. So cutting down the trees to move the planes and create a new home for them is, the museum authorities argue, the only realistic option for them. They say that refusal of their plans will put the new jobs at risk.I totally understand the need for jobs at this time in particular, but the trouble is the approach taken by the museum is part of the reason the world is facing an ecological crisis with deforestation, the destruction of habitats and the extinction of wildle. It is part of the mindset that sees nature as ldquoin the way of development.Donrsquot be ridiculously dramatic, I hear some folks say this is not the Amazon or a rainforest in Indonesia, itrsquos a small wood in East Lothian.And that is precisely the point. It is a small but very rare example of a wood with mature trees in our county. It is a special place, with a ersity of trees and buzzing with wildle. Walk under its canopy and you will discover that. I know itrsquos proposed to plant new trees in a dferent area as compensation, but this wonrsquot connect to the wood and will take generations to grow. It will never replace what will be lost.If we seriously want to do something about the ecological disaster we are making on our planet then we need to start in our own backyard. We canrsquot campaign against deforestation, habitat destruction and declare a climate emergency, and then say: ldquoWell, the rules donrsquot apply to us when we want to destroy woodland to move some planes.Deforestation has a multitude of justications all over the world: dam building, road construction, cattle ranching, extreme poverty of subsistence farmers, profit from timber, oil exploration and pipelines, mining: the list is long. The point is there will always be someone with an economic justication for environmental destruction.While it may be on a much smaller scale, the proposal to destroy irreplaceable woodland in order to move some planes is a product of the same mindset that has brought us to a point of environmental and climate crisis.This mindset is revealed in the Historic Environment Scotland response to the proposal. This is the public body charged with protecting Scotlandrsquos built heritage. It has said: ldquoWe would not consider the trees of Sunnyside Strip to be directly related to the cultural signicance of the scheduled monument ndash they are visible but do not relate to our understanding of the monument as a wartime airfield.In other words, woodland isnrsquot part of our heritage mature trees, many of which were around before the war, arenrsquot historic or worthy of value in themselves. Really The wood is far more a historic part of the wartime airfield site than the massive car park. It seems to be a very selective viewpoint.The truth is that the UK is one of the most nature-depleted countries on the planet. A quarter of our already-decimated wild mammals are in danger of extinction. Our woodlands are small and dispersed, but all the more vital for the habitat they provide. East Lothian has huge developmental pressure, and this wood is a rare and vital part of naturersquos increasingly precarious foothold in our county.A changed mindset would be one which makes the protection of nature and the environment the initial default position. Developers should then take this priority as the starting point for proposals.That hasnrsquot happened with this plan, and credit to the council for rejecting it.There has been so much publicity and justied outrage recently over the destruction and littering of our land by people lsquowildrsquo camping and disrespecting nature. So many people, it seems, just donrsquot care, or seem unable to appreciate the gt of our natural environment and its importance.There is a disconnect from nature at the heart of this. We will never solve the environmental and climate crisis we are in until we can foster love and appreciation of nature, of which we are a part. Our childrenrsquos future literally depends on this.And institutions such as National Museums Scotland should be part of the solution, not the problem. Instead of viewing the woodland as irrelevant to the visitor experience, it could be used to enhance it. The wood is a magic place, with younger trees growing amidst towering old mature ones.My kids were in wonder as they explored the wood, peering up at the tops of the trees, and an old oak caught their attention as its boughs seemed to dip asto say hello. We spent a wonderful hour being immersed in nature.Many of our children, in fact many adults, have limited opportunities to explore and enjoy such places. Imagine the extra possibility of a nature walk in the tall wood, where wildle thrives and trees older than the airfield can tell their story. This wood is not an intrusion for the visitor but a potential wonderful addition. Get the ranger service to do talks and tours about this amazing place, a treasure hunt use it to enhance peoplersquos connection to nature ndash an extra experience.Woodland is not just a habitat for wildle, itrsquos a habitat for us humans too. Enjoying nature and learning about its importance should not be seen as a contradiction to enjoying historic planes.While Irsquom aware that itrsquos only part of the wood under threat, the proposal to destroy a large section of it will result in a tragic loss of trees and the habitat they provide.

This is how I heard about an otter at the Esk for the first time three years ago.A few people mentioned they had seen this elusive creature a few years ago, but never since.The otter became my new photography challenge. I tried visiting the river at dferent times of the day, especially at dawn and dusk, when otters are more active, always trying to keep the noise down to a minimum.After two years of searching, my hope was gone and I almost gave up. Until one sunny day in April during lockdownhellipThe weather that day was enjoyable, so Chris and I decided to go on a walk. The local path was very busy the dog walkers, cyclists, families with children and joggers were enjoying the sun whilst social distancing.As always, I kept my eyes low on the water hoping to see the kingfisher.As we followed the river upstream to the area at The Grove, I spotted something moving in the water.I grabbed Chrisrsquo hand and I pulled him down on the ground right behind a bush.It was not a kingfisher but something I did not expect to see in the middle of the day... an otter fishing!We managed to crawl down the slope and lie down so we would not disturbit.Whilst I was photographing the otter, I also heard a cheery pee-pee-pee and saw the kingfisher flying past the otter. What a day!Since then I have seen the otter a couple more times.The Eurasian otter is a secretive, semi-aquatic species with chocolate brown fur, webbed feet, and a powerful tail. Their thick coats are built of two layers of fur: an inner layer that works as insulation, and the outer, waterproof layer. The two-layered system prevents their skin from direct contact with water and subsequent temperature loss.Their nostrils and ears stay closed as otters swim underwater.Despite being excellent swimmers, they cannot hold their breath underwater for long periods the average time underwater is about  seconds as they e.Otters are solitary, territorial animals, that live in underground holes called lsquoholtsrsquo. The size of their territory ies and depends on the quality of the habitat, amount of food and number of possible holts.It is also known that a male otter has a larger territory that can even overlap several female ottersrsquo territories. Otters usually have a well-defined area within their grounds in which they feed, rest and breed.Seeing signs of otters is generally easier than seeing the animals themselves. If you happen to find yourself at the riverbank or a sea loch, look for five-toed footprints and otter droppings , that are left in places such as fallen trees, rocks and weirs.Spraints are easily identiable as they contain visible fish bones and have a characteristic and not particularly unpleasant smell that has been described as ranging from fish to freshly brewed jasmine tea!The otter that you may see at the coast is very often called a lsquosea otterrsquo however, this is the same species as the animals that live further inland.If you would like to share how you get on finding the otters oryou have any rare kind of wildle in your area, I would love to hear from you.Speak to you next month!zanslensfacebook zanslens instagram zans_lens twitter zans_lens"},{"url":null,"title":"tantallon-castle-john-muir-birthplace-among-attractions-reopening","story":"Historic Environment Scotlandhas confirmed that Tantallon Castle, east of North Berwick, will accept visitors with pre-booked tickets from next Friday .A phased reopening of some HES sites across the county has begun, but there is no date yet for when Dirleton Castle could reopen.Both of these county attractions closed in March when lockdown was initiated to combat the coronavirus pandemic.A statement from HES said: ldquoAfter what has felt like historyrsquos longest wait, the easing of certain lockdown restrictions means you and your family can now grab a well-earned change of scenery at a selection of our safe and secure sites.ldquoItrsquos a pleasure to welcome you back and we would like to thank you for your patience and perseverance in staying home during this pandemic.ldquoWhen you arrive at any of our reopening sites, wersquoll need to work together to make sure we are all following the rules and staying protected.Entry tickets for Tantallon Castle can now be pre-booked via the website historicenviron ment.scotWalk-up visitors without an advanced booking will not be able to gain entry.Meanwhile, in another boost for the countyrsquos residents and visitors, the museum telling the story of Dunbarrsquos most famous son has reopened its doors.The John Muir Birthplace Museum welcomed back visitors on Tuesday for the first time since the coronavirus outbreak started.The museum, on the townrsquos High Street, allows visitors to explore the le and legacy of the man recognised as the father of the US national park system, in the house where he was born.Meanwhile, further attractions are also available for visitors to see at the National Museum of Flight, East Fortune.Hangar had already been open, along with the historic airfield and the parachute store.Now, the military aviation and civil aviation hangars have also opened to the public.Lucy Casot, CEO of Museums Galleries Scotland, said: ldquoWith so many of our museums and galleries across Scotland now able to open, therersquos so much to choose from, many with wonderful outdoor spaces to enjoy with the whole family.ldquoItrsquos not just a fun day out museums and galleries have a positive impact on our social wellbeing as well as the local economy, so we are urging everyone to make a point of visiting their favourite museum or gallery.ldquoAdditionally, with many of us staycationing this year, it is a wonderful opportunity to discover more of Scotlandrsquos inspiring museums and galleries."},{"url":null,"title":"retired-musselburgh-nurse-writes-book-caring-people-dementia","story":"Dee Jenkins, , of Eskmills Road, said the main aim of the publication ndash I Remember Dementia ndash was to encourage carers of dementia patients.Born in Dublin in , Mrs Jenkins, who has lived in Musselburgh for  years, came to Scotland in  to enter a religious order, the Novitiate for the Sisters of La Sagesse, at Leuchie House, North Berwick.

secondary school pupils.Do they need to be worn in class While staff and students can continue to wear face coveringsthey wish to, they will not generally be necessary in the classroom.This is because

schools.\"Alongside this change to the wearing of face coverings, we need to reinforce the importance of maintaining high standards of cleaning, personal hand and respiratory hygiene and physical

Masks can trigger ious types of skin irritationsand redness .There isnrsquot a prevention for maskne, as we need to continue wearing our masks, but there are ways that you can help combat the issues.Skin Care routineIf you want to combat the impact of maskne then having a good skincare routine is essential.It is just as important to cleanse your skin before wearing a mask as it is to cleanse after wearing a mask.To help your skin heal, Ashley would recommend using a squalane or balm cleanser so help remove make-up, dirt and debris.However,you are experiencing chapped, irritated skin or suffer from sensitivity then a gel based cleanseradvised.Dermalogicarsquos UltraCalming Cleanser helps to calm and cool sensitised irritated skin.ExfoliatingExfoliating is key to clear clogged pores and remove dead skin cells which will help reduce the impact of maskne.There are thousands of dferent types of exfoliators available from chemical, physical and masks but it is always important to follow the recommended application and how often you should use the product.Over-exfoliating your skin can compromise your skins barrier , damage the skins capillaries and dehydrate the skin.Ingredients such as glycolic acid, lactic acid and salicylic acid are great exfoliating athelping fight breakouts.Spot treatmentsUsing targeted spot treatments with ingredients such as salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide will help remove dead skin cells and decongest pores.Hyaluronic AcidsHyaluronic acid can hold , times its weight in water - so it is like a magnet for moisture.Using hyaluronic acid regularly will leave the skin feeling super-soft, radiant and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.Hyaluronic acid has antibacterial properties meaning it will help soothe and protect chapped, irritated skin.FoundationsOpt for tinted moisturisers rather than a heavy foundation or go bare faced to help cause less clogging in your pores - but donrsquot forget your SPF!MoisturisersHeavier moisturisers will sit on the skin for longer due to the humidity of wearing the mask which can cause further clogging and irritation of the skin.However, donrsquot want to stop using a moisturiser all together as our skin still requires hydration and moisture.Instead try using a light and soothing moisturise such as Charlotte Tilburyrsquos Magic Cream light.Chapped SkinFor those suffering from chapped skin try using a physical barrier cream such as Dermalogicarsquos Barrier Repair.Barrier Repair shields against environmental pollution and helps forty sensitive skin with a damaged barrier."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/10762411.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"new-bbc-documentary-series-jamie-genevieve-great-indoors-air-week","story":"The make-up artist, who is a worldwide star on YouTube and Instagram, will star in the three-part series Jamie Genevieve: Great Indoors on BBC Scotland onThursday at . pm.It comes after the success of her first documentary for the networks BBC Scotland channel Jamie Genevieve #Unfiltered.The former Cathkin High School pupil started out working in make-up counters in Debenhams in Glasgow.Now she is known for her how to make-up demonstrations on YouTube.The new mini-series focuses on how Jamie and husband Jack is coping in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic from trying her hand at hairdressing to baking."},{"url":null,"title":"list-glasgow-shops-administration-lockdown","story":"Here we look at some of the businesses who will no longer be operating in the city and the ones under threat.Remnant KingsCity location: Howard StreetA total of  stafflost their jobs from the firmrsquos bases in Glasgow, Hamilton, and Edinburgh after the administrators were called in.The firm, which started in Glasgow in , said that although they were historically profitable, they have since suffered from declining turnover and trading dficulties in recent years caused by changing consumer habits.:Glasgow firm Remnant Kings goes into admistration resulting in job lossesOasis and Warehouse GroupCity locations past and present: Buchanan Galleries, Silverburn, Princes Square, and Glasgow Fort.The company behind Oasis and Warehouse went into administration in April when Deloitte was appointed as administrator.All stores haveclosed indefinitely whileonline sales have stopped.Reports say the fashion brands have been sold to restructuring business Hilco in a deal which includes stock but not the  stores or  concessions.Hash Ladha, chief executive of Oasis Warehouse, previouslysaid: ldquoThis is a situation that none of us could have predicted a month ago, and comes as shocking and dficult news for all of us.ldquoWe as a management team have done everything we can to try and save the iconic brands that we love.:Oasis and Warehouse who have shops in Glasgow fall into administrationCath KidstonCity location: Gordon StreetCath Kidston said they will not reopen their shops when lockdown ends.They called in the administrators in April with the closure of shops costing around  jobs.It is understood that the owner of the retro fashion brand has secured a deal to buy back the brand and its online operation.

Fortunately, HM Treasury has bailed Scotland out in this Covid crisis, so, while the - figures will be excruciating, Scotland will survive, thanks to taxpayers in the southeast of England. Would anyone who can count support leaving the UK under these circumstances Jill Stephenson, Edinburgh EH.THE publication of the latest GERSfigures has triggered a now-traditional feeding frenzy.A black hole in Scotlandrsquos finances is heralded by unionist politicians as validating the continuation of their beloved Union.The killer phrase for me from the GERS report is: ldquoThe report is designed to allow users to understand and analyse Scotlandrsquos fiscal position under dferent scenarios within the current constitutional framework.GERS is therefore a measure of the public finances, under the current Union, hardly the greatest endorsement for how the economy has been managed on the UKrsquos watch.Major economic levers required to stimulate economic growth are still currently reserved to Westminster.It is indeed a bizarre scenario when politicians from unionist parties, who should be ashamed at the situation, actively gloat and support a Union that has mismanaged the economy so appallingly.GERS is a set of figures, based on a measure of guesswork that indicate very little, except highlighting the negatives of the current Union. It has little bearing on the finances of an independent Scotland.The point of independence is not to do everything in the same way as it has been done within the current constitutional framework, but to move away from this one-size-fits-all fiscal straitjacket to a tailored approach that prioritises stimulating economic growth.Alex Orr, Edinburgh EH.TODAY the annual GERS numbers have been revealed and no doubt there will be the usual bunfight about their relevance to the constitutional debate. If I might take a dferent tack: the SNP administration is to be congratulated on its determination to publish these figures annually. Not every political party would persist in publishing economic data which has the potential to destroy its raison detre.In a sea of misinformation and spin, GERS stands out as a beacon of truth and accuracy. When we are told that Scotland is doing so much better than the rest of the country on Covid- deaths, but the statistics show dferent, we still have GERS to restore our faith in objective facts. When the first serious outbreak of Covid- in the country is in Edinburgh but the First Minister forgets to tell us about it, we have GERS to remind us that some uncomfortable truths can still make in into the public domain. When we are told that ministers have no say in infectious patients being discharged into care homes but official letters show dferent, when the Education Secretary endorses an equation that seriously disadvantages working class pupils, and when the same Education Secretary does a u-turn on his equation and claims that makes it all right, when Cabinet Secretaries deny that fiscal transfers happen while demanding the continuation of the UK furlough scheme, when the First Minister says we have extra Covid testing capacity but people from Glasgow are told to go to Belfast for a test, GERS is an important truth that we can hold to, a shining light in a murky forest of obfuscation and incompetence. And when we have a succession of Finance Secretaries whose economic qualications seem to be the possession of the requisite numbers of fingers and toes, its nice to know that some competent people are actually keeping the score.So, when we are told that independence transcends everything and that all routes through independence would lead to a prosperous sunny upland, the SNPs own GERS publication is there to remind us, and itit has the wit and honesty to admit it, that such a view is the acme of economic illiteracy and, in the wise words of a prominent nationalist politician, stupidity on stilts.Alex Gallagher, Labour Councillor, North Ayrshire Council, Largs.THANK you, Iain Macwhirter, now we have an article on independence that is relatively neutral in tonereceives a large tranche of its electricity and gas from us, so would be daft to restrict trade on political grounds.

It is ridiculousthat we have no clear break-down of Scotlandrsquos economy, revenues, GDP, expenditure, perhaps only months away from independence, because the UK government will not direct the civil service to provide this information. No serious economist would trust GERS to provide other than the vaguest guestimate of our fiscal position post-Union. A lot will depend on the nature of the dissolution and the subsequent allocation of assets. Funnily enough, that is something unionist politicians commentators donrsquot ever like to talk about. If independence is a serious proposition, then it behoves the media to start asking questions of both sides.GR Weir, Ochiltree.ALAN Fitzpatrickclings desperately to the \"once in a generation\" anthem and wondersstatements in the Scotlands People publication \"could be construed as amounting to a verbal contract with the electorate\". Mr Fitzpatricks memory appears to be selective as he makes no mention of the infamous \"Vow\" to which all three unionist party leaders signed up and promptly forgot about and as for Mr Fitzpatricks comment regarding the old saying that \"an Englishmans word is his bond\", the word was that Scotlands position in the EU could only be guaranteed by voting No to independence, and the bond was broken at the EU referendum so much for that \"verbal contract\".I would remind Mr Fitzpatrick that the SNPs  manesto stated that there would not be a second independence referendum, unless there was \"a signicant and material change of circumstances, such as Scotland being taken out of the EU against our will\". As the voters ed the SNP to power on that manesto, that could be viewed as a written contract with the electorate.Ruth Marr, Stirling.Read more: GERS Report: What is it and what does it mean for independence "},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-surge-demand-testing-schools-returned-foreseen","story":"Not because it necessarily poses a major public health risk, but because the start of any new school term triggers a spike in cold and flu-like viruses that could easily be mistaken for Covid-, thus precipitating exactly the surge in demand for testing that has occurred in recent weeks.A glance at the latest statistics for Scotland shows that during the seven days to August  - when schools began re-opening - a total of , people in Scotland were newly tested for the virus. This resulted in  new cases being detected - a positivity rate of . per cent.In the seven days to August , the number of people being tested had risen sharply to ,, with  new cases identied - a .% positivity rate.Many of these iniduals will have been tested more than once across the NHS and community sites we are now performing more than , Covid antigen tests per week - the highest turnover since the pandemic began.: Scotland to roll out -minute Covid testsDespite this sudden upswing in demand - and bearing in mind that the vast majority of testing is carried out on iniduals with possible Covid symptoms - % of those tested are still coming back negative for the Sars-CoV- virus.While some of these may be  negatives, it is also a strong indicator of just how many non-Covid viral infections are circulating in the community causing coughs and fevers.Young children have also long been known to be lsquosuperspreadersrsquo of colds and flu - yet the same does not appear to be true for the newest strain of coronavirus behind the pandemic.Emerging evidence suggests that older children aged  and over can infect others with Covid in much the same way as adults, however, leading the World Health Organisation to update its guidance to advise that teenagers should wear facemasks in certain circumstances.There is less concern about the danger of the virus to children and adolescents per se. The evidence is overwhelming that the age group is at extremely low risk of serious illness or complications.The real alarm surrounds their potential to pass the infection on to adults on campus, or to bring it home to family members who may be a greater risk.Yet even this is unclear.: Fresh call to lt cap on medical school intake for A Public Health England study published on Sunday analysed outbreaks linked to primary and pre-school children during June.Of the million or so children attending,  children and  members of staff were infected in  separate outbreaks - but PHE said most had probably been caused by staff members infecting other staff members, with only two instances apparently linked to pupild infecting other pupils.However, a study by French epidemiologist Arnaud Fontanet at a school in France found that although younger age groups do not \"transmit to the same extent\", \"teenagers are just as contagious as adults\".Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor of cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, told the Independent that it was best to ldquoerr on the side of caution when discussing whether the coronavirus can be transmitted to adults by children.ldquoTherersquos not a mountain of evidence on both sides,\" he said. \"The fact is we know very little about this, precious little.The bottom line, however, is that our testing capacity has not kept pace with the predictable surge in demand caused by schools reopening.The same pattern is occurring in countries such as South Korea, where schools in Seoul were forced to close and revert back to distance learning this week after the th consecutive day of triple-digit daily increases in coronavirus cases. At least  students and teachers have tested positive over the past two weeks in the Seoul city region.Germany too was forced to completely or partially close some of its schools or quarantine pupils and teachers within days of the new term two weeks ago. In Berlin,  schools have been affected by Covid- cases.The messaging in Scotland was clear: schools could only open safely as long as anyone with possible symptoms stayed home and got tested straightaway.: Contact tracing will only prevent outbreakstesting carried out within  hours of symptomsModelling by academics from University College London and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that reopening of schools in England in September could lead to a second, bigger wave of coronavirus by December unless a \"comprehensive test, trace and isolate strategy\" was in place. This took into account other factors - such as parents being freed up toto offices- but it illustrates the importance of sufficient and rapid testing capacity.The fact that our testing capacity has been overwhelmed so quickly - evensome of it is confusion among people told to self-isolate wrongly seeking tests - is far from ideal.On the plus side, the test results we do have so far indicate that Covid is only behind around one in every  cases of flu-like illness."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-covid-19-linked-greenock-primary-school","story":"NHSGreater Glasgow and Clyde confirmed contact tracing is now underway atLady Alice Primary in Greenock.There was no confirmation on the numbers of cases or whether staff or pupils are involved.:SNP ministers drop annual economic case for independenceA NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde statement read:\"At this time there is no evidence of transmission within the school itself.\"To respect and maintain patient confidentiality, no further details will be released.\"\"Robust control measures are in place within the school.\"Apart from those who are identied as close contacts, all other pupils and staff can continue to attend as normal.\"Families are urged to stay vigilant and to continue with general measures to help halt the spread of coronavirus."},{"url":null,"title":"watch-politically-suicidal-richard-leonard-left-red-faced-horror-fmqs","story":"Mr Leonard was left red faced during First Ministerrsquos Questions after called for Ms Sturgeon to press the UK Government to extend the furlough scheme, which is due to expire in October and commit to a ldquoquality jobs guarantee scheme - both of which the First Minister has already done.Ms Sturgeon asked ldquowhere Richard Leonard has been for the last few weeks.She said: ldquoIrsquove been asking the UK Government to continue the furlough job retention scheme almost every day for weeks.

It was in a boulder lying flat and I was hopping from one boulder to another on my way back along the shore.ldquoI was going quite fast and not really looking, but after I went over the top of this stone I thought it looked like something and went back.ldquoIt turned out I had literally just stepped on a dinosaur. It wasnrsquot clear what kind of animal it was, but there was no doubt it was a dinosaur bone.ldquoThis is a hugely signicant find. Globally, Middle Jurassic fossils are rare and, until now, the only dinosaur fossils found in Scotland were on the Isle of Skye.ldquoThis bone is  million years old and provides us with evidence that stegosaurs were living in Scotland at this time.The bone, which is just over half a metre long, was badly damaged by the action of the waves, but there was enough remaining for a team of palaeontologists to study.The fossil was taken to a laboratory and removed from the rock. Its shape, together with the microstructure of the bone itself, was used to determine that it was part of the hind limb ofa stegosaur.The animal would have been a predecessor of the stegosaurus, a specic species that lived in North America about  million years later.The Isle of Eigg was already known for Jurassic fossils, particularly marine reptiles and fish first discovered by th-century geologist and writer Hugh Miller.The research team was looking for fossils in general to help build up a picture of what le was like in Middle Jurassic Scotland.Dr Panciroli said: ldquoEigg has got rocks from that time, but in  years of searching no-one has found a dinosaur before, so this is quite special.ldquoHow it died and how it ended up where it did, we can only speculate, but there are signs on the bone that itrsquos been nibbled so something probably scavenged it.The discovery comes after stegosaur footprints from the same era were found at Brothersrsquo Point on the nearby Isle of Skye.Dr Panciroli added: ldquoStatistically speaking, they are almost certainly not from the same animals, but they are definitely the same kind of animal.ldquoScotland looked very dferent then, and these herds of animals could have been walking from what is now Eigg to what is now Skye.The fieldwork on the Isle of Eigg was funded by the National Geographic Society. The work on the island took place with the kind permission of The Isle of Eigg Heritage Trust.The bone is now in the collections of National Museums Scotland in Edinburgh.Co-author Dr Steve Brusatte, of the University of Edinburgh, said: ldquoElsarsquos discovery of this bone is really remarkable.ldquoNobody, not even Hugh Miller himself, had found dinosaur bones on Eigg before.ldquoThis fossil is additional evidence that plate-backed stegosaurs used to roam Scotland, which corroborates footprints from the Isle of Skye that we identied as being made by a stegosaur.The report is published in Earth and Environmental Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh ."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"August ,  at : amThis week’s edition of The Orcadian is now available in shops and online, here.

I believe that OLA representing the cattle industry in Orkney can have a strong association with Moredun in the future.#Beth Wells, from Moredun, said “Through meetings we have been fortunate to meet many of Orkney’s livestock farmers, who are well known for their high quality beef production and we are delighted to be developing a closer working collaboration with OLA, which will be of huge benefit to both of our organisations.”OLA is a sub-group of HiHealth Herdcare which is a national cattle health scheme. Karen Johnston, from OLA, said: “We are delighted and very honoured to give our members the opportunity to benefit from expert information and support from such a prestigious and well respected organisation.  We are looking forward to seeing how this partnership progresses and the benefits it brings to Orkney farmers.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Unlike student nurses and midwives, however, those training to be a paramedic are not eligible for a bursary, despite being unable to take up part time work.  To add insult to injury, their counterparts in England do receive bursaries.“This lack of a level playing field risks putting off those we need to see coming into our health service.  The current arrangements do little to encourage young people to pursue a career as a paramedic and store up problems for the future.“When I wrote to the Health Secretary recently on behalf of a constituent, I was told the government has no plans to review the funding options for trainee paramedics. Today, Nicola Sturgeon said she would look into the matter, having also been approached by a young constituent, angry at the unequal treatment.“The First Minister needs to recognise that introducing a bursary scheme would make a real dference, not least in widening access to the profession.  It’s time the Scottish Government properly recognised the dedication of our trainee paramedics by putting them on the same footing as trainee nurses and midwives.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

On the Pentland Firth, people are still being forced to pay over the odds.“COVID has inevitably created challenges, but even prior to the pandemic there seemed to be little urgency from the Scottish Government to deliver on its promise. Assurances that Ministers will now ‘pick up the ball again’ are likely to ring hollow with islanders who just want a date for cheaper fares to be introduced.“Meantime, Ministers could help soften the blow from the delayed introduction of RET by using the underspend to cut fares on Orkney’s internal ferry services.

But this week he wished a fond farewell to his feathered friend and sent her on a southbound trip that involved local RSPB manager Helen Moncrieff, NorthLink Ferries and an Aberdeenshire-based horse transportation company, which offered to take Patricia back to her home coop.Patricia should be reunited with her grateful owner this weekend. Eighty-two year-old John Wheeler lives in the far-off village of Hucclecote ndash over  miles away.Mr Jamieson said his suspicions that he may have had more than just an ordinary pigeon on his hands arose when Patricia appeared reluctant to leave.ldquoIt was in our hen run and the hens were making a commotion, he said.ldquoIt was just a rag of bones.

But what of other aspects What of community resilience, something I suspect will barely register as a priority for most us when deciding on our weekly shop It may be the case that more people will try and grow more of their own food and local produce will, hopefully, be in greater demand.All very welcome. But what’s really needed is a completely fresh approach to our behaviour as consumers.As the pound in our pocket becomes ever more stretched we need to value it in terms of what benefit it can bring to the wider collective # who can it support, what should it support and how can that can bring about greater resilience within our own communities.It’s not radical or revolutionary. It’s just about taking a bit more time and effort to think about where best to spend our cash, especially when it comes to our most basic of needs.It can’t possibly make sense to get your Sunday roast from the supermarketthe same cut of meat is available at your local butcher at a comparable price . And especiallythat butcher has sourced his meat from the crofter down the road.It takes a bit of extra effort to call in at the butcher, for sure, but add in important elements like food miles and provenance and there really is no excuse, except for our own inherent laziness.It has always amazed me how there is any fish at all on the shelves of supermarkets in this part of the world when the local fishmongers offer far higher quality at a lower price.And, in any case, it’s now perfectly possible to buy direct from the fisherman, with many of them now offering sales to the public.That may have come about through the closure of their overseas markets during lockdown, but what better example of necessity being the mother of invention.If west-coast prawns were coveted by sophisticated palates on the Mediterranean, then they should be more than adequate for consumption a bit closer to home.It’s not that long ago that our communities were completely self-reliant in food.We do demand a more discerning choice these days # no-one would want toto a diet made up entirely of fish, mutton and potatoes.But, with an abundance of quality produce on our own doorstep, surely it makes sense to take more advantage of that and in the process create greater community resilience through sourcing from independent, local retailers.If there’s a downside to that approach, I fail to see it.ONE aspect that looks certain to change, certainly for the foreseeable, is that there will be less air travel.Through the lockdown it is estimated that carbon emissions have been reduced by over  per cent by planes being grounded alone.That’s not even taking account of reductions in car journeys and it is a staggering figure from just one simple change.There are certain elements in the environmental lobby who would have you believe that methane emissions from cattle make a signicant contribution to climate change.Never mind that bovineshave roamed the land for thousands of years without causing much harm.Never mind that it’s only the last  or  years, as our economy became ever reliant on fossil fuels, that the damage to our planet has been made.The reduction in air travel will be for economic, more than environmental, reasons.But the staggering statistics of these last few months should at least mean that when it comes to a real determination in tackling environmental damage the finger of blame will be pointed in the right direction.Then again, maybe cows are a much easier target."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image.jpg","title":"royal celtic societys unique music","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineWork has begun on processing the twenty entries received for a unique competition which set the country’s musicians the challenge of creating a new shinty composition.

Kerry McWilliams, the founder of Lightwork NI, a charity that has provided more than  sessions of direct support to families over the past two months, said the crossover between school and family le was a major issue for many of the people she has worked with throughout the pandemic. Kerry said they have found that while children were largely able to keep in touch with the outside world and their peers through the likes of social media, many were uncomfortable being taught by their parents. And she said the stresses experienced by some groups of parents, such as key workers or those who had lost their income, made it more dficult for adults to support their children effectively. Home schooling was a cause of signicant conflict and distress, she said. Parents told us they found it very dficult to get children to do the work children told us they were afraid of being found out.One nine-year-old boy told me, #I don#t want to do school work with my parents because they think I#m really smart and they#re going to find out I#m not - I get good marks because I cheat and copy and when they see I can#t do the work they#re going to know#. This was a common fear for children - a sense of discomfort as school invaded their homes and family relationships. Most children like to keep school and home separate. Parents felt exposed and vulnerable as they were unable to understand or support their children#s learning.Many couldn#t access ICT equipment or provide internet access for multiple children and this led to frustration. She continued: We have lived through a global pandemic, a moment in history unprecedented in modern society. Families I have worked with have all moved through paralysing fear, powerlessness and panic. They have taken a fresh look at what makes them happy, what is worth fighting for - we all realised it#s not toilet roll - and how far they have sleepwalked into a le they wouldn#t have consciously chosen, and don#t really want to go back to. I believe the legacy and consequences of lockdown will be signicant for everyone both in the immediate future and for many years to come.She said there are a number of steps parents can take in the coming weeks and months to ensure their children cope with theto school, including drawing upon the relationships that were built during lockdown and ensuring children#s voices are heard. She also recommended putting in place routines and precautions to ensure everyone feels safe: Then you can stop worrying. Our worries communicate to children - when you feel confident and optimistic, they will too.

It#s been an incredibly rushed and quick turn around, but it#s not really until the children are back that we will see how it will work as that may well throw up other issues that we haven#t even thought of yet.Ms White added: However, one of the most fundamental things we need clarity on is what should be done straight awaya child or staff member tests positive for Covid-.

Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council issued the warning after a number of incidents over the weekend.At Benone Strand, a large amount of cans and broken bottles were left close to the beach boardwalk, while glass was also found on the sand at Castlerock along with discarded belongings and other items including plastic bottles and bags.There are concerns that groups are congregating to use beaches and dunes as drinking dens.The council has issued a reminder that there is a zero tolerance approach to littering with offenders facing an £ Fixed Penalty Notice. Those found drinking illegally can also face further enforcement action.Mayor Mark Fielding said: I want to appeal directly to anyone who visited our coastal locations at the weekend. What did you do with your rubbish  Did you think it was acceptable to leave it behind  Did you expect someone  to clean it up for you  Litter is proving to be a huge challenge at this time, and we need everyone to take more responsibility.Our beaches are one of our greatest assets and they are there for everyone#s enjoyment. Leaving broken glass where it can injure visitors, children and pets is a disgraceful act. I would ask those who did this how they would feela member of their family was badly injured because of their completely unacceptable behaviour Parent and carers should share this message with their children so they realise that littering of any kind is wholly unacceptable.To report littering contact Environmental Health by ringing    or email environmentalhealth@causewaycoastandglens.gov.ukBelfast Most ReadLet there be light: Derelict Belfast church transformed into heavenly homesCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Wet pubs to remain closed after virus spikeIncident in which NI restaurant turned away ambulance worker because of Covid risk #regrettable#, says hospitality chiefDetectives investigating Belfast bonfire attacks on police release images of inidualsTyrone footballer wins £k on National Lottery scratchcard,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The museum#s curators said the decision was influenced by the Black Lives Matter movement, sparked by the police killing of George Floyd in the US. Sir Hans will now be described as a collector and slave owner on signage. However, CEO and founder of the Sir Hans Sloane Centre Elizabeth Crilly argued that the physician never owned a slave, as it was his we#s father who was a slave trader. Sir Hans was born in  and married a wealthy heiress of Jamaican sugar plantations.Yes, he did get money, but how did he get his money, she asked. He fell in love with a woman. It was her father who was a slave trader. Are the sins of the father to be passed on to the children She said he used the money to further his collection and when he died he made his collections accessible to the public.The people of Killyleagh and Northern Ireland should still be proud of him and not let this negative story destroy what we#re trying to do for Killyleagh and get a bit of prosperity going on here.Ms Crilly said Sir Hans was a man of equality, as he treated rich and poor. Hans Sloane never owned a slave. A man of the church sent him a slave but Hans Sloane educated him and put him on a boat to France to get him on his feet, she said. It#s those things you need to look at, and sadly slavery is in our history. It was wrong and it was a global trade, but it was the British who brought it to an end.Belfast Most ReadLet there be light: Derelict Belfast church transformed into heavenly homesCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Wet pubs to remain closed after virus spikeIncident in which NI restaurant turned away ambulance worker because of Covid risk #regrettable#, says hospitality chiefDetectives investigating Belfast bonfire attacks on police release images of inidualsTyrone footballer wins £k on National Lottery scratchcard,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The collapse of Stormont coupled with the Department of Health’s view that the school did not demonstrate ‘need and value for money’ led to delays. Finally, in May of this year Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill announced that it had been approved and would open in September . In an in-depth interview with Derry News reporter, Garrett Hargan, Professor Dubras speaks of her elation after discovering the long wait was over, about the hundreds of people who have expressed an interest to date and the wide-ranging benefits that training doctors locally will bring. googletag.cmd.push She also refutes any suggestion that the school will ever be relocated, talks about the prospect of health science courses moving to Magee to complement the medical school and new build projects in the pipeline which will enhance the learning experience for medical students in the city.  For readers who may not know, can you provide a brief background of your career path before taking on the role as Foundation Dean at the Magee Medical School  I’ve been a GP for a long time. My clinical background is that I worked in Southampton looking after homeless people for a long, long time. I was lead GP for a homeless service. googletag.cmd.push From a university perspective, I worked at the University of Southampton for quite a long time and had increasing roles in leadership and ended up running the medical degree programme. I went from there to King’s College in London where I was the Deputy Dean of Medical Education. We were doing a huge curriculum change in this very big medical school, one of the biggest schools in the country with about  students each year. So it was very sizeable and quite a challenge. Then I became the Interim Dean of Medical Education for nine months and then was ready for a new challenge and that’s when this job came up. I arrived in Derry in June . I was really excited about coming here because it was an opportunity to establish something new, obviously with a focus on General Practice. An opportunity to bring my own values to the school and my personal values which have kind of always been about social justice, access and community-based healthcare. It really aligned with the university’s plans. And that’s me in a nutshell. What are your thoughts on the city having lived here for two years now  It’s wonderful, I have felt so welcomed here. I was born and grew up in the Channel Islands, Jersey, and it’s a small community, coastal and I’m kind of used to being in a place where people know other people and I’m used to being somewhere that I can get to the sea. From that perspective I’ve loved it. But I’ve done things like joining Altnagelvin Hospital’s choir, I’m probably the worst member of the choir, but it’s just been lovely and a brilliant way to get to know people. I’ve started running, I joined Star Running Club. Everywhere I’ve gone I’ve been impressed by just how much of a welcoming place the city is. Why did approval for the medical school take so long  It took a little bit longer than I was expecting. But although the journey was a little bit longer and a bit lumpier than I had anticipated, it’s worth it. I think the outcome is a really great one. At this months Western Trust meeting a member of the board said the Department of Health put obstacles in the way. Is that true  No, I don’t think so. It’s been a very thorough process of working with the university to develop our outline business case. And I think the civil service have a responsibility to make sure that these things are robust. At the point where we submitted our final business case to them in October of last year I was confident it was well put together and robust. There was time required for them to consider that. And the Assembly was not in place which was an added dimension to the decision-making process because the civil service aren’t in a position to make that level of decision. So it took longer than any of us expected but with the benefit of hindsight, that was not wasted time. And the GMC process was ongoing in parallel anyway. They visited us in July last year and we did have to pause the process until such time as we had confirmation of student places. But once we resumed the process we were able to pick that up fairly quickly. A little bit longer but I wouldn’t say there was deliberate obstruction at all. How did you feel when it finally got over the line  Oh goodness, delighted. The announcement by the Deputy First Minister in May of our places was just so welcome and then the confirmation that we had by the end of June was equally, each step has been fantastic. But the one that made me feel most excited was the point where the GMC gave agreement that we could recruit staff and students. That was the most signicant for me when our external regulator said it was happy for us to progress. There is some fear in the city, which has been highlighted by local councillors, that the school could be moved given the history of courses being transferred to other campuses. Are there any guarantees that the medical school will not be moved to another campus  I don’t think there’s any question about that, Garrett. How many applications have you received so far for the course  They all go through UCAS and we don’t know how that is going until ious UCAS deadlines are passed. This morning we had the first of a series of webinars with people who are interested in studying with us. We had  people on this morning wanting to know about the programme. We’re running a test centre for The Graduate Medical School Admissions Testand we filled up our places within a week. There is a real interest in coming to study with us. Has a date been set for the GAMSAT  There are two opportunities, one is usually September and the other March. We became registered as a GAMSAT centre as soon as we got the go-ahead to recruit students. Because it’s an Australian company that runs GAMSAT, it’s the kind of gold standard for anyone going in to graduate entry medical school courses. Our September October sittings are full and they will release the dates for March and as soon as those are released people will be able to register. But in order to apply, people don’t have to have taken GAMSAT in those dates. There’s a two-year grace sosomeone did it in  they would still be eligible for our first round of applications. You’ve pointed out that it is not a post-graduate course or limited to people with medical qualications, but open to anyone with a : degree. What fields have applicants come from so far  The beauty of our programme is that we don’t limit it to people with bioscience backgrounds. My experience working with students on other GEMS courses and also the experience of our partner medical school, St George’s in London, is that there’s a real mix of prior backgrounds. You might have people coming in who’ve got Masters of even PhDs in biomedical related subjects but equally I’ve worked with people who’ve come in with degrees in music, who’ve been geography teachers, lawyers, and the interesting thing about graduate entry medicine is that we teach it students work in mixed groups so you’ll find you might have somebody with an English degree working with someone who has a Masters in mechanical engineering or a BSc in biomedical sciences and actually they all learn from each other and are all engaged in that journey. And the people who are non-bioscience in background learn fast and by the end of the first year they are all at the same level and all really benefited from that ersity in backgrounds. At this stage would you know anything about the geographical spread of applicants  We have a database of about  people who have been interested in following the programme and have probably been in contact with us for about three years. They’re fairly widely dispersed, quite a lot of them are from NI and spread out here. Some expressing interest from GB and other international students but there’s a limit to the number of international students any medical school can take. That’s set by the UK government because of the way clinical placements are funded and also going into the foundation programme to become fully registered with the GMC. There’s a cap on medical courses partly because of what it costs to train doctors but in addition to that it’s about the capacity of hospitals and general practices to take those students. We’ve got lots of interest but limited to what we can do internationally. What specic facilities do you need in order to provide the type of first-class course you envisage  We have a building identied for refurbishment. We will have students on campus for their first year and part of their second year. After that they’re largely out on clinical placements and coming back to campus for certain weeks, tutorials and so on. The estate plan is comprehensive to accommodate those students and we’ll be providing them with a range of resources rooms for learning anatomy, for learning clinical skills, communication skills as well as standard tutorial rooms. Do you have those in the current buildings at Magee  Absolutely. Is the aim to still have a new building along the riverfront   Absolutely yeah, we still intend to have our new building but we have the wherewithal and are ready for first intake on the campus.  Would the theory element of the course be taught there once it’s ready  That would be the expectation, yes. Is there any timeline that you’re aware of for that  As you know, the funding for that is within the City Deal process so there will be the standard contractual stuff that will go on. But we have space on the campus to not be pressured for time and ultimately our new build has to be right. It’s not like we’re going to have to move out within a particular timescale. Seventy students have been agreed to begin with a view to increasing that to . Are you confident it will be increased to  and in what timescale are you looking for that to happen  There are ongoing discussions with the Department for the Economy. In our business case we had a sense of how we want to grow year on year but we’re certainly happy to be delivering  doctors a year because that is a substantial addition to the Northern Ireland medical workforce. Does Ulster University have enough experience and expertise to supervise the medical school at council level  One hundred per cent, absolutely. You’ve heard us talk about the rigorous GMC quality assurance process and a lot of that process is about testing out with us, in a very robust way, a whole range of things that include senior level governance, support, commitment, resources so the GMC wouldn’t be permitting us to progressthey weren’t confident in the university’s ability to deliver this. Can you say anything about the plans for on-site teaching facilities at Altnagelvin that were mentioned at the recent Western Trust board meeting  We’re at an early stage of those conversations and obviously we’re working in a partnership with the Trust and we’ll be having conversations with them and with our colleagues at Queens University Belfast. So it’s early days yet with that. Were these plans included in a business case that has already been submitted  Oh yes, it’s costed. Absolutely. Was it with the department of health because a number of departments have said they have no knowledge of it  I can’t remember the details about which department, it was included in the capital requirements within the City Deal. Should health science coursesmove to Magee to complement the medical school and build upon that positive progress, and would you like to see them come  As you know there’s been a consultation on the future location of those courses which has been paused because we’re running a full equality impact assessment. So we’re aiming to resume that shortly. I think from an educational perspective, the more health professionals you are able to educate in the same place the better. Do you think the medical school approval will aid that case  I think it’s a signicant element. Are you confident it will happen and are you personally pushing for that move  It’s subject to consultation, Garrett, so I can’t pre-judge the outcome of a consultation. But you’ve read the consultation document so you know that that’s the university’s preferred outcome . What do you think about a cross-border university named in honour of John Hume that would link UU Magee, the Institute of Technology in Letterkenny  Sligo and North West Regional College   It has been proposed by the Irish government’s Higher Education minister, is that something you’d be supportive of  I think we have to recognise the impact of John Hume as a politician, peace maker and honorary graduate of the university. So John Hume had immense impact and I think we are very keen to work with the Hume Foundation to recognise his contribution in whatever way is most appropriate. And of course, as you know, his daughter is a GP locally so I think commitment to health and social justice are all things which align very much with my own personal values. We have a very strong working relationship with our colleagues at the Letterkenny Institute of Technology, with North West Regional College, so I think from my perspective, the university is going to continue to deepen those working relationships. Student numbers have dropped at Magee every year since. Does the university have to show that it is committed to the campus by delivering on long-promised expansion to , students  I think the mere fact that the university is committed to the school of medicine and training of doctors in the city is evidence of its commitment. Are you aware of a wider strategy to deliver on that promise  I don’t think there’s any doubt about the university’s commitment to the city, as I said, certainly in terms of training doctors, we’ve already talked about the university’s preferred outcome for the health sciences consultation so I think there’s absolutely no doubt about the university’s commitment. Id imagine you have a busy year ahead, what has to be done to ready the school for students in the coming months  As you can see from the university’s marketing material and my tweets and so on you’ll see that we’re actively marketing to recruit students. And we’ll continue that with webinars, we’ll be running the GAMSAT test in October, we aim to run our interviews in JanuaryFebruary of next year whether they are in person or virtual because of COVID. That will be us progressing student recruitment. Then there is staff recruitment which is due to go out in the next week or so. We have a recruitment strategy to get all of those people in post in time for the first students. There’s the building refurbishment, there’s procurement of our virtual learning environment and ious other bits and pieces. So, you’re right, there is plenty to keep us out of mischief. Looking to the future, what will the course bring to the city, and ultimately when these students are able to graduate, how much will that mean to local health care  My goodness, there are so many benefits. One is that we know from really good research over time thatyou train doctors locally they stay local. And will often choose general practice as a career. What it can do for the city first and foremost is, it will grow our health profession workforce. Second is, there is also a huge opportunity to improve morale amongst the workforce who are currently here because they can see real benefit in brining on the future. There’s nothing more exciting than actually working with medical students because they’re amazing people and you know that they’re going to make brilliant doctors. The third thing is that there’s a real opportunity to improve recruitment anyway, because people like to come to places that are involved in medical education. And another benefit is the fact that medical students don’t just stay in their university, they like to get involved with the local community through classes and societies, so they will often run resuscitation training courses for kids in schools, they might work with a range of community groups doing volunteering. So I think everywhere you turn you would see real benefits to the school the medicine and these students in the city.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It is not the first time he faced a challenge in that part of Ulster. He tells Liam Tunney his gripping story, outlining his reasons for wanting to break the stigma of addictionA County Derry man has spoken of his experience with addiction as he prepares for a fundraising challenge in aid of the organisation who helped him deal with it. Dean Groogan, from Ballinascreen, is raising money for the Cuan Mhuire rehabilitation centre in Newry by climbing the seven peaks of the Mourne Mountains this weekend with a number of friends. The -year-old, well-known in south Derry for his story-telling and recitation talent, has spoken about his story to encourage others who may be struggling to seek the help they need. “I know a lot of people that need help, but they dont know where to get it or how to go about it,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I wasnt originally going to talk about myself, but I was talking to my girlfriend and people close to me and they said, why are you beating about the bush  “They saidI wanted to break the stigma, I had to be straight and honest, and it made sense. The more I tell my story, itll help people come forward and get help themselves.” Dean had been struggling with drug addiction for a number of years before attending the Newry rehabilitation centre, and says the continued fight to cover up his problems took its toll. “For a lot of years I was struggling. I can make all the excuses in the world about mental health problems, anxiety, depression and guilt, but I got deep into addiction with fake highs,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “I was covering up for a lot of years. I can wear a hundred and one masks and people would think I was in great form, but deep down I was a broken person. “I was hiding that for a long time and I tried a thousand times to get myself sorted, but I would not do it on my own. “It was put to me a few times about getting residential help, but I didnt want it, because it was a pride thing for me. I was embarrassed people would find out. “Eventually I had to put my hands up and say I needed help. I didnt lose my job or my family, so it wasnt rock bottom that way, but emotionally, I was at rock bottom. “I didnt know where to go, I was just a broken person in the depths of depression. Just a broken man. I had to get help and Cuan Mhuire was a le-saver for me.” Dean and Pat McGinn met up a few weeks ago to record a video about Cuan Mhuire. Dean was introduced to Pat McGinn, a former Lord Mayor of Newry and someone who had been through Cuan Mhuire previously. He admits though, thatit wasnt for the intervention of his girlfriend Emma, and close family and friends, he might not have taken that step. “Cuan Mhuire saved my le, andit hadnt been for my girlfriend Emma and my close family and friends, I wouldnt have gone,” he said. “I wont say Cuan Mhuire did it all for me, because they dont just put a magic wand over your head and say thats you free, because you have to put in the work yourself. “I went in and gave it my all and Cuan Mhuire gave me three months to get my head sorted, myself straight, allowed me to recharge the batteries and I came out a dferent man.” Cuan Mhuire was set up in  by Sister Consilio in Athy, County Kildare. The Newry centre was built in  and originally catered for those suffering from alcohol addiction. These days, the spectrum of addiction is much wider. “In this day and age, its not as simple as a man lying drunk in the street. Drugs are everywhere, in every bar you go into, and its so easy for a young person to get hooked on something,” said Dean. “They try it for a bit of craic and the next thing they know, its a few months down the line and theyre in something they cant get out of. It destroys lives. “Drugs are a new thing, people dont really understand. I was speaking to a man who was drinking for years. He said he never touched drugs, butthey had been about in his day he probably would have. “Its so easily available these days and it wrecks families. It rips the soul clean out of you. For me, I detested myself. I knew what I was doing was wrong and that it was wrecking my le. “I just couldnt stop. Addiction is something that you cant get enough of, but that you detest. It was just ruining me and Cuan Mhuire was a le-saver for me.” The Cuan Mhuire centre in Newry. On Saturday, August , Dean and a group of friends will climb the seven peaks of the Mourne Mountains to raise money for the centre. They are already well on the way to their pound, target, and are hoping the trip will be a fun way of raising money and awareness for Cuan Mhuire. “Eight of us are going to start off at six in the morning and tackle the highest peaks in the Mournes,” said the Ballinascreen native. “I know a few boys that have done it in around  or  hours, but were not going to break any records! There are a few men going to meet us halfway up and do us a barbeque, so itll be a days craic as well. “I know money donated to the charity is great, but stigma is the main thing, so Ill be pushing online about the residential care for people suffering with drugs, gambling or drink.” Dean wants to ensure that anyone who finds themselves in need of help knows where to access it, and is especially keen to help men who may be struggling and reluctant to act. “As men, we bottle a lot of things up, personal things like depression or anxiety and people turn to drink or drugs or other highs to mask them things,” he said. “They are taught from no age not to show any emotions, to bottle it up and be a man, and thats not the reality. Theyre turning to other substances to mask the pain and thats just not the way to go. “This is to let them know that places like Cuan Mhuire are out there and will help themthey come forward. “Anything can go through that door thats one thing I found out about it. There are all dferent age groups and all dferent backgrounds and religions. “There are people with plenty of money and people with none. There were even a few people who were homeless whose families want nothing to do with them. “Addiction doesnt care who you are, it will come for you regardless. Putting yourself out there warts and all isnt easy, butit helps someone, thats the reason for doing it.” For more information, visit the Mourne Mountain Challenge Facebook page, where you can find links to the Just Giving page, for those wishing to donate.

It is not the first time he faced a challenge in that part of Ulster. He tells Liam Tunney his gripping story, outlining his reasons for wanting to break the stigma of addictionA County Derry man has spoken of his experience with addiction as he prepares for a fundraising challenge in aid of the organisation who helped him deal with it. Dean Groogan, from Ballinascreen, is raising money for the Cuan Mhuire rehabilitation centre in Newry by climbing the seven peaks of the Mourne Mountains this weekend with a number of friends. The -year-old, well-known in south Derry for his story-telling and recitation talent, has spoken about his story to encourage others who may be struggling to seek the help they need. “I know a lot of people that need help, but they dont know where to get it or how to go about it,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I wasnt originally going to talk about myself, but I was talking to my girlfriend and people close to me and they said, why are you beating about the bush  “They saidI wanted to break the stigma, I had to be straight and honest, and it made sense. The more I tell my story, itll help people come forward and get help themselves.” Dean had been struggling with drug addiction for a number of years before attending the Newry rehabilitation centre, and says the continued fight to cover up his problems took its toll. “For a lot of years I was struggling. I can make all the excuses in the world about mental health problems, anxiety, depression and guilt, but I got deep into addiction with fake highs,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “I was covering up for a lot of years.

Just a broken man. I had to get help and Cuan Mhuire was a le-saver for me.” Dean and Pat McGinn met up a few weeks ago to record a video about Cuan Mhuire. Dean was introduced to Pat McGinn, a former Lord Mayor of Newry and someone who had been through Cuan Mhuire previously. He admits though, thatit wasnt for the intervention of his girlfriend Emma, and close family and friends, he might not have taken that step. “Cuan Mhuire saved my le, andit hadnt been for my girlfriend Emma and my close family and friends, I wouldnt have gone,” he said. “I wont say Cuan Mhuire did it all for me, because they dont just put a magic wand over your head and say thats you free, because you have to put in the work yourself. “I went in and gave it my all and Cuan Mhuire gave me three months to get my head sorted, myself straight, allowed me to recharge the batteries and I came out a dferent man.” Cuan Mhuire was set up in  by Sister Consilio in Athy, County Kildare. The Newry centre was built in  and originally catered for those suffering from alcohol addiction. These days, the spectrum of addiction is much wider. “In this day and age, its not as simple as a man lying drunk in the street. Drugs are everywhere, in every bar you go into, and its so easy for a young person to get hooked on something,” said Dean. “They try it for a bit of craic and the next thing they know, its a few months down the line and theyre in something they cant get out of. It destroys lives. “Drugs are a new thing, people dont really understand. I was speaking to a man who was drinking for years.

It was just ruining me and Cuan Mhuire was a le-saver for me.” The Cuan Mhuire centre in Newry. On Saturday, August , Dean and a group of friends will climb the seven peaks of the Mourne Mountains to raise money for the centre. They are already well on the way to their pound, target, and are hoping the trip will be a fun way of raising money and awareness for Cuan Mhuire. “Eight of us are going to start off at six in the morning and tackle the highest peaks in the Mournes,” said the Ballinascreen native. “I know a few boys that have done it in around  or  hours, but were not going to break any records! There are a few men going to meet us halfway up and do us a barbeque, so itll be a days craic as well. “I know money donated to the charity is great, but stigma is the main thing, so Ill be pushing online about the residential care for people suffering with drugs, gambling or drink.” Dean wants to ensure that anyone who finds themselves in need of help knows where to access it, and is especially keen to help men who may be struggling and reluctant to act. “As men, we bottle a lot of things up, personal things like depression or anxiety and people turn to drink or drugs or other highs to mask them things,” he said. “They are taught from no age not to show any emotions, to bottle it up and be a man, and thats not the reality. Theyre turning to other substances to mask the pain and thats just not the way to go. “This is to let them know that places like Cuan Mhuire are out there and will help themthey come forward. “Anything can go through that door thats one thing I found out about it.

There were even a few people who were homeless whose families want nothing to do with them. “Addiction doesnt care who you are, it will come for you regardless. Putting yourself out there warts and all isnt easy, butit helps someone, thats the reason for doing it.” For more information, visit the Mourne Mountain Challenge Facebook page, where you can find links to the Just Giving page, for those wishing to donate.

But after the birth of her second child in , the Rosemount woman decided to relocate to the city where she grew up. “I had a great time in London and some amazing experiences there, but like many Derry people living away from home, I always missed it,” Jeananne said. “We moved to Derry a year and a half ago and are so happy to be here, particularly in the last six months, when having a bit more space and being close to family and nature has been so important.” googletag.cmd.push With a growing trend for people looking to leave built-up cities for quieter, more affordable locations post-lockdown, Jeananne decided to share her experience and that of other ‘city quitters’ in a podcast. All Change Please is co-hosted by Jeananne, who now works as a freelance journalist and copywriter, and her friend and fellow journalist, Jayne Cherrington-Cook, who left London for Kent. They release new episodes fortnightly and interviewees in series one include s music royalty-turned-designer Pearl Lowe, who moved from London to Somerset, Irish presenter and illustrator Maggie Molloy, and original Big Brother winner Craig Phillips, who reveals he once rented a room from the shows notorious Nasty Nick. googletag.cmd.push We cover all sorts of topics, from the practicalities of moving, to working from home and making friends somewhere new - and whether people have any regrets about leaving a big city, said Jeananne. Its all done remotely with Jayne in Kent, me in Derry and our guest joining from wherever theyre based. I actually have to record in my parents house, my own is too noisy with two young children running around and wanting to join in, said Jeananne who, plans to include some well-known local names soon.The logo for All Change Please was designed by local artist Bronach Crabtee, aka The Crafty Crab. The plan is to attract listeners considering a move, but I think our interviewees have such interesting stories to tell, it will make a good listen for anyone looking for a new podcast to enjoy, Jeananne added. The first two episodes of All Change Please are online now, with new episodes released fortnightly on a Thursday. The podcast is available on iTunes, Spoty and Acast, and is on Twitter @allchangepod https:podcasts.apple gb podcast all-change-please id  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Micky Doherty was presented with the Foyle Pride Mark Ashton Award for Outstanding Contribution to the LGBTQ+ community by the citys real Mayor, SDLP Councillor Brian Tierney, at a ceremony at the Holywell Trusts Garden of Remembrance on Saturday night. A spokesperson for Foyle Pride said Mr Doherty, who fronts the citys Pride parade each year, was a truly deserving winner who does so much, for not only the LGBTQ+ community, but also the wider city and district community. Mr Doherty is a tireless charity fundraiser and helped set up a special fund to help local people in need during the oronavirus crisis. googletag.cmd.push Im known in the local area as being a charity fundraiser-theres a charity fundraiser Ill host it, said Mr Doherty. Its just part of me that I like helping people. During lockdown I knew people had started to struggle and they were coming to me and I started to think about how I could help. Because I have been working with charities for a long time people put their trust in me. Mr Doherty was hosting a drive through bingo event last week when he got a phone call to say he had won the Foyle Pride award. I just burst out crying, he admitted. I really didnt expect it so I was just overwhelmed. googletag.cmd.push I just have so much gratitude for the award and for everyone who nominated me and I want to thank them all. Mr Doherty said he wished his late mum, Cathy, could have been there on Saturday to see him receive his award. Its hard to accept that my mammy couldnt be there, he said. Its just not the same without her but I am still filled with so much gratitude for it, he said. Derry LGBT+ campaigner, Suzanna Toland, who passed away earlier this year, was remembered at Saturdays ceremony. It was really nice to see Suzanna recognised for everything that she did, said Micky. She was a very special person.Before she passed away she had set up an LGBT+ disco at Rosie Joes so that people would have a safe place to socialise.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It is understood that the mystery vessel was bought for pound with the unknown owner planning to convert it into an Airbnb boat.  Foyle Search and Rescue , the police and other relevant agencies responded to reports of the boat being stuck on Sunday when they offered the crew assistance. The vessel, Day Dawn N , was last known to be engaged in fishing. according to the Marine Traffic website. Another site, Vessel Finder, also states that it received the latest position of the boat at .pm on August . googletag.cmd.push FSR were tasked on Sunday last, following reports of a grounded vessel. Pat Carlin, of FSR, said the boat was likely to be there until mid-September when the tide would be high enough for it to re-float. “She’s stuck solid,” he added. “We went and assessed the boat, determined that the crew were safe and passed that information on to the police service,” Mr Carlin explained “We provided them with some basic supplies that they needed and basically the vessel is grounded and can’t be move until the tide is lted. “All relevant services were notied and are aware that it’s there.” googletag.cmd.push Mr Carlin continued: “I think they were up on the council pontoon and to the best of my knowledge they may have come from outside the area, I don’t know exactly. “They’ll have no choice but to wait, maybe with the sudden floods tonightthey’ll be lucky and might get re-floated otherwise they’ll have to wait until the tides are high enough.” The PSNI confirmed that police assisted partners, including FSR and Coastguard in liaising with the crew. A report from , shows that Day Dawn N  was bought for the purposes of fishing from Portavogie. It was said to be the first time the vessel had been based anywhere  apart from Kilkeel since her arrival in  from Banff where the wooden-hulled boat was built by John Watt  Sons as a trawler. Harbour master at Portavogie, Neil Warnock, yesterday said Day Dawn was based there but left a couple of months ago. “Somebody bought it for a pleasure craft,” he explained. “It’s not a fishing boat any more, the licence on it was sold off a while ago there. “The last I heard the boat was in Portrush, I saw a picture of it at Portrush harbour after it left here.” At Portrush, the assistant harbour master said the boat owner was only there for three days and he believed the man travelled from the Greencastle direction. He was trying to get himself a permanent mooring, he said, but wasn’t able to secure it. The owner left Portrush heading towards Derry where he tried to get a mooring in the town and ended up on the mud flats. “I just know that he bought that for a pound. None of the fishermen like decom- missioning so they basically would rather they go off. “So I think he bought it for a pound and wanted to change it into an Air B ‘n’ B, but we couldn’t offer him a permanent mooring in Portrush, so he was only here for three days,” the Assistant Harbour Master added. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Foyle Port added: “Foyle Port is aware that a small trawler has run aground at Madams Bank in the River Foyle. “There is no environmental threat or impediment to other marine craft. “Once conditions are right we expect the vessel to become buoyant again.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Pat Carlin, of FSR, said the boat was likely to be there until mid-September when the tide would be high enough for it to re-float. “She’s stuck solid,” he added. “We went and assessed the boat, determined that the crew were safe and passed that information on to the police service,” Mr Carlin explained “We provided them with some basic supplies that they needed and basically the vessel is grounded and can’t be move until the tide is lted. “All relevant services were notied and are aware that it’s there.” googletag.cmd.push Mr Carlin continued: “I think they were up on the council pontoon and to the best of my knowledge they may have come from outside the area, I don’t know exactly. “They’ll have no choice but to wait, maybe with the sudden floods tonightthey’ll be lucky and might get re-floated otherwise they’ll have to wait until the tides are high enough.” The PSNI confirmed that police assisted partners, including FSR and Coastguard in liaising with the crew. A report from , shows that Day Dawn N  was bought for the purposes of fishing from Portavogie. It was said to be the first time the vessel had been based anywhere  apart from Kilkeel since her arrival in  from Banff where the wooden-hulled boat was built by John Watt  Sons as a trawler. Harbour master at Portavogie, Neil Warnock, yesterday said Day Dawn was based there but left a couple of months ago. “Somebody bought it for a pleasure craft,” he explained. “It’s not a fishing boat any more, the licence on it was sold off a while ago there. “The last I heard the boat was in Portrush, I saw a picture of it at Portrush harbour after it left here.” At Portrush, the assistant harbour master said the boat owner was only there for three days and he believed the man travelled from the Greencastle direction. He was trying to get himself a permanent mooring, he said, but wasn’t able to secure it. The owner left Portrush heading towards Derry where he tried to get a mooring in the town and ended up on the mud flats. “I just know that he bought that for a pound. None of the fishermen like decom- missioning so they basically would rather they go off. “So I think he bought it for a pound and wanted to change it into an Air B ‘n’ B, but we couldn’t offer him a permanent mooring in Portrush, so he was only here for three days,” the Assistant Harbour Master added. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Foyle Port added: “Foyle Port is aware that a small trawler has run aground at Madams Bank in the River Foyle. “There is no environmental threat or impediment to other marine craft. “Once conditions are right we expect the vessel to become buoyant again.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I am very proud that our incoming head boy, Cormac Savage, was at the forefront of this campaign and believe his contribution was pivotal in ensuring that the sense of injustice and unfairness felt by his peers was articulated in a forceful and timely manner.Mr McCann also welcomed confirmation that GCSE grades will be awarded as calculated by schools.ldquoTeachers were asked to exercise professional judgment and engaged in a robust process to ensure that pupil effort and attainment in the period from September  to the unexpected and unprecedented closing of schools in March was rewarded, he said. ldquoA great deal of time and energy was devoted to this task by the staff of St. Patrickrsquos Grammar to ensure that grades were awarded fairly and consistently.Down High principal Maud Perry, said after the initial publication of results last Thursday the school was celebrating its best ever A-Level achievements.ldquoThis was unsurprising, as this particular year group achieved the schoolrsquos best ever AS results last year, she said.ldquoThis was a very dferent year in so many ways, but Down High pupils continue to be among the best qualied of their generation and, beyond the curriculum, our pupils are enriched, socially confident and ready to take their place as leaders of the future in whatever fields they choose. Congratulations to all of the pupils on these fully deserved grades.Shimna Integrated College principal Kevin Lambe congratulated the schoolrsquos ldquowonderful A level students who weathered the storm of this unprecedented year.He said he was delighted that the vast majority of students had already been placed at their first choice of university before the restoration of the teacher assessed grades on Monday afternoon.Mr Lambe said that while there had been considerable controversy about the process of awarding grades this year, he paid tribute to the excellent guidance document CCEA provided and to the commitment and energy his staff brought to the grading process.ldquoI am quite sure that the moderation process was undertaken in good faith, but it caused dreadful damage and heartache across the country, he said. ldquoThe CCEA guidance was sound, the work of teachers was thoroughgoing, the teacher awarded grades were the right ones and I am absolutely delighted that they have been restored.Ballynahinchrsquos Assumption Grammar School said it was delighted with the government U-turn in awarding grades as the original process ldquocaused signicant emotional upheaval which affected students, parents and our staff.ldquoWe are fortunate in that over % of our A students had already accessed their chosen university or workplace and hope that now almost every girl has achieved their true potential and will be able to access a iety of career pathways. Assumption Girls set the highest of standards year on year and we are proud of our Year  Girls who excelled in every subject at every level, said a school statement.ldquoOur AS students now have a solid foundation of grades which will give them the confidence to believe in their own potential to achieve at the highest of levels as they enter A level. We wish our GCSE girls the best of luck for tomorrowrsquos results.Castlewellanrsquos St Malachyrsquos High School said it was pleased with Education Minister Peter Weirrsquos announcement that AS and A level students will receive their centre assessment grades or the grade awarded by the examining body, whichever is higher.ldquoWe continue to work hard in St Malachyrsquos in the best interests of all our young people, said a statement issued on Monday evening. We are all here in St Malachyrsquos to help and support our students in the best way we can. Congratulations on their wonderful achievements we wish them all the very best in the future.De La Salle High School principal Ciaran Maguire described the past academic year for students as ldquochallenging.He said students adhered to social distancing guidelines collecting their results last Thursday, with the school delighted with their overall grades.ldquoA-Level results across the province has been one of confusion and uncertainty, said Mr Maguire.ldquoWe as a school were relieved that the majority of the teacher assessment grades were secured for our pupils and will continue to appeal and challenge those that need to be addressed to ensure that all pupils get the right outcome, allowing them to progress in an ever changing world.Before Mondayrsquos announcement, Mr Mark Morgan, principal at St Colmanrsquos High and Sixth Form College in Ballynahinch, said the continued year on year improvement in grades from the students appeared to have been curtailed by the examination bodies.He said teacher predicted grades, which were in line with all the tracking data, appeared to have been totally ignored and grades were given that bore no reflection to the historic and contemporaneous standard attained by students at the school.St Maryrsquos High School in Downpatrick congratulated its A-Level and AS-Level students who received their results.The school said the studentsrsquo success was a ldquoreflection of their hard work, determination to succeed and dedicated teaching staff who always go the extra mile.ldquoOur steady, upward trend in examination results has continued this year and we wish our students all the very best as they begin their studies at university, the statement added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th August 2020 53.jpg","title":"53 dogs put down in past year – one third of all in NI  ","story":"A LOCAL politician says she is ldquoheartbroken that more dogs being put to sleep in Newry, Mourne and Down than any other council area in Northern Ireland.Fty-three dogs were destroyed in Newry, Mourne and Down in - out of a total of  for the whole province.Thatrsquos almost twice as many as the next highest area, which is Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon with .By contrast six councils reported single figure death rates, while not a single dog was put to sleep in Ards and North Down.Rowallane area councillor Kathryn Owen says the figure for Newry, Mourne and Down makes for ldquogrim reading.Cllr Owen, who has four dogs, says the council should look to the successful measures being implemented in other council areas.ldquoTo say Irsquom heartbroken about the immense number of dogs destroyed in Newry, Mourne and Down District would be an understatement, she said.ldquoThis is not a statistic that we should be proud of.

The Minister cannot allow all this to simply be thrown away.Ms Armstrong said the local community previously stood together to save Exploris and would do so again.She added: ldquoI would urge anyone with concerns to make their voice heard and lodge their concerns and together we can save our local economy.It is believed that the poundm aquarium proposal for Belfast could create more than  full-time jobs and would be the biggest attraction of its kind on the island of Ireland, with city planners recommending that the new development should be given the green light.The firm behind it, reefLIVE, says around  to  jobs could be created during its construction, with  full-time posts created when it opens its doors, subject to securing planning approval.The aquarium would be a two-storey building, based across more than , sq ft and include a cafe, coral reef ocean tank, with the main exhibition space across five zones on the first floor ndash themed as Ireland, Deep Ocean, Azores, Pacic and Arctic.Around  representations were received in relation to the planning application, including  letters of objection.Concerns included the impact to traffic and travel, the impact on heritage for both listed buildings and monuments, flooding and the potential negative impact on the Exploris aquarium in Portaferry.Those behind the planned tourist attraction say it is anticipated the reefLIVE Aquarium will be the largest marine-le visitor attraction on the island of Ireland and in bringing another international-standard attraction to the Titanic Quarter, would help to boost theof tourist visits to the city.In recommending the scheme for approval, Belfast City Council planners said that ldquohaving regard to the development plan and other material considerations, including the issues raised by the representation, the proposal is considered and approval of planning permission is recommended with delegated authority given to the director of planning and building control to finalise the wording of conditions subject to no new substantive planning issues being raised by third parties..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th August 2020 Celebrations.jpg","title":"Celebrations to mark the end of WW2  ","story":"CHURCH bells rang out across Killyleagh on Saturday morning to mark the th anniversary of VJ Day.The bells of St Johnrsquos Church of Ireland were tolled as part of the UK-wide commemorations of the anniversary.The day when the Second World War finally ended was celebrated with a short interdenominational act of remembrance at the War Memorial.At am former Army chaplain Hector Wanliss gave a ure reading and led prayers of thanksgiving for the men of Killyleagh, Shrigley and district who went to war, and for peace.Then Last Post and Reveille were sounded by Ronnie Cromie and Wilmer Cromie before two minutesrsquo silence was observed and Binyonrsquos Lines were recited by Billy Croskery, the chairman of Killyleagh and Killinchy Royal British Legion.A wreath was then laid by Mr Croskery, who was escorted by Kevin Kelly.Sadly Killyleaghrsquos last remaining Second World War veteran, Martin `Tinarsquo Charters, who is aged , was not able to take part on this occasion.Social distancing measures were in place and the organisers are grateful for those who attended adhering to these.It was a timely reminder that the main highlight of the year, the Killyleagh VE  celebrations, had to be cancelled in May by the Killyleagh Remembers the War group in the wake of the Coronavirus alert and the danger of public gatherings.The Killyleagh group has now cancelled its next proposed event, a lecture on the Second World War in the library due to be given by author George Busby on September .ldquoWe will be keeping under review the remaining schedule of the programme, in conjunction with the Heritage Lottery Fund.

This time Ardal McMahon provided the finish as they reached the water break.The RGU management team were left with plenty to ponder. Downpatrick continued to battle after the resumption, determined not to be hit by the threat of an avalanche of Rostrevor scores.At this stage there looked to be a real danger that Rostrevor would cut loose.

Certainly in terms of the opening they made to the match, catching the RGU cold, they laid the foundations early that kept many of the worries away that Downpatrick could spring a result on them.To Downpatrickrsquos credit, after that disappointing early start, there were more than enough signs there that the spirit within the camp to dig in and get themselves out of trouble in games is there.Downpatrick: James Deeny, Paddy Smith, Ronan Murphy, Eoin Rooney, Nathan McShane, Gerdie Collins, Conor Doherty, Damian Turley, Jonny Bell, Tim Prenter , Conor McGrady , Conor McCarron , Ruairi Quinn , Peter Turley , Chris Magee .Subs: Jarlath Brannigan , Morgan Fitzpatrick, Caolan Boyd, Damian Branf, Daniel McCarron, Garrett Trainor, Ruairi Og Quinn, Frank Starkey, Tom Savage, Tim Collins, Aidan McNeill, Con Farrell, Aidan Og Robinson.Rostrevor: Gareth Clarke, Jarlath Farrell, Tomas Gordon, Eoin Murdock, Nicky Murray, Colm Murney, James Donaghy, Sean Cooper, Caolan Mooney , Ardghal McMahon , Jordan Fegan , Patrick Magee, Conor Doyle , Shaun Parr, Piaras Kane .Subs: Paul McGrath, Richie Reynolds, Darren McElhinney, Conall Gordon, Eamon McConville.

There will also be clear, visible guidelines about cleanliness and reminders of personal responsibility throughout the facilities.Council chairwoman Laura Devlin said: ldquoWe have been working hard to ensure that we open our leisure facilities in the safest way possible, taking a step-by-step approach to ensure your safety.ldquoWe aim to accommodate as many people as possible, but we need to ensure that we also adhere to government guidelines.ldquoAs well as the key safety measures, such as social distancing and hygiene, there are now practical things people need to consider before they swim, such as coming to pools beach ready, showering at home and paying special attention to pool signage.She added: ldquoI would urge all our keen swimmers in the district to make themselves familiar with our guidance on our website before booking their swim slot and coming along to our swimming pools..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11743512.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

a cheatit had been suitable.ldquoBack in  there were a few areas in Barry which were beginning to look a little tired, but it also came with a timeless charm that provided us with the perfect texture and feel that Dave and I had discussed.ldquoAdded to this was the welcome we were given by residents and, in particular, the support of the local council.ldquoPorthcawl was also a serious candidate for the backdrop to this show, but having scouted tirelessly the whole of Barry and Barry Island, I knew that this ticked every box.Mr Evans said Trinity Street was an instant favourite.ldquoI knew Gwenrsquos house was here, he said. ldquoThe terraced houses on a steep hill and its far-reaching views over to Barry Island and docks meant that no matter which direction the camera was pointing, there would be interesting textures and views.ldquoThe next objective was to get inside as many houses as possible to seeany worked for us as Gwenrsquos house.ldquoI letter dropped about  houses to gauge the interest.ldquoIrsquod heard that Matt Lucas was going to be involved so I used his name get to my foot in the door.ldquoThis usually helps.ldquoIn those days very few had heard of James Corden.ldquoI viewed and took pictures of about five houses on that street and Glendarsquos who was one of the first to contact me.ldquoThe decor and character of Glendarsquos house fitted my brief perfectly, but my first thought was that house was a little on the small side.ldquoTo get a film crew and the actors to work in such a tight space would be quite a challenge, butI could convince our director and designer that it could be achieved Gwenrsquos house was found.ldquoI took Dave and Christine along to Trinity Street and both fell in love with the location within minutes.Mr Evans continued: ldquoGlenda was so accommodating.ldquoI remember very well discussing with her the details of how filming on location works, how disruptive the whole process can be and also the location fee.ldquoWhat I do remember was her reaction when I mentioned the amount.ldquoGlendarsquos reply was: ldquoIrsquom so sorry Clive, but I donrsquot think I can cover that.ldquoGlenda thought that she needed to pay for the privilege of having us there and not the other way round.ldquoShe is a lovely lady and still loves being a part of the Gavin  Stacey world.During the locationsrsquo breakdown meeting, we discussed how Pam and Mickrsquos house might look in Billericay so homes were viewed in and around Llandaff and Sully until Dinas Powys was selected thanks to the welcome that was received.ldquoSt Cattwgrsquos Church at Llanmaes was not the first-choice wedding venue for Gavin and Stacey, Mr Evans said. ldquoThey were due to be married at St Nicholas Church at the village of St Nicholas, but a last-minute change of heart by the Church in Wales meant that we needed to find an alternative at the th hour.ldquoA friend and another locations manager called Chris Hill pulled in a favour and we were able to use St Cattwgrsquos.ldquoI dont recall any candidates other than Island Leisure .ldquoWhile filming on the front, Marco opening up early for the crew to be able to get a nice coffee as the weather was pretty unkind.ldquoWe didnt use the interior of the coffee shop as a location in series one, but as it was so cold when we filmed on the seafront the coffees were very welcome.ldquoWe also filmed at the Vale of Glamorgan Resort for the exterior of the wedding fair.ldquoThe interior was shot at the Copthorne Hotel at Culverhouse Cross.ldquoWhile at the Vale resort, the Wales rugby team came into the reception of the hotel.ldquoRuth Jones askedIrsquod be able to set up a photograph of the cast with the Welsh team.ldquoWe got them to agree so out there somewhere are pictures of the Gavin  Stacey cast with the Wales rugby team.ldquoUncle Brynrsquos house was only an exterior in series one so very little was involved in its search.ldquoQuiz night at the Colcot Arms was interesting.ldquoWe were close to completing our filming when the pub opened to the public - so the last few shots took a little while longer than wersquod planned.Mr Evans lives with his we Rhiannon and daughter Cerys Mim and runs his own Film and TV Facilities company.He added: ldquoThe actors usually donrsquot get to see the locations beforehand.ldquoThey are brought to set, run through a quick rehearsal then go for the real thing.ldquoThey then have to go through the whole thing over and over with the camera shooting from dferent angles.ldquoIt is a slow process and  hours on camera gives us around three minutes of footage.ldquoI get a real buzz from seeing locations that I have found on TV, but when it comes to Gavin  Stacey the story I always bring up is that while scouting in the very early days with the series producer in the car he askedI would consider reading for Dave.ldquoMy le could have been so dferent, but I have no regrets as no-one could have played it better than Steffan Rhodri.ldquoMy daughter Cerys Mim was born during filming and James Corden was the first to congratulate me when I ed to work on the show after her birth.ldquoHe joked about us naming her Nessa or Stacey.ldquoBarry and the Vale have always provided me with a fantastic hunting ground for film and TV locations.ldquoIts a huge contributor to South Wales becoming a hotspot for filming in the last decade or so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsPoliticsQuestions asked over Lord Mayor’s decisionA Portadown councillor has called on Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council’s Chief Executive and legal team to investigate the Lord Mayor’s interpretation of a standing order.By The NewsroomWednesday, th August , : pm\"\"The call for clarity was made during August’s monthly meeting of Council by DUP councillor, Darryn Causby.It follows a decision made by the Lord Mayor, Councillor Kevin Savage, during June’s monthly meeting of Council to rule a motion relating to the naming of the South Lake LeisureCentre ‘improper’ and decide that it would not be debated.During discussion of his decisionon the night, the Lord Mayor made it clear he had not taken legal advice but had discussed his decision with his Sinn Fein party colleagues.Council’s Chief Executive Roger Wilson also confirmed that he was only made aware of the decision just as the meeting was beginning and as such, legal advice was not produced.Speaking at August’s monthly meeting, Cllr Causby said he believed the Lord Mayor did not have the authority to act as he did and asked for clarication to ensure such actions are not repeated.“I want to raise a point of order Lord Mayor,” said Cllr Causby. “It refers to standing order .. which is the standing order you used when deciding not to allow a motion placed on the agenda for our meeting in June to be heard.“You interpreted the standing order in an interesting way. I have checked and reading through the standing orders I don’t believe you had the authority to do what you did,you read the standing orders in the correct context.“In terms of the standing order it is for the reporting officer to determinea notice of motion is lawful or improper. The Chief Executive is our officer in that regard and he considered the motion and included it in the agenda for the meeting.“You then took the decision, unilaterally, to not have it heard during the meeting.”Councillor Causby asked for the matter to be investigated to clarythe Lord Mayor acted within the bounds of his authority.“My ask is that the Chief Executive and Council’s legal team investigate the eighth edition of’Knowles on Local Authority Meetings’ as it details the proper protocol, it is the guide and case law,” said the DUP representative.“I want to ensure that we get proper clarity to prevent a decision like from being taken again.”Speaking to the Local Democracy Reporting Service after the meeting, Councillor Causby said this call has nothing to do with the decision taken on the naming of the South Lakes Leisure Centre, rather ensuring that the office of the Lord Mayor remains removed from partisan politics.“With regards to the decision taken on the name of the leisure centre, what is done, is done,” said Cllr Causby.“We are not going to overturn that decision, it has already been made. I just want to ensure a moment like this does not happen again.“The standing order the Lord Mayor quoted is ... It concerns motions that are unlawful or improper. The Lord Mayor called the motion improper but that was not his call to make.“Council Baxter should have been informed of the decision prior to the meeting but he was not, nor was the Chief Executive, the Lord Mayor told us on the night he had informed his party colleagues.“He acted outside the process, outside standing orders and, in my view, quite improperly.”When asked about the process of the investigation, a Council spokesperson said “no comment could be made on the matter”.“In line with legislation, a notice of motion is subject to a call-in periodand no comment can be made on the matter until the call-in period has lapsed,” the spokesperson said.“In this case, as legal advice on the interpretation of the standing order is to be provided, it would also be subject to legal privilege.”Read our coverage of the original debate hereA message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Over my years as principal, we have had great support from the club and some of our past pupils have gone on to represent their county.For me, the notable achievement has been to see the way in which past pupils have progressed in a iety of chosen careers and been successful in so many walks of le.Another achievement is the way in which the staff both past and present have worked together as a team to have accomplished so many things over the past  years, not least to have been awarded Outstanding in our last inspection report.The development of the St. Cairealls Community Playschool on the school site has also brought me great joy over the past ten years to see it now as a successful pre-school provider with DENI status and funding for our local children.Having spent so many years of my le in St Cairealls P.S., it has become a second home and the staff and pupils a second family. Retiring for me brings mixed emotions. However , I am looking forward to having more time to spend with my family, my husband Kevin, our daughters Emer, Niamh and Fionnuala and their partners. Also our son Michael and his partner and my two precious grandsons Micheal and Braidan. Mrs McHugh concluded: I want to offer good wishes to the future of this very special school – St. Cairealls Primary School, Aghyaran and success and happiness to my successor, Mrs Michelle Ellis.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dfcecfab   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_eccfeecc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1598431969897.jpg--post_primary_pupils_now_to_wear_face_coverings_in_corridors.jpg?159843197000","title":"post primary pupils now to wear face coverings in corridors ","story":"Education Minister Peter Weir has announced that guidance on face coverings will be updated to include wearing them in corridors of post-primary schools. This will come into effect on  August when schoolson a full-time basis. The Minister said: “My key priority is that pupilsto school on a full-time basis, as soon as it is safe to do so. “Following further advice which I have received today from the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Scientic Adviser, I am recommending that pupils and teachers wear a face covering in corridors and other communal areas of post-primary schools from next week when schoolsfull-time. This updates the existing guidance on the use of face coverings in educational settings. “The current public health advice is that the use of face coverings provides some benefits, however, it is not a replacement for frequent hand washing, social distancing where possible, covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze and regular cleaning of surfaces. It is also important to remember that evidence suggests that the risk of transmission in schools is relatively low compared to some other settings. “My existing guidance on the reopening of schools already deals with the use of face coverings. In terms of school transport, the advice remains the same, that we strongly recommend that all pupils wear a face covering on all dedicated school transport including buses and taxis where it is appropriate for them to do so. “In relation to communal areas in schools, the guidance already strongly encourages face coverings for activities that entail large numbers of staff or pupils within an enclosed space where social distancing is not possible. “Given the risk mitigations in place in schools to limit and contain the spread of Covid-, face coverings are not recommended as being compulsory for routine use in education settings. However, staff and pupils may wish to use them during the routine school day and this is acceptable. Schools should also be aware that some personsare exempt from wearing face coverings. “I will continue to keep all guidance in respect of education settings under review in light of the latest medical and scientic advice. Peter Weir said: “The first step in keeping our schools safe is that anyone with symptoms should not attend school. Parents should not send their children to schoolthey have any of the Covid- symptoms including: a high temperature a new, continuous cough a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste.” The Department’s New School Day Guidance will be updated to reflect this recommendation.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dfcecfab   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_eccfeecc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
