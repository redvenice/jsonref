The normally media-shy Huawei founder has been forced to step into the limelight in recent months as the company has come under increasing pressure over espionage concerns and the US-led campaign to persuade other countries to ban its technology US prosecutors are also charging Huawei with stealing trade secrets, saying it offered rewards to employees for stealing technology from other rivals.Ren shrugged off the growing pressure.\u0027If the lights go out in the West, the East will still shine,\u0027 he said. \u0027America doesn\u0027t represent the world.\u0027\u0027Even if they persuade more countries not to use us temporarily, we can always downsize and become smaller.\u0027Signs that US efforts to convince its allies to shun Huawei technology could fall through are also growing.British intelligence concluded that security risks posed by using Huawei\u0027s 5G equipment can be managed, The Financial Times reported on Monday.\u0027Other nations can make the argument that if the British are confident of mitigation against national security threats then they can also reassure their publics and the US administration that they are acting in a prudent manner to allow their telecommunications service providers to use Chinese components,\u0027 an unnamed source told the newspaper.New Zealand is also in talks to minimise the security risks posed by using Huawei equipment in 5G infrastructure instead of excluding it entirely.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said Tuesday that New Zealand\u0027s security bureau was discussing Huawei security concerns with Spark, the domestic telecoms carrier that had been barred from using the Chinese firm\u0027s equipment last year.She also added that the company had \u0027never\u0027 been ruled out from potentially participating in the country\u0027s 5G rollout."},{"url":null,"title":"Meghan Markles matchmaker Misha Nonoo flashes giant diamond getting engaged Mikey Hess","story":"    They do: Designer Misha Nonoo, 34, is engaged to 32-year-old oil heir Michael \u0027Mikey\u0027 Hess (pair above in Cabo San Lucas)          Wedding bells: Hess popped the question in Cabo San Lucas while the two were on a romantic getaway for Valentine\u0027s Day (pair above on Valentine\u0027s Day)  Knock their socks off like Meghan in a metallic dress by Misha NonooTake a closer look here...We do love looking back at the Duchess of Sussex\u0026#39s old outfits.

The musical remake of her 1980s film that she leaves behind is proficient, but soulless. The set blinks like a pinball machine, it churns out good smutty puns, but it’s oh so thin on plot, monotone on performance and even the newly penned songs by Dolly are blandly forgettable.Two Parton classics appear though, one warning us ‘too much make-up, too much hair, don’t be fooled by thinkin’ that the goods are not all there’.Reader, the goods are not all there.Its attempt at a message is ‘#MeToo the musical’ but with bottom slapping. The central trio of secretaries (originally Parton, Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda on screen) start the fight within their firm for equal rights and recognition.Worthy causes, but they’re quickly forgotten as cleavages are ogled, unattractive women are balked at, secretary Bonnie Langford kicks her height in suspenders and boss Brian Conley is dangled from the ceiling in a gimp suit.          Dolly Parton joins cast members Natalie McQueen as Doralee Rhodes, Caroline Sheen as Violet Newstead, Amber Davies as Judy Bernly, Bonnie Langford as Roz Keith and Brian Conley as Franklin Hart Junior on stage during the curtain callIt unconvincingly tries to have it both ways, like Bernard Manning giving a serious lecture on the virtues of feminism.But the crowd lapped it up, except the elderly gentleman sitting in a box who tutted like a woodpecker when drugs made an appearance.Our secretary trio is Caroline Sheen, Natalie McQueen and Amber Davies. Davies is far better than her Love Island career start would have you expect, Sheen is solid West End standard, but McQueen as Doralee (unmistakably the rootin’-tootin’ Dolly Parton role) is the closest thing to stardust with fine Tennessee-twang vocal cords and a Barbara Windsor slapstick quality.

It was overturned, meaning the Proceeds of Crime Act proceedings against the multi-millionaire can be revealed for the first time. The Act was introduced in 2002 to allow money or assets to be seized by the State if they were obtained through unlawful conduct. In Stunt’s case, he has not been charged with any offence, and it is not clear why the order has been made. His assets have not been seized, but their use has been restricted and he must not dispose of, deal with or diminish the value of them.It is understood that, since August, the restraint order has been subject to minor revisions on three occasions, to take account of Stunt’s business interests.In the original order, Judge Munro QC slapped a £1,000-a-week limit on him, saying: ‘This order does not prohibit the Alleged Offender from spending up to £1,000 a week towards his ordinary living expenses.’          Listed by the court: One of two Rolls-Royce Phantoms. Stunt recently bragged of owning 200 cars and boasted that losing £5million in a casino meant nothing to him.          Stunt is being forced to live considerably more frugally these days – on the orders of a judge (pictured: His favourite supercar, the Lamborghini Aventador)It is a far cry from his days of splashing the cash. His costly and acrimonious orce from Miss Ecclestone in 2017 did not dent his penchant for shopping trips to Harrods in a cavalcade of supercars. In March last year, he declared to Tatler magazine that he is ‘as rich as ever’.He said he had once had a £5million credit line at ‘every casino’ in London, Monaco, Las Vegas and Macao but had recently cut his wagers to ‘just’ £20,000 a night, explaining: ‘Me fooling around with £20,000, I’m not trying to sound as if I don’t know the value of money, but it’s a huge improvement on losing £5million a night. You have to bet enough to hurt you, but I definitely had a gambling problem. I was losing millions every time.’Interviewed at home by the high-society magazine, while wearing a £60,000 Audemars Piguet gold wristwatch, he showed off some of his paintings including a Van Gogh, a Constable, a Picasso and several Van Dycks.These are likely to be among the list of artworks that Stunt has been ordered to draw up by the court. The judge demanded he itemise all of his ‘paintings, furniture, watches, jewellery and objets d’art’, along with their estimated value, photographs and locations where they are held.          Audemars Piguet gold watch: Stunt has one worth £60,000 in his collection          The gold bullion magnate is the ex-husband of Formula One heiress Petra Ecclestone, with whom he has three children (pictured: His Bentley Mulsanne)          Rolls-Royce Phantom: The other in Stunt’s collection. Stunt has also spent millions on artworksStunt has spent millions on artworks. His bodyguards have been spotted carrying bubble-wrapped masterpieces from Sotheby’s and Christie’s to Rolls-Royces parked on yellow lines outside.He has lent paintings by Monet, Dali, Picasso and Constable to galleries around the world. Even Prince Charles accepted paintings on loan for the restoration of his Scottish stately home Dumfries House, and Stunt has several royal letters of gratitude on display at his Mayfair office.Two months ago, in line with good journalistic practice, the Mail gave Stunt a chance to comment before publication. A security guard answering the door of his stucco-fronted Belgravia cottage said he was unavailable, but accepted a letter to him offering an opportunity to comment. Instead of doing so, Stunt went straight to a judge.Later that day, Old Bailey Judge Mark Dennis QC granted an order to ‘prohibit publication of all information’ relating to the assets freezing order. Yesterday, Judge Dennis threw out the gagging order, and suggested Stunt had been trying to protect his ‘personal, reputational or personal business interests’, none of which was relevant to the Proceeds of Crime proceedings. The CPS has declined to comment.          Used by his security team: One of two Range Rovers. He told Tattler he liked to travel in ‘an armada of cars’ on shopping trips round London          Bentley Flying Spur: Stunt claims to own 200 carsStunt has repeatedly stoked controversy. During his £5billion orce, he was claimed to have rubbed cocaine on his gums during a court hearing. On the same day in June 2017, it is also claimed he barged into his father-in-law, the ex-Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone, and made a gun gesture towards him in court. He later made an obscene gesture at photographers as he left the hearing. Stunt has ‘categorically denied’ all these allegations, calling them ‘completely ridiculous’.Around that time, Stunt was photographed sitting in the back of a Rolls-Royce with Terry Adams, the ‘Godfather’ of Britain’s most notorious crime family which has been linked to 25 murders, money laundering, racketeering and extortion.Adams is also Stunt’s godfather. Stunt has spoken of his pride at being his godson. There is no suggestion he is involved in any of Adams’s affairs.          Wine collection: A bottle of Chateau PetrusThe assets which have been frozen by the court offer a fascinating glimpse into Stunt’s wealth. Among other things, the Proceeds of Crime order lists his cars and their personalised number plates – all variations on his surname.Supercars Stunt is banned from selling the following cars: Bentley Flying Spur, registration S4UNT Range Rover S2UNT Lamborghini Countach 157UNT Rolls-Royce Phantom 57UNT, Lamborghini Aventador S7UNT, Range Rover S1UNT, Rolls-Royce Phantom S3UNT, Lamborghini Aventador S1VNT, Bentley Mulsanne S6UNT.He has bragged that he owns more than 200 high-performance cars, mainly stored in hangars in California and the UK.He told Tattler he liked to travel in ‘an armada of cars’ on shopping trips round London, typically in a Lamborghini sandwiched by two Rolls-Royces and two Range Rovers as, he claims, it would embarrass him to have his 25-strong security team trail him in Ford Fiestas.Stunt once boasted to Bernie Ecclestone that his £600,000 Rolls-Royce Mansory Conquistador was the only one in the world.Apartments The court order imposes a freeze on two entire floors of a luxury apartment block next to the Thames. Stunt paid £3.3million for the first flat, in 2012, and a further £3.4million for the apartment directly beneath it, in 2015.Deeds for the two properties, publicly available via the Land Registry, have been recently amended to show that a court order prevents any sale without the permission of ‘the CPS Proceeds of Crime Central Pre-Enforcement Unit’. They also show that a bankruptcy notice was filed at the High Court in October this year.£11m cottage Stunt’s stucco-fronted four-storey Belgravia cottage has four double-bedroom suites, wine cellar, roof terrace, cinema, gym and steam room. Bought via one of his companies for £2.7million in 2011 – he boasted he paid cash – it was put back on the market in 2016 for £11.8million but did not sell.          The court order also demanded that Stunt draw up a list of all his art. Pictured is one of his entourage on an art-buying spree in July 2015 Land Two small plots in Stunt’s name close to Dartmouth Castle in Devon are identified in the order. Bizarrely, the plots in a patch of woodland are tiny – each less than eight inches by eight inches.MoneyThe order freezes no fewer than 14 bank accounts in the names of James Stunt or Stunt \u0026amp Co Ltd. They comprise nine accounts at Barclays, four at Lloyds and one at a Mayfair wealth management firm.WineStunt is banned from selling his Corney \u0026amp Barrow fine wine collection. The 230-year-old London-based firm is one of the oldest independent wine merchants in the UK. It is currently selling a case of 12 bottles of Petrus 1982 for £51,000.Art The court order also demanded that Stunt draw up a list of all his ‘paintings, furniture, watches, jewellery and objets d’art’ and itemise their estimated value and locations where they are held."},{"url":null,"title":"Shamima Begums baby taken Loose Womens Denise Welch tells viewers","story":"Denise Welch (right) has waded into the jihadi schoolgirl controversy by saying her baby should be taken off her, while Gemma Atkinson (left)  says the jihadi schoolgirl should not be allowed back into the UK          They are the latest celebrities to offer their views on 19-year-old Shamima Begum (pictured) who is begging to return home after fleeing to Syria to join the Islamic State in 2015She said: \u0027I do believe the baby should be taken from her and I believe the baby should be placed with a family that has nothing to do with that family.\u0027  And the star went on to say the runaway schoolgirl has shown \u0027no remorse\u0027 and was \u0027still in love\u0027 with her jihadi husband. Jihadi bride Shamima Begum says she is willing to go to JAIL...Share this articleOther panelists disagreed with the ex-Coronation Street actress, including singer Gabrielle who supported the ISIS schoolgirl\u0027s cause.She said: \u0027We are a humane country - we should have her back.

A hard Brexit would be a particular blow to us, but not life threatening. While it may put pressure on future decisions, we are fully committed to the UK.\u0027Our Brexit planning is in place. These are contingency measures. We have a plan, strategic as well as short-term. There will be no lay-offs. But we have a safety valve just in case.\u0027           Mr Hallmark was speaking to the MailOnline in Marbella, SpainThis includes: :: quadrupling the amount of stock it holds (soon to rise to five-fold) to prevent being hit by shortages of key parts :: shipping cars and parts via Immingham instead of Dover :: remaining flexible over potential shut-down periods. There are no plans yet to extend the planned Easter holiday shut-down, but Friday working could be curtailed if necessary to give some flex. Mr Hallmark said Brexit was only one of a number of factors currently affecting the wider motor industry and forcing uncomfortable change. Others include the demise of diesel, the drive towards electrification, and sales slowdowns in China and the USA. He said that as a luxury manufacturer Bentley was better placed than most volume car producers where tariffs bite harder because trade is more price sensitive. If a \u0027hard Brexit\u0027 meant tariffs of around 10 per cent were imposed, Bentley would take a decision whether to add them onto the price or to absorb them, hitting profits. Mr Hallmark said: \u0027A hard Brexit could lead to a lift in prices in Europe, or we could live with them ourselves by taking the hit and reducing our base price accordingly to compensate for the extra tariff. That\u0027s harder for volume manufacturers.\u0027 He stressed: \u0027When times get tough, those who are weakest struggle most \u0027Brexit hasn\u0027t happened yet. I don\u0027t think anyone can blame current performance on Brexit. There\u0027s the diesel issue, for example. That\u0027s nothing to do with Brexit.\u0027          Mr Hallmark, who this week celebrates his first full year at the helm said: \u0027All our Brexit planning is in place. We have been here for 100 years and we will be here for the next 100 years.\u0027Mr Hallmark said only 20 per cent of Bentley\u0027s sales are to Continental Europe so it has a more balanced spread of sales. Some 21 per cent is to the USA, 19 per cent to China, 14 per cent remains in the UK and the remaining 16 per cent is exported to the result of the world. \u0027The outlook for luxury cars is still positive,\u0027 he added.Volkswagen Group has given Bentley two years to drive back to profitability.

Fears surrounding our departure helped to halve fresh investment in the sector last year, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.            Nissan has also scaled back UK production by cancelling construction of its new X-Trail SUV at its Sunderland factoryOverseas investors such as Honda have, in the past three decades, rebuilt the British car industry after it was driven to the brink of annihilation in the 1970s by rabid trade union activity. Now they are in flight.Nissan is cancelling plans to build its new X-Trail SUV at its Sunderland factory. US giant Ford, which employs 13,000 workers in Britain, describes the potential consequences of No Deal as \u0027catastrophic\u0027, while the boss of Jaguar Land Rover, which is cutting UK jobs, has issued a string of dire warnings.Brexiteers will, of course, accuse these firms of crying wolf. Maybe – but that doesn\u0027t mean there are no wolves out there. And it is a tragedy that the very companies which helped to bring about a remarkable renaissance in the British car industry have become the collateral damage in the chaos of our impending departure from the EU.            Jaguar Land Rover, which is cutting UK jobs, has also issued warnings about a no deal BrexitIt is yet one more problem to contend with in a troubled industry that faces plummeting demand for diesel cars, a slump in the vast Chinese market, and fears that Donald Trump may impose punishing tariffs on vehicles imported into the US.In Germany, a country synonymous with the production of sleek, super-reliable driving machines sold worldwide, the decline in the auto industry is actually stalling the economy.The industry is also dealing with the lifestyle choices of the Uber generation: city-dwelling, environmentally-conscious young people who are less fixated on car ownership than their parents were.So a state of emergency would prevail even without Brexit, and the threat of No Deal makes us an even less attractive place to invest in troubled times.Workers blame Brexit for demise of Honda\u0027s Swindon plant | Business | The Guardian"},{"url":null,"title":"Radio host Nicky Campbell tells sense rejection felt foster children","story":"    Broadcaster Nicky Campbell, pictured centre, with his adoptive parents Frank and Shelia and his half-sister Fiona, right          Nicky Campbell\u0027s biological mother is Dublin nurse Stella Lackey, pictured.

The fact that the firm is still here today, almost 200 years later, speaks for itself.\u0027In 1824, John Cadbury bought the shop in Bull Street with money given to him by his father, who owned the shop next door.Alongside tea and coffee, John also sold cocoa beans which he turned into drinking chocolate. He saw the drink as a healthy alternative to alcohol - something John, being a Quaker, was keen to encourage.His clientele agreed and the company grew exponentially in the 19th century under the stewardship of his sons, constantly expanding their range of drinking chocolates, the size of their business premises, and producing their first chocolate bar and Easter eggs in the 1870s.          Easter eggs were first produced in the UK in 1875. Here a group of factory workers are pictured putting the finishing touches to beautifully-crafted chocolate eggs complete with edible spring flowers on the top \u0027By 1879, the factory in Bridge Street was deemed unsuitable, and not just because of its small size,\u0027 explained Ms Wordsworth.\u0027The location of the factory also caused the brothers some discomfort. As committed Quakers and members of the Society of Friends, they believed in providing a workplace in pleasant surroundings away from the dirt, grime and overcrowding of what had now become a small city.\u0027Enter the new premises at Bournville - a town that didn\u0027t even exist until the Cadburys moved their chocolate factory there.\u0027And it wasn\u0027t just a factory - it became a way of life, with green fields, habitable housing and good working conditions.\u0027Very good working conditions that any company today would be proud of.\u0027          A Bournville Cocoa cart pulled by two horses is pictured riding through the streets of Birmingham in 1915           Happy 100 years: The sheer number of staff employed at the Bournville Cadbury\u0027s plant is made clear in this picture from 1931. The congregation was organised to celebrate 100 years since the opening of the factory Alongside semi-detached cottages with gardens for the workers, there was a field next to the factory where men and could play cricket and football a garden and playground for the girls and proper welfare provisions.Over the years, sports facilities grew to include hockey, tennis, squash and bowling facilities.Eventually, swimming pools were built with everyone in Bournville taught how to swim.Staff days out were common, and for workers living outside of Bournville, Cadbury\u0027s negotiated reduced train fares with the local railway company. Education was made available for everyone and the company actively encouraged vocations outside of their business interest.A place of virtuous living, no pub was allowed in Bournville, a rule which still applies today.          The Cadbury family worked tirelessly to ensure slavery was abolished and that their workers farming cocoa abroad were paid. Here a group of cocoa farmers are pictured showing off their haul before it was shipped to the UK by boat Nowadays, Bournville is made up of 7,800 homes on 1,000 acres of land with 10 per cent of the space dedicated to parks and open spaces. It remains a popular residential area of Birmingham.In 2009, the American food company Kraft Foods launched a hostile takeover bid that was initially resisted by the board at Cadbury\u0027s.Despite protestations, the American company won their bid. Although initially promising that British factories would be kept open, Kraft closed the Somerdale factory in Bristol (formerly owned by Fry\u0027s) in 2011.Following its successful takeover Kraft named the spin-off company Mondelz International in 2012. In 2016, Mondelz came under fire for not keeping its promise to continue making chocolate at Bournville. Instead, it moved some of its manufacturing to Poland.But following a £75 million investment in the Birmingham plant, it looks as though they have made a new promise to return Cadbury\u0027s Dairy Milk to the UK.In 2018, Cadbury Dairy Milk was crowned as Britain\u0027s favourite chocolate bar, proving the confectionery\u0027s lasting appeal.            The man behind the chocolate: John Cadbury who founded Cadbury\u0027s in 1824 is pictured in a black and white portrait.

Forces loyal to Italy\u0027s hardline Interior Minister Matteo Salvini and far-right French politician Marine Le Pen (pictured) will make gains, according to an analysis of national opinion polls put together by the parliamentAnd, with the Socialists and Democrats as the second force, the traditional parties of the centre will remain the largest in the new parliament.The survey forecast that the EPP will lose 34 seats and the Socialists 51 seats but retain 183 seats and 135 seats respectively.The new parliament will have 705 seats, down from the current 751 because of Britain\u0027s scheduled exit from the 28-nation bloc.The liberal group ALDE will move from fourth to third place with a projected 75 seats, compared to 68 today.ALDE will displace the European Conservatives and Reformist (ECR) Group, which will see its share decline from 75 to 51 seats, with the departure of Britain\u0027s pro-Brexit Conservatives. Poland\u0027s eurosceptic Law and Justice (PiS) Party also belongs to the ECR. The liberal group could even - according to the survey - increase its representation to 93 seats if it is joined, whether formally or in an alliance, by French President Emmanuel Macron\u0027s Republic on the Move (LREM) party.LREM\u0027s expected gains will however come at the expense of established centrist parties, not Pen\u0027s National Rally (NR), which the poll average shows will strengthen its position and win 21 seats.The NR belongs to the Europe of Nations and Freedom (ENF) group, which could rise from 37 to 59 seats with help from Salvini\u0027s League, which is sceptical of Brussels but not outright opposed to Italy\u0027s EU membership.The League, which counts only six seats in the current parliament, are projected to win 27.Overall, eurosceptic and populist forces will represent more than a fifth of the new parliament if the ENF and ECR results are added to those of the EFD, which includes the League\u0027s coalition partner, the Five Star Movement.But these gains are comparable to their current representation.\u0027Contrary to what some have said, the extremes, the nationalists and the populists are far from attaining a majority,\u0027 analyst Christine Verger told AFP.\u0027Even if they increase a little in numbers, this will not fundamentally shake up the internal balance,\u0027 said the analyst from the Jacques Delors Institute.Gains by such groups in smaller EU countries have had little impact at the European level, she added.Corinna Horst of the German Marshall Fund think tank said she would not put \u0027too much weight\u0027 on polling results, especially this early.The issue, Horst said, is less about populist gains than about the fragmentation of the European Parliament and EU Council summits gathering leaders of the member countries.\u0027The bigger question is how the EU will govern amidst this fragmentation,\u0027 Horst said in an email to AFP.In one example, the EU is split over how to share responsibility for asylum seekers, which has fuelled the rise of populist parties in Italy and other countries.The EU remains deadlocked even though migrant arrivals have fallen sharply since a 2015 peak.   "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a3a97141fb6efaa80918a04a8b3d1a5d6366677/306_496_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec2ae9fc9e7b1a0dfefb8ffa3d855293","title":"marina abramovic the life review serpentine gallery london","story":"Serpentine gallery, LondonWhy would anyone want to watch a hologram of the famous performance artist doing nothing? Abramović’s much vaunted show is tedious and tritePeople are standing around with hi-tech devices strapped to their heads. I am one of them. Through the lenses that protrude from my face, I can see how daft my fellow audience members look. We’re like a bunch of drunks playing that game where you have a word stuck to your forehead. This is Mixed Reality, which lets you see a virtual image within a real physical space. In the middle of the gallery stands the world-famous performance artist Marina Abramović, wearing a bright red dress with her dark hair tied back. She paces a bit. She holds out an arm and stares at it as if mystified. Then she dissolves in a cloud of blue dots.Abramović, you see, is present only in digital form. She has been filmed by 36 cameras to create a mobile simulation of herself. This virtual animated sculpture seems to walk on the actual floor of the gallery. At times she vanishes, leaving just her shadow to move around the room, creeping towards audience members.And that’s about it. At the press view, Abramović (the real one) explained how difficult Mixed Reality had been to make, how this 19-minute artwork had been forged at the whitehot edge of new technology. The most generous thing to say is that her passion for experiment has led her to use tech that isn’t yet capable of serious art – that this is a modest essay in what may work for artists one day.Yet nothing here suggests modesty. The Life is presented as a wonder, a redemptive encounter. Before entering and being fitted with a headset by a white-coated attendant, you have to surrender “all your belongings”. Why all? It can’t be for security or safety. On the contrary, it is a step in a ritual: like a pilgrim who wishes to enter the inner sanctum, you must be prepared, cleansed, purged. Only then may you enter the Electric Presence.Abramović had a great-uncle who was patriarch of the Serbian Orthodox church and her performance art has always been quasi-religious. Throwing herself into a flaming star, losing consciousness, being potentially assaulted by her audience – the extreme performances that made her name in the 1970s were Joan of Arc-like martyrdoms.The Life, too, is a sacral rite. As we stand about in our headsets, we seem to experience a spiritual vision. This is not the fleshly Abramović. It is her angelic, resurrected self. That’s why she is able to vanish and reappear, step in and out of our reality. She’s like the risen Christ, or Gandalf the White, or Tupac when he came back as a hologram.The Tupac analogy is best, because this is celebrity art at its most empty, a piece of nonsense that takes the gallery into bathetic realms of pop-culture kitsch. The only reason to be thrilled by this digital Abramović is that you adore the real Abramović as a star. The work itself is too slight to hold the attention. I naively deduced from the title that Abramović‘s immaterial presence would tell her life story, that we’d get a confessional encounter of some kind. Yet she does not speak or engage in any way with the audience.Everything Abramović is loved for is lacking. She is renowned for relating to her audience directly and uneasily, looking them in the eye. With her digital version, looking at her own hands is about as intense as it gets. Nor is there any sense of danger. Nothing is going to happen to the simulacrum Abramović, nor is anyone in the audience going to be challenged.I’ve only experienced events this vacuous at really bad concerts, when you’re miles from a band watching them on screen as they perform mechanical versions of their hits. I kept watching it over again, waiting for some emotional or intellectual depth to materialise. Instead, the optical illusion got less and less convincing and the headset heavier. My eyes began to ache as Abramović’s dress melted in red blotches. There is no intimacy or human presence. This is a robotic perversion of performance art."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b468efff2be44970291deccdf09b459e4a31997d/0_187_5710_3428/master/5710.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dec50db8185a5ece3e192bbb694442a8","title":"black panthers photo gallery 1960s san francisco art institute","story":"An exhibition at the San Francisco Art Institute takes a new look at Pirkle Jones and Ruth-Marion Baruch’s controversial 1968 photo essay, which sought to enhance public understanding of the Black Panthers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e4338b4782e861fcd6c062cedb57350576947a7/24_40_4002_2401/master/4002.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba32e840bf4077654d84805d2b9b51f9","title":"success of vegan sausage roll gives greggs surge in sales","story":"Bakery chain upgrades profit expectations for third time in three monthsGreggs has credited the fanfare of publicity around its vegan sausage rolls for a surge in sales that has sent the value of the company to an all-time high.The Quorn-filled vegan alternative to the traditional meat pastry – which was developed after 20,000 people signed an online petition organised by animal welfare group Peta that called on the baker to produce a vegan version of its bestselling item – went on sale on 3 January. It had taken more than a year to perfect and its launch coincided with Veganuary, a growing movement that encourages people to try plant-based diets during January.Not everyone welcomed the new vegan snack. The Good Morning Britain presenter Piers Morgan was not a fan, tweeting: “Nobody was waiting for a vegan bloody sausage, you PC-ravaged clowns”. Greggs PR department, however, had a swift response, replying: “Oh hello Piers, we’ve been expecting you.”It said the rate of growth had eased slightly in February but was still likely to mean profits this year would be higher than previously expected.Last month, Greggs said it had been struggling to keep up with demand for the £1 vegan rolls after selling hundreds of thousands in the first week.Tuesday’s trading update was the third time in three months that Greggs has told the City that its profits would be higher than anticipated. At the same time, the company announced it was upgrading pre-tax profit expectations. It said it expected to make an annual profit of at least £88m for 2018, having already updated its guidance in November, when it said profits would be at least £86m.An upgrade last month was the result of bumper sales of its festive bakes and mince pies, as well as its hot drinks and breakfast range.Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “The new vegan sausage roll has helped bring home the bacon for Greggs, prompting a spike in sales at the start of this year.“It’s unclear how much of the boom can be attributed to sales of actual vegan rolls rather than simply the publicity associated with the launch. However, catering for vegan diets is now rising up the priority list for many food retailers, with M\u0026ampS recently launching its new vegan range, Plant Kitchen.“This isn’t just a flash in the pan for Greggs either it builds on strong performance last year and demonstrates it is still possible for bricks-and-mortar retailers to earn a crust on the UK high street.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ead1d6402c2c9a2f09172b58fdcb7e44dce780a/0_291_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2310d79c97a4ee229f98f394324b22bd","title":"did you work for a uk high street chain that has closed","story":"For an upcoming project, we would like to hear from former workers of chain shops that shut about how it affected their livesWith thousands of high street shops closing over the last decade, communities have been rightly concerned about the decline and what the future holds.If you worked for a high street chain that shut down, we’d like to hear from you.

He is unable to walk, although at regular intervals he is able to throw up some of the bottle of rum he has just drunk.The St John Ambulance team here in Newcastle see dozens of these men and women every night: a head laceration on a rough sleeper, a student who thinks she broke a tooth when a friend accidentally closed a door on her, a German couple concerned about a man tottering precariously close to the edge of the High Level Bridge.The common denominator? Alcohol, and in due course the patients are walked 20 yards to a second van nearby that has been converted to take eight seats, and has sick bowls and wet wipes. Under the supervision of two police officers the patients are given time to sober up, charge their phones, contact friends or family, and get taxis home.One of the officers has worked the city centre beat for 16 years. “Babysitting drunk kids didn’t used to be our job,” he says. “But the focus these days is on people’s safety.”Some surveys suggest a recent trend towards more moderate drinking among younger people, but on tonight’s evidence, there are still plenty who enjoy a drink. The crew will assess and treat more than 50 people by sunrise.“There are drinkers who know they’ve had enough, those who don’t, and those who do but carry on,” says Daryen Lemmon, clinical operations manager of the North East Ambulance Service, which runs the Safe Haven in partnership with St John and the Northumbria police and crime commissioner.“They’re the dangerous ones, and the challenge is to make them understand that they are vulnerable.”The Safe Haven is designed to help tackle that challenge, relieving pressure on Newcastle’s stretched police and hospital resources. Five years ago, before it was introduced, A\u0026ampE waiting rooms and police station receptions were stuffed on weekend nights. Similar safe havens are in operation in Bristol and Cardiff. In December, NHS England made £300,000 available for other cities to set up similar facilities over the festive period.But along the so-called Diamond Strip of Newcastle nightclubs, there is still plenty to keep police patrol cars, ambulances and street pastors busy as they rub shoulders with pushy promoters promising three trebles – three triple-shots of spirits, such as vodka or rum, with a mixer like Red Bull or orange – for little more than a fiver.Post-industrial cities such as Newcastle, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester and Nottingham dominate the latest Which? University rankings of best cities for nightlife. They have some of the highest densities of pubs and bars per sq km, and the most recent Public Health England figures suggest those densities are increasing every year – and much faster than the national average.Serving a regional population of around 2 million, Newcastle’s compact city centre offers a rowdy but representative sample on a Saturday night: all ages, men and women, but skewed heavily in favour of the 50,000 students who study here. These younger revellers seek entry between the red velvet ropes erected by pre-bars and clubs with exotic names like Tup Tup Palace, Florita’s and Bijoux. A more affluent set of locals head for the gin bars and microbreweries of Grey Street and High Bridge. Older drinkers settle in for the night in the traditional pubs of the Bigg Market.These pubs, bars and nightclubs are the engine of the night-time economy, on which Britain’s struggling post-industrial cities and towns are becoming ever more dependent. In many ways it is itself a hangover from the past: the great industrial cities of 19th-century Britain were saturated with beer houses, gin palaces and pubs, and in Newcastle drinking patterns formed around the working lives of shipbuilders and coal miners who finished their last shifts at 1pm on a Saturday, then went to the pub and drank away their wages until closing time.Now, with heavy industry gone, these cities are left with their reputation as party towns. Newcastle city council estimates its night-time economy accounts for 7,000 jobs, £500m of revenue and 17 million visitors a year – more than a few of them on stag or hen parties. “As proud Geordies, we sure know how to party in style,” boasts the local bar crawl organiser Last Night of Freedom. “If you’re visiting the city and you’re looking for a canny night out – slap on your false tan, prepare to tash on and get propa mortal.”Protecting this reputation comes at a high price. You hardly need a Lancet subscription to know the links between alcohol and a slew of health and social problems: heart disease, liver disease, brain damage, cancer, mental health problems, accidents, injuries, assaults, domestic violence and sexual offences, to name a few.The alcohol-related mortality rate in Newcastle has risen in the last five years from 48 to 61 per 100,000 people. The English average is 46. Rachael Hope, the city’s community safety specialist for drugs and alcohol, says she knows of 4,066 dependent drinkers in Newcastle, including 180 she describes as having multiple issues of substance abuse or mental health. “They’re the ‘frequent flyers’ who come in and out of various different services,” she says, “but you don’t necessarily see alcohol problems present themselves in the same way as you would see a drug issue – until possibly it’s too late.”Newcastle has done more than most to constrain what economists would call these “externalities”: side effects of a product that have a negative impact on society as a whole but aren’t reflected in its price.Now keen to shed the image it gained as a stag and hen party destination of alcoholic excess – amplified to the world through the MTV reality show Geordie Shore – the city introduced a new licensing strategy last year that seeks to prove its night-time economy is about more than just alcohol. In neighbourhoods with the most licensed premises, the council is encouraging operators to move towards a more mixed offer: more restaurants, more bars with seating, more family-oriented attractions.Bars along the city’s Georgian Grey Street have accepted a voluntary minimum unit pricing of 50p. Newcastle is one of just eight cities and local authorities to introduce a late-night levy: 243 licensed premises pay into a fund that pays for the extra policing, taxi marshals and after-hours cleaning incurred by the night-time economy.On the top floor of the Newcastle Civic Centre, a half-hour walk from the Diamond Strip, Ed Foster heads up the city’s public safety and regulation team. “We want to support business and growth in the city, but we want to shape what goes where,” he says. “By having the right planning and licensing policies, we can help business fit in with what our vision is of the future of the city.”Police, meanwhile, have been working with bar and club staff, training them to take better care of drunk and vulnerable people following a series of tragic incidents: in 2012, a drunk 17-year-old schoolgirl was raped by at least two men after being thrown out of Digital nightclub in 2016, the death of an 18-year-old student at Hoults Yard revealed a shortage of qualified first-aiders on the premises.That same year, a 20-year-old Newcastle University student died from excessive alcohol during an Agric Society initiation ceremony. The school and other universities in the city have since intervened, encouraging freshers’ week organisers to plan as many “grub crawls” as pub crawls. Meanwhile, a drugs bust and forced closure of three adjoining late-night bars on the Diamond Strip in 2017 has led to clampdowns on club-night promoters, who could soon become licensed and regulated in the same way as bouncers and door staff.“Police budgets have shrunk, so I’ve got to work differently,” says Ch Insp Dave Pickett, who is responsible for Newcastle city centre. “One of my sons is 13 now, so in the not-too-distant future he’ll be wanting to go out with his friends and I want to know he’ll be looked after, not left abandoned on a night out.”The city of Liverpool reckons its economic cost from misuse of alcohol at around £750m a year. In January this year it opened a Centre for Alcohol Research, but it faces the same dilemma as Newcastle and others seeking to reduce harm from alcohol: how to regenerate city centres without it? Central government funding to Newcastle will have fallen by £282m in the 10 years to 2020. Licensed premises are some of the city’s most successful remaining businesses.The rules are skewed towards the interests of Big Alcohol, says Colin Shevills, director of the north-east campaign group Balance.Indeed, more than nine out of 10 applications for licences – many of them for high-volume “vertical-drinking” bars – are being approved, even in “cumulative impact zones”, areas that cities have already identified as saturated. In Newcastle the number of licensed premises continues to rise, not fall, from 1,165 in 2013 to 1,197 now. Each pays as much as £1,000 for a licence. To a cash-strapped city, alcohol is a much-needed source of revenue.The extended drinking hours introduced by the Licensing Act were aimed at bringing  “continental”-style café culture to England: according to a slogan of the time, “Bologna in Birmingham, Madrid in Manchester, why not?”A decade later, the government devolved responsibility for drugs and alcohol treatment services to local authorities, leaving cities to pick up the bill. Subsequent austerity cuts meant places like Newcastle could no longer afford to pay for dedicated alcohol services, which are now merged with drugs treatment services. At least 41 English hospitals do not currently have an alcohol care team.The government’s toothless approach to alcohol contrasts with its aggressive targeting of Big Tobacco, which has seen it restrict the sales of cigarettes and all but banish advertising. That would be tricky to do with booze. Much of the night-time economy is run by the alcohol industry. Night-time mayors typically have backgrounds in nightclubs or licensed premises: in London, for example, the current chair of the Night Time Commission, Kate Nicholls, is also the CEO of UK Hospitality her vice chair is a director of the Drinkaware Trust, which is funded largely by donations from UK alcohol producers, retailers and supermarkets.Restricting advertising is another option. In the US, several cities already ban alcohol ads on public transport, including New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco. “History has shown us is that when restrictions and bans were placed on tobacco sponsorship, other companies come in and fill the advertising void,” says Shevills.But the alcohol industry, like Big Tobacco before it, is resilient and resourceful, and unlikely to give up control of cities without a fight. Lobbying in Chicago, Charlotte and Washington DC, for example, has recently overturned bans on alcohol advertising on public transit.Likewise, in another Newcastle – the one in New South Wales, Australia – “lockout” laws that have halved alcohol-related assaults are under constant attack. Local activist Tony Brown says the city centre used to be a no-go zone at night, held hostage by the “three Vs: violence, vandalism and vomit”.And yet New South Wales’s Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority is under sustained lobbying to roll back the changes, in spite of evidence of what can happen when licensing hours are relaxed.“We had this whole narrative going on, which is common internationally, that the blame was all about the young people themselves. It really pissed me off from a social equity view,” says Brown. “No one was ever talking about political responsibility or the industry’s responsibility. This is a dominant mono-narrative about blaming young people.“Our cities must disentangle themselves from the industry and escape from the notion that the unfettered availability and supply of alcohol is a prerequisite for the development and sustainability of the night-time economy. Our city has proven otherwise.”For the rest, as any addict knows, the first step to recovery is admitting they have a problem.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/226cce70224830a5b011f0261f3e7622f93786e4/0_72_5183_3109/master/5183.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29b519401984241df34bc953fa487b9f","title":"angela smith left labour funny tinge mp racism","story":"On Monday, seven Labour MPs resigned the whip to sit as the Independent Group in the House of Commons, and the slide of British politics into the surreal continued apace. Immediately after citing the antisemitism crisis as one of her reasons for quitting the Labour party, Angela Smith joined me in the BBC Politics Live studio and when sharing her thoughts on the nature of racism said “it’s not just about being black or a funny tinge … you know, different - B, err from the BME community”. Whoever had “new splinter group embroiled in racist scandal after three hours of existence” in the parliamentary sweepstakes, please collect your tenner from reception.Neither of these things excuse Smith’s comments. Offering a politician’s non-apology that accepts everything but responsibility isn’t the same as accountability. Framing the comment as having “misspoken” treats racism like it’s some involuntary reflex. Someone speaking light-heartedly about their loved one, based on years of shared experience and affection, is not the same as an MP referring to BME people as having a “funny tinge” while gesturing at the only person of colour on a current affairs panel. The latter, besides being buttock-clenchingly gauche, positions people of colour as being inherently abnormal. It suggests that melanin is somehow a stain or an aberration. And if you want to make that joke, at least have the decency to marry my mum first.It seems that prompting racist brain glitches in British elected representatives is my superpower: it was only a fortnight ago that Nadine Dorries, the Conservative MP for Mid Bedfordshire, mixed me up with another brown woman with infinitely better bone structure. After Dorries apologised to, err, Newsbeat for “any offence” she may have caused, the story was promptly forgotten. While it takes a lot more to offend me on a personal level (I went to an all-girls school, the banter was brutal), both these incidents demonstrate a deep problem with how the political establishment, and the media culture at large, react to the mere existence of people of tinge.On Newsnight, one of the Splinter Seven, Chris Leslie, quickly brushed over his colleague’s comments when asked about them by Kirsty Wark. Despite the clip of Smith’s flub having garnered over a million views on Twitter, it wasn’t featured on Channel 4 News, BBC News at 10 or this morning’s Today programme. It would be utterly unthinkable that a Labour member, let alone an MP, would have been forgiven so quickly for a similar statement at the height of the summer’s antisemitism crisis. The Independent Group, justifiably, have excoriated their former party for the pace and ineffectiveness of its disciplinary procedures. But as they’ve not officially launched a party of their own, they’ve managed to skilfully evade any such criticism of their own internal workings. How would I make a complaint about Angela Smith’s comments? What kind of disciplinary procedure would she face? Have these MPs signed up to a working definition of racism? And when will the establishment media confront the Independent Group over its institutional racism problem?Angela Smith’s Politics Live appearance exposed a lot more than her own personal squeamishness when it comes to issues of race: it revealed the double standard in political media when it comes to identifying racism on the left, and accountability elsewhere. This isn’t the new politics that the Independent Group promised at their launch – but the same old cycle of racism, rinse, repeat that people of tinge have had to deal with for decades.• Ash Sarkar is a senior editor at Novara Media, and lectures in political theory at the Sandberg Instituut"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30ff37bb43d6a511f0ce2f6ef1ec910ba4f8431b/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6e03963d541e755efcb2d9cbbae3c69","title":"bernie sanders 2020 election democrats","story":"Without Sanders’ campaign, we would never have had Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez or mainstream support for Medicare-for-AllIt’s official: Bernie Sanders announced today that he’s going to run for president and lay the groundwork for transforming the economic and political life of this country. His decision comes not a moment too soon.After all, if you think things are bad now, imagine if Bernie Sanders hadn’t run for president in 2016. Imagine if Hillary Clinton had swept the primaries that year, easily parrying Martin O’Malley’s feeble blows and a few charming Lincoln Chafee debate performances. Trump would have still beaten Clinton, but his charlatan, rightwing populism would have been the only outlet for those angry at the status quo. More than anything else, dejection would reign among voters. The Democrats would have heightened their focus on winning over “respectable” anti-Trump Republicans in the suburbs, with depoliticized calls to “fix” Obamacare, find “realistic solutions” to climate change, and make higher education “accessible”.Forget Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: in the early days of 2019 this would be the party of Michael Bloomberg. No surprise, in this scenario, that Trump would be polling narrowly ahead of all his contenders, the billionaire Michael Bloomberg included.But Bernie did run in 2016 – and not just for a single campaign, but something far greater. Sanders reintroduced working-class politics in the US. It was a style based on a simple message: you work hard, we’re going to get you the dignity and security you deserve, and we’re going to fight the millionaires and billionaires standing in the way. It was a politics, in other words, that created a common narrative of struggle in which the protagonists were those trying to get by in an unfair and unequal country.Sanders expertly communicated this message, by being as clear, direct, and honest as possible. His stump speeches used an even more limited vocabulary than Trump’s. His lines were so predictable that crowds would finish his sentences. In May 2015, he said: “This campaign is not about Bernie Sanders ... This campaign is about the needs of the American people, and the ideas and proposals that effectively address those needs,” and what endured from his campaign were precisely those ideas and proposals.Bernie Sanders talked about the need for a Green New Deal, for Medicare-for-All (now supported by a sizable majority of Americans), for tuition-free higher education, for a jobs guarantee – all now part of the mainstream debate. Most importantly, as a democratic socialist he banded these policies together in a political framework, a way of understanding the challenges facing working people and possible solutions. Sanders also encouraged his supporters by the thousands to run for elected office. Alexandria-Ocasio Cortez and Rashida Tlaib are among those who answered the call, building off Bernie’s program and reaching new audiences.Before 2016, who could forget that the Democratic party was dominated by charter-school supporting politicians and anti-public-sector-union types like Cory Booker and Rahm Emanuel? Now 2020 candidates who were silent during the 2012 Chicago teachers’ strike are keen to show their solidarity with Los Angeles educators. It might not yet be the political revolution Sanders was calling for, but it’s testament to his influence.The spirit of 2016 may not last forever, and it’s vital that we use the coming presidential campaign to do battle with the country’s powerful economic and political establishment. We’ll have to wait until 2024 for AOC to be eligible – for now Bernie Sanders is the only one capable of reaching millions of working Americans with the message that politics can indeed improve their lives. And not only can he continue to lay the groundwork for a left opposition to Trumpism: Bernie can actually win this time around.Sanders lost the 2016 primary because of early Super Tuesday setbacks, particularly among black American voters. The problem wasn’t that he talked too much about class or inequality – in fact, many African American voters had similar economic views to Sanders – but rather that he wasn’t seen as credible candidate. Not enough people knew who he was, and for those who stood to lose the most from a Trump presidency, Clinton seemed like the safer bet. That’s not to mention her deep roots in the network of civic organizations and political leaders that drive turnout in southern primaries. By the time he was more established in 2016, in states like Michigan and Illinois, Sanders fared much better among black voters.Today, Sanders is viewed favorably among most Americans, even more so among black voters than white ones, and is among the best known political figures on Earth. The once obscure junior senator from Vermont has come a long way. If Joe Biden doesn’t run, Sanders seems to be the favorite at the start of this campaign cycle – polls even show him ahead of Elizabeth Warren in her home state of Massachusetts.His campaign infrastructure going into the primaries is also unrivaled. Sanders received the most inidual campaign contributions in history – his March 2016 FEC filing alone, in a month when he received $77m in donations from those giving less than $200, was 188,613 pages long. With far more expertise and extensive email lists, Sanders won’t be starting from scratch this time around.The young people that gave Sanders more primary votes than Clinton and Trump combined in 2016 are also primed to come out again for him. Where’s the comparable group of dedicated canvassers and social media partisans ready to back Biden?Democrats can’t call him kooky and radical this time around. More and more Democrats, including those who are courting Wall Street, are playing lip service to progressive demands such as a $15 minimum wage and Medicare-for-All. They can’t do that and dismiss Sanders at the same time. Nor can some of the prospective Democratic candidates grumble about his age. Sanders will be 79 on Inauguration Day, but he’s in great health and Biden himself would be 78, Warren 71.I’ve been wrong about this once before, but I’d bet that whoever the Democratic nominee is in 2020, they’ll be able to defeat Trump. That’s all the more reason to go with the most viable progressive candidate – someone committed to change and with the knowledge and willingness to do battle with the big business interests that want to hear none of it.Near the end of his campaign in 2016, in a speech in Burlington, Sanders looked to the future: “My hope is that when future historians look back and describe how our country moved forward into reversing the drift toward oligarchy, and created a government which represents all the people and not just the few, they will note that, to a significant degree, that effort began with the political revolution of 2016.”With the start of his 2020 bid – and with the exciting emergence of a new generation of politicians and activists who share his vision – there are more reasons than ever to believe him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf30b55e9f36c71057468386a46df2b22630290f/0_61_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a2d2f03651597f3c6dd7aa1b14c7535","title":"brexit racism independent group gang of seven","story":"A hot mic moment, a racism scandal, ruling out people’s votes: the ‘gang of seven’ are already a proper party!At the end of John Steinbeck’s novel Of Mice and Men, one of the two main characters, Lennie, has got himself into big trouble. Rather than tell him that there’s no way out, his friend George describes once again how they’re going to live on a beautiful ranch and tend rabbits, before shooting Lennie in the back of the head. Which is about where we are right now as a country.The government that promised Brexit would improve our lives now count it as a major success that they’ve stockpiled enough body bags for everyone. Car manufacturers are fleeing the country faster than a billionaire Brexiteer in pursuit of a tax break, and in the event of no deal, fresh food might become more scarce than accuracy in a Daniel Kawczynski tweet.At this point the main thing we’ll be using our blue passports for is to go visit tomatoes or jobs.Right now we need the heroes more than ever to fight the bad guys, which is why Labour have chosen this very moment to land a killing blow on the Tories start vigorously punching themselves in the testicles. It’s as if, at the end of Avengers Endgame just when it looks like all hope is lost and Thanos can’t be defeated, Iron Man swoops in at the last second and starts twatting Thor.The press conference announcing the new party started off OK, if you ignore the sound of a reporter muttering “between this and Brexit we’re actually fucked” off mic. But let’s face it, at this stage most people would have a hard time noticing the words “we’re actually fucked” wasn’t their own internal monologue.Angela Smith, one of the seven “splitters” gave a speech in which she said that she didn’t think any of the major political parties were fit for power and cited antisemitic racism as one of the reasons she left Labour. It was good. Luciana Berger also made a solid, heartfelt speech. Things were back on track.Now what the new non-racist party in town needs is celebrity endorsements, which they soon got when Katie Hopkins briefly stopped frothing at the mouth in order to praise Chuka Umunna.“So far so good,” they probably thought to themselves. “As long as nobody goes on national TV and does a racism then everything is fine. Oh. Oh no. Oh no, no, no.”Because just two hours after launching the new non-racist political grouping, Angela Smith, one seventh of everyone’s new favourite non-racist political grouping, went on live TV and appeared to refer to people from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds as having a “funny tinge”.I know you think it’s bad, but look at it this way: after one morning they’d already chalked up their first racism scandal – just like a real mainstream party. Angela even apologised for “any offence caused” rather than the remark itself: proper, statesmanlike, frontbench stuff.It wasn’t long before the smears began emanating from outside of the group, too. Corbyn-supporting Skwawkbox, well known for crying “conspiracy” when there isn’t one, surprised everybody by yelling “conspiracy” when there wasn’t one. They did some digging and found that the “new” website was actually registered in 2015. A “fact” they discovered by misreading the date.The day almost over, the new party’s MPs responded to calls from Labour’s John McDonnell to stand for re-election in their constituencies by refusing to do so.“They said we wouldn’t be a major force in British politics,” they probably thought to themselves. “But here we are on day one and we’ve got a racism scandal under our belt and have already ruled out a people’s vote. Just like the big boys.”Nor did the Independent Group rule out MPs accused of sexual harassment being allowed to join. Less than 12 hours after launch, then, and they’ve already made it clear they’re an incompetent bunch of catastrophes that most of the population would feel extremely conflicted about voting for.In other words, they bear all the hallmarks of a mainstream political movement – in their own terms, at least, a resounding success.As far as political launches go, my only major concern is that they may have peaked too soon. Or that the fear of being seen as institutionally racist will mean it’s only a matter of time until the splitters split.On the other hand, it has been a tough few days for anyone who is vaguely interested in the prospect of not having a sociopathic group of Tories rule the country until the end of time itself.To cap it all, like a toddler who craps its pants to distract from the fact it has wet itself, the Labour party chose this moment to let it slip that Derek Hatton is back in the party.People on the left are now spoilt for choice. We can either vote for a party beset by racism accusations of racism who look like they won’t get into power (you Corbyn cultist!) or a party beset by racism accusations who definitely won’t get in power (you Blairite melt!).Meanwhile the Tories probably spent the day stockpiling something sinister like orphanages or double-decker coffins. We were too busy watching the only viable alternative attacking the real enemy – fellow lefties.• James Felton is a TV and radio comedy writer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42419a66a8c14d795f1fbb8881337095b7cb8d66/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35cf7b3502cc9efd558ae1a866cffb03","title":"poll labour tory mps independent group","story":"For a party that doesn’t actually exist yet, the movement born from the wreckage of what was once the Labour mainstream seems surprisingly popular.The first poll to test the water since seven MPs abandoned Jeremy Corbyn shows “a new centrist party against Brexit” in third place behind Labour and the Tories – and already beating the old centrist party against Brexit, otherwise known as the Liberal Democrats. Or to put it another way, in 24 hours it’s achieved the kind of market share that Ukip took decades to get near.But it is still only an idea. It has no leader, no policies, nothing to actively deter voters all it promises is essentially what Nick Clegg promised at the 2010 election, which is not to be like those other guys. And we all know how that turned out once Clegg actually had to take decisions that ided his supporters. Survation’s poll is measuring understandable depths of anger at the sorry choices on offer, as Britain lurches deeper and deeper into crisis with no obvious means of extricating itself. But it can’t really say much that is meaningful about a movement that is, so far, little more than a blank slate on to which people can project what they like, and which may not even solidify into a formal party until months after we are due to leave the EU.Yet it isn’t entirely meaningless, because polling has the ability to encourager les autres. This new movement stands or falls on its ability to do what the SDP never achieved, and split more than one party, creating the space for a genuine realignment. To survive, the Independent Group needs Tories to join it, and the four or five Conservative MPs currently wobbling on the brink will be reading the runes very closely.For all the death threats they receive, and for all their very real fears of entryism by ex-Ukippers returning to the Conservative fold bearing grudges, Tory remainers don’t have quite the same viscerally emotional reasons for breaking with their party as their Labour counterparts. Nor do they have quite the same instinctive recoil from the very idea of their leader, for all that they despair of her handling of Brexit.Polling meanwhile shows the new entity is very appealing to Lib Dems, pretty appealing to Labour voters – which suggests those Labour members howling about treachery are nowhere near as in touch with their base as they like to think – and least appealing to Tory ones, probably because it’s pitched as an anti-Brexit party. Many Conservative voters will be highly sympathetic to the seven Labour renegades personally, sharing their view that the idea of Jeremy Corbyn becoming prime minister is intolerable. But that’s a big step from actually wanting to vote for their breakaway faction.For Tories who are heading for deselection anyway, however, the calculation isn’t necessarily whether they could take their old seats with them if they defected. It’s whether to wait for a better lifeboat from the disappearing middle ground of politics, or jump on board this potentially somewhat leaky one and hope it won’t become a laughing stock.It’s not reassuring that within hours of launching, one of the formerly Labour seven, Angela Smith, was having to apologise for seemingly describing people of colour as having a “funny tinge”. The timing isn’t ideal either for Tories who want to be absolutely certain there is no other way of avoiding a hard Brexit, and are hanging on to see how the next set of crucial Brexit votes turns out.But the polling suggests that a new centrist party needn’t be a completely embarrassing flop, despite the difficulties of breaking through in a first-past-the-post election that there is a receptive audience out there, at least for someone smart enough to preach to it without fluffing their words. The question now is how many Tories are feeling lucky."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a4644e95663e9e1e7f791d8acc7e010bc6d5727/0_373_5906_3543/master/5906.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c3f55641a18ebffe124ebbb8dc1570f","title":"the return of king rat derek hatton marks a new low for labour","story":"What with the vicious antisemitism row and a party split, it seemed things couldn’t get worse. Then look who turned upIn a single day, the Labour party has lost Luciana Berger and “gained” Derek Hatton. As swaps go, this isn’t dissimilar to giving someone an orgasm and them giving you gonorrhoea: the loss of a hard-working, campaigning constituency MP (Berger was among seven MPs to resign from Labour) and the official welcoming back, by a three-person panel, of a man so odious that he infamously delivered redundancy notices by taxi to his own council staff.To sum up Hatton in a brief vignette: at the 2016 Labour party conference in Liverpool, I was in a coffee shop searching for wifi, and hit on a hotspot someone had called “Derek Twatton”.Liverpudlians don’t even need to have been born during Hatton’s 80s tenure as deputy leader of Liverpool city council to know the havoc he wreaked on the city. As with stories of Beatlemania, Hillsborough, The Sun, and later Anthony Walker, Scousers pass their history on. But for those who don’t know who Hatton is: he was a member of the Trotskyist faction Militant Tendency, and became deputy council leader just five weeks before Margaret Thatcher’s 1983 landslide win (and Michael Foot’s disaster). The Labour council was the first majority one in a decade for the city.Hatton, who eclipsed the mild-mannered leader, John Hamilton, was right to be furious with central government grant cuts and underfunding of Liverpool during Thatcher’s “managed decline” of the city after the riots of 1981, and when changes in shipping practices – the rise in the use of containers in particular – were having a devastating impact on a proud port. Deprivation and unemployment were widespread. But Hatton’s response was to set an illegal budget – expenditure exceeding income – and to gamble that the government would make up the £30m overspend. Other councils also affected by central government grant cuts managed to set legal budgets.Opposite my former school, there used to be Harthill Gardens, known as the “Kew Gardens of the north”. When the gardeners were called out on strike, they rebelled, fearing the impact on the flora. In an act of political revenge, and a mark of his character, Hatton sacked the gardeners and bulldozed the gardens. A famous banner held aloft in protests against the council at the time read: “Hitler only destroyed half of our city. Hatton tried for the lot.”Militant’s grip on Liverpool came to an end with Neil Kinnock’s famous speech at Labour’s Bournemouth conference in 1985. Then party leader, Kinnock blasted Hatton’s running of the council as “grotesque chaos”. The NEC eventually voted 12 to six to expel Militant members. Hatton was put on trial on corruption charges, in response to Merseyside police’s brilliantly named Operation Cheetah, though he was eventually acquitted. Liverpool’s economy did not recover until the late 1990s.This is the man Labour has just readmitted to the party. A man who was literally cast as King Rat in a pantomime. In recent years, Hatton has even turned his hand to espousing ignorant ideas around rape cases, because he is committed to always becoming that bit worse.But it is perhaps most egregious that Berger’s heartfelt statement on antisemitism has been met with Hatton’s readmittance. Just a few years ago, Hatton tweeted about “Jews with any sense of humanity”. The intellectual vacuity of antisemites, unable to distinguish between Netanyahu’s government and past Israeli administrations and an entire group of historically oppressed people, or their right to a homeland, continues to take the breath away. It is a truly depressing thought, a morally vacant one.Stella Creasy has told Sky News that Hatton’s return “absolutely beggars belief. I’m not going to pretend otherwise”. Lucy Powell has said the “timing could not be worse”, while the former Welsh minister Alun Davies called the decision “appalling. I do not want to be in the same party as this man”. Neither do I.Whatever one thinks of the newly formed Independent Group – and it has always been my view that those who resign the whip, or cross the floor, should stand in byelections – Labour’s reaction is dreadful. Referring to himself in the third person Hatton told Radio 4 this morning: “I can assure you, Derek Hatton will not be the candidate for Wavertree,” referring to Berger’s constituency seat. But “Degsby”, the nickname he gave himself and had made into a numberplate (DE5SBY) is back espousing socialist values he disavowed. He’s sucking up to Jeremy Corbyn, though two years ago he wrote that he had “serious doubts about him”.In response to a query about how his new capitalist lifestyle aligned with his apparent socialist beliefs – Hatton once said: “My days in politics were a very long time ago and I lost interest in it after I was expelled from the city council.” The man doesn’t have an honest bone in his body. I hope someone writes him a note telling him where to stick it, and delivers it in a taxi.

When they were not recording they would make the short trip over the Albert Bridge to play football in Battersea Park.It was while living in Oakley Street that Marley and the Wailers finished recording Exodus, the album which featured Jamming and One Love.The historian David Olusoga, a trustee of English Heritage and blue plaques panel member, said he was particularly excited by the Marley plaque.Marley, he said, remained “one of the most loved and most listened to musicians of the 20th century.“He was one of the first superstars to come from a developing country. He is one of the most famous faces in the world, one of the most recognisable faces in the world, and he blazed a trail for other artists from developing countries.”Marley once said he regarded London as his second home and his stay provided provided much-needed stability after the horrific events of 1976, when politically motivated gunmen shot Marley, his wife Rita and his manager Don Taylor.Around 12 blue plaques are given out each year and English Heritage is conscious of needing to have more women and more people of colour commemorated.Chairman Sir Tim Laurence said: “We went through a long phase where unless you were white and male you had less chance of getting a blue plaque. We are trying to make the selection much more balanced and more erse.”All possible recipients have to have been dead for at least 20 years and be nominated by members of the public.On Tuesday a plaque for the film-maker and gay rights campaigner Derek Jarman was unveiled on the former warehouse near Tower Bridge that he lived in and used as a studio.Later this year Carter will be honoured at her former home in Clapham, and Gellhorn at the house in Cadogan Square she called home for 28 years.Bell, the archaeologist, adventurer and diplomat who played an important role in establishing the modern state of Iraq, will be marked at a house in Chelsea which English Heritage said was a family home and her London base for over 40 years.One possible blot on Bell’s reputation is her fervent opposition to women getting the vote. She was secretary of the northern branch of the National League for Opposing Woman Suffrage and was on its national executive committee.Olusoga said Bell was not the only blue plaque recipient to have elements of controversy, pointing to the first one, Lord Byron. “I don’t think it is the position of the committee to make judgments about people, we look at their achievements in the round.”Also getting blue plaques in 2019 will be Lilian Lindsay, the first woman to qualify as a dentist in Britain, and Sir John Wolfe Barry, the civil engineer whose greatest achievement was Tower Bridge.English Heritage also announced a £2.5m donation from Julia and Hans Rausing towards its project for a dramatic slate footbridge for visitors to get to Tintagel Castle in Cornwall. It is a contemporary replacement for the natural land bridge which collapsed in the 15th or 16th century and will save people the long stair climb from one side to the other."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cc926b12b1f0c74f8b1fce95bddcb46dc770309/0_150_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2969a6d69add0cbd0fc910d43df100b9","title":"im not spending money on that the rise of the teetotal student","story":"Universities are seeing an increase in teetotal clubs and alcohol-free accommodation. Why are students drinking less?Like most students heading off to university, Emily Proctor, 19, felt apprehensive. But it wasn’t just the thought of leaving her family and making new friends that caused her to be anxious Proctor was concerned about how she’d fit in as a teetotal student.“I was worried as I knew that much of university life involves going out drinking, especially in the first year,” explains Proctor, who is studying law at Swansea University. To help alleviate her concerns, she signed up for the university’s alcohol-free accommodation. “I didn’t want to be around people who were partying constantly and coming home drunk,” she says. “I wanted to be around similar people who I could chill with instead of going out every night.” Proctor, who doesn’t drink alcohol as it’s never appealed to her, says that decision has proven to be a wise choice. “It worked out well in the end as I have friends that I stay in with and we might play cards, or go to the cinema or out for meals.”Universities are keeping apace with this cultural shift. A growing number of institutions such as Swansea, St Andrews and the University of Aberdeen offer dedicated alcohol-free accommodation.Universities are trying to shake off the drinking culture that has been embedded within university life. Aberdeen University’s student association asks all of its societies and clubs to run at least one alcohol-free event during freshers week, while Bristol holds a number of alcohol-free events during welcome week and has increased the number of alcohol-free drinks available in its union bar.Changes in students’ drinking habits have driven the University of Hull to make a number of adjustments. “We know that many of our students drink less regularly than they did five to 10 years ago, and we have many students who do not drink for cultural or religious reasons,” says Osaro Otobo, president of Hull University union. “We have reduced our club nights from twice to just once a week.”Students are taking the matters into their own hands and establishing societies that don’t revolve around drinking. “Our socials involve meeting for a hot beverage and cake every Thursday,” says Maria Marr, 22, president of the Sober Socials Society at Newcastle University. “We started the society in 2017 with 20 members and have now more than doubled it to 57,” adds Marr, who is studying a master’s in professional translation for European languages. While not completely teetotal – she might have one glass of wine a month – she believes more students are emerging as non-drinkers. “People are realising that you don’t need to give into social pressure. Alcohol is one those things you’re supposed to do when you grow up but a lot of people don’t like the taste and think, ‘I’m not spending money on that.’”George Pitt, 19, a teetotal medicine student at the University of East Anglia, says that while there is undeniably a massive drinking culture at university, “alcohol is not the be-all and end-all of socialisation”. Pitt, who is a member of the UEA Societea, a club where drinkers and non-drinkers meet for tea, adds: “The reality is most people don’t care too much as long as you don’t lord yourself over them or try to change them, so it’s really easy.”For those staying off the booze at uni, Marr’s advice is to look for societies and events where there isn’t a big drinking culture and to be upfront about your habits. “Of course people will try to encourage you to drink. You will have to deal with that, but don’t feel bad for the fact you’re not doing the same as everyone else.”Proctor adds: “Sometimes it can be hard as quite a lot of people drink quite heavily, but I’ve still been able to meet friends through my accommodation, societies and my course. It’s definitely been easier than I thought.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4deffd78c9dd3e919bfb3ae651a44a12e96ce77/0_337_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc140b089059e60154638e4e6cf422e5","title":"new behaviour code schools guide headteachers","story":"A guide for headteachers in England aims to help them deal ethically with thorny issues like exclusions - and to confront colleagues who do notOne of the most enduring images of recent decades has been that of the superhead: the heroic, league-table topping, entrepreneurial lone-ranger figure, once compared by the former chief inspector of schools, Sir Michael Wilshaw, to a Clint Eastwood figure “fighting for righteousness”.But might the model of the next few decades be different – a less combative leader, driven as much by a vision of a good society as by competitive advantage?That is the profound wish of Carolyn Roberts, a longstanding headteacher and one of the architects of the Ethical Leadership Commission. The influential body, founded by headteachers, has been working for two years to come up with a common set of values to help school leaders navigate what they describe as an education “moral maze”, in which behaviour can be driven by a preoccupation with results.But why do we need to recalibrate school leadership to be more ethical? In many ways this is a troubling question to be asking on a damp February morning in the successful south London comprehensive Roberts has led for the past six years.Does the fact that we need to reinvigorate the moral purpose of education suggest that something has gone wrong with school leadership? Is it now unethical?Roberts, headteacher of Thomas Tallis school, a huge erse comprehensive sandwiched between Blackheath and Kidbrooke in the London borough of Greenwich, chooses her words carefully. “We now have so many different types of schools and we need to be certain there is enough that binds us together.”While Roberts is careful not to criticise fellow heads, the elephants in the room are hard to ignore: regular reports about some schools “off-rolling” – getting rid of challenging students cheating in exams “gaming” the curriculum by channelling students into easier subjects. And then there’s exorbitant headteacher pay, and even financial scams that verge on the criminal.Roberts knows headteachers are under intense pressure to keep improving results. She admits that in the past – she was head of two schools in the north-east before moving to London – she has faced “personal dilemmas” over issues such as the use of GCSE-equivalent qualifications that were promoted intensively to boost some schools’ league table positions.“It is really hard for people who are under pressure all the time,” she says. “Too many headteachers have found themselves compromised. The accountability measures say they have to achieve one thing and the local authority or academy trust says you have to do it quickly, therefore decision-making becomes harder and people take what they may view as shortcuts.“It is perfectly reasonable to make sure that a child gets a good set of examination results. But we can’t get away from the fact that schools are communities that ought to model what we value about society. What we are hearing is that headteachers want a language they can use to support them in that long-term nuanced work.”In an age where “robust” leadership and easily measured outcomes are highly valued, the commission could be accused of promoting a more “wishy-washy” definition of education.Michael Gove, the former education secretary, whose reforms still shape the lives of many schools, pioneered the idea of a slimmed-down inspection framework devoid of what he described as “peripherals” such as pupil wellbeing and community cohesion. His colleague Nick Gibb, who once described the idea of social and emotional learning as “ghastly”, remains as schools minister.But the Ethical Leadership Commission has high-level support from the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), which helped to set it up, the National Association of Head Teachers, the Church of England Education Office, the Headmasters and Headmistresses’ Conference, the Chartered College of Teaching and the National Governors’ Association. At the publication of its final report last month, it received a warm welcome from the interim National Schools Commissioner, Dominic Herrington.Geoff Barton, general secretary of ASCL and a former headteacher, is adamant that the current system is not unethical. “The vast majority of practice upholds the values articulated in this framework,” he says. “Our members felt it was time to identify and articulate the principles and values that are immutable in education leadership, and provide a supportive framework upon which school leaders can draw in making difficult decisions under great pressure.”A hundred schools are now trialling the framework and an ethics forum will meet several times a year to consider the sort of dilemmas leaders face, in the context of the Nolan principles – seven principles of public life: selflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty and leadership – to which the commission has added the personal characteristics of trust, wisdom, kindness, justice, service, courage and optimism.The chief inspector of schools, Amanda Spielman, is a member of the commission and Roberts believes proposed changes to the Ofsted framework – away from focusing on results and towards a broader definition of “quality of education” – reinforce the idea that change is coming.Far from being abstract, she argues, the commission’s “virtues and values” are intricately bound up in real-life dilemmas faced by heads, and marshalling them into a framework can give colleagues confidence and courage. “For example, it is about going down the road and looking a colleague in the eye and saying: ‘the way you do admissions or exclusions affects my school, and can we talk about this?’ That is quite a difficult thing to do, so courage is very important.“It is about heads feeling they can be honest with parents if there is a disappointing set of GCSE results. It is about ensuring that children see adults treating each other in a just, wise and kind way, modelling the sort of behaviour we would want to see in society,” says Roberts.She adds: “It is about supporting heads who want to take time to see both sides of the argument before making a reasoned judgment, or those who would prefer to support and be kind to a teacher who is under pressure in the hope of helping them through a difficult patch, rather than feeling that they are compromised because people expect them to be instant judges and zero-tolerant of failure.”Even the current debate about mobile phone use in school has an ethical dimension, she says, and should be seen in the broader context of how society and adults use electronic devices.Most urgently, though, she argues that the framework is needed because England is facing a chronic teacher recruitment and retention crisis and headteachers in their 50s are leaving the profession in record numbers, partly because of competitive pressures and leadership styles that were valued in the past. Wilshaw notoriously suggested that heads would know they were doing their job properly if “staff morale was at an all-time low”.“This had led to intolerable workload issues and it has made it harder for teachers to see themselves doing the job for 40 years,” says Roberts. “We are losing experience and wisdom from the system. But every interaction in school ought to build up a stable and happy community in which all children are valued and adults want to work. We need a clear idea of what schools are for and we need to take seriously our responsibility to the sorts of citizens we want for the future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e8607fbbc65f8451e1c3b82013217bccf1d229a/0_80_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c93b950a524786b84e897bcdd45028d","title":"dont feed monster the people who have stopped buying new clothes","story":"A growing movement eschews fast fashion in favour of secondhand clothing. Is this the biggest personal change that can be made for the environment?Lauren Cowdery is flicking through the rails of the Cancer Research charity shop in Goole, east Yorkshire. “Too bobbly!” she tuts at a ribbed top. “This skirt is big but it would be easy to take in … ” Cowdery appears to be shopping, but she is merely browsing. She is on a mission not to buy any new clothes, even ones that have recently belonged to someone else. “I think you have to pull back and ask: ‘Do I need this?’” she says.So how hard is it to make the transition to a more sustainable way of shopping? In the UK, clothing has the fourth largest environmental impact after housing, transport and food. More than half of fast-fashion items are thrown away in less than a year, according to McKinsey’s State of Fashion report last year. But is buying secondhand really an antidote to fast fashion?In Goole, where Cowdery works as a marketing officer for the Junction Theatre, there are ample local distractions for a lunch break: Dorothy Perkins, New Look, Peacocks. Cowdery used to buy things “because they were there”. In the evenings, she went on Asos. “I’d think: ‘Oh brilliant, a discount code! Free shipping! I’ll order stuff! Hmm … It doesn’t fit very well, but I can’t be bothered to send it back … I’ll keep it.’”Each month, Cowdery bought two or three things. “At £20 a time, that starts to build up. There’s a wardrobe of stuff. Things with the tags still on … I took a look at myself and thought: ‘What are you doing?’”Curious about a post she saw on Facebook, one weekend Cowdery dropped into the Leeds Community Clothes Exchange, a local swap shop. Four years on, she is one of its three directors, helping to oversee the 2,000 items – “designer stuff, vintage stuff, handmade things, wedding dresses” – that pass through the doors of the Woodhouse community centre each month.Cowdery and I meet in one of those lunch hours that used to be spent shopping. Her skirt, top and cardigan are all from the Clothes Exchange her boots are from the Autism Plus shop in Goole. “At the exchange, it’s one for one on everything,” she explains. There are no value judgments. A garment is saleable if all its buttons are present and there are no stains. Some prom dresses return again and again. “People take them, wear them, bring them back.” Regulars set aside pieces for each other. The fitting room is a place of encouragement.As her involvement in the clothes exchange grew, Cowdery’s visits to Peacocks dwindled. Now, its shop floor struck her as “an explosion in a jumble sale”. She began to delete unopened emails from Asos and Topshop. She swore off buying new clothes for a year. “I thought I’d reach the end and think: ‘I’ve done that. I’ll move on,’” she says. Instead, “It changed how I thought about clothes.”Cowdery still loves clothes – especially anything velvet – but she has found a safe way to consume them. The clothes exchange enables her to refresh her wardrobe without adding to it. She can be acquisitive, as long as she relinquishes in equal measure. Where she once bought three pieces a month, she now swaps 10 to 15 – mostly things she picked up at the previous exchange.Clothes come and go at the Basingstoke home of Sarah Fewell, too. In fact, so many parcels come and go that she knows her postman by his first name (Jay). Fewell has always loved cutting up old clothes, sticking on studs, even at 14 when most of her friends were into Hollister. But now she has turned her passion for preloved clothes into a sustainable version of fast fashion.Fewell runs a shop called Identity Party on the website Depop, which since being established in 2011 has offered its 10 million users a blend of eBay-style trading with Instagram-style posting. Her brand is “a lot of 80s, 90s, quite bohemian, grungy”. She especially loves “selling things with animals on, a good old ugly jumper and anything by St Michael.”Two years ago, in the second year of a politics degree at Goldsmiths, University of London, Fewell was browsing the charity shops when she saw “a really nice dress that wasn’t for me”. She already had a Depop profile, having sold some unwanted clothes, so she bought the dress, listed it as “‘very Phoebe from Friends” and it promptly sold.She bought and sold relentlessly during her third year. “When I left university, I thought, I don’t want a real job.”Now with Identity Party, Fewell has professionalised her love of vintage.We are sitting in a cafe in a shopping mall in Basingstoke. Fewell, who is wearing an Identity Party top and jeans and an eBay jacket, runs through her working week: Monday, she posts Tuesday, she photographs Wednesday she uploads. A fourth day is spent scouring the charity shops of Basingstoke, Newbury and Reading. A fifth and a sixth on further photography and posting.Fewell’s days are long. But all the hours spent cutting out shoulder pads and removing used handkerchiefs from pockets have made her one of Depop’s top sellers. Since that first dress, she has sold more than 3,000 items, and her customer base includes her own friends, who no longer find secondhand shopping “a bit niche”.In 2017, when she posted that first dress, Fewell “wasn’t very conscious” of the sustainability benefits of secondhand clothing. “I wasn’t really thinking: ‘I could push this message.’” After a couple of months, “it got added in there”. Now she trades her “handpicked vintage gems” as sustainable fashion. Facts about clothing waste are printed on the reverse of her business cards. When a piece of clothing doesn’t suit a customer, she urges them to sell it on, to close the loop.But does Fewell ever look at the floor of her parents’ spare room – now her stock room – at the sea of pink plastic packages waiting to be driven to the post office, and think that buying and selling secondhand clothing may not be the height of sustainability? In some ways, Depop mirrors fast fashion: consumers buy cheaply and often. Fewell points out that the bags are made of recycled plastic she would like to afford biodegradable ones. “The downside, environmentally, is postage and packing,” she admits. “But people are always going to want to buy clothes. Buying secondhand is probably the best way they can do it.”The key, says Stephanie Campbell from Wrap’s Love Your Clothes campaign, is “to keep clothing out of landfill”. Each year 430,000 tonnes of clothing are disposed of and not recycled in the UK. Meanwhile, the number of new clothes sold is rising: 1.13m tonnes in 2016, an increase of 200,000 tonnes on 2012.“It’s a slow, gradual mindset change,” says Zoe Edwards, a sewing teacher and blogger who 11 years ago pledged never to buy new clothes. “It’s not like a switch goes on and all of a sudden, it’s: ‘Right, this is how I shop now.’”Edwards was working for “a very fast-fashion, low-end clothing supplier” in London. Her job was to order the trims: labels, hanging loops, buttons, zips. The quantity of delivered fabric always varied, so she had to order a surfeit of trims, a routine waste that made her uncomfortable. She had always loved sewing, selling her handmade clothes on market stalls and Etsy. Now, her two ways of living jarred.“I didn’t want to be part of fast fashion any more,” she says. She quit her job, sewed clothes, sold the clothes, taught sewing and blogged about it. In the past 11 years, Edwards has bought only “one or two things”. Her bras are new, and she thinks she may have purchased a top from Zara in about 2010. Even her knickers are what she calls “me-made”.So how difficult is it to stop buying clothes? Tania Arrayales, a self-described “fashion disruptor”, has founded an organisation in New York called Fashion of Tomorrow to advocate a more sustainable approach to the clothing industry. Arrayales was a founding member of Style Lend, a peer-to-peer clothing rental site, and swore off all clothing purchases for a year, inspired by the documentary True Cost. But weren’t there times when she was desperate to break her self-imposed rule?“The challenge was feeling a little bit … I wasn’t as trendy as I used to be. I couldn’t make an impact when I went to an event,” she says. “I didn’t have anything new and shiny. But I wanted to restructure the way my brain saw shopping.”In her second year, she allowed herself to buy vintage clothes. The year after that, she bought the odd piece of new clothing from sustainable brands. Any time she felt her style “lack a little”, she rented what she needed from Style Lend (there are lending sites in the UK, too, but this is not yet a flourishing market). “I started seeing pieces in a new light. I discovered styling,” Arrayales says.Cowdery has noticed a similar sense of exploration and play at the Clothes Exchange. “I’ve been more experimental, more free, with clothes. I don’t keep things for best. I wear them. And I don’t worry about the size on the label,” she says.The fluidity around sizing is one of the pleasures of secondhand shopping. Depop sellers such as Fewell list clothes as fitting size eight to 14. Shoppers are encouraged to view their size as variable. “That’s the great thing about swapping,” Cowdery says. No one gets depressed because something their size won’t zip up. “You just look by eye, and ask yourself: ‘Will that fit?’”Edwards has faced a similar confrontation with her personal taste. Sewing requires a lot of decision-making: the colour and weight of fabric, length of dress, shape of sleeves. She buys vintage fabric and refashions charity shop finds, but even so, she doesn’t think “sewing is necessarily the most sustainable way to dress yourself”. There is still the acquisition of fabric and materials. And a tendency to prize the making over the wearing, so that a lot of making goes on that never gets worn. “There is a big slow fashion movement within the sewing community,” Edwards says. “People are using their stash rather than buying new stuff.”The volume of clothing of all kinds – new, secondhand and handmade – is challenging. And selling on secondhand clothes has its limits. To avoid swamping the secondhand market, or passing the problem on to others, including developing countries where many used clothes are sold in bulk, other technologies, such as fibre-to-fibre recycling, need to be encouraged.“Clothing is a way to show who I am, what I feel, what I believe,” Edwards says. “It’s a way to communicate with the world. It’s got real social value, but it has got to be done mindfully.”As Cowdery says: “Clothes have a story. If you wear something once then throw it in the bin, it hasn’t had a story. You want to know there’s life in these things.”• This article was amended on 19 February 2019. An earlier version referred to Newbury as Newberry. This has been corrected.

Maybe something was in the Hollywood water. Whatever the reason, 1999 yielded a bumper crop of movies about angry, ordinary men throwing off society’s shackles and finding something extraordinary in themselves.Fight Club and The Matrix purported to see past the blinders keeping everyone in line, and revolted against the sinister forces (capitalism and parasitic brain-vat robots respectively) exerting their invisible control. In American Beauty, a henpecked husband gave himself a new lease on life by rejecting suburbia for a simpler existence of weightlifting, pot-smoking, and skirt-chasing. But the most revealing film of that time, about the stifling influence of work and the evolving mores of masculinity, has to be Office Space.As profoundly unmotivated systems programmer Peter Gibbons, Ron Livingston and his don’t-give-a-shit shrug provided a generation with a hero. Writer-director Mike Judge has spent his entire career jabbing at the indignities of having a job, and in Peter he found the ideal vessel for his contempt. He punches the clock at the oppressively grey headquarters of Initech, a company whose ill-defined mission might as well be breaking the souls of its employees. It’s the most banal vision of hell: lethal doses of tedium, an unceasingly chirpy customer relations rep one cubicle over, an ineffective flow of management so dense with bureaucracy even Kafka would have banged his head against his desk. Other irritants have more of a personal sting, such as the smug pleasure boss Bill Lumbergh (Gary Cole, doing a bargain-rack Gordon Gekko) takes in by informing his underlings that, yeah, they’re gonna need to come in on Saturday.Peter and his colleagues’ ill-conceived scheme to get rich skimming fractions of pennies from the corporate kitty gives the loose, shaggy plot a semblance of direction, but Office Space would be more accurately clocked as a character study about a man who refuses to take any more. The aggressive regular-guy-ness of Livingston empowers anyone sharing his middle-income lot – not well-off enough to enjoy being rich not poor enough to have the hardship to account for his misery – to access him as a surrogate, making his strike against the coffee-slurping overlords into a slacker wish-fulfillment fantasy.His version of getting unplugged from the matrix comes when a hypnotherapist drops dead in the middle of their session, which leaves Peter in a state of new enlightenment. It means all he must do to change direction is simply decide to do so. He starts coming to work in flannel shirts and jeans, ignoring the memos telling him things he already knows, and eventually skipping out entirely to embrace absenteeism as a philosophy. His willingness to think past the conformity of the zombies pacing the corridors catches the attention of his supervisors and lands him a promotion – perhaps Judge remembered the feeling when he realized the loathing of authority that made him unemployable could mean success in entertainment.While this critic is relieved to confirm that two solid decades of incessant “I believe you have my stapler” stammerings from unfunny men at bars have done nothing to detract from this film’s hilarity, certain aspects have aged.Early on, during a late-night gripe session with Peter, one of his pals suggests that the stability and consistency of their work may have its merit, and gets summarily dismissed. That Peter and the film itself consider a reliable paycheck a fate worse than death may baffle an 18-year-old today, reared in a world of few jobs for young people, inhumane conditions at the world’s biggest corporations, and millennial burnout. A new generation is leaning in favor of socialism to stop widespread poverty and viciously exploitative business practices. Peter’s idea of suffering is being bored – did we ever have it so good? Take a step back, and a viewer can see people growing more desperate, aware, and politicized in their rebellion.The other element binding this film to its era are the distinctly male overtones to Peter’s metamorphosis into his best self. He finds happiness by getting back in touch with the physical instincts from which eight hours under fluorescents can estrange a man. He finally ditches his unfaithful girlfriend and shacks up with a local waiter played by Jennifer Aniston, an epitome of cool to Peter for sharing in his apathy. He eventually ends up getting a new gig on a construction crew, which Judge makes out to be good, honest work. At the risk of putting too fine a point on it, Judge even splices in a few shots of Peter catching a fish. The film imagines his transformation not as an evolution, but a devolution in the direction of our primal hunter-gatherer origins.Though he’s defined by his lack of extraordinary qualities, Peter’s as much of a chosen one as his contemporary Neo. He takes it upon himself to carry the mantle of his fellow men, left flabby and neutered by the creature comforts of mild prosperity. His crusade against the tyranny of the 9-5 would refine its social component to shed the hangups about manliness, and the economic stakes would rise considerably over the following decades.

It faces competition from DreamWorks Animation’s How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World, which managed £1.65m at the weekend. By releasing a week earlier, the Viking adventure has built up a higher total, £11.5m, and will probably retain a lead over its Lego rival at the end of the films’ runs.Boosted by previews totalling £485,000 and with takings just below £2.47m, Instant Family almost pipped The Lego Movie 2. Less than £3,000 separated the two films, although Instant Family had the benefit of its previews tally.The film represents a change of tone for Sean Anders who had writing andor directing credits on Sex Drive, We’re the Millers, Horrible Bosses 2 and both Daddy’s Home films. Mark Wahlberg and Rose Byrne star as a married couple who adopt a set of young siblings. The comedy-drama is inspired by the experiences of Anders and his wife, who themselves adopted three children.Instant Family opened in the US in November, beginning with $14.5m on its way to $67m. Not counting previews, the UK debut number is £1.95m – by industry rule of thumb, that’s ahead of the UK equivalent of the US opening figure (which would be £1.45m). Instant Family has a 12A certificate, and might hold up reasonably well during the half-term holiday.Landing in seventh place, family adventure The Kid Who Would Be King struggled to define its niche. Unlike the Lego or Dragon films, the live-action quest tale doesn’t benefit from a strong recognition factor – unless you count the King Arthur legend, on which the story draws. Director Joe Cornish previously made Attack the Block, which had a distinctly different audience skew.The Kid Who Would Be King began with an uninspiring £667,000, including modest previews. Attack the Block began with £837,000 (£1.13m, including previews) in May 2011. Cornish has enjoyed bigger success as a screenwriter, with credits on Ant-Man and The Adventures of Tintin.The Favourite faced competition from other awards-friendly releases, Green Book and If Beale Street Could Talk – the latter boosted by its expansion from 52 to 339 cinemas. Below The Favourite in the chart are Mary Queen of Scots, Vice, Can You Ever Forgive Me?, Stan \u0026amp Ollie, All Is True, Boy Erased, Beautiful Boy and Colette. Also in the mix is A Private War, starring Rosamund Pike as fearless war reporter Marie Colvin. The biographical drama began with a decent £103,000 from 74 sites (£223,000, including previews).1.

Walker, the same age as Taylor and of similar background, found himself confronting a gang of local racists and, after first fighting back, went to extraordinary lengths to fit in and gain their friendship.The film features interviews with Walker looking back 15 years on from the events he describes, which are re-enacted in the locations where they took place, with Kai Francis Lewis playing Walker.Responding to the nomination, Walker said that he was, “humbled and proud.

Here are some hints for making a little knowledge – and some orbital shaking – go a long wayNever ruin your palate by drinking fine wine, they say: the last thing you want is to find that perfectly acceptable bottle of supermarket plonk turning sour in your mouth because you’ve supped too long at the altar of Gevrey-Chambertin.But talking the talk can still be pretty useful: there’s nothing like a smattering of well-chosen phrases about “botrytis” (mould, counter-intuitively, a good thing, also known as “noble rot”), “malolactic fermentation” and “ullage” to put the most irritating know-all in their place.Becoming a fully paid-up oenophile is a long process, however, and one that few of us have the time or patience to master. Here, then, are our top 10 tips for sending your life a little Sideways without alienating all those around you.1. Rope in an expert, specifically one gifted in the art of distilling their knowledge. Jancis Robinson, for example, shoots peas through a whole lot of wine-related myths in her book, The 24-hour Wine Expert. You don’t need an array of glasses to enjoy wine (she recommends a grand total of one) don’t sneer at a screw-top the colour of a wine is less important than its weight when it comes to matching with food. Hearteningly, she also advises beginning your studies into the finer aspects of the grape by assembling a large number of bottles and a group of friends the proportions she leaves up to you.2. In the same vein of myth-busting, you’ll sound quite the connoisseur if you ask for an ice-bucket for a bottle of red – many in the know believe that, these days, red wine is served far too warm. Similarly, don’t leave the white in there for too long it’s supposed to be chilled, not turned into a slush puppy.3. Central to the business of tasting wine is the art of the swirl: it needs to be slow enough to incorporate oxygen, but not too slow determined enough to create little wine arcs but not so vigorous that it sloshes over your top. What you need is “orbital shaking”, and so precise an art is it that oenodynamics are now studied by physicists. For real. Afterwards, comes the sniff, which can best be boiled down to: quick, followed by slow.4. Be careful what you diss wine fashions change more quickly than hemlines. Currently undergoing a reputational resurgence is none other than lambrusco, the fizzy wine from Emilia-Romagna previously associated with 1980s teen parties, now newly suave, thanks to a little less sweetness and an image makeover. More tips for 2019: Croatia, Crete and Canada will all be making appearances on the wine buff’s wishlist.5. Additionally, sherry is now hip, and shows no signs of not being so. Until they discover the thing that used to be less hip than sherry. Wincarnis, anyone? Buckfast?6. You will have to conquer the embarrassment of some wine terminology. Yes, they really do talk about “mouth-feel”, which – disappointingly – appears simply to mean what wine feels like in your mouth they do call wine being “aggressive”, as if it were a therapy session and phrases such as “fruit-forward” do exist. There is genuinely a thing called “bottle shock”.7. But don’t be taken in by the apparent egalitarianism and increasing inclusivity of the wine world. Every guide will tell you that the most important thing is to find a wine you like – and to enjoy it. They don’t mean it, as you’ll find out if you turn up to dinner at their house with a bottle of Blue Nun. That’s when they start talking about things like regions and varietals.8. This is a tough one for some keen topers to swallow. But all the pros say it, so it must be true. You’re not supposed to fill the glass to its brim something to do with oxygen. Even the esteemed Jancis Robinson advises not filling the glass more than halfway up. For Brits, especially, keen on value for money and historically scarred by early closing times, this seems to go against common sense – who knows when the bottle’s coming round again, after all? But if moderation is the way forward, then so be it. Just make sure you’ve secreted an extra bottle at your end of the table.9. Treading the fine line between stingy and spendthrift is key in choosing a decent wine from, say, a supermarket. Go too low, and you’re just paying for label design, duties and other overheads break the bank and you could simply be throwing money away on fancy name recognition. And to repeat an oft-debunked canard: never order the second cheapest bottle on the wine list that’s what the establishment expects you to do and they price accordingly.10. Know when not to serve it at all. Restaurateur Mark Hix knows his way around a decent bit of grub and, when I interviewed him once, seemed unconvinced that red wine was the right accompaniment for a groaning cheeseboard too much flavour, all at once. His answer was a top-notch tequila – but that’s a whole other story."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82ad1dc9f5ef8ef5dfd154d529e949da42c5cbdd/0_332_4980_2988/master/4980.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02c02d9ca211fe6e25035e60cab27130","title":"bayern munich liverpool champions league too old doubts","story":"The German champions have been sluggish for much of the season and the problems may run to the very top“Maybe they are slowly becoming part of the problem,” mused Stefan Effenberg in November. The former Bayern Munich midfielder was referring to Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Uli Hoeness, the chief executive and the president of the Bundesliga club respectively, and went on to suggest the club were going stale under their leadership.“They have made grave errors when it comes to the planning of the squad,” he said. “They have to look at the characters in the squad and get rid of five or six players. Maybe it is time for some new impulses from the outside.”Effenberg has a lot to say, as most pundits do, but he may have a point here. There is something strange about Bayern, who face Liverpool in the first leg of the Champions League last-16 tie at Anfield on Tuesday, at the moment. They are keeping the pressure on Borussia Dortmund at the top of the Bundesliga, having twice come from behind against Augsburg on Friday to win 3-2, but the mere fact they are not first in the table is instructive.Bayern have won the past six league titles but have looked sluggish and unconvincing for most of the season. It appears, as Effenberg suggested, that the squad have lost their shape, that they have got too old. Arjen Robben has been there for 10 years, Franck Ribéry for 12. Manuel Neuer, Jérôme Boateng (ruled out of the game at Anfield by illness) and Mats Hummels are more than 30 years old. Thomas Müller is a shadow of the player he once was. Robert Lewandowski, also 30, is still scoring goals, just not as frequently.There are extremely talented players at the club and Leon Goretzka, Kingsley Coman and Joshua Kimmich are under 25 and will continue to improve. Perhaps the problem is that there are not enough of the players who are at the peak of their powers. Those you expect to be there, such as Thiago Alcântara, David Alaba and James Rodríguez, are unlikely to reach the level needed to form the backbone of a Champions League-winning side. It is telling that Bayern’s transfer record is still the £36.5m they paid for Corentin Tolisso in 2017.Their form is not terrible. They have won five of their six games since the Christmas break, though defence is a problem. During that run, they conceded three times against Leverkusen and twice each against Hertha Berlin and Augsburg. They won two of them 3-2 but the manager, Niko Kovac, said after the game at Augsburg, in which Bayern conceded after 12 seconds, “that maybe some players were already thinking about Liverpool”.He added: “In Europe we have to concede less. It is going to be very difficult if we have to score three or four goals every time to win.”It will be fascinating to see how Bayern fare. There is already friction between the fans and the board, with supporters unfolding a banner of Hoeness and Rummenigge with their faces covered with euro signs for last month’s game against Stuttgart. The were unhappy Bayern had gone to Qatar for their mid-season break and made their feelings clear.The most surreal moment of a hitherto disappointing season came in October, when Bayern called an impromptu press conference. There were suspicions Kovac would be sacked but instead Rummenigge, Hoeness and the sporting director, Hasan Salihamidzic, started laying into the press.Flabbergasted journalists listened as the trio lambasted the “disrespectful” reporting. “It’s about time the biggest club in Germany takes a clear stance on this issue,” Hoeness said. “We will no longer accept this recent kind of media coverage,” added Rummenigge, who threatened legal action should the criticism continue. The response to the 33-minute tirade was justifiably scornful. NDR spoke of “arrogance, thin skins and double standards” while Bayerischer Rundfunk said the “bosses at the Bavarian club have crossed a clear line with their attack on the media. The attack on free speech and reporting was wrong and completely unnecessary.”Paul Breitner, a World Cup winner in 1974, said he had never seen Bayern show “such weakness” in his 48-year-association with the club. Of Hoeness, he added: “With Uli it is always about the Bayern family. And now the children have to say that they are ashamed of the dad.” The comments did not go down too well and, according to Bild, Breitner was soon banned from the VIP section of the Allianz Arena.Out of time and out of sync? If Bayern win against Liverpool and go far in the Champions League the criticism will die down. If they do not it may be the start of a long farewell, not only for some players but for some influential people at the top."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d880ba3b547cf9746d733a7e1e58d17523bdde9/0_68_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e4a294346e05648cf390f38eac9cd34","title":"chelsea maurizio sarri manager malmo roman abramovich sack","story":"Maurizio Sarri will take charge of Chelsea’s Europa League tie at home to Malmö on Thursday and is set to continue as manager for Sunday’s Carabao Cup final against Manchester City, although another defeat by Pep Guardiola’s side at Wembley could lead to his dismissal.The 6-0 loss at City this month and Monday’s embarrassing FA Cup exit against Manchester United at Stamford Bridge that prompted home supporters to turn on the Italian have left Sarri clinging to his job after less than a season. The 60-year-old was given a month for results to improve after the defeat at the Etihad, and last week’s 2-1 victory over Malmö in the first leg of their last-32 tie offered some respite. But that proved brief given the performance against United and the reaction of large numbers of Chelsea’s supporters, who chanted “Fuck Sarri-ball” and eventually joined in with the United supporters’ refrain of: “You’re getting sacked in the morning.”It is understood a decision on Sarri’s future will be taken by Roman Abramovich. The owner appointed Sarri after a successful spell at Napoli and will choose whether to continue with him, rather than assigning that to Marina Granovskaia, the director who oversees much of Chelsea’s day-to-day business.Abramovich has not attended a game this season, having withdrawn his application for a UK visa last year. He has previously shown little patience with managers who are perceived to have lost the support of the home crowd and the decision not to use the forward Callum Hudson-Odoi as a substitute as Chelsea chased the game against United is also likely to come under scrutiny. The 18-year-old has played only 19 minutes since Chelsea turned down a £35m bid from Bayern Munich in January.If Sarri survives the weekend he faces a Premier League game at home to Tottenham next Wednesday. “Hopefully we can have a good nine days,” César Azpilicueta told Chelsea TV. “It’s the whole season. Now in three days we will be back at the Bridge against Malmö, to finish the job we started last Thursday, to get through to the next round.”He added: “Then we have two massive games. We know that a trophy in the middle is everything, to bring the fans back to Wembley with the spirit to get the cup. Hopefully we can give a bit of happiness to them, to enjoy a bit of joy. Then we know Tottenham at home is something special.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50426c121dad19220ed83fdbabb198de4e8755df/1258_1984_922_553/master/922.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1aa36dbf0401445677bcc6f573b84bd6","title":"david squires on tottenhams grand designs for their new stadium","story":"Our cartoonist looks at Spurs and their protracted renovations to move back into their ground"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e74e1cee1762d4a9b766128a9c30ee2c0bd2836/0_238_3640_2184/master/3640.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=895e9432187f50f102b4dd833a01b043","title":"young people hold the power the movement against fgm in pictures","story":"More than 200 million women and girls have undergone female genital mutilation and about 3 million more are at risk every year.

The ‘future of British politics’ will be one without them - which is a shame because I’d much prefer we united all of our efforts into getting rid of the vile government. Mike BarkerThe only thing that would be useful - to the country, if not the leadership of the two main parties - about Umunna et al going would be that they take a few Tories with them, and thus remove May’s majority. Theoretically at least, this could really change the direction of British politics and force a second referendum, or the abandonment of no-deal or of Brexit altogether. But if they can’t do that, this is just a waste of time and column inches. And I can’t help wondering exactly what it is that Chris Leslie sees in the company he’s keeping ... unless it can tempt away half a dozen Tories to go with them. wightpaintFinally! A centrist party that remain voters can get behind! So sick of Tory and Labour spearheading Brexit meaning no effective opposition. Let’s get real proportional representation and sort this country out in coalitions representing this ided country’s views - the only way we’re going forward together as a country is in compromise and the two-party system prevents this. Tallisker2Pretty damning.

Reform only happens from within - wasn’t that the central argument of remainers in the first place? AmouxThe comparisons with the gang of four of 1981 are wrong. Yes both are a splintering caused by a hard left turn in the Labour Party. Yes, the Labour party is currently unelectable like in 1981. The more so because its handling of Brexit will lose it millions of younger votes including e.g. the seat of Canterbury.Most obviously though 2019 is different because there was in 1981 no defining political cause of the day on which to gain political energy. Brexit affords that to this new group and allows them to rehome potentially millions of voters (which the Lib Dems have singularly failed to do under an ailing leadership). Campaigning for a second vote will drive energy and electoral power to this new group, which is the calculation they have made on timing - now and not in six weeks.The second point is the age of these MPs. This is a newish generation of MPs (but with credibility from some experience). The gang of four were all past their political peak - and career trajectory matters in politics. Political change against the populists like May and Corbyn is coming from the new generation, ground up - May and Corbyn are either side of 70 and don’t recognise the need for inter-generational change. Neither are radical practical thinkers and are both in different ways intolerant of change. Any reform agenda they have is going nowhere right now - since they have both have been hobbled by their extremist wings.In this Brexit mess the political change happening now under our feet is as radical as the social change of the 1960’s, and the centrist MP’s see that. They do have a good chance. sussexplanThe Labour Party hasn’t changed since the last General Election when these MPs stood under the Labour banner. It is they who have deserted the Labour voters. They should resign as MPs and fight by-elections as Independents, but they won’t because basically they are gutless. DADAspeakThe left of the party withstood all kinds of pressure to leave throughout the 90s and beyond. Most of us stayed if we weren’t kicked out. These saps have no fortitude. I’ve been a member of the party for 22 years and have never voted any other way. There is exactly the same amount of antisemitism as there has always been in Labour, not very much. As for the hard left machine politics stuff, there was nothing more machine like than the Blair years. And if they think a broadly Wilsonian stance is hard left then maybe they are in the wrong party. Well, Good luck to them. At least they’ll have a job till the next election. But if they let a Tory in may the dead of their constituencies rise up and eat them. DrWhatsonThis is sad, very sad. Labour is supposed to be a broad church, MPs getting hounded out is not a sign of a government in waiting. And the rebels are right on antisemitism, the response from the leadership was too slow and inadequate. One gets the impression Corbyn preferred to soft-peddle when criticising old comrades. That said, this was always going to happen with Brexit. We will see a similar split with the Tories, it’s only a matter of time. Finite187Pity about the number of cynics on here. Surely this is just a symptom of how polarised politics has become and a result of loss of faith in weak leadership, that reasonable people are trying to find moderate ground. I’m all for centrism personally. You can sneer all you like of course but I don’t see much inspiration coming from elsewhere. 89798840The Tories will be loving this and what awful timing. You have to ask: ‘Why now?’. Well they should stand for re-election immediately then, but doubt they’ll do so. They would rather keep the Tories in than see a real, socialist Labour party.

Sir Mark Lyall Grant, UK ambassador to the UN in 2009-15, told the inquiry the foreign aid commitment demonstrated “evidence of real intent to be a global power”.David Hannay, a cross-bench peer and ambassador to the UN in 1990-95, concurred that without this continued commitment the UK’s reputation “would be in sort of freefall territory”.A third former ambassador to the UN, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, said of Brexit: “Most other people – almost without exception – think we’ve shot ourselves in the foot.”One New York diplomat told the inquiry: “There is a perception that the UK is doing less and championing fewer and less difficult agendas. Most of the difficult diplomacy in 2018 on Syria and Yemen at the UN security council was handled by Sweden and the Netherlands.”Sir Simon Fraser, the former foreign office permanent secretary, said: “Fundamentally and structurally, I think our position, and our leverage in international institutions, will be weaker once we have left the European Union”.When asked whether Brexit had impacted the UK’s capacity for influence, a senior source from a non-EU state said: “Yes, I can feel the UK’s weight in the council is dwindling, you can feel it. Definitely when Brexit happens things will change.”An EU source at the UN said: “One of the risky things about Brexit is the inconsistency of the mood, and you know to be effective in the security council is this sort of mixture of being confident, consistent, reliable.”Non-UK diplomats told the inquiry that Britain “was less willing to criticise China now, in recognition of how important China will be to the UK after Brexit. These problems for the UK are self-reinforcing because if they tread more gingerly, they appear to other members as if they are less powerful and less able to take a leadership role. This poses risks for the UK as they attempt to navigate their position in the world post-Brexit.”The authors suggest the UK should adopt a more collaborative stance at the UN, for instance by sharing the so-called pen-holding role on key files with members of the general assembly.Last year the UK was the penholder on 12 files including Libya, Myanmar and Yemen, and, although admired, Britain has been sometimes accused of not acting as an honest broker in that role, but instead using its influence to prevent difficult issues being aired.The authors suggest the UK could gain notice by being more willing to respond to the call by the UN secretary general, António Guterres, for “a quantum leap” in collective action on peace operations. Such an offer would fit with Hunt’s promise to do more within the Foreign Office budget to prevent atrocities.The report also says the Foreign Office will need to identify gaps in its diplomatic capacity at the general assembly since the UK will no longer able to rely on EU for burden-sharing and support in New York.France will become the sole member of the EU on the security council, raising questions about whether it feels under pressure to represent the views, not just of France but those of Europe.The lead author of the report, Dr Jess Gifkins from the University of Manchester, said: The research showed the impacts of Brexit go beyond the UK and the EU to the UN, where the UK’s reputation is tarnished and its capacity for influence is weakened.”Prof Jason Ralph, from the University of Leeds, who led the research project, identified “widespread confusion about what Global Britain means, and doubts about the UK’s capacity to deliver the resources to back up its diplomatic leadership”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25b4a38e3dd3dcc154581e535165b68b761ddae0/0_38_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f5325049cce2b65df97bdf5c1c73898","title":"labour split jeremy corbyn brexit politics live","story":"Rolling updates as Jeremy Corbyn is warned that more MPs could leave party to join new groupJeremy Corbyn has accused Theresa May of trying to “blackmail” MPs into backing her Brexit deal by running down the clock to prevent alternative plans being considered.The Labour leader accused the prime minister of risking a no-deal Brexit in order to keep the Conservative party together. The Labour leader, who has suffered a split in his own party on Monday, partly due to Brexit policy, called on the prime minister to accept his offer of working on a “sensible” deal. Addressing manufacturers’ organisation Make UK, formerly known as EEF, he said Labour’s plan – based on a customs union – “could win the support of parliament, be negotiated with the European Union and help bring the country together”.Corbyn, who is due to hold talks with EU negotiator Michel Barnier on Thursday, said the Labour plan “has been widely welcomed as a way of breaking the impasse”. He said: “If the prime minister is unable to adopt a sensible deal because it would split the Tories, then there needs to be a general election. Without it we will keep all options on the table, including the option of a public vote. The country cannot be taken over the cliff edge for the sake of Tory party unity.” “The government is running down the clock in an attempt to blackmail MPs with the threat of crashing out without a deal.” An estimated 100,000 Scots could lose their job in the event of a no-deal Brexit, MSPs have been told.If the UK is forced to quit the European Union on March 29 with no agreement in place “things will change, and change very fast for the worse”, Scottish constitutional relations secretary Mike Russell warned.In a statement at Holyrood, Russell said: “A no-deal Brexit could, we estimate, result in an increase in unemployment in Scotland of around 100,000 people, more than doubling the unemployment rate. We would go from a record low to a level not far off that at the depths of the last recession, with all the human costs which that would entail.” He added: “Whatever we as a government do, and we will do everything we can, we simply could not avoid that sort of damage being done to our economy and our country. But one person could - the Prime Minister could.”Scottish finance secretary Derek Mackay will publish a new paper on the economic cost of a no-deal Brexit later this week. Speaking on Sky News, he added that he wants to remain in a “compassionate and outward looking party” that is “inclusive” and “attractive to the next generation”. “That is not possible with the European Research Group working as a block.. not as iniduals but as a block ... We must not allow that branding to poison moderate perspective centre right Conservative party.”Labour’s leader Jeremy Corbyn has issued a defiant message to the seven MPs who resigned from his party, reminding them they were elected to carry out the party’s manifesto.He said the group – who broke away from the party on Monday – “were elected to carry out those policies”.The Labour leader was speaking at the annual conference of the manufacturers’ group Make UK. It was his first public appearance since the breakaway MPs announced their departure.A protester has been charged with harassment after MP Anna Soubry was taunted outside Parliament. James Goddard, 29, was accused of two counts of harassment relating to incidents on December 19 and January 7. The Crown Prosecution Service said he is also accused of two public order offences against a police officer. The self-styled “yellow vest” activist posted a video on Facebook on Tuesday to thank his supporters after being warned he was likely to be remanded in custody when he answered police bail. “If they do remand me then we will just have to learn from it, go away, do it, come back even stronger,” he said. Goddard was arrested by the politan Police on January 12 following claims that Soubry was harassed in Westminster five days earlier. Corbyn is asked by Sky News what the party is doing, or going to do, to retain MPs and stop others from leaving.He replies that Labour has developed policies that are radical but they are also popular and the party is doing it best to put them forward.“They are are discussed frequently with parliamentary colleagues and we are making huge progress,” he said.By contrast to remarks by the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, earlier today about how the party needs to embark on a “massive” listening exercise, Corbyn added that anyone who says they “are not being consulted are not taking up the opportunities that are are open and available to them at all times.”There is also a question from Heather Stewart of the  who asked if he agrees with his deputy, Tom Watson, that Labour’s front bench needs to ersify to encompass more views.Corbyn began by saying that he was proud to lead the Labour party and proud of what it achieved in so many areas of society.“I recognise that leading the party, you have to take people with you,” he said, adding that he was determined to do that so that the party’s policies can be best represented when an election comes.Corbyn is now taking questions. The first one is about the departure of the seven MPs and cites their claims that the party is anti-semitic, that he is anti-business and that others are planning to follow Chuka Umunna and co out of the party.The Labour leader is also asked about when he is going to invoke a call for a second referendum on Brexit.Corbyn replies that he regrets the MPs left, “because I want our party to be strong, to be united around the polices that we have put forward.On the question of a second referendum, he cites the Labour frontbench’s recent amendment in parliament which called for a “popular vote” at the end of the process.He accuses the government of “running down the clock” on Brexit, which he says would be very damaging to the economy. Jeremy Corbyn has been announcing proposals for a major investment in skills and education.The Labour leader outlined plans for a national education service which would be available to everyone, “whatever their age, from cradle to grave.”Speaking at the EEF employers’ group manufacturing conference, Corbyn referred early in his speech to the departure of seven MPs yesterday, saying that he was disappointed that they had failed to get behind a Labour agenda which was in line with the wishes of half a million Labour Party members both inside and outside of parliament and with millions of people around the country.Quoting Tony Benn’s comments about how education should be like an escalator, Corbyn also announced details of a Commission for Lifelng Learning, which will be jointly chaired by the former Education Sectretary, Estelle Morris, and trade unionist Dave Ward.“Never again will workers feel discarded,” said Corbyn, who added that it made no sense for people to be only educated for the first quarter of their lives.“We have to end the outdated grammar school mentality of looking down on someone who does a vocational course and looking up to someone who does an academic course.”A circumspect interview by the Japanese ambassador to the UK, Koji Tsuruoka, has yielded a few lines on the BBC’s World at One.Perhaps it was what he didn’t say that was most interesting though when he was asked about a report this week in the Financial Times that Japanese officials had accused Jeremy Hunt and Liam Fox of taking a “high-handed” approach towards a post-Brexit free trade deal, and briefly considered cancelling bilateral talks due to take place this week.The FT cited unnamed officials in Tokyo who reacted with dismay to a letter sent on 8 February in which Hunt, the foreign secretary, and Fox, the international trade secretary, insisted that “time is of the essence” in securing a trade deal with Japan, the world’s third-biggest economy.“I don’t think there was any kind of emotional offensiveness in the terms of the letter,” he said, while stopping short of saying that the report was untrue.Pressed on whether he was telling his government that British politics was “stable,” he said: “Predictability is a very important element. That is why uncertainty has caused a lot second thoughts about continuing business in the UK,” he said.“We have told both the EU and the UK government that Brexit should not damage the stable economic environment that we all enjoy today.”The lack of predicability.. the lack of what may happen next is a real problem,” said the ambassador who repeated his prime minister’s support for the deal negotiated with Brussels by Theresa May.“He also said very clearly that no deal should also be avoided.”Uncertainty over Britain’s exit from the European Union must be ended so that businesses can have clarity about the future, business minister Greg Clark has said.Speaking hours after Honda said it would close its car plant in Britain, Clark told the EEF employers’ group manufacturing conference: “Decisions like Honda’s this morning demonstrate starkly how much is at stake.”“This news comes on top of months of uncertainty that you as manufacturers have had to endure about Brexit, about our future relationship with the EU,” said Clark.“A situation in which our manufacturers do not have the certainty they need about the terms under which two thirds of our trade will be conducted in 40 days time is unacceptable - it needs to be brought to conclusion and without further delay.” He added: “We will go on making sure that the argument that manufacturers put for a deal to be concluded swiftly is something that is heard loud and clear,” he said. The number of EU workers in the UK fell by 61,000 at a time when the employment rate for British and non-EU workers has soared, according to new official figures which have been seized on by figures from opposing sides of the Brexit ide.There was an estimated 2.33 million workers from the European Union between October to December in 2017, but that figure dropped to 2.27 million a year later. A notable drop in workers from eight eastern European countries that joined the EU in 2004 had largely accounted for the decrease.This contrasted with an increase in the number of non-EU workers in the UK, jumping from 1.16 million to 1.29 million in the same time period. This was an increase of 130,000 compared with the equivalent period 12 months earlier, and the highest number the highest number since records started in 1997.Rosie Duffield, Labour MP and a leading supporter of People’s Vote, said: “The uncertainty over Brexit means it is sadly no surprise that tens of thousands of EU nationals have left Britain over the past year, and that fewer people want to come here to contribute to our society and our economy. Brexit is already damaging our NHS, our universities and industry and means less money for public services.Overall, The number of people in work in the UK reached a record 32.6 million.Emma Barr, Head of Communications at the right-leaning Centre for Policy Studies said: “These figures are extremely reassuring. Even as we prepare to leave the EU, the British economy - and British business - is still creating jobs at an enviable rate, with record levels of people in work thanks to our flexible labour market.”The health secretary Matt Hancock has been urged to stop private companies from securing NHS contracts, after Labour research found Dozens of new NHS contracts worth £128m are currently out to tender.Research commissioned by the Labour Party found a total of 26 health service contracts worth more than £128m are currently out to tender, including one worth more than £90 million, reports Aisha Zahid for the .Last month in front of the Health and Social Care Select Committee, Matt Hancock MP stated there would be: “no privatisation of the NHS on my watch.”But Labour is demanding that the health secretary delivers on this statement by ensuring these new NHS contracts are kept in public hands.The House of Commons Library for Labour identified that the 26 contracts include a new £91m contract for a NHS 111Clinical Assessment Service in the South East.Jonathan Ashworth MP, Labour’s Shadow Health and Social Care Secretary, said: “This health secretary’s privatisation credentials become clearer by the day - whether it’s promoting GP at Hand to endorsing private dentistry to now allowing millions of pounds worth of health services contracts to be privatised.A warning has been sounded that condition are potentially now favourable for a more formalised Far Right movement to emerge from what is, for now, “a shapeless and leaderless mass of angry people”Joe Mulhall, a senior researcher at anti-racism organisation, Hope not Hate, suggests that the anti-Muslim activist Robinson (real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon) could yet take on the leadership of such a movement or even do so within Ukip, which has embraced the far right under Gerard Batten.With trust in politicians and our political system at a low point, there is a ready pool of people who could be attracted to this type of messaging.Whatever happens with Brexit there is bound to be a narrative of betrayal being advanced by the far right that will likely speak to large numbers of people in the UK and reinforce existing disillusionment.Regardless, we cannot wait for a traditional, united, far-right umbrella organisation to emerge before we act. We need to start connecting the dots now and to realise that what we’ve seen over the last year is various incarnations of the same threat.Chris Leslie of the Independent Group has made a first intervention for the new political entity during House of Commons health and social care questions, shoehorning in one of the catchphrases from yesterday’s press conference.Delays around plans for the long-term funding of adult social care “typify the broken politics in this country,” said Leslie, who was flanked on either side by colleagues Mike Gapes and Angela Smith.Earlier, Health Secretary Matt Hancock sought to make hay out of Labour’s split (splintering?), telling fellow MPs that his Labour shadow, John Ashworth was a “reasonable and sensible man.“I like him. My politics are probably closer to him than his are to the leader of his party,” said Hancock, to laughter.Gesturing to the former Labour MPs, he then added: “Why doesn’t he have the gumption to join his friends over there in the Independent Group rather than backing this hard left proto communist?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5697b978cdd1e232bbbc28a652820f11ca109d32/0_391_4607_2764/master/4607.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b18e270db415c0a6c175b056ec7f28fa","title":"alysa liu figure skating young athletes sport","story":"The figure skater is barely into her teens and is already the US champion. But some believe the mental and physical strain of elite sport should waitAlysa Liu covered her face and cried as the results were announced at the US ladies figure skating championship in Detroit, Michigan, last month. Her coach, Laura Lipetsky who has worked with her since she was five, hugged her.Liu had just won the national title at the age of 13, making her the youngest athlete to have done so, and with two triple axles no less. The weeks since have been a media frenzy. She appeared on the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, and profiles on her meteoric rise have been published across the world. But for all the attention Liu has received, she won’t be able to compete in Worlds. She’s too young. A 1997 International Skating Union rule requires athletes to be at least 15 by 1 July preceding the season to participate in senior-level international events.That poses a question: is 13 too young to devote one’s life to sports? How young is too young to be a full-time athlete?Liu’s childhood has been anything but ordinary. She usually trains four to five hours a day at the Oakland Ice Center under Lipetsky, who says in an email she spends so much time with Liu on a daily basis that “I feel like I am a mother to her.”At the age of 10, Liu enrolled in California Connections Academy, an online program used by other elite skaters, to allow her the flexibility to travel for competition. Liu completes her homework between practices at her father’s nearby office. She eats dinner in the car on the way home and goes to bed around 8.30pm. Despite the rigorous schedule, her father, Arthur Liu told the San Francisco Chronicle, “She has lots of friends, has sleepovers. I’m trying to provide her with a normal life.” Lipetsky says that despite Liu’s age, she does not coach her any differently. “I want all my students to be able to be the best they can at any level they are in.”There are countless cautionary tales about young phenoms burning out, leaving their sport – or at least taking a break – seemingly before their time was up. Jennifer Capriati. Björn Borg. Sonny Pike. Todd Marinovich. Pike, who was touted by some as the next Diego Maradona, described how the pressure affected him. “At 17 my head was finished. I was suicidal,” he told the  in 2016.The cautionary tales exist for good reason. Kids have different needs. Parents can be controlling, channeling their ambition through their children. Coaches can abuse their power. The pressure can be overwhelming for someone so young. But for every cautionary tale, there are prodigies who have had long careers: the Williams sisters, Magic Johnson, LeBron James. Unfortunately, there is no formula that can determine whether a young athlete with the necessary talent is ready to play a professional sport or not. “I don’t think there is a certain age,” says John Stevenson, a registered psychologist and mental performance consultant. “It really comes down to the inidual.”There are, however, some factors that can predict success or failure.Andrea Jaeger, who reached the US Open semi-final at the age of 15, recalls waking up at 5am to run in Chicago winters. “It’d be 10F (-12C), and I’d be excited to do it because I loved training,” she says.That kind of love of the sport makes it less likely a young athlete will face burnout. “That intrinsic drive is really difficult to quantify. If that’s coming from them, and not from the parent, that’s probably healthier,” Dr Charles Popkin, a pediatric orthopedic surgeon at Columbia University Medical Center, says.Beyond parenting, avoiding burnout is about balance. While success depends on long hours training, it shouldn’t feel like a job. Dr Stephen Smith, who specializes in clinical sport psychology for adolescents, describes the difference between deliberate practice, where the focus is on drilling and improving skills, and deliberate play, “where kids get together, sometimes with an adult and sometimes not, and they just play.” While both are important to improving one’s skills, it’s important that the young athlete isn’t just practicing the sport the enjoyment, after all, comes from playing it.Jaeger only started playing tennis at the age of eight, but by 10 she was giving interviews, and by 14, she had turned pro. “I had People Magazine, Sports Illustrated, and Life Magazine at my junior high,” she says. Now 53, Jaeger recalls having fans recognize her with her signature long pigtails in airports in Japan. Jaeger rose to No2 in the world, her highest ranking as a professional tennis player, at the age of 16. She beat Billie Jean King, Martina Navratilova, and Chris Evert. “Personally, for me, I was fine being 14, being a professional tennis player. The environment wasn’t ready for me,” she says. “Professional women’s tennis wasn’t ready for a 14-year-old phenom. They just weren’t.”Jaeger recalls going out on court at 1am to play a match and sharing locker rooms with grown women. She notes today’s organizing bodies are better, but she says there should be a safety system that includes background checks on adults who come in contact with young athletes. Jaeger points to the failure of USA Gymnastics to protect athletes from the sexual abuser Larry Nassar. “There’s no excuse for it,” she says. “Address the professionalism in the adults, and then maybe you’ll see these kids lasting longer.”Jaeger, for her part, faced an organizing body that didn’t understand and actively tried to dissuade her from her other passion: charity. In between matches and practices, Jaeger would often go to the local hospital and bring toys for the kids. She never told anyone what she was doing in her spare time, but when a local newspaper wrote up as story about her talking about suicide prevention at a high school in White Plains, New York, the WTA gave her an ultimatum: tennis or charity. “You have to quit doing this. It’s not helping those kids. And it’s making us look bad,” Jaeger recalls being told. She was baffled.Injuries tend to plague young professional athletes. Part of this is the wear and tear that specialization in a sport, defined as competing for at least nine months of the year, requires. When there’s no off time, there’s less time for muscles to heal. (It’s no surprise then that Liu has had multiple hip surgeries.)Popkin noticed a problem that came up time and again when treating young athletes’ injuries. After the injuries began to heal, some children would avoid their sport. “There was a psychological component to overcome as well. There were some similarities with PTSD,” Popkin says. Along with other surgeons and psychologists at Columbia University, he shared his findings in a paper this past summer. They found that young athletes who tear their ACL, have “emotional trauma, anxiety, symptoms of hyperarousal, avoidance of their activity.” The problem, Popkin says, is that for “a lot of kids, particularly if they specialize early, their identity is wrapped up in their sport.”Smith has seen the same thing. “You have someone who has just done one sport, and they don’t think of themselves as good students, they don’t think of themselves as artists, they don’t think of themselves as anything but their sport, and then they blow out a knee or they have an ACL tear, or they’ve got one too many concussions, whatever it is, then what?”For Jaeger, that point was put to her starkly after she blew out her shoulder in the first round of the 1984 French Open. After she defaulted the match, she says a reporter came up to her and told her: “You will never amount to anything ever again now that you can no longer play tennis. She now recalls: “People didn’t talk to me for years, years because I was no longer of value.”But Jaeger had other plans. “My shoulder popped, and I was like ‘OK, God decided I go help kids full time.’” It took her a few more years to leave professional tennis, but when she did, used her winnings to begin The Little Star Foundation, a charity for children with cancer she still runs today.Many people point to Jaeger as an example of a child prodigy who lost her childhood. Jaeger doesn’t see it that way. “I had a great childhood. I traveled my juniors. I went to Australia at age 10, South Africa at age 13.” Jaeger missed her prom, but “I just wasn’t that kid,” she says. “I chose to be on the circuit. I chose to turn pro. My parents did not make me do it.”For now, Liu’s season is over. Her latest trip wasn’t for ice skating, but for fun. Along with her family, friends and Lipetsky’s family, she headed to Disneyland this past weekend. “That is our tradition we have after the season is over,” Lipetsky said.When asked whether 13 is too young to compete as an elite athlete, Lipetsky says that everyone progresses at their own rate. “Age is just a number and she should not he criticized for her age … she has proved to everyone that she deserves to be a professional athlete.”Jaeger agrees. “If they’re succeeding, how can you stop them?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/501a4fea5bcd250ad29a4a617b880ed0606844eb/0_83_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2aca44a8a352bdc339d47e63512d4be","title":"wales alun wyn jones six nations england","story":"With his 132nd Test on Saturday the captain will move within 16 caps of Richie McCaw – and England should expect to be hit by an elemental forceSome statistics in rugby are barely worth collating. The “most carries” column, for example, does not necessarily reveal whether a player had a good or even a moderate all-round game. “Metres made” does not show the speed or subtle angles at which they were covered. The number of passes a team makes matters less than their accuracy, their timing and how often they split the opposing defence.One list, however, never lies. It remains the original and the truest measure of a player’s ultimate worth: how often was he or she deemed good enough to represent their national side? To play international rugby even once is an achievement to play it virtually non-stop for well over a decade, collecting more than a century of caps and multiple trophies, is to enter the realms of the superhuman.Most normal people would be hospitalised within 30 seconds of exposure to the ultra-physical professional game. Now imagine the fitness, resilience and bloodymindedness required to cope with 131 Tests in one of the sport’s most demanding positions. Take a look at Alun Wyn Jones during the anthems in Cardiff on Saturday and ask how many lock forwards have been more pivotal to their national team’s identity than Jones for his beloved Wales.Try telling the Welsh captain he has played in an era of cheap, confetti caps. If anything the game grows steadily less forgiving. Wales have had plenty of fine second‑row forwards, from Brian Price, Delme Thomas, Roy John and Rhys Williams to Allan Martin, Bob Norster and Gareth Llewellyn, but Wales’s current captain has outdone them all. When he takes the field for his 132nd Test on Saturday (including nine for the British \u0026amp Irish Lions), he will move within 16 caps of Richie McCaw, the world’s most garlanded international player, and just a couple short of Wales’s all-time record holder Gethin Jenkins.It is a few years now since the  was brave – or foolhardy – enough to ask Jones if his career might conceivably have been easier had he been born English. The response was unequivocal. “I’d have moved to Wales. Because I’d rather be Welsh.” He might be a father now, but those who rubbed shoulders with him on the 2017 Lions tour to New Zealand still testify to his enduring competitiveness. “People like Alun Wyn have an aura about them,” England’s Jamie George said this week. “He was a big leader on that Lions tour, he is respected around the rugby world and he’s a brilliant player. To have done what he has done is very impressive.”All of which brings us to the nagging doubt in the back of English minds this week. On recent form the visitors should theoretically be good enough to beat Wales on Saturday on paper, even without Mako Vunipola, Maro Itoje and Chris Ashton, they still have an array of weaponry. But what if Owen Farrell limps off after five minutes and Wales gain an early foothold? What price then any sense of pre-game complacency in the baying Welsh colosseum?Under those kind of circumstances, Jones’s influence becomes increasingly apparent. Smart enough to talk proactively to referees, proud enough to keep on pounding away until the end ... if England do win, it will not be through any deficit of Welsh spirit. “They’ve got a few figureheads, especially in their pack,” George said. “Alun Wyn’s a big talisman for them, Ken Owens is another one, Ross Moriarty to a certain extent. They’ve got a few guys who set the tone.”Quite so. You will not find the word “hwyl” on the stats sheets, nor any definitive measures of a player’s heart and soul. In theory, at 33, Alun Wyn should be entering the twilight zone of a fine career. Regardless, shortly after 4.45pm this Saturday, England should still expect to be hit by an elemental force clad in red. If ever there was a day made for Wales’s skipper to channel his inner Dylan Thomas and rage against the dying of the light, this is it.Might a Welsh victory this weekend be written in the stars? The following sequence would certainly suggest so ... in the corresponding fixtures in 1949, 1959, 1969, 1979, 1989, 1999 and 2009 Wales have beaten England every time. Should the pattern repeat itself, Eddie Jones’s squad can hardly claim they were not forewarned.Last season there were just four away wins in the entire Six Nations tournament. It was the same in 2017. This time around, conversely, there have been four already in the opening two rounds, with home wins this weekend potentially once again in the minority. In theory that is healthy for the competition, which thrives on unpredictability of outcome. In practice, however, the tournament organisers would ideally prefer three home wins for France, Wales and Italy. In that event, the 2019 title race would go right down to the wire."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41df9a079efe47c7a28b839627b911c92565f06a/0_199_4212_2529/master/4212.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fda7851624f7e65e0868116eb85c7cc3","title":"alabama kkk editorial goodloe sutton resign doug jones","story":"Members of Congress including Doug Jones and Terri Sewell called for Goodloe Sutton of the Democrat-Reporter to resignAlabama members of Congress have called for the resignation of a newspaper editor who wrote an editorial calling for a resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan.Goodloe Sutton, the editor and publisher of the Democrat-Reporter in the small town of Linden, told the Montgomery Advertiser that he authored the editorial, which was headlined: “Klan needs to ride again.”“Time for the Ku Klux Klan to night ride again,” the article begins, denouncing politicians the author says are attempting to raise taxes in Alabama. “Seems like the Klan would be welcome to raid the gated communities up there.”Alabama senator Doug Jones denounced the editorial and called for Sutton to resign.“OMG! What rock did this guy crawl out from under? This editorial is absolutely disgusting and he should resign – NOW!” he said in a tweet on Monday night. “I have seen what happens when we stand by while people-especially those with influence- publish racist, hateful views. Words matter. Actions matter. Resign now!”The 14 February editorial in the paper sparked outrage after Chip Brownlee, the editor-in-chief of the Auburn Plainsman at Auburn University, posted a photo of it on Twitter on Monday. “Check the date. A paper published this in 2019. Wow,” he said.Sutton defended the article in his comments to the Montgomery Advertiser and went further, calling for officials in Washington to be lynched.“If we could get the Klan to go up there and clean out DC, we’d all been better off,” Sutton said. “We’ll get the hemp ropes out, loop them over a tall limb and hang all of them.”Asked why he was promoting a violent white supremacist organization, Sutton reiterated on his support for the Klan. “A violent organization? Well, they didn’t kill but a few people,” he said. “The Klan wasn’t violent until they needed to be.”Sutton and his tiny newspaper drew national attention two decades ago for their reporting on corruption by a local sheriff, receiving a congressional citation and being discussed as a potential Pulitzer prize contender.Congresswoman Terri Sewell also demanded the publisher step down. “For the millions of people of color who have been terrorized by white supremacy, this kind of ‘editorializing’ about lynching is not a joke – it is a threat,” she said in a tweet. “These comments are deeply offensive and inappropriate, especially in 2019. Mr Sutton should apologize and resign.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d237a03ae3fec77bbc5cb038ff90a70ab563ff9/0_225_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28fc449c79e68ab3efc538fa6768591d","title":"bernie sanders announces 2020 run presidency","story":"Bernie Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont whose 2016 presidential campaign helped energize the progressive movement and reshaped the Democratic party, has entered the 2020 race for the White House.Sanders, a self-styled Democratic socialist who spent much of his nearly 30-year congressional career on the political fringe, cast his candidacy as the best way to accomplish the mission he started three years ago when he ran against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination.“Together, you and I and our 2016 campaign began the political revolution,” he said in an email to supporters on Tuesday morning. “Now, it is time to complete that revolution and implement the vision that we fought for.”Sanders, 77, running as a Democrat again, believes he can prevail in a crowded and erse field that includes several female and minority candidates, and then beat Donald Trump, whom he called on Tuesday “the most dangerous president in modern American history”.Asked in an interview on CBS on Tuesday morning what would be different about his 2020 campaign, Sanders replied: “We’re gonna win.”Whether he can once again capture grassroots support, and whether the energy of his past campaign will pass to other candidates, will likely be a central factor in determining who Democrats nominate to take on the sitting president.The progressive policies Sanders helped popularize in 2016 – Medicare for All, a $15-an-hour federal minimum wage, tuition-free college, demands to fight climate change more aggressively and to tax the wealthy at a higher rate – have now been broadly embraced by several other presidential candidates.Sanders wrore: “Three years ago, during our 2016 campaign, when we brought forth our progressive agenda we were told that our ideas were ‘radical’ and ‘extreme’. Well, three years have come and gone. And, as result of millions of Americans standing up and fighting back, all of these policies and more are now supported by a majority of Americans.”Sanders will face opposition from moderate Democrats and from Republicans who are likely to use his candidacy to paint the party as too liberal. In a preview of Trump’s re-election campaign, the president used his State of the Union speech this month to warn against what he said was the creep of socialism in America.Trump 2020 campaign spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said in a statement: “Bernie Sanders has already won the debate in the Democrat primary, because every candidate is embracing his brand of socialism.“But the American people will reject an agenda of sky-high tax rates, government-run health care and coddling dictators like those in Venezuela. Only President Trump will keep America free, prosperous and safe.”Sanders made clear on Tuesday that he plans to go after Trump directly in his campaign.In an interview with Vermont Public Radio, where he first announced his bid, he said: “I think the current occupant of the White House is an embarrassment to our country. think he is a pathological liar. I also think he is a racist, a sexist, a homophobe, a xenophobe, somebody who is gaining cheap political points by trying to pick on minorities, often undocumented immigrants.”After a midterm election cycle that saw women and minority candidates sweep to power, the nominating contest is likely to be fought not only over ideology but over identity and electoral strategy. Already, the 2020 candidates are being pushed on how they can appeal to the Democrats’ broad range of demographic groups, which includes working-class families, black and Latino voters, suburban women and young people.This year, Sanders apologized publicly and privately to former female staffers after allegations of sexual harassment by male staffers on his 2016 campaign. He has also stumbled on questions about race, despite a years-long effort to improve his standing with minority voters.Still, no candidate will enter the race with as many advantages as Sanders, who ended the 2016 primary with more than 13m votes and nearly $230m raised, much of it through small donations. Now he begins a second run not as a political outsider but as a top-tier candidate with near-universal name recognition, a dedicated following and an unrivaled donor list.Yet he will likely face far greater scrutiny, in a growing field already populated by colleagues and allies including the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, his closest friend in Congress.Senators Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota have all entered the race, as have lower-profile contenders including the former San Antonio mayor and federal housing secretary Julián Castro and Pete Buttigieg, the young mayor of South Bend, Indiana.The former vice-president Joe Biden, former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke and billionaire businessman Michael Bloomberg are all weighing whether to run.With a fractured Democratic field, advisers believe Sanders’ core support, should he retain it over the next year, will be enough to power his campaign in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, the early voting states that helped lift his 2016 campaign.He is likely to benefit from a campaign waged by his allies to reform the party’s primary process, which succeeded in stripping voting power from the so-called “superdelegates”, a major source of controversy in 2016 when Sanders lost the battle for the nomination to Clinton.Born to Jewish parents with roots in Poland and Russia, Sanders grew up poor in a cramped apartment in Brooklyn, New York. He graduated from the University of Chicago, where he became involved in the civil rights movement. In 1981, he was elected mayor of Burlington, Vermont. In 1990, Sanders became the state’s sole representative in Congress, where he served until he joined the Senate in 2006.Following the election of Trump, Sanders published a book titled Our Revolution: A Future to Believe In. He has four children and is married to Jane O’Meara, a former president of Burlington College and his closest adviser."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17ac625fbcc16839a4d151de1f76aed51b5f9fe2/0_82_2248_1349/master/2248.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73d439c4dfdad41a30afaeadd9b8658b","title":"cowboys politics climate immigration poetry nevada","story":"At the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering in Nevada, friends and performers with wide-ranging views met to discuss climate change, immigration and other concerns ‘without demonizing each other’Several weeks ahead of the 35th annual National Cowboy Poetry Gathering in Elko, Nevada, Gail Steiger, a rancher and singer-songwriter from Yavapai county, Arizona, emailed a proposal to a small host of close friends and fellow performers.“None of us fit easily in any box, but we all hold each other in high regard,” he wrote.“If we can’t talk to each other about the future course of our country, who can?“Maybe,” he added, “we could see if old friends can at least have a conversation about these issues without demonizing each other.”Steiger was proposing a political rendezvous amongst friends – some Republicans, some Democrats, some in the wild, open range in between – who have largely avoided the subject for their more than 30-year history together.In other circles, Steiger’s request may have seemed commonplace. At the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering, a weeklong festival of western poetry and song cherished by thousands for its cultivation of community, it was a perilous suggestion. More than a few performers, they say, have shot themselves in the foot proselytizing in Elko. Of the five poets Steiger initially invited to participate in his offsite roundtable, two respectfully declined.The rodeo poet Paul Zarzyski, a diehard liberal from Great Falls, Montana, was one of them.“These people are so locked in. I was going to run head-on in that room,” he later told me. “I didn’t need that here. Elko might be the one place I can come to and disconnect. When I go back, I’m going to be looking on Huffington Post in the morning. I’m going to be watching MSNBC. I’m going to be thrown right back in again and this is a little sanctuary for five or six days.”The rest of them quietly gathered in the old Hotel West, the Basque steakhouse next door boisterous with tourists and townies, the blinking lights of Elko’s tiny brothel district visible from the back door. They sat around a large dining room table, discussing climate change and immigration, passing the “talking stick” back and forth and striving unsuccessfully – like newcomers to a board game – to follow the rigid guidelines of a Socratic dialogue: more questions, fewer opinions.The son of a rancher and five-term Arizona congressman, Gail Steiger grew up with “a different brand of politics”. He used to accompany his father Sam to the weekly meetings of the Arizona delegation, and though all but one of them were Republican, he says, the lone Democrat commanded equal respect at the table.“They’d laugh about that, but they were friends! They would sit down and say, What is best for Arizona? They really tried hard to do that.”But he’d never harbored any particular fantasy of a career in politics, not after watching the way it skewed so many simple encounters into perverse transactions, everyone “blowing smoke” to gain access to his father. After he dropped out of college to help run his father’s Senate campaign in 1976, he shut the door on politics for good, suddenly all too aware of just how manipulative and hollow the enterprise could be. The final straw was an encounter with the then governor, Ronald Reagan, who agreed to endorse his father.“He stands right on his mark and he looks at that camera and in one take – you would have sworn that he and my father had known each other their whole lives and they were just like this,” he says, crossing his fingers. “This guy had sincerity like you wouldn’t believe.”Finally disillusioned by politics, Steiger earned a business degree in Colorado, took a summer job working cattle back in Arizona and gradually fell in love with the work he’s been running cattle ever since. He credits the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering with shifting his perspective on environmental stewardship. The forum in Elko, which mixes ranchers and environmentalists, conservatives and liberals, helped him see what both groups have in common – an intimate connection to the land.“If climate science suggesting we should take steps to reduce our use of fossil fuels …is in error,and we take the suggested action anyway, the downside will be that we’ve left more fossil fuel in the ground for our descendants,” he wrote to those involved in the roundtable discussion. “If the preponderance of climate science is correct, and we do nothing to alter our carbon footprint, the downside will be that we’ve rendered our planet uninhabitable for humans and many other species, all for the short term gains of those who currently benefit most from the status quo.”Steiger’s views on immigration stem primarily from his own experience working with undocumented immigrants in Arizona, the “overwhelming majority” of whom he found “to be honest, hardworking people who did their jobs, supported their families and paid their taxes”. He’d rather see the US focus its time and money on the “economic conditions, lawlessness, violence and desperation that causes people in Mexico and Central America to seek asylum here”.Born and raised on a ranch near Jiggs, Nevada, a ghost town 36 miles south of Elko, Waddie Mitchell quit school at 16 years old. Like the cattlemen and “true cowboys” he idolized as kid, he soon found himself starting colts for a nearby ranch and living alone in a tiny bunkhouse with little but his own imagination to occupy him.That first winter alone, he was desperate for thicker gloves and new boots his parents sent him a box of old books instead. “I thought it was the worst present ever,” he says. But the isolation got the best of him. He finally ed in. “To this day, I think it was the best present I ever got.”It planted the first seed of what would later become a full-time career in the arts, writing and performing cowboy poetry for audiences across the country, from Elko to The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. In between, he’d buckaroo all over the west, serve a tour in Vietnam, break horses for the US Cavalry in Fort Carson, Colorado, get married, raise five kids, and help found the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering in 1985.In recent years, Mitchell has been an outspoken supporter of the Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, whose refusal to pay federal grazing fees led to an armed standoff in 2014 with government agents. Mitchell has written a host of op-eds for the local newspaper arguing against government overreach and the Bureau of Land Management’s treatment of ranchers whose roots in the area predate the enforcement of grazing limits on federal lands.“We should not allow these unconstitutional, martial law minded BLM globs to abuse power THEY GAVE THEMSELVES, against citizens who, unlike the tax suckers, actually produce something,” he wrote in the Elko Daily Free Press in January 2016.Like the poet John Dofflemyer at the other end of the table, Mitchell stops short of declaring global warming a manmade issue, but he calls the increase in extreme weather events in his lifetime “substantial” and says he stands with “the scientists, not the petroleum pamphlets, on this one.Vess Quinlan was 10 years old when he contracted polio. One day he was helping his uncle break horses on a ranch near Eagle, Colorado. The next he was “crippled”, he says, confined to the hospital for a year, subject to the doctors’ whims and his mother’s whimsey, neither of which allowed for even the slightest suggestion of a return to the ranch. He killed the time reading Will James and the poems his grandmother had clipped from the livestock papers and collected in a shoebox, tranquillized by a stiff cocktail of existential despair.His mother eventually moved the family to Pueblo, Colorado, where his teachers tried their best to steer him towards more intellectual pursuits. But the cowboy never left him, and his heart remained at the ranch.“It created this huge conflict with everybody around me. With my folks, with my teachers. And that’s my little problem with authority.”At 15, he ran away from home and spent the rest of his teenage years hiring himself out at various ranches, earning $20 a month and attending roughly nine high schools before finally cobbling together enough credits to graduate. He kept working as a ranch hand until he met his wife, who purchased a farm and ranch in the San Luis Valley. They’ve lived there ever since.Quinlan doesn’t question whether the climate is changing – it always has, he says – but he’s hardly convinced it’s a manmade issue, nor does he place any faith in warnings from “publish-or-perish scientists and professors” whom he believes are often bought and paid for by corporate interests. “The same agencies and scientists that are now predicting manmade global disaster,” he says, were predicting the same when he first moved to the valley in 1970.“But it didn’t really matter: the experts were predicting a coming famine because other farmers were even dumber than me and allowing erosion to wash all their topsoil into the Gulf of Mexico and would soon be trying to plant their soybeans on bedrock,” he wrote. “And besides, we were running out of fossil fuel and would soon be reading by candlelight and canning our meat. What meat we had left was from ranchers even dumber than farmers who were destroying their pastures by overgrazing.”Like Steiger, he’s worked with many undocumented immigrants over the years, almost all of whom were “decent people and good hands”. If he were living in the same conditions they fled from, he says – the cartel violence and economic despair – he’d do the same.“I would be here asking John for a job picking fruit in his orchards, or asking Gail for day work on the Spider Ranch. If caught and sent back, I would start walking north as soon as I got off the bus.”And though he believes America has a responsibility to “develop a fair, affordable, and accessible immigration system”, he also considers tight border security a moral imperative: “I think it is immoral when we steal the best and brightest from poor countries by not controlling our border. Most of the illegals I worked with over the years were a credit to this country and would have … been a credit to their own if given a chance at a decent life.”Zarzyski grew up in awe of his father, an iron ore miner in Hurley, Wisconsin, and the brute force with which he approached every facet of his life, whether a mile deep in the hematite mine or “making firewood”.From an early age, he learned to throw his everything into everything. It’s an ethic he carried to graduate school at the University of Montana, where he studied poetry under the celebrated American poet Richard Hugo and began competing as a bareback bronc rider. He kept at both until his mid-30s, subsisting on occasional winnings from the rodeo circuit, meager paychecks from a part-time teaching gig at the university, and the scraps he earned from his published work. Serendipitously, just as his body began to give out, he found a wider community for his work through the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering.Few who are familiar with his work would be shocked to learn Zarzyski – one of the few here to write in mostly free verse – is liberal. Still, he makes it a point to step aside from politics each year when he enters Elko county, and he has dedicated more than a few poems to close friends across the aisle.“If you’re asking, ‘Do I bring it out in the open verbally?’ the answer is no. It would be an extreme violation of all the goodness this gathering has stood for,” he says. “I have witnessed year after year people making pilgrimages here because they’re in need of something missing from their lives that they can’t quite articulate, but they had a pretty strong instinct that if they came here, they would be graced with that mecca-something or other, and they almost always inevitably are.”Outside the confines of the Gathering, however, he rarely holds back. Consider the final stanza of his unpublished poem, “Knock-Knock-Knocking On Doomsday’s Door,” which lampoons both humanity’s stupidity in the face of climate change, and the seemingly futile nature of his own work in the face of global crisis.then, exists only to sift its own ashenthrough its own chaliced fingersraised in a pathetic gestureof reckoning, raised to the billowing God-cloud of what was onceeach and every miracle, eachand every mystery, each and everymolecule of merciful matterthis poem held dear—of what wastwice-blest you … me … them … us … it. Cognizant of his own half-Italian, half-Polish ancestry and their passage through Ellis Island, Zarzyski strongly identifies with those immigrants fleeing dire circumstances in their home countries.“They came here to give, as well as to receive… and I’m not convinced that the larger majority of immigrants seeking security and safety for their families today do not harbor similar sensibilities as did our European immigrants,” he writes.“I understand, as well, that the ‘green new deal’ coupled with the long-overdue rebuilding of infrastructure in this country is not the panacea to all that ails us, but I can’t help but wonder just how integral—how ‘symbiotic,’ if you will—are the solutions to immigration and climate change? Bottom line, ‘it’s’ all going to come down to fresh perspectives and an entirely new way of applying hard work, white- and blue-collar work alike, to save us from ourselves, from destroying this glorious orb that gives everyone of us our, and everything its, existence.”A fifth-generation cattleman in Tulare county, California, John Dofflemyer “weaned” himself on the poetry of Gary Snyder, which he first encountered as a teenager while packing mules in the Sierra Nevada. “I ran across his work and just came undone,” he says. “His poetry really spoke to me in that minimalistic form. Gary doesn’t use a lot of multisyllabic words, and I realized, shit, I was capable of writing.”After graduation, he enrolled at the University of Southern California, distractedly studying business, certain “my graduation present would be an AR-15 and some camo gear”. But he failed the draft physical with a bum knee from a rugby injury and instead returned home to work the family ranch full-time. After first performing at the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering in 1989, he launched the quarterly Dry Crik Review, encouraging verse grounded less in the past than the cowboy present, the challenges and opportunities facing ranchers today. Though he no longer prints the physical chapbooks, he continues to publish his own work on the Dry Crik Journal website. Work like The Climate of Change, in which he finally asks:How long can we be entertainedby delusion, the dissolutionof civility, of compassionas the planet preparesfor the business of war –already overstocked with banksDofflemyer often resists crediting human activity for global warming, but either way, he wrote: “It’s only prudent to make provisions for a warmer and drier climate where we can.”As for immigration: “Congress needs to address our immigration policy in a practical and humane way. Separating children from their parents and holding immigrants in concentration camps is no better strategy than completing the construction of a wall that has been tunneled under for decades. Instead of a political bargaining chip, the DACA program needs to be resolved compassionately.”An anti-war demonstrator during his college years, he admits he’s lately grown fatalistic, that he views his own political involvement as “a futile exercise.” And perhaps more importantly, he says, “relationships with neighboring ranchers are too vital and important for us to jeopardize, so it’s out of respect for them and getting along that we don’t discuss politics.”Later that week, as visitors flooded downtown Elko and the group scattered to fulfill their various performance schedules, each of them told me separately they had never held any hopes of changing anyone’s mind and were certain no one had. Still, they were curious to see how the night would play out.A few of them felt the exercise was important, a test of their friendship, an affront to the larger partisan forces currently alienating friends and relatives. Though none of them tested the waters again – certainly not on stage – they regretted little more than their own mismanagement of the dialogue. They had opined too much, or their questions had been too narrow, or they had lost track of the order. They had never gotten around to income inequality.“I don’t have any illusions of saving the world, but you do what you can,” Steiger says. “And I will tell you that I feel a lot better after trying than I did just ranting and raving about those stupid son-of-a-guns who don’t agree with me.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1efef7e30c84f8658466224bf12d2b8b2b35ae1e/0_425_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c517ad23990c9d442054c74e748332f9","title":"powder mountain utah wealth influx summit series local reaction","story":"Utah’s Powder Mountain has seen an influx of monied entrepreneurs, but longtime residents fear something special is being lostWhat bothers Dan Harris the most, he said, on a rickety chair on the porch of his 90-year-old, 800ft “cracker box farm house”, is how the owners of the mountain across the street don’t seem to feel the same devotion to it that he does.As he described it, they have turned “a near-pristine” Utah mountain top where he hiked, hunted and skied as a youth into a landscape studded with holiday homes for high-profile business and media tycoons. “If you want a second vacation home, why use all those resources and space, all this potential wildlife habitat for a place you’re going to visit a couple of times a year?” he said. “It just seems kind of arrogant.”The five co-founders of Summit Series, which promotes events for wealthy entrepreneurs aimed at inspiring progressive values, and several venture capitalists bought the 8,500 acres plus of skiable terrain in 2013. That purchase was partly to save it from “over-development”, according to recently appointed Powder Mountain CEO Gary S Derck.For locals who’ve lived in the rural, largely Mormon community for decades, the sudden presence of millionaires has meant an influx of jobs and money, and better access to skiing slopes. But some worry about an influx of BMWs, Land Rovers and a dollar-drenched cultural shift.Driving along the roads at the top of the mountain, visitors encounter ski-in, ski-out mansions going for upwards of $1.5m. One $2.05m, six-bed mansion comes with a Toyota Rav4  and a snowmobile.Wood frames jut from craggy slopes, the bones of 105 homes that will enjoy stunning views across Utah, Wyoming and Colorado. Powder Mountain promises an exclusive community, where the wealthy and the privileged live so close to the bright blue alpine sky, the real estate promo videos seem to suggest, that they can truly own the top of the world.In an email, Derck, a three-decade veteran of resort developments, was keen to separate the ski resort and its mountain housing developments from Summit Series, long-touted as “Davos for millennials”. Nevertheless, the owners are in large part the same.“The locals request from the beginning has been to preserve the unique character of the mountain by not overcrowding it,” Derck wrote, and that request has been “honored”. He touted jobs in construction and the service-industry generated by Powder Mountain, along with donations and support for local non-profit initiatives. Powder Mountain has spent $700,000 on bike trails open to the public and donated 631 acres of land for wildlife habitat protection.Terry Murphy, the chair of the Ogden Valley Balloon and Artist festival, says she “can’t go along with” those who say Summit’s impact has been overwhelmingly negative. “I’ve seen things they’ve done that are really amazing. They’ve brought in cool programs into the elementary school.” She sees them as “forward thinkers, they’re young, they have money, they are young entrepreneurs, they think out of the box”.Utahns like Jason Carter, who grew up just 20 minutes from Powder Mountain, and learned to snowboard there, are resigned to the fact that what made it so special may be eroded. The Summit founders’ extensive social network in Silicon Valley and beyond, and Powder Mountain’s slick real estate marketing, are attracting an affluent crowd to its slopes, where an adult can ski the season for $880.Carter used to drive 80 miles one way to snowboard at Powder Mountain. “I loved how quiet it was. You usually get the most snow with the least amount of people. It’s still the only place I’d want to go to now.”But since the Summit purchase, he says he has encountered people on the ski lift from every state except Utah. The last time Carter stopped by, he got to the parking lot and found it was overflowing. He stood among the seething crowd, sighed, fought back tears, and drove back home.“Our teeny tiny little mountain is the place to be now. It’s kind of neat. But it’s hard to share.”A few issues in particular have riled some residents of Eden, a 600-strong community at the base of the mountain.Contractor Jeffrey Guthrie said he’s been “fighting a one-man crusade, David taking on Goliath”, having mounted four or five one-man protests several years ago. “I know if I give up, they’ve won.” He is concerned that local children will get sucked into what he sees as Summit’s party-culture lifestyle.He also charges that the owners have been neglectful of the landscape. In June 2013, he visited a wooded grove on the mountain. Along with a manmade pond, there were stations for massages and a cloth-draped metal frame, set up, he believed for yoga or meditation. When a reporter returned to the site five years later, in fall 2018, the pond contained stagnant water, concrete slabs and large pieces of rotting wood. Ropes hung from trees and the rusted climbing frame.Derck said that “plans are in motion to remove the constructed pond”, and the company has hired a retired professor from local Utah State University with a background in forest ecology and environmental science to ensure the firm is operating sustainably. Guthrie “never engaged us in any dialogue”, Derck said, and he alleged that Guthrie threatened staff. (Guthrie denies making any threats. He says he once wore a Toy Story costume to a protest, going as Sheriff Woody, and had an empty holster. But a witness claimed he was carrying a gun.)Graver concerns abound over the region’s lifeblood. “Everybody’s fear in the west is that somebody’s going to intercept their water,” said Harris, a self-described “red neck environmentalist”.Rights to specific quantities of water can be traced back to the arrival of pioneers in the area in the late 1850s, said Dee Staples, a five-generation resident. Staples is also president of Wolf Creek Irrigation Water company, a protagonist in a three-year water rights dispute with Summit Mountain Holding Group, the joint venture company that owns the mountain. Staples and other local water interests protested to the state over the developer’s plans to pull water from a well drilled down from the top of the mountain, amid concerns it would interfere with the preexisting water rights.An agreement was reached in 2016. “We’ve put all our disagreements behind us and we’re moving ahead with a positive attitude so everyone can succeed,” Staples said. As part of the agreement, Summit purchased 15 “shares”, at $10,000 a share, of water from Staples’ firm. None of the 150 shareholders wanted to sell the shares to Summit, Staples said, so in the end he did it himself, “because I recognized if we’re going to be partners in the mountain we need to participate in a friendly manner.”But the cost of hiring a hydrologist and attorneys to defend their water rights, which Staples estimated in the “hundreds of thousands of dollars”, and the shadow of that struggle, lingers.“You have two different cultures trying to mesh into the same community, and that presents some challenges,” Staples said.The incongruities of a rural, agricultural Mormon culture being reshaped by wealth and power are never far from view.On a late Friday afternoon, as locals parked their trucks by the market and headed inside for their weekend groceries, some watched with bemusement. Struggling to maneuver out of the lot, inching back and then forward, was an interloper from another world: a white stretched limo with tinted windows."},{"url":null,"title":"brussels orban jean claude juncker poster george soros hungary","story":"Campaign claims commission president and George Soros are ‘endangering Hungary’s safety’The European commission has accused Viktor Orbán’s government of a propagating a “shocking” and “ludicrous conspiracy theory”, after Hungary launched a poster campaign targeting Jean-Claude Juncker.Opening a new front against Brussels a few months before European elections, the poster shows the European commission president alongside the Hungarian-American philanthropist George Soros, a familiar target in Hungary.“You have the right to know what Brussels is planning to do,” the poster says. On its official Facebook page, the Hungarian government says the poster is part of an information campaign to tell the public about Brussels’ migration plans, which it claims “fundamentally endangered Hungary’s safety”.Although the government has previously run a “Stop Brussels” campaign, the decision to use an image of Junker is an escalation in the Orbán government’s public relations war with the EU’s most senior leaders.It also exposes the rift in the centre-right European People’s party in the European parliament, which counts Juncker and , Orbán, as members.In an unusually forceful rebuttal against a member state, Juncker’s chief spokesman, Margaritis Schinas, said the commission had made a commitment “to fight disinformation and fake news” and this case was no exception.“The Hungarian government campaign beggars belief,” he said. “It is shocking that such a ludicrous conspiracy theory has reached the mainstream to the extent it has. There is no conspiracy. Hungarians deserve facts not fiction.”Juncker and Orbán have long had awkward relations. In 2014 Orbán, along with the then UK prime minister, David Cameron, failed in an attempt to block Juncker from becoming commission president. Juncker once met Orbán with the jokey greeting “hello, dictator” and playfully tapped his face. But the animus on Hungary’s side deepened when the EU forced through mandatory refugee quotas in 2015 at the height of a humanitarian crisis.Hungary has always refused to take refugees under the quotas and continues to block an EU law that proposes a permanent redistribution system for asylum seekers. The poster refers to this theme, stating: “They want to introduce compulsory relocation quotas.”The government campaign also accuses Juncker and Soros of wanting “to weaken member states’ rights to protect their own borders” and claims “they want …migrants’ visas”. EU leaders have repeatedly stressed their desire to strengthen Europe’s borders in recent years, a policy that many diplomats say was influenced by Orbán’s approach.It was not immediately clear what the Hungarian government meant by “migrants’ visas”. The EU has a little-used blue-card scheme, modelled on the US green card that is intended to attract skilled labour. Under the scheme, member states decide how many non-EU migrants they admit.The commission rejected the Hungarian claims. “There is no ‘they’, only the European Union with Hungary sitting at the table,” Schinas said. “It is not true that the EU supports or undermines border protection. Quite the contrary. And there are zero plans for so-called humanitarian visas. Member states decide to what level they want to accept legal migration.”Orbán was re-elected for a third straight term last April, after a campaign dominated by immigration. A long-term critic of the EU, Orbán has accused NGOs and critical media of being part of a plot orchestrated by Soros to send millions of people to Hungary.In recent weeks, Orbán has spoken of his hopes that the next European parliament will be dominated by anti-immigration parties."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c96e2e28dedcd138b6136b2da00be852f3a2055e/0_508_6432_3860/master/6432.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40ae1a59b3be2880e3ffb024d9e265ab","title":"palestinians patrol hebron israel ejects foreign peacekeepers","story":"Volunteers in blue uniforms begin escorting Palestinian children past Israeli settlers to schoolPalestinian activists in the flashpoint city of Hebron have started patrols to prevent attacks by settlers after Israel’s widely criticised expulsion of an international observer mission.The Temporary International Presence in Hebron (TIPH) was first established more than two decades ago after a far-right Jewish extremist murdered 29 Muslims at a mosque in the city.TIPH has since monitored and documented altercations in the West Bank city, in particular between Palestinians, the Israeli army and members of a several hundred-strong ultranationalist settler movement who live in heavily fortified districts.The body’s forces, a team of 64 observers from Italy, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey, had escorted Palestinian children who needed to walk past settler areas to get to school.“Their absence is a big gap,” said Issa Amro, a local activist leader who set up the civilian patrol of 18 volunteers, all wearing blue uniforms with the word “observer” written in English, Arabic and Hebrew. “We escort kids to schools, we try to document human rights violations using video cameras … we try to protect Palestinian homes,” he said.As soon as he began a week ago, Amro’s mission drew anger from settlers. He published a video of a woman slapping him and other volunteers being pushed around.More than 200,000 Palestinians live in Hebron, the occupied West Bank’s largest city. But the presence of settlers has effectively shut down local life in the main souk as army checkpoints cut off the area.Central to the volatility is Hebron’s leading holy site, which Jews call the Tomb of the Patriarchs while Muslims refer to it as the Ibrahimi mosque, after the patriarch Abraham, a key figure for both faiths.Last month, Benjamin Netanyahu announced that the mission’s mandate would not be renewed, saying Israel would not “allow the continuation of an international force that acts against us”.The move was interpreted as a nod to domestic far-right voters as Netanyahu seeks re-election in April. TIPH has been the focus of controversy in Israel recently after one of its observers was deported for slapping an Israeli child and another was filmed puncturing the tyres of a settler’s vehicle.The ejection of the observers drew widespread international condemnation. In a joint statement, TIPH member countries said it undermined one of the few established mechanisms for conflict resolution between Israelis and Palestinians. The EU said it risked further deteriorating the already fragile situation on the ground.Chris Eijkemans, the local representative for Oxfam, said the departure was “a dangerous green light for more violence”.Most world powers consider settlements to be illegal under international law, which forbids the transfer of civilians into occupied land. Settler violence against Palestinians living in the West Bank has been rising since the beginning of 2017, according to the UN. Incidents often follow attacks by Palestinians against Israelis.While TIPH observers were never authorised to interfere in incidents or disputes, they patrolled seven days a week and their mandate intended their presence to give “a feeling of security to the Palestinians of Hebron”.Amro says his volunteers are not as well trained as the TIPH, but more importantly, they do not have diplomatic backing. While Israeli soldiers could not force TIPH observers away from any areas of Hebron, his group has been banned from parts of the city after the army declared it a closed military zone.After the TIPH observers packed up, he said: “The soldiers are acting differently, the settlers are acting differently.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c77e09573002530b161046cef6c2e9f66ae09b6/0_0_900_540/master/900.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2c858adb943711adf084a713ec4d7ca","title":"sharm el sheikh locals lament wall going up around resort","story":"Project aims to recoup lost tourism income since downing of Russian plane in SinaiEgyptian authorities have started work on a concrete barrier around the Sinai resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh, which has struggled to attract tourists since a Russian passenger jet crashed in the region shortly after taking off in 2015 in a terrorism-linked attack, killing 224 people.Despite photographic evidence to the contrary, the governor of South Sinai denied a wall was being built.“It’s not a wall, who told you it’s a wall. We don’t have a wall,” said General Khaled Fouda. The project, he said, consisted of a mix of high concrete barriers and at least 37km of razor-wire fence, with “four very beautiful doors” to access the town.It was intended to “beautify and secure Sharm el-Sheikh”, he said. “We are doing this for the future. The project will help Sharm el-Sheikh recoup lost tourism revenues.”Photos and video show the construction of a concrete barrier estimated to be up to six metres high, which residents fear will encircle the perimeter of the town.Similar plans for a wall around the town were considered by the South Sinai authorities in 2005 but scrapped. Fouda declined to state why the project had been revived.Kelly Walmsley, a manager at the Rixos resort in Sharm el-Sheikh, said she had not been informed about the work. “To be honest, nobody really understands what’s going on,” she said.A resident, who asked not to be named, said checkpoints and cameras already surrounded the town to provide security. “For us residents, it’s ridiculous. The beauty of the place is being covered up with a fence. Sharm el-Sheikh is well-known for its mountains and desert – this thing will destroy the view,” the resident said. “This security barrier isn’t going to make a difference, it will just annoy people more and it won’t stop terrorism. It’s a joke. Any tourist coming out of the city will be worried they’re not safe – this will affect tourism.”The wall will also cut off Bedouin communities in the surrounding desert area, a likely point of contention especially after authorities enlisted the Bedouin to help combat jihadi elements elsewhere in Sinai. “This wall tells the Bedouin that they’re not part of the community – it sends the message that they’re not worth protecting from terrorism,” said the resident.A ban on direct flights from the UK to Sharm el-Sheikh is still in place after the jet attack. The Egyptian authorities have since enhanced security measures at Sharm el-Sheikh airport, hoping for the return of flights from Russia and the UK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d105bcc326bfcf5ac9595278f9e0fe9acfe0eaf6/0_374_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db4d7716ba7aa3665bdee4df21f3961c","title":"vatican reveals secret rules for priests who father children","story":"Spokesman says guidelines for those who break celibacy vows will not be made publicThe Vatican has acknowledged for the first time the existence of secret guidelines for priests who break their vows of celibacy and father children.The document requests that a cleric who has fathered a child leaves the priesthood to “assume his responsibilities as a parent by devoting himself exclusively to the child”. Gisotti told CBS News that the document was “for internal use … and is not intended for publication”.Survivors of clerical sexual abuse from around the world are gathering in Rome this week to hold vigils and protests outside an unprecedented summit of senior bishops and other church figures called by Pope Francis.The number of children born to priests is unknown although one support group, Coping International, has 50,000 users in 175 countries. Some children are the result of consensual relationships, but others are the result of rape or abuse.According to Vincent Doyle, the son of a priest and the founder of Coping International, the issue of clerical offspring is “the next scandal” to confront the church. “There are kids everywhere,” he told the New York Times.A commission set up by Francis to tackle clerical sexual abuse was tasked with looking at how the church should respond to the issue of priests’ offspring. Irish bishops have published their own guidelines, saying that if a priest becomes a father, the “wellbeing of his child should be his first consideration”. The document adds: “A priest, as any new father, should face up to his responsibilities – personal, legal, moral and financial. At a minimum, no priest should walk away from his responsibilities.”Some people have argued the Roman Catholic church should drop its requirement for priests to take a lifelong vow of celibacy. They say it may be a factor in sexual abuse, and that it deters people from signing up for the priesthood, with many countries now having an acute shortage of priests.The eastern Catholic churches have a long tradition of married priests, and exceptions to the celibacy rule have been made on a case-by-case basis for former Anglican priests who convert to Catholicism.But last month, Francis said he was opposed to any general change to the centuries-old tradition. “Personally, I think that celibacy is a gift to the church,” he said. “I would say that I do not agree with allowing optional celibacy, no.”Exceptions could be considered in “very far places” where there was “a pastoral necessity” owing to a lack of priests, he said."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/03/28/TELEMMGLPICT000157004915_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"democrats 2020 could bernie sanders americas jeremy corbyn finally","story":"A lifelong political outsider, Bernie Sanders rose to international prominence during the 2016 campaign Bernie Sanders\u0027 singular refusal to compromise the principles of his left-wing crusade have helped earn him the nickname America\u0027s Jeremy Corbyn.In policy terms there certainly are similarities, although Mr Sanders sits somewhat to the right of Mr Corbyn.

Some women prostrate themselves on the floor in prayer.In the sparse formerly industrial building, its interior brightened by touches of gold paint, a speaker reminds the group of a list of banned activities — no smoking, no drinking of alcohol, no practicing of black magic.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialIn a street outside, a pastor flicks holy water over the car of a woman who wants a blessing to ward off the risk of accidents.The busy scene at the Celestial Church of Christ is repeated at a half a dozen other African Christian temples on the same drab street and in the adjacent roads – one corner of the thriving African church community in south London.Created with Sketch.African churches boom in London’s backstreets Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Worshippers sing as they offer thanksgiving during Sunday service at the New Jerusalem Parish, a celestial Christian church.

Some pastors take worshippers for full immersion baptisms in the cold of the Thames Estuary. Others believe that when congregants suddenly start speaking in unknown languages it marks the presence of the Holy Spirit.But the researchers from the University of Roehampton found things that many churches have in common, including a drive for professional advancement, a commitment to spend three hours or more at Sunday service and typically very loud worship.“That is how we express our joy and gratitude to God,” says Andrew Adeleke, a senior pastor at the House of Praise, one of the biggest African churches in Southwark, in a former theatre.“The church is not supposed to be a graveyard,“ Adeleke says. “It is supposed to be a temple of celebration and worship and the beauty is to be able to express our love to God, even when things are not perfect in our lives.”For some, the noise from amplified services is a problem, leading to complaints to local authorities from residents.But many churches face bigger challenges than unhappy neighbours: some provide food for people struggling to make ends meet, or work with young people at risk of recruitment by gangs.With clubs, churches and motorcycles, Berlin becomes home for migrantsAndrew Rogers, who led the University of Roehampton researchers, says pastors have to juggle retaining the churches’ African identity while appealing to children of first-generation immigrants, many of whom have never lived outside Britain.They typically have a more liberal world view which can be hard to reconcile with conservative Pentecostal teachings.Rogers recalls speaking to one pastor who lamented he was unable to talk about religious miracles to his children.“If the church doesn’t adapt, then they are going to leave and look elsewhere,” Rogers says.Reporting by William Schomberg, ReutersWe’ll tell you what’s true.

And they could be as big a change as when the wires dropped out of Apple\u0027s existing headphones and they were first born.Introduced in 2016, the two truly wireless earphones haven\u0027t been updated since. They came with a wide range of futuristic features – but a range of rumours have swirled around them about new updates, that would bring new and even more futuristic features.The AirPods are actually two (or three) different things: the case that protects them and the earphones that sit inside. Until recently, they\u0027d be considered one and the same – but recent leaks have suggested that Apple might update the two separately, with different release dates.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialAccording to recent rumours, the new case is likely to arrive earlier, and maybe soon. It could even be a part of Apple\u0027s March event. The actual release date is probably dependent on when Apple releases the AirPower mat that it\u0027s charging could rely on.The earphones themselves are likely to undergo a more dramatic reinvention. But that could also take longer to arrive. Those could not be updated for some months, according to recent rumours – and perhaps won\u0027t even arrive until September, when the new phones are introduced.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

And most of the rumours focus around how exactly it would do that.New AirPods charging case could come before updated earphonesMost likely, the biggest change in any new case would be the addition of wireless charging. That would allow them to charge up just like a phone, being able to be plonked down a wireless charging puck and then transfer that into its battery as well as the AirPods themselves.Apple has actually teased a new case before, when it announced the AirPower wireless charging mat. It said that a new case would be needed to allow the AirPods to be charged through that new product – but then the new product never actually arrived.The company did say then that the case would be updated but that the existing AirPods would be compatible with the new one. And people would be able to pay a reduced price just to buy the case and update, it made clear – an offer that will presumably stay around with the new earphones.Another rumoured change includes the addition of a new and grippier kind of plastic, which should make the box easier to hold. And if as suggested Apple does introduce new colours of AirPods, such as black, presumably the case will also change colour too.But it\u0027s the earphones that have most of the technology. Rumours have suggested that a whole host of new (and sometimes strange)\u0026nbspfeatures could be coming to the new earbuds.The most likely feature – in part because it\u0027s been apparently revealed by Apple\u0027s own software – is always-on Hey Siri. That will mean that people don\u0027t have to do the uncomfortable move of tapping their own ears to wake the earphones up, and instead just say Hey Siri any time they\u0027re wearing their AirPods to speak with the voice assistant.Other rumoured updates including new health tracking tools. Apple has been keen to get into those features with technology like the Apple Watch, and the inside of people\u0027s ears is a great place to take readings for things like heartbeat and temperature, which could happen with future AirPods.Apple is also likely to improve the performance in less obvious ways. The new buds will probably feature better wireless connectivity, and improved waterproofing.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.420 Avengers: Age of UltronJust in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 720 s of the Galaxy Vol 2The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1020 Ant-Man and the WaspWhile the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 1920 s of the Galaxy Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took.

It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity.

Some suggest that it will ban memes, by forcing websites to automatically check for the use of\u0026nbspany media that is owned by somebody else, and that it could stop websites such as Google and YouTube from working.The blog post from the commission appeared aimed at taking on those criticisms. It referred to campaigners as a mob and suggested they were unwittingly working for websites like Google, YouTube, Facebook and Twitter.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

Samsung\u0027s foldable phone is due to be released in the coming weeks, and other companies are already preparing their own rivals.Other companies have chosen to sit out of the growing trend, however. LG has said that it will not release a foldable phone just yet, and that it was too early for the devices.It might also be that Apple does not reveal a foldable phone at all. The company regularly files patents for products that never actually make it to market, or arrive in a completely different form.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The phones will keep the Lightning cables they have been powered up with for years, allowing owners to keep their existing accessories despite continuing rumours Apple could one day move to using USB-C.The feature would not be entirely new: the Huawei Mate 20 Pro is already able to pass its battery to other phones, with a feature that the company calls reverse wireless charging.Created with Sketch.iPhone XS launch in September 2018 Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.111 Tim Cook speaks about the iPhone XS and XS MaxTim Cook, CEO of Apple, speaks about the iPhone XS and XS Max at an Apple Inc product launch event 211 Tim Cook speaking at the iPhone launchTim Cook, CEO of Apple, speaks on stage at the end of the Apple Inc311 Tim Cook speaking during the event411 Phil Schiller, Apple\u0027s senior vice president of worldwide marketingPhil Schiller, Apple\u0027s senior vice president of worldwide marketing, speaks about the Apple iPhone XS and Apple iPhone XS Max511 Phil Schiller speaks about the new iPhone XRPhilip W.

The main upgrades will include tools that allow the phones to use precise indoor positioning and navigation, a frosted glass casing, better Face ID facial recognition, and bigger batteries.The biggest new feature however is said to be a triple-lens camera, which is endorsed by the new report and has been widely rumoured. That will allow the phone to include a wide, telephoto and ultra-wide lens system, the new report claims.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That was first shown off in 2017, as a wireless charger that could power up AirPods, an iPhone and an Apple Watch at the same time – but despite the promise it would come soon, nothing has been said about it since, and some have even suggested it might not be coming at all.The AirPods themselves will also receive an update. They will include wireless charging capabilities and improve Bluetooth – and might also feature a whole range of other more exciting upgrades.Both the AirPods and AirPower mat are expected to be released in the first half of the year. Apple almost always releases new iPhones in September, and it is not clear when the Macs will arrive.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It remains surprising that one of their few films to evade any nominations is this endlessly quotable mistaken identity comedy starring Jeff Bridges as The Dude.Brian De Palma doesn’t exactly make films in the hope of winning award, but his political thriller - based on Michelangelo Antonioni’s Blow Up – would have deserved any Oscar it was nominated for.Breathless\u0027 failure to receive a nomination is proof that the Oscars can’t be trusted. Despite being one of the most studied films in the world, Jean Luc-Godard’s French masterpiece has an Academy Award tally of zero.The Academy rewarded many notable screwball comedies, though this Howard Hawks-directed standout starring Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn - who’d go on to hold the record for most wins - wasn\u0027t one of them.Courtesy of BFINicolas Roeg, who directed this Venice-set chiller, is one of the most unfairly overlooked directors in Oscars history.  Richard Kelly’s science-fiction mind-bender, which made a star of Jake Gyllenhaal, was a festival favourite upon its debut in 2004. Many expected a screenplay nomination to manifest.1047 The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)It wouldn’t be until the 1990s that western films found favour with the Academy. It was ironically  thanks to Unforgiven, a film directed by Clint Eastwood whose career flourished after starring in this Sergio Leone film that many consider to be the genre’s peak.Mathieu Kassovitz’s black-and-white drama – translated in English as Hate – follows three young friends and their struggles living in the suburbs of Paris.The Academy may not be frothing at the mouth to nominate horror films, but do have previous (see: The Exorcist and The Silence of the Lamb), which makes the absence of John Carpenter’s influential Halloween a glaring oversight.1347 Harold and Maude (1971)This offbeat romantic drama was a critical and commercial flop at the time of release, which probably accounts for its lack of Oscar nominations. Today, though, it’s cult following ensures it remains in good favour with film fans.On paper, the big screen union of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino in Michael Mann’s cop drama was a shoo-in for awards, but no Oscar nominations manifested.Yet another Howard Hawks screwball comedy starring Cary Grant that criminally failed to secure a single Oscar nomination.While falling short of Christopher Nolan’s best,  modest drama Insomnia – made years before Batman Begins – had enough strong performances (Al Pacino, Robin Wiliams, Hilary Swank) to warrant acting nominations. Alas, it received none.Bill Forsyth’s beloved comedy-drama follows the mishaps of an American man sent to buy up a Scottish village where the oil company he works for wants to build a refinery. Forsyth won the Bafta for Best Director, but the film received no such love from the Academy.You’d be mistaken for thinking the “M” stands for “masterpiece” in Fritz Lang’s German drama that follows the manhunt for a serial killer - not that the Academy agreed.Robert Bresson’s adaptation of André Devigny’s memoirs charts the French Resistance member’s time as prisoner of the Germans during World War II, and is even more enthralling considering Bresson himself was held captive years before.Kenneth Lonergan would go on to win an Oscar for Manchester but he Sea, but Margaret - his three-hour plus drama featuring a searing performance from Anna Paquin - failed to secure a single nomination.2147 In the Mood for Love (2000)Wong Kar-wai set the benchmark for romance in film with his acclaimed Hong Kong drama following a man and woman (Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung) who develop feelings for one another after suspecting their respective spouses of having an affair together.2247 The King of Comedy (1982)It may have taken him decades to win an Oscar, but the Academy has rarely balked at nominating Martin Scorsese films – especially for films starring Robert De Niro. The King of Comedy was an exception.Robert Altman’s superior thriller stars Elliott Gould as Raymond Chandler’s private investigator Philip Marlowe in one of the director’s most entertaining films. The director would go on to be the recipient of the Honorary Award in 2006.He may have hosted several times, but Steve Martin has never been nominated for an Oscar. One film he deserved recognition for was Carl Reiner\u0027s 1983 sci-fi comedy, The Man with Two Brains.2547 A Matter of Life and Death (1946)The Academy Film Archive may have preserved A Matter of Life and Death in 1999, but voters failed to recognise the Powell \u0026amp Pressburger’s fantasy-romance at the time of its release in 1946.It may not be credited as his debut, but Mean Streets is very much the first true Martin Scorsese film. The director would go on to win a belated Oscar for The Departed in 2007, but he’d have to wait until 1975 for his first nomination (Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore).No Lars von Trier film has ever been nominated for Best Picture, though Dancer in the Dark came close (it settled for a Best Original Song nomination). He came close with Melancholia, but ultimately, the drama didn\u0027t getDespite being revered as a Coen brothers favourite, not to mention its notable performances from Gabriel Byrne and Albert Finney, Miller’s Crossing is one of few Coen brother films not to receive a single Oscar nomination. 2947 Once Upon a Time in America (1984)Though it\u0027s by no means a masterpiece, it’s staggering to think that Sergio Leone’s gangster epic - starring Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci - didn’t acquire any Oscar nominations (the film\u0027s music was disqualified from consideration after Warner Bros accidentally omitted the composer\u0027s name from the opening credits when trimming the film’s lengthy running time for its American release).Critics assumed Jim Jarmusch’s Paterson would have been a shoo-in for awards recognition - most notably in the Best Actor category, thanks to a quietly fantastic performance from Adam Driver - but no such luck.3147 Paths of Glory (1957)Stanley Kubrick never won Best Director despite being nominated four times.

Today, it’s considered one of his finest works as well as being one of the most revered horror films of all time.3747 The Shop Around the Corner (1953)It may have endured as one of the best loved romcoms of all time, but it has zero Oscar nominations to its name.Japanese director Hirokazo Kore-eda\u0027s portrait of a family over roughly 24 hours as they commemorate the death of the eldest son was a glaring oversight by the Academy.Before he became Disney\u0027s go to, Jon Favreau (Iron Man, The Jungle Book and the forthcoming live-action Lion King) wrote this independent film about the lives of single, unemployed actors living in Hollywood, California during the 1990s swing revival.The 2007 ceremony would have been far better had Shane Meadows\u0027 coming-of-drama been in contention for awards.The Academy deemed Silver Linings Playbook and American Hustle worthy of nominations, but not David O Russell’s Three Kings, which remains one of his greatest films to this day.Tokyo Story is deemed Japanese filmmaker Yasujirō Ozu\u0027s masterpiece and was named Sight \u0026amp Sound\u0027s best film of all time in 2012.4347 Touch of Evil (1958)Orson Welles\u0027 classic noir wasn\u0027t as well loved at the time of release as it is today.Olivia Colman may be in contention for Best Actress at this year’s ceremony, but the fact she failed to earn a nomination (or Bafta, for that matter) for her role in Paddy Considine’s hard-hitting drama Tyrannosaur is one of the biggest oversights in awards history.Another exceptional achievement in filmmaking from Nicolas Roeg that somehow failed to receive any Oscar nominations.Notch it down to bad timing, but Lynne Ramsay’s You Were Never Really Here - starring Joaquin Phoenix - is a sensational piece of work worthy of reward.Three years later, David Fincher would go head-to-head with The King Speech\u0027s Tom Hooper for The Social Network.

It remains surprising that one of their few films to evade any nominations is this endlessly quotable mistaken identity comedy starring Jeff Bridges as The Dude.Brian De Palma doesn’t exactly make films in the hope of winning award, but his political thriller - based on Michelangelo Antonioni’s Blow Up – would have deserved any Oscar it was nominated for.Breathless\u0027 failure to receive a nomination is proof that the Oscars can’t be trusted. Despite being one of the most studied films in the world, Jean Luc-Godard’s French masterpiece has an Academy Award tally of zero.The Academy rewarded many notable screwball comedies, though this Howard Hawks-directed standout starring Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn - who’d go on to hold the record for most wins - wasn\u0027t one of them.Courtesy of BFINicolas Roeg, who directed this Venice-set chiller, is one of the most unfairly overlooked directors in Oscars history.

Many expected a screenplay nomination to manifest.1047 The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)It wouldn’t be until the 1990s that western films found favour with the Academy.

Today, though, it’s cult following ensures it remains in good favour with film fans.On paper, the big screen union of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino in Michael Mann’s cop drama was a shoo-in for awards, but no Oscar nominations manifested.Yet another Howard Hawks screwball comedy starring Cary Grant that criminally failed to secure a single Oscar nomination.While falling short of Christopher Nolan’s best,  modest drama Insomnia – made years before Batman Begins – had enough strong performances (Al Pacino, Robin Wiliams, Hilary Swank) to warrant acting nominations.

The King of Comedy was an exception.Robert Altman’s superior thriller stars Elliott Gould as Raymond Chandler’s private investigator Philip Marlowe in one of the director’s most entertaining films. The director would go on to be the recipient of the Honorary Award in 2006.He may have hosted several times, but Steve Martin has never been nominated for an Oscar.

There’s no cynicism, sneering, or snark here – listening to her naive optimism is like seeing your twitter feed in negative. But the clever thing about Tina Fey’s fast-paced, wise-cracking show is that it isn’t, well, too fey. Kimmy’s zest for life comes from having been held captive in an underground bunker for years rather than being broken by that, she emerges determined to get the most out of life. Four seasons in, there’s still something rather inspiring about that. If you’ve ever dreamt of sacking off the rat race and giving countryside self-sufficiency a try, why not live vicariously through this delightful, warm-hearted Seventies sitcom? Here, though, Tom (Richard Briers) and Barbara (an effortlessly cool Felicity Kendal) don’t quite make it to the countryside, instead attempting to raise goats, pigs, and chickens in their suburban back garden after Tom packs in his corporate job. Buoyed by its wonderful supporting characters, namely the Good’s painfully conventional next-door neighbours Margo and Jerry Leadbetter, The Good Life is an utter joy.310 Pride and PrejudiceThe work of Jane Austen, as a whole, is a kind of the ultimate comfort blanket. She offers us a smart, witty view on the world, where love can be transformative, but should never be pursued at the cost of losing all your senses. The BBC’s 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice captures this feeling, and has dynamism to spare. It’s wistful and romantic without feeling naive, anchored by a relatable heroine in Jennifer Ehle’s Elizabeth Bennet, and (of course) features that swoon-worthy, brooding performance from Colin Firth as Mr Darcy. Then there’s the lake scene – need I say more?Five gay American men do a makeover, and it’s fabulous. That’s the basic premise of Queer Eye, a Netflix reboot that introduced the world to the new Fab Five. Each has their area of expertise – Antoni Porowski teaches cooking, Tan France es into wardrobes, Karamo Brown provides life coaching, Bobby Berk re-designs their homes, and Jonathan Van Ness is in charge of grooming – and each one makes the show that little bit special in their own way. Even when the person getting the makeover is at the other end of the political spectrum to our hosts, the show focuses on the positives and shows that everyone, whether they’re democrat or republican, can do with a little self-love.Stars Hollow is excellent in all seasons, as demonstrated by Gilmore Girls: A Year in the LifeThis early Noughties comedy may be the product of its time, but it still makes for deeply unchallenging viewing. A single mother, Lorelai, and her teenaged daughter, Rory, have an upbeat and supportive relationship, speaking in snappy one-liners and rapid-fire dialogue. They live in Stars Hollow, a pastel picture of small town America at its most loveably eccentric. While it delivers poignant emotional truths galore, the focus is blessedly narrow, the stakes untroubingly low, and the outcome usually uplifting. Gilmore Girls has all the bite of a marshmallow – but soft and gooey is, sometimes, just what you need. Could there be a more quintessentially British TV show than The Great British Bake-Off? A batch of contestants try their hardest to impress two judges with their ornate cakes and pastries, all while cheering each other on and become the best of friends. There’s not a whiff of bitterness between them as they leave the tent – only sadness that Paul may never taste their grandma’s macaron recipe. And with the sardonic wit of Mel and SueNoel and Sandi keeping things fun – even when the pressures on – there’s never a mean-spirited moment. Bewitched is absolutely the product of its time, but that’s also what makes it so delightfully subversive. Samantha Stephens (Elizabeth Montgomery) is, on the surface, the ideal housewife of the 1960s. Each episode ends with her household in perfect order, dinner on the table, and a martini ready for her husband the second he walks through the door. Yet the joy of Bewitched comes from the fact that Samantha does these things with a wry smirk. We know she’s a witch, after all, actively choosing to the wear the guise of housewife despite the option to live as an all-powerful, supernatural being. We also know that it’s often her pulling the strings behind-the-scenes on this idyllic marriage. Despite its mid-century suburban sheen, Bewitched is a rebel in disguise. And that’s always enlivening to watch. Brooklyn Nine-Nine is a friendly embrace of a TV series, a sitcom in which all members of its erse ensemble deliver on cheer and belly laughs in each and every episode. Its the endlessly likeable Andy Samberg who leads the charge, and his Peter Pan-style detective Jake Peralta is the kind of character that makes you feel any issue can be resolved. As such, the show offers more of a motivational boost than you might expect for a series about hapless members of a police precinct. After all, if they can do it, anyone can.A staple on ITV3, Inspector Morse is the televisual equivalent of slipping on your favourite slippers: familiar and cosy. Sure, there are quite a few murders, but what about that beautiful Oxford setting, where dreaming spires tower above the grisliness? It\u0027s intelligent and has brilliant characterisation, with John Thaw\u0027s curmudgeonly, Wagner-loving, real-ale man its wonderful centre of gravity. The series ran from 1987 to 2000 and its legacy has lived on through spin-offs Lewis and Endeavour, but neither of which can quite match this series for charm. Sure, the further away we get from the end of Friends’s decade long run, the more blatant its many problematic moments are – but this ensemble sit-com is also enduringly funny, brilliantly acted, and endlessly bingeable. It rightly made stars of its six cast members when it premiered in 1994, and managed to continually evolve through the course of its ten seasons without losing its warm, inimitable charm. Once you\u0027re hooked, you\u0027ll have 236 episodes to get your teeth into – which is enough that by the time you\u0027re done, you\u0027ll be ready to start again.She dresses like a primary school teacher, smiles like the Cheshire cat, and sees the best in absolutely everybody: Kimmy Schmidt is an unusual heroine today.

Therefore any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the six months that should be remaining for travel to most countries in Europe.The \u0027blue\u0027 passport, like Brexit, is an international embarrassmentCombining these two rule changes means that\u0026nbspthere are some passports out there which could be rejected even though they expire 14 months and 29 days after the date of travel.\u0026nbspHowever, these rules do not apply when travelling to Ireland. To try to eliminate any confusion, the government website has a new passport checker service to see whether\u0026nbspyou should renew your documents or not.If the UK leaves with a deal, travel to the EU should\u0026nbspremain the same as now until at least 31 December 2020.That would mean\u0026nbspUK passports would\u0026nbspbe valid for travel anywhere in the Schengen area (the vast majority of EU countries as well as Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) up to and including the expiry date.\u0026nbspGot an unanswered question about Brexit?

Vets would therefore like to see a ban on non-stun slaughter to prevent the suffering of millions of animals.”The RSPCA, which\u0026nbspsaid its concern was not over expression of religious belief but\u0026nbspanimal welfare,\u0026nbspcalled on the government to ensure trade deals with other countries did not include non-stun meat and to make labelling compulsory, until it introduced a no-stun ban.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The recent scientific analysis of the Stonehenge cremated bones (that appear to have been buried adjacent to the newly re-erected stones) is now helping to reveal the origins of the community, which appears to have actually built the earliest version of the monument.The ever-increasing body of evidence suggesting Stonehenge and the original Stonehenge community’s western British origins has substantial implications for our understanding of British prehistory.Scientists know the Stonehenge early phase standing stones (known as “bluestones”, rather than the later more famous and much larger “sarsen” stones) come from this and other Pembrokeshire prehistoric quarries – because of chemical identification tests they have carried out on the rocks.So far, only two quarries have been identified – both on the northern slopes of the Preseli Hills in Pembrokeshire, southwest Wales – but geologists, who have studied the Stonehenge bluestones, think it is likely there were at least three or four other quarries that have yet to be found.The discovery of the tools is likely to rekindle one of archaeology’s biggest debates – how did the builders of Stonehenge transport the bluestones (an estimated 79 of them, each weighing approximately 2 tons) from southwest Wales to Salisbury Plain.There are three major potential methods – by land, by land and river, and by sea and land andor river.Stonehenge celebrates 100 years since site was gifted to nationThe most practical way would have been predominantly by sea – but the most ritually, politically and ideologically impressive method would have been predominantly by land. Only very detailed future archaeological research will stand a chance of finding the route and cracking that particular mystery.In the first, more maritime\u0026nbspscenario, the stones would potentially have been moved by raft (or catamaran) down Pembrokeshire’s river Taf into the Bristol Channel and then along England’s river Avon to within 20 miles of the Salisbury Plain site earmarked for Stonehenge.In the second scenario, the stones would have had to be carried by stretcher or hauled on sledges (or possibly rollers) for long distances over often extremely challenging terrain (with only limited opportunities for river transport).This second method would certainly have had ostentatious political and ideological advantages – but it would have required vast amounts of manpower, time, effort and intertribal or interclan acquiescence.The discovery of the stone quarrying tools, which date\u0026nbspto the approximate time of the construction of the first stone phase of the monument (c 2900BC), proves\u0026nbspbeyond reasonable doubt for the first time\u0026nbspthat Neolithic people quarried the Welsh stones that ended up being used to build the world’s most famous prehistoric temple.But why did the builders of Stonehenge want to get their standing stones from 175 miles away when they could have used perfectly good local stones from Salisbury Plain?The answer is probably genealogical. Chemical\u0026nbspsignatures found in the bones of early Stonehenge people\u0026nbspsuggest many of those iniduals were originally from western Britain,\u0026nbspnot from Salisbury Plain. It is therefore conceivable that the stones of early Stonehenge were brought to Salisbury Plain from the area associated with the builders’ ancestors.Fascinatingly, in much later (medieval) Arthurian literature, the stones of Stonehenge are said to have been brought by the magician Merlin from the far west (although, in the legend, from Ireland, rather than southwest Wales).The fact that the stones were brought from Pembrokeshire to Salisbury Plain raises another key mystery. If indeed they were transported to their new home as clan or tribal heirlooms, then it suggests they already possessed great significance. And that implies the possibility that they had already functioned as a ritual monument (ie\u0026nbspas standing stones) in Wales, long before they were taken to Salisbury Plain.So the big archaeological question is whether the initial stones of Stonehenge were second hand or freshly quarried for use so far away. If the former theory is correct, then the original Stonehenge was actually in Pembrokeshire – not in England. The hunt is therefore now on for the original site of this potential Welsh proto-Stonehenge.Without doubt Salisbury Plain’s world-famous prehistoric temple still holds many secrets – but archaeological research over the coming years is likely to reveal them.British people ‘more familiar with Eiffel Tower than Stonehenge’Groundbreaking research reveals origins of people who built StonehengeThousands gather for summer solstice sunrise at Stonehenge Stonehenge tunnel ‘could destroy traces of human life from Ice Age’Congestion expert warns worst Christmas jams will be at StonehengeThe discovery of the quarrying tools – published today in the British archaeological journal\u0026nbspAntiquity –\u0026nbsphas been made by a team of archaeologists and geologists from UCL, Bournemouth University, the University of Southampton, the University of the Highlands and Islands and the National Museum of Wales.Professor\u0026nbspPearson said: “What’s really exciting about these discoveries is that they take us a step closer to unlocking Stonehenge’s greatest mystery – why its stones came from so far away.“Every other Neolithic monument in Europe was built of megaliths brought from no more than 10 miles away. We’re now looking to find out just what was so special about the Preseli Hills 5,000 years ago, and whether there were any important stone circles here, built before the bluestones were moved to Stonehenge.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Several factors are pointing towards something coming soon.May will travel to Brussels tomorrow for a meeting with Commission President Jean Claude-Juncker, it will be a workmanlike affair – with officials, no dinner.Then, we are expecting a speech from attorney general Geoffrey Cox towards the end of this week. He is the PM’s weapon of choice when she needs to convince her own MPs and others of the legal and political viability of her cause.So if some new wording on the backstop has been achieved by then, this will be the speech in which he sells it to colleagues.Also, if the PM has not put a new deal with Brussels to the house herself by next week, she will be forced to table a further “amendable motion” – giving MPs like Yvette Cooper and Nick Boles a chance to put alternative Brexit plans to the commons.If she insists on keeping no deal on the table at that point, she has been warned that she may well face a series of resignations from remainer ministers, so there is an incentive to move.Nothing is written in stone in the withdrawal saga, but time is ticking down for the PM as well as for Brexit itself.And of course, even if she does get something from Brussels, there is the unanswered question as to whether it will be enough to convince her eurosceptic Tory colleagues to pass her deal.Asked what he would do differently to address the concerns of his MPs, Mr Corbyn said: Anyone who thinks they are not being consulted are not taking up, in my view, the opportunities that are available there and open and ready for them at all times to do that.I\u0027m always prepared to discuss policies with people in the party and I do all the time.Corbyn is asked whether he agrees with his deputy Tom Watson that the shadow cabinet should be more reflective of the parliamentary party.He says he is proud to lead the Labour Party, and lists its achievements.\u0026nbspHe adds But I recognise that leading the party means you have got to take people with you and I am determined to do that - determined to do that so that we can, when an election comes - present those policies and that determination to the public as a whole.That\u0027s it for the Q\u0026ampA.While responding to a question on Brexit, Mr Corbyn confirms that he is going to Brussels next week for talks to break the Brexit deadlock.\u0026nbspOur Europe correspondent Jon Stone wrote a bit about this last week.Asked about the seven MPs who resigned from the party and what he will say to those considering resigning, Corbyn replies: I regret that 7 MPs decided to no longer be members of the party.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHe says those MPs stood on the 2017 manifesto, and they were elected to carry out those policies. I regret that - I want our party to be strong, united.\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn is now speaking at the manufacturing conference in central London. He says the long slump in manufacturing lays squarely with the government and strangled investment.\u0026nbspThere is another way of doing things, the Labour leader says, as he makes clear the party will establish a national investment bank.\u0026nbspHe says his party\u0027s policies won huge support at the election, and he is disappointed a small number of MPs decided to take a different path and split from the party.\u0026nbspCorbyn says the Conservatives\u0027 failure to invest in infrastructure goes hand in hand with their failure to invest in the workforce.Business minister Richard Harrington\u0026nbsphas suggested that MPs would act to delay Brexit rather than allow the UK to crash out without a deal.He told a manufacturers\u0027 conference in London: I do not believe there will be a no-deal Brexit. The reason I don\u0027t believe that is because I think the Prime Minister\u0027s deal will go through.But if it doesn\u0027t get through, before then Parliament will have taken control, we will have a small extension to Article 50 and Parliament will then decide on alternatives.I believe that will become the Plan B.We’ll tell you what’s true.

It is not the forthright position many campaigners hoped to be in at this stage in the Brexit process.It is now not even clear if this more caveated approach to winning a new referendum, or\u0026nbspa more direct one, will be put in front of MPs for a vote on 27 February – which is being hailed as “high noon” for the country’s approach to Brexit in other respects.Last October when 700,000 people poured out on to the streets demanding a new referendum, the feeling was that momentum was swinging in their direction, that Jeremy Corbyn\u0026nbspwould ultimately have no choice but to back one and that, if it came to a vote in the Commons at the right time, MPs would push it through.Since then\u0026nbspall sides have become stuck in the bog of Brexit’s political complexity.

It repeats endlessly that the withdrawal agreement is closed and that it isn’t going to reopen it.When the Brady amendment passed the House of Commons, saying Parliament would accept the dealthe backstop was replaced, the EU responded by saying they didn’t think this Parliament majority was “stable”.Thursday night’s vote helps them make that argument.As one No source laments: “We don’t want to give the Europeans a chance not to engage with us.”I understand that when the Brexit Secretary, Steve Barclay, dined in Brussels this week Sabine Weyand — the EU’s deputy negotiator — spent her time telling him that a customs union was the only major change available to the backstop.The EU think that Corbyn’s support for it means that a customs union could pass Parliament. I am told Barclay attempted to disabuse them of this idea.Mrs May can’t entirely escape blame for this week’s fiasco.No should have made sure that its own MPs were happy with the wording before publishing the motion.“She’s like a football team that can’t string two wins together,” complains one minister.But the Tory Brexit ultras should have paid more heed to the real-world consequences of their actions.Another effect of Thursday night’s defeat for the Government is that it increases the chances of the Cooper amendment passing on February .This would compel the Government to seek an extension to Article Mrs May hasn’t won Parliament’s support for an exit deal by March .One Cabinet minister, with close links to several of the ministers who might quit to ensure this amendment goes through, tells me it is now “much more likely” to pass.This Secretary of State complains that the Government’s defeat “makes it harder to make the argument that we should hold our nerve” as “the best evidence for holding your nerve was that the outcome would be the same as when the Brady amendment went through”.Another minister warns: “If she doesn’t come back with something cooking by the th, there’ll be trouble.”I understand those around Mrs May know they need to have shown progress by the th.One insider tells me: “If the Government doesn’t want Parliament to take control, they need to have a plan.They can’t just sit there for two weeks.”Other Cabinet ministers aren’t so sure Cooper will pass.One tells me: “I don’t think the ministers will resign, andthey don’t resign, then it doesn’t pass.”If Cooper does go through, politics will enter into an even more unpredictable phase. One May Cabinet ally is predicting a general electionthis happens.But it is hard to see how a general election could end in anything other than disaster for the Tories in these circumstances.If Mrs May is forced to ask the EU for an extension but with no Parliamentary agreement in sight, the EU is more likely to offer a long extension than a short one.I understand the view in several EU capitals is that the longer the extension, the more likely it is that the political dynamics in the UK will change.But a long extension would prolong this damaging, political uncertainty.This Government, and this Parliament’s, job is to get Brexit done. Time is running short. Both Parliament and the Government need to get their act together.But it may well be because the NHS – traditionally Labour’s strongest suit – is not the most important issue in politics right now.But that number is down to  per cent this winter, according to the pollster Ipsos Mori.The question now is whether the Tory decision to spend an extra £billion a year on the health service by  leads to a decline in public concern.But in January AE departments recorded their worst waiting times since the figures started being collected in .Matt Hancock, the new Health Secretary, is setting up a new NHS-X unit to try to bring the health service into the digital era, which would help the NHS to better use its resources.There are many things the Tories have to do to win the next election – not least, deliver Brexit – but they must also reassure voters on the NHS.Butthey can be ed they should be subject to the full force of the law.Justice must be done and must be seen to be done.Churchill wouldn’t have been Prime Minister but for the Labour Party’s willingness to serve in a government led by him.When it came to the crucial decision to fight on in , Clement Attlee and Arthur Greenwood, two Labour members of the War Cabinet, were more solid than some of Churchill’s Tory colleagues.But Attlee and Greenwood came from a very dferent Labour tradition to McDonnell: They weren’t Marxists or Trotskyists.There are some Labour MPs who are just not prepared to try to put into power people who are so outside the traditional bounds of the party.One minister likens the coming Tory leadership race to the  Grand National, when a crowded field led to a pile-up at the rd fence and the victory of the - outsider Foinavon.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Time to offer them up.Brexiteers must then hold their noses and vote for Theresa May’s deal. All other roads lead to catastrophe.They won’t get the backstop removed. We don’t believe they’ll get a No Deal exit either, and eventhey did the short-term chaos would kill their party.Instead Parliament would postpone Brexit, possibly finishing the Tories for a generation. This current purgatory would go on for months longer — maybe long enough for Remainers to reverse the referendum result.The Government would have failed in its only mission. It would instead have undermined our democracy and ensured bitter isions that would never heal.The one person unable to compromise, oddly, is the Prime Minister. Because what Brussels, Labour and Tory Remainers glibly ask of her, a permanent customs union, ALSO wrecks her party and destroys Brexit’s economic case.It was folly to expect the Tory ERG group to vote to “take No Deal off the table” on Thursday night. Logic was on their side, at least.But they need to think hard now how they will feel on March Brexit is put off and they are blamed.

And it was an old-school print journalist, the brilliant Anthony Loyd of The Times, who found Begum in a Syrian refugee camp containing almost , people.Loyd’s interview with her is a gripping insight into the twisted mind of a British youngster who ran off to join IS’s murderous caliphate. And the BBC had bugger all to do with it.While BBC staffers were sipping their skinny lattes and nibbling almond croissants in Broadcasting House, a journalist from The Times got his scoop the hard way, tramping into a chaotic refugee camp in one of the most dangerous parts of the world.Why does this matter  Because this country has one of the most vibrant newspaper industries on the planet.And the bloated, over-funded BBC is KILLING it.The Cairncross Review, a Government report into the future of UK journalism, revealed this week how tax-dodging tech giants Facebook and Google, together with the publicly-funded BBC are annihilating our free Press.They have already destroyed what was once affectionately known as “the local rag”.Over the past seven years, hundreds of local papers have shut down and thousands of regional journalists have lost their jobs. , journalists worked on local newspapers in  — now it is just ,. And it is your money that bankrolls the BBC.At a time when the BBC is contem­plating ditching free TV licences for the over-s, the debate we should REALLY be having is about how much of your money we should be chucking at Auntie.We have a great newspaper industry and it is worth preserving.Because it wasn’t the BBC that broke the story of MPs fiddling their expenses — it was a newspaper . And it wasn’t the BBC that broke the story about charity Age UK receiving £million from an energy company to flog gas and electricity to pensioners — it was a newspaper .It wasn’t the BBC that dared to publish the names of the killers of Stephen Lawrence — it was a newspaper .And what was the most-read story on the BBC last year  Strictly minx Katya Jones snogging Seann Walsh  — a Sun on Sunday exclusive.The BBC, like Facebook and Google, is a parasite that lives off the flesh of real news-gatherers.What makes the BBC dferent from the tax-dodging tech giants is that we love it.

Lord Reith never dreamed of a state broadcaster that was all-powerful.The BBC gets far too much of your money and spends it far too easily. Why does the BBC need to be over every nook and cranny of the internet To the generation growing up on Netflix and YouTube with an entire universe on their smartphones, the BBC pocketing more than £ a year from everyone with a TV set is absurd.The BBC has got too big for its publicly-funded boots.That’s what we should be talking about — not the merits of free TV licences for granny and grandad!The Cairncross Review told how the BBC’s expansionist online empire has come very close to destroying the local newspaper industry.Are we really going to keep giving the BBC £billion every year so it can do the same to the national newspaper industry In the same week as the Cairncross Review came out, Bruce Sharma, , fought off thieves armed with a hammer and a machete with just his rolled-up copy of The Sun.Bruce was reading The Sun in Ram Stores in Long Eaton, Derbys, when the hooded pair burst in demanding money. “Instinct took over and I tried to whack them with the paper,” says Bruce.You can’t do that with a TV licence.GORDON Banks lit up my childhood.For my generation – a wide-eyed kid on that magical summer’s day in  – those World Cup winners will always feel like family.Gordon never got a knighthood.

The gaping wounds left by this internal conflict could soon prove fatal to him.There were sharp intakes of breath yesterday when seven moderate Labour MPs announced they have resigned to set up a new Independent Group.Their number may be small — and none of them, except perhaps Chuka Umunna, may be household names — but their move is certain to have a huge impact on British politics.It throws the Opposition into chaos.  Beleaguered by dismal poll ratings, serial incompetence, isions over Brexit and accusations of extremism, Corbyn will now come under brutal pressure.The Gang of Seven’s decision to quit will feed into the narrative that he is a Marxist mediocrity, whose toxic spell at the helm since  has not only dragged his party to the lunatic fringe but has also allowed vicious anti-Semitism and intolerance to flourish.The seven splitters made precisely those charges yesterday, using language that  will be gleefully exploited by Labour’s opponents.Luciana Berger, the MP for Liverpool Wavertree who has endured death threats and deselection attempts from socialist zealots, said she would be “sickened and ashamed to remain in the Labour Party” because of the  “culture of bullying, bigotry and intimidation”.Equally powerful was Chris Leslie,  the Nottingham East MP, who argued that Labour had been “hijacked by the machine politics of the hard Left”, peddling “abuse and hatred”.Labour’s turmoil follows the battering that Corbyn received in a new book by investigative journalist Tom Bower.With a wealth of shocking details, it exposes the full scale of the Labour leader’s dreary left-wing fanaticism, his links to anti-Semitism, his anti-British instincts and his low intellectual calibre.As the book graphically demonstrates, never was there any politician less fitted for the premiership.Given the y charge sheet against Corbyn, it is amazing that the party split did not happen earlier. But the moderates hung on in the forlorn hope that Corbyn might change or that Labour might move back towards the centre ground.There was never any chance of that.Corbyn and his dogmatic followers are not interested in compromise or debate — only in enforcement of their warped ideology.  They have turned what was once a broad church into a narrow personality cult.In fact, many Corbynites, like a kind of Trotskyite Taliban, welcome the split because they see it as an opportunity to rid the socialist creed of impurities.“Though cowards flinch and traitors sneer, we’ll keep the Red Flag flying here,” screeched the infantile Young Labour movement.Yet the charge of cowardice is an absurd one to make at the splitters.It took courage to quit. Most of them had relatively safe Labour seats. Yet they have put their political careers and livelihoods at risk in protest at Corbyn.In addition, they will be forced to endure a barrage of abuse from party members, since Labour is a profoundly tribal movement, where betrayal is regarded as the darkest sin of all.But this will only be the start of a major rebellion against Corbyn.To the Gang of Seven can be added three other moderate former Labour MPs who already sit as Independents, namely Frank Field, Ivan Lewis and John Woodcock, who describes Corbyn as “a clear risk to national security”.Public interest in the new group is strong. By early yesterday evening they had gained , followers on Twitter.And more Labour MPs are likely to resign, emboldened by the Gang Of Seven.  It should be remembered that in  no fewer than  Labour MPs —  per cent of the parliamentary party — openly declared their lack of confidence in Corbyn’s leadership.Tellingly, Tom Watson, the Deputy Leader, said in a bitter swipe at Corbyn yesterday that he “no longer recognised” his own party and merely condemned the defections as “premature”.Even with its modest beginnings, the Independent Group launch represents the biggest split in British politics since the formation of the SDP in , when Labour was lurching to the Left under Michael Foot. But the parallel with the SDP also highlights the weakness of the new group.The SDP was headed by the big figures of Roy Jenkins, David Owen and Shirley Williams, all experienced Cabinet Ministers and potential premiers.There is no one remotely of that stature among the new Independents.Their most high-profile member, Umunna, briefly ran for the Labour leadership in  but withdrew at the first whf of media scrutiny.Nor does the Independent Group have a coherent set of policies beyond being anti-Corbyn and pro-EU.In contrast, the SDP had a clear stance in favour of Britain’s nuclear deterrent, Common Market membership and the market economy.The splitters’ claim to be standing up for democracy is also weakened by their reluctance to accept the result of the  EU referendum, the greatest democratic exercise in British political history. Indeed, in their Remoaner posturing, there is an unpleasant air of the narrow, metropolitan progressive elite about their operation so far.Nevertheless,they help to prevent the election of Corbyn, they will do a service to British politics, just as the SDP helped to halt the advance of Foot almost  years ago. If the new Independent Group is really to reshape the British political landscape, it will have to be far more than just a narrow, elitist breakaway from Labour.A burst of anti-Corbyn hype is not enough. To become an authentic third force that dominates the centre, it will have to attract MPs from other parties.That means taking over the increasingly moribund Lib Dems, now led by the ineffectual Sir Vince Cable.More importantly, it   requires winning over Left-inclined Tories and anti-Brexit MPs such as the noisy Anna Soubry and the former GP Sarah Wollaston.Gaining Conservative support was precisely what the SDP failed to do, ultimately dooming it to failure. Just one Tory MP, Christopher Brocklebank-Fowler, became a Social Democrat.Gang of Seven member Gavin Shuker said that Labour had “turned its back on the British public”.He is absolutely right — which is  why Corbyn’s mob must not be allowed near power. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The automotive giant announced it will shut its -year-old Swindon factory in  and move production to Japan in a blow to , jobs.Speaking this morning, Hondas senior vice-president Ian Howell said flatly: This is not a Brexit-related decision for us. But a move that risks enraging Tory Brexiteers, Business Secretary Greg Clark claimed the decision demonstrates starkly how much is at stake. And in an urgent debate in the House of Commons today, MPs repeatedly drew comparisons between the huge blow and the chaos over leaving the EU. Their pointed out Japan has signed a trade deal with the EU which will allow tarf-free trade - while our tarfs after March  are still unknown.  Pro-EU minister Mr Clark also pointed out the devastating decision came after long warnings about the impact of No Deal Brexit.Mr Clark, who confronted Theresa May yesterday demanding she rule out a no-deal Brexit, said at a conference this lunchtime: Decisions like Hondas this morning demonstrate starkly how much is at stake.And he later told MPs: The company said the decision was not about Brexit and clearly we must accept that. In truth they have a small market share in Europe compared to the markets they said they are expanding in. But I’ve always been very clear that the motor industry, Japanese investors, and Honda in particular have been very clear for many months that Brexit is an additional worry at a dficult time.  If there’s one message all of us in this House can give that they want to hear it is that the deal should be ratied. He added: “Although it’s the case that the Brexit uncertainty was not cited as being one of the factors in the decision, it is evidence that the whole industry and investment decisions… this does bear on their mind.” As MPs lined up to attack the government, Remainer after Remainer demanded the government now rule out leaving without a deal in  days time. Tory MP Ken Clarke said: It’s no good people ignoring the warnings of every leader of the car industry. Ex-minister Michael Fallon said: “One of the lessons here is the power and scope of the EU-Japan trade agreement. In contrast to the continuing uncertainty here, two and a half years after the referendum… as to what the future terms of our trading relationship Europe are actually going to be.”  Hilary Benn, chairman of the Commons Brexit committee, said it came at a “dangerous moment” for the future of the car industry - and the government must be persuaded “what a disaster [No Deal] would be for the future of British car manufacturing.”And Labour MP Richard Burden said Brexit is an absolutely key part of the context in which Honda and other major car manufacturers are making decisions about where to invest and the generations of vehicles that will transform this industry.“And the harsh reality is Britain’s reputation as a stable place to do business and a gateway to Europe is being undermined before our eyes.” Jeremy Corbyn denied a link to Brexit at a conference this afternoon. He said: Although not directly linked to Brexit today we learn that Honda is planning to close its plant in Swindon at the cost of , jobs.That is devastating news for those workers, their families and for the local economy. It’s bad news too for all the small and medium sized businesses in the supply chain.But Shadow Business Secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey went further - saying there was no doubt Tory Brexit plans were having an impact on the industry. She told MPs: The government is completely incompetent. Honda’s decision is a damning indictment of this government’s failure to support car manufacturing and ensure business confidence - both in terms of Brexit, and in terms of their so called industrial strategy. I understand that Honda’s CEO this morning said the decision was unrelated to Brexit. However, the company statement specically says they want to focus activity in regions where it expects to have high production volumes, especially in electric vehicles.  So the question logically follows - why does Honda no longer believe the UK will have high production volumes  And why do they no longer have confidence to invest here to make it so  They will be exporting from Japan to the EU instead of from Britain. She added: Something must have changed. Could it be the government’s botched Brexit causing chaos and uncertainty and undermining business confidence  And she went on: Honda itself warned last year that leaving the EU without a deal would cost the company tens of millions. So there can be no doubt this government’s reckless threats of no deal and prolonged uncertainty is having an impact on business decisions in the here and now - eventhat isn’t the top line of a press release. Mr Clark told MPs a task force is being set up to ensure workers in Swindon can make the best use of their skills after the closure. It will include local MPs, business leaders and the trade unions to ensure the skills and expertise of the workforce are maintained.Theresa May told the weekly meeting of the Cabinet that she had spoken to the president ofHondato express her disappointment at the decision to close the Swindon plant.The Prime Ministers official spokesman said she told the meeting that the Government would be doing all we can to support those affected.

What happens next is crucial, more Labour MPs ripping up party cards to join what is calling itself an Independent Group would be another gt for the Conservatives. Labour should first consider why the seven departed to avoid others following, addressing grievances on Europe and anti-Semitism in the hope of uniting the party. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell’s call for MPs to stand again in by-elections, now they’re against the party which got them into Parliament, is, alas, likely to be rejected.   The prospect of a Labour government is a little more remote today and the Tories a little more secure as a result of the split. Surely that can’t be good for working people. What car-nage Honda shutting its Swindon factory is a terrible car crash for workers, their families, local businesses, suppliers, motor manufacturing and the British economy.

The split in  continues to cast a dark shadow over the party. Then, as now, a group of moderate MPs left in protest at the party’s shyleadership, the infiltration by the hard left and isions over Europe. Then, as now, the splitters promised to break the mould by changing the “broken” way of doing politics. In the end they only proved the dficulties of establishing a new political force under our first-past-the-post electoral system. In , the SDP-Liberal Alliance got . million votes, a shade below Labour’s . million, but won  seats to Michael Foot’s . By , the SDP was wound up following the creation of the Liberal Democrats.  Many in Labour fear history could repeat itself with the “gang of seven”. The lesson they draw from the creation of the SDP is that a new party will split the Labour vote and hand the Tories the next general election on a plate. Angela Smith said yesterday that comparisons with the SDP do not “stand up to scrutiny”.  “This is a dferent century and the challenges that the country faces are on a scale that I don’t think we have seen at any other time in the post-war period,” she said. There is no doubt that Brexit is testing traditional political allegiances. Many voters now identy themselves by how they voted in the referendum, rather than by which party they tend to support.  But it is far from certain this upheaval will lead to a redrawing of the political map. Historian Dr Matt Cole, from Birmingham University, said: “The inidual MPs have a steep hill to climb, it is rarely successful. “The culture of British politics is one in which the main political parties, however unpopular they are, nonetheless are incredibly resilient. “They are like a company that nobody likes the products of, but they can’t stop buying them.” The two main parties’ joint vote in  was the highest since , he said. There may be, as Ms Smith said, a large number of people who feel politically homeless. But evenyou provide then with a new house the chances of breaking the two-party monopoly are slim.  Unlike in , the seven dissident MPs cannot claim to be political heavyweights. The founders of the SDP included Roy Jenkins, a former Chancellor and Home Secretary, David Owen, a former Foreign shySecretary, and Shirley Williams, a former Education Secretary. The highest rank achieved by Chuka Ummuna was shadow Business Secretary under Ed Miliband. At the moment, the Independent Group lacks all the components required to form a new party – a grassroots base, money and a distinct agenda. The MPs were brutally honest in saying what they were against: the failure to tackle anti-Semitism the hard Left’s grip on the party machine the lukewarm opposition to Brexit.  They were less clear when it came to spelling out what they did stand for. But this does not mean the Labour leadership has nothing to fear from the breakaway. The centrist seven could be joined by other MPs, including Conservatives, and their message may shyresonate with disillusioned Labour councillors, activists and voters. Which is why many expected a stronger response from the Labour leadership to the most serious fracturing of the party in almost  years. It was moment when the party’s MPs and activists looked for reassurance and direction. Instead, Mr Corbyn issued a tersely worded statement expressing his disappointment and sent an email to members urging them to stay united.  There should have been, at the very least, an acknowledgement that the criticisms made by the departing seven would have chimed with many Labour MPs and supporters. Those who may still quit need to hear from the Labour leader why they should stay. It was left to Deputy Leader Tom Watson to try to articulate the mood of a dismayed and anxious party. His warning that unless things change others could follow the seven out of the door was a direct challenge to Corbyn. Labour could only prevent others from leaving, Watson said,we “reach out and extend beyond our comfort zone”.  There was also a more veiled message that the leadership needed to listen to the Parliamentary Labour Party on Brexit. It was noticeable that in his email to party members, Mr Corbyn reaffirmed that the option of a second referendum remained on the table. Some believe that unless he follows through on this demand then other MPs could join the nascent Independent Group. How the leadership responds will be a major factor in determining whether the breakaway MPs are a flash in the pan or a new movement. If allies of Corbyn turn viciously on the quitters they will confirm their reasons for leaving and could encourage others to follow.  The leadership must ask itself why moderate MPs feel they can no longer stay in the party and respond to concerns about Brexit and anti-Semitism. At stake is Labour’s chance of winning the next election. In dozens of marginal seats the Independent Group could split the opposition vote and allow the Tories to keep power. The legacy of the SDP was to force Labour to sht to the centre, where elections are usually won or lost. Today’s seven MPs may have decided to sacrice their careers for the same ambition.

Bethany-Maria Beales, , was at a pals pad after a night on the town when she fell from the th floor of the Heron in Moorgate, central London, where a studio flat sells for more than pound,. Known to friends and family as Beth, she was found barely breathing on a sixth-floor terrace of the building complex with injuries consistent with a fall from a height. Beth - described as a party animal by pals - had been out clubbing in the hours before her death last May, City of London Coroners Court heard. A man and woman were initially arrested on suspicion of her murder, but detectives couldnt find any evidence to suggest that they were involved in her death.  Recording an open conclusion, Senior Coroner Alison Hewitt said Beth may have been taking a selfie when she fell from the balcony. Beth, a junior sales executive who lived in Wimbledon, south west London, had graduated in English literature and performance from Roehampton University.She was a recreational user of cocaine and had been taking it the hours before her death, the hearing was told.Beths friend Hannah Curtis, who attended the inquest, said: She used cocaine from time to time.More recently she used it at the weekends when she was drinking. She had an issue with it, but wasnt addicted.   A statement from Beths friend, India Boyd, who was out with her that night, was read to the hearing. She said: I met Beth at a private members club in Soho. It was a mansion-type house and we were sitting on a sofa, talking and drinking. It was daylight when we left. She said Beth took some cocaine when they went back to the apartment of a man known as Jessie who Beth had been seeing.  Ms Boyd said: Beth was talking to me about Jessie, she didnt know what he was looking for relationship-wise. At .am, Beth and Jessie went to the bedroom and at around am or am I could hear them talking. Beth was talking sternly. She came out and said Jessie had made her angry and asked could I go to the bathroom with her. She seemed upset. The inquest heard that when Ms Boyd woke up at noon, Beth had left the apartment.  Beth had been texting her friend Okechukwa Ngaha, known as Marvin, and asked to visit his apartment in the Heron to talk, the inquest heard. Mr Ngaha told the inquest: Beth messaged me between am and .am. She told me she was upset, she had tears in her eyes and can she come around. He told the inquest he initially askedBeth was okay to go home because he was shattered. But when he heard that she was upset he said he would wait with his friend Carol Boulter, who was the only other person at the apartment. Beth was seen on CCTV entering the apartment building at .pm. Mr Ngaha said: Shes usually bubbly and lively, but she was blank. She dropped her bag down and we talked for about  to  minutes.  She told us she decided to tell Jessie something she hadnt told anyone. It was traumatising for her. His reaction was not what she expected. She thought it was going really well with Jessie, she was just feeling defeated. After about  minutes she said her mum had rang and she was going to make or take a call. She went out to the balcony and closed the door. The curtains were closed so we couldnt see out. We thought she might have been calling Jessie so we just left her to it. After a while we went to check on her and she had disappeared. But there are two entrances to the balcony and my bedroom door was open. I thought she had gone in there, so we had a cigarette. The inquest heard that when Mr Ngaha and Ms Boulter went to check on Beth, they couldnt find her. He said they thought shed left without telling them.  After searching for her and ringing her phone, they decided to leave her shoes and bag downstairs. Ms Boulter, who said she thought it was strange Beth had left her shoes, left her belongings with the concierge before leaving. She texted Mr Ngaha that there may have been a fire in the building after seeing the fire brigade. The police arrived at his apartment shortly afterward. Although Ms Boulter and Mr Ngaha were questioned by police, no evidence was found that they were involved in Beths death.  Det Chief inspector Edelle Michaels, the senior investigating officer, told the hearing: We couldnt find any evidence that would suggest that Marvin Ngaha or Carol Boulter were involved in her death. The messages that Marvin said he sent to Beth were concurrent with what we found on her phone. There are no inconsistencies. The Coroner askedDCI Michaels would agree the balcony was too high to fall over by accident. DCI Michaels agreed, but added: Apart from the chair being close to the balcony. She may have used it to stand up on. She may have used it so she could sit up on the railing. Her phone was found very near her, so she probably had it in her hand. Maybe she was going to take a photo and fell. She was very close to her mother and as she said she would have contacted hershe was going to do that.  The inquest heard that Beth had attempted to take her own le in  over the breakdown of a relationship, but told her mother she immediately regretted it. The inquest heard she had no previous mental health issues and seemed very upbeat in the lead up to her death. A pathologist found that Beth died from multiple injuries consistent with a fall from a height. Ms Hewitt said: Toxicological testing found a blood alcohol concentration of mg per ml. It found some presence of cocaine - within the wide range of values seen after use of a typical recreational dose. With regard to the alcohol and drugs she said it was possible they contributed to her fall. Recording an open conclusion, the Coroner said: I am satisfied there is no evidence of third party involvement. I have to deduce whether it was a suicide. The definition of it issomeone had died from their own deliberate act and, in doing that act, they deliberately intended to kill themselves. This was a high barrier, it doesnt seem to me you could fall over it. From the evidence, Beth has put herself in the barrier by using a chair up against it. Its possible that was in order to climb over to deliberately fall. But it seems to me its also possible that she used to the chair to sit up on the barrier. This could have been down to lack of judgement after taking alcohol and drugs, she lted up her phone to take a selfie possibly. Is one of them more likely than the other  I dont think so. There was another time with an overdose, but it seems to be that that was not a suicide attempt. She had a very good support network. Its possible she was trying to take her own le but it is equally possible it was an accident so I cant record suicide. The Coroner ruled it an open conclusion as she said there was not the requisite standard of proof to record a precise verdict.

It’s posh and full of snobs.”So that evening I mentioned this to the audience, and a woman shouted, “It’s true, they are posh – they’ve even got theirown dentist.”Incidents like this led to the Radio  show Mark Steel’s in Town, in which I visit a town each week and write a show about it, performed to a local audience. This is why I’ve encountered attractions such as Hebden Bridge, the scenic Yorkshire town so famous for its lesbian community that the manager of the tourist office told me a woman came in that week, striding past brochures for coach trips and rambles, and said, “I’ve heard this town is full of lesbians, so I want you to find me one.”  A few miles away, the people of Stockport are immensely proud of the  night bus route, on which they insist every journey entertains you. One discussion went, “Does that bloke still get on with no shirt, always carrying a rabbit ” – “Of course he does, he’s the driver.” Stockport also shyexperienced a plague of wild peacocks. No one knew where they’d come from, but they were sat on cars, screeching on fences, and the local paper quoted one woman saying, “It was terrying. One came into the kitchen and knocked over a kettle.” In nearby upmarket Wilmslow, Cheshire, where soap stars and Manchester United footballers live, I found a leaflet in an estate agents, advertising a bungalow for poundmillion, which said: “This bungalow boasts one feature not found in any other bungalow in the area: it has an extra floor.”Sometimes it feels asthe area puts on a show on purpose. When I visited shyBirkenhead, Merseyside, someone suggested I go to a local bar called Moodz. It was a long thin room, brightly lit, with a dozen people drinking on their own, facing forwards and scowling, while one man rode up and down in a mobility scooter. Then Come on Eileen by Dexys Midnight Runners came on the jukebox, and a woman of about  stood on a table and sang along to it very loudly. The man in the mobility scooter stripped down to his pants, then stood up, trying to dance while clinging to the bar. The woman came down from the table, whipped off his pants, they sang “too-ra-oo-ra-ay”, while no one  took the slightest bit of notice. The producer of the radio show nudged me and said, “And it’s only half past seven.”  Almost every town has a rich tradition of protest. So everyone in Walsall, West Mids, seems to know Sister Dora – the Victorian nurse who transformed hospitals by campaigning for them to be kept clean – who has a statue in the town centre. And all of Hull knows Lily Bilocca, the woman who led the campaign for safety laws on trawlers, whose face is on a vast mural by the docks. But in the genteel Durham town of Barnard Castle, there was fury because British Telecom installed a small green box on a pavement. One woman said: “I was delivering the church newsletter and wasn’t looking where I was going so I nearly walked into it.” But they were determined to resist. The local paper reported: “A group of knitters are threatening to produce a tea cosy to cover up the cabinet... However, having considered their tea cosy protest, fear of getting into trouble with the authorities is making them think twice.” It’s like reading about the struggles of Nelson Mandela.  Some of the proudest areas are just outside cities. Don’t suggest to someone from Paisley they’re a part of Glasgow. You’ll face abuse that goes, “We’re nowhere near Glasgow, we’re at least two miles from Glasgow, I don’t even know how I know it’s two miles away as I’ve never heard of Glasgow.” In a pub in Paisley I was told of the time a dog’s jaws locked around a man’s testicles. The police were called but action was required urgently, so a passer-by whacked the dog with a baseball bat. Later the police said: “It was lucky this happened in Paisley, as it’s the only place you can shyguarantee there’ll be a passer-by with a baseball bat.” On the surface, modern Britain looks increasingly unorm and soulless. Every town has its shyidentical shypedestrianised precinct, Tesco Expresses, and out-of-town retail parks with Homebase and identical staff and pot-plants. But in Portishead, the shypersonality they asked to turn on the Christmas lights was Nigel who worked in Homebase, “chosen above TV stars, for his cheerful demeanour and helpful attitude”. By the end of the series, I’ll have been to  towns, and every one has been packed with enthusiastic people who adore their town, because each place is ridiculously gloriously dferent. Because it’s only in Hastings that businesses can have names such as “ waxing for men”, and a builder called “William the Concreter”.Mark Steel’s In Town, Radio , Thursday, .pm.

The men can be seen fighting each other during the clash, which is believed to have been filmed in Saxon Road, Luton. In the shocking clip, a terried woman can be heard desperately screaming for help as a thug repeatedly bashes another man in the head with the baseball bat. The incident is believed to have taken place last week, although the reasons behind the fight are not clear. The video - filmed by an unknown bystander from their residential window - begins with the five men fighting by a parked car.    A pair of thugs, one of which is wielding a baseball bat forcibly kick and drag a male passenger out of the parked car and pull him on to the street. Another man tries to fight off the two men and this prompts th assailants to punch him instead. As the male passenger is carried to safety by someone , thugs start savagely attacking and kicking the man. One of the the yobs starts repeatedly beating the man across his head with the baseball bat. The petried female car passenger can be heard screaming: Stop! Please! as the pair of assailants beat the man with the bat and he cowers in pain. Another woman can be heard yelling: Call the Police! as the violence intensies.   Suddenly the filming residents shouts at the men Yo! Relax! as the video cuts to an end. A spokesman for Bedfordshire Police said: We take reports of violence on our streets incredibly seriously, and wont tolerate this kind of behaviour or the use of weapons. Wed urge anyone who witnesses incidents like this to report it to us so we can investigate to try and find those responsible, ensuring they arent able to cause further harm.  The street where this incident is believed to have taken place saw serious violence back in September. Gangs armed with baseball bat and knives clashed and left a teenager fighting for his le. Following the street fight, it was reported that six other people, including three teenagers, were taken for further treatment with serious injuries, including stab wounds. Earlier this month, Chief Constable of Bedfordshire Police, John Boutcher told Conservative MP for South West Bedfordshire, Andrew Selous how the county literally ran out of officers on the day of the brawl and was unable cover incidents after a spate of crime across the area.

After receiving three messages from the stranger, Mary, who was also married to someone  at the time, responded to let Peter know he must have the wrong number. But their relationship soon blossomed over text messages and the pair confided each about their failing relationships - until Peter travelled from Bolton, Lancashire, to stay with Mary and her then husband.   When Peters we found out about their friendship and Mary eventually split from her own partner, the pair realised that fate had brought them together. Despite the unusual method of meeting and the -year age gap, the couple claim their shared sense of humour ensures they are well matched. Mary, from Newcastle, Tyne and Wear, said: It was fate that brought us together. When I first received Peters messages, I just ignored them - I had no idea who they were from. I was receiving messages in the early hours of the morning because Peter worked at a similar time to me and thought he was texting his we. Then one day I had the courage to say Im sorry, but I dont know who you are and he apologised. But we kept in touch on and off about our days after realising we both worked similar hours. We chatted about what was going on in our lives and eventually got round to talking about our relationships at the time.  It turned out Peter was having the same problems in his relationship too and we used each other as a backbone really. After over a year of texting and talking on the phone as just friends, Peter had a blazing row with his we and came to stay with Mary and her then-husband. Mary said: Peter came up for a couple of days after an argument with his we and he stayed at my house with me and my husband. Before he came to Newcastle hed only sent me one photograph of himself and his son at his wedding - thats all Id seen. But I knew he was in need and after talking to my ex-husband, he suggested he came and stayed with us. There was nothing romantic at that point. He tried to get his head together while I just got on with my normal routine. After Peter went back to his hometown of Bolton in March , he left his we a couple of weeks later and went to stay with a friend. In July, Mary left her husband and went to stay with her sister, while Peter decided to move up to Newcastle to be near her - although they insist they were only friends at this point.  It wasnt until later that year that the couples friendship evolved into something more as they helped each other through orces and decided to take a trip to Blackpool. On their , they finally decided to give their relationship a go. Mary said: We didnt decide what was going on until we went to Blackpool just to seewe could work as a couple. At first I thought the age dference would be an issue but it wasnt. We had a lot in common, the same sense of humour and most importantly I trusted him to keep me safe. Its been a lucky escape to a better place. People are always so shocked when we tell them how we met. Theres a girl at work this week who asked Peter - she couldnt believe it. In , after  years together, Mary and Peter finally married at a low-key ceremony surrounded by close friends and family. Mary said: Everything was lovely. I didnt have a new dress - I had a dress that had been made for me previously. Peter had a kilt from his first wedding so we had that all dismantled.   I made the flowers myself and all the button holes for the men. I also made my own wedding cake. Our wedding song goes back to the time we actually met - it was Daniel Bedingfields I Will Never Leave Your Side. Peter, who now works at the same supermarket as Mary in Newcastle, split up with his we after she reportedly became jealous of their friendship. He believes they grew together because of their shared sense of humour and similar experiences. Peter said: Id just bought a new phone so was saving my ex-wes number, but must have typed in the wrong digit. There was one number dferent between my we at the time and Marys numbers. Id sent a few messages and Mary eventually messaged back explaining Id got the wrong number. She explained who she was but I didnt mention it to my we because we were going through a bad patch. From the same day we started talking to each other. It was a case of messaging back and forth then. Eventually, my we found out about Mary but I was still keeping in touch and ringing her. She didnt like that - you can understand why. One day it just got too much and I left. I had to find somewhere to live. I had to sleep on my friends sofas for a couple of months until I could move up to Newcastle. I soon had a job lined up though and in July  I moved up there. I was in the flat for about  months until  when Mary and I got a house together. Weve got the same sense of humour and in the early days we could talk about the things that were going on in our lives. Thats how we grew closer.

Haider Ahmed is said to have also planned a a robbery to fund his journey to the Middle East to fight for ISIS. He was just  when he allegedly told ISIS sympathisers he wanted to carry out a terror attack as soon as possible. A court today heard he was supplied a large hunting kne by friend Imadul Karim, then , as he planned the attack. Prosecutors at Kingston Crown Court claimed the blade was for a terrorist purpose. Ben Lloyd, QC, prosecuting, said: This is a case about the purchase and supply of a large hunting kne.  The purchaser of that kne was Haider Ahmed, despite his young age the evidence reveals that he is a loyal supporter of IS . A young man with a radicalised, dangerous, and entrenched mind who was in contact with others of a similar mindset in other countries. Karim, also on trial, was described by the lawyer as a supporter of IS ornot a supporter himself, he at least had a keen interest in IS and the events of that region. Mr Lloyd QC added: Mr Karim was more than happy to sell the large hunting kne to Mr Ahmed When he did so Karim was, so the prosecution say, aware of Ahmeds mindset and the prosecution say that Karim knew, or at the very least there was reasonable cause to suspect, that the large hunting kne that he was supplying would or might be used for a terrorist purpose.  He purchased the large hunting kne to enable him to use it for terrorist purposes. You will be aware of the other attacks on the streets of London and where in the world , , and , by kne wielding IS supporting terrorists. Mr Ahmed was, the prosecution say, no dferent to those iniduals, he would have be willing to die for the cause. He also explained to others that he would use the kne to commit a robbery. Ahmed, now  and of Redhill, Surrey, has admitted sending users of the secretive social media network Telegram a video of a head exploding. But he denies preparing acts of terrorism between July ,  and July .  Mr Lloyd QC continued: Ahmed sent someone with an account in the name of Abu Dawud a series of images on Telegram which state they are from Khilafa News. That is a website, as its name suggests, that distributed pro IS propaganda. The images that Ahmed sent appear to have come from a video clip. The images show a man in an orange jump suit. In the later images the man is on his knees whilst another man puts a blue rope around the first mans neck. The final image shows the mans head exploding. Karim, from Streatham, south London, denies funding terrorism by making available the kne to Ahmed. The trial, which is due to last two weeks, continues.

Tara Gratton, , claims doctors were baffled by her partially formed vagina before she was diagnosed with Mayer-Rokitansky-K ster-Hauser syndrome . Its a congenital disorder that affects the female reproductive system. After being diagnosed with the most severe form aged , the support worker was told she had no vaginal tunnel, no womb, no cervix, no fallopian tubes, and only one kidney. Tara was left devastated after realising shed never be able to carry her own child but after meeting partner, Stuart Pretswell, , the couple began researching their options.   She opted to have her vaginal tunnel rebuilt through using her bowel as a teenager and is now on the waiting list for a womb transplant - with the couple now hoping, through using her own eggs, theyll be able to start their own family. Tara, from Stakeford, Northumberland, said: At  years old I was diagnosed and had my first surgery so Id be able to have sex as an adult. I had a vaginal tunnel built from my bowel as only part of my vagina had formed properly. My surgery was a risky one as it involved using two inches of my bowel to create a new tunnel opening. I was really young but naturally I was embarrassed about my condition back then as it was so rare. Since then I have met my partner, Stuart, and were desperate to have a family after meeting four years ago.   I dont have a womb so the next surgery I need is a womb transplant. It would be amazing to have our own family to show others anything is possible. Tara was first diagnosed with constant kidney infections before doctors did further tests and realised she had MRKS - a rare disorder that affects  in , females, in ying degrees. She added: My parents had originally taken me to the doctors when I was three, as I kept having kidney infections and nothing seemed able to stop them. I spent a long time in Newcastle Childrens Hospital and with antibiotics, it was eventually managed quite well. It took them a long time to discover what was actually causing all my problems, and doctors even said, it was the first time theyd ever seen a girl like me.  Tara decided to have the invasive vagina surgery at  to give herself a normal future. She added: After the surgery I had to have lots of dilation therapy - which essentially stretched my vagina. Doctors thought I didnt have any oies but as I grew older, I discovered that they were wrong - I did have oies which meant it was possible for me to have children - but I would have to go through IVF and alternative routes. After finding her current partner Stuart, also a support worker, Tara was open about her condition and together theyre excited about the prospect of starting a family together. Tara has since applied for the womb transplant trial, that has only recently become a viable option. The first baby from a womb transplant from a deceased donor was born in December of last year. However, with a long waiting list, Tara is also looking into surrogacy as a possible path. Tara said: We have two embryos in storage and are raising money to cover any potential costs from surrogacy. Now I want to help others like me by speaking out. It took me a long time to get a diagnosis, and to find help - but with more awareness, more support could become available. Tabitha Taya, founder of LivingMRKH, one of the UKs only support groups, said: We first met Tara back in  after she reached out to us after she read our LivingMRKH founders story in a daily newspaper. It is now a pleasure to work with her in sharing her message to help others. We have since got to know Tara through several social gatherings held to support those living with this condition. We all have dreams and aspirations, to be a mother is one of Taras and we wish her and her partner all the very best. The road to parenthood for those with MRKH can be challenging, but not impossible, its important to remember the condition does not define us and there are options available to make our journey a little less stressful and isolating. We hope Taras courage to share her journey provides hope and inspiration to our fellow community.

It then smashed into the rink side camera, making it wobble and go out of focus. Mr McGuire looked shocked and could be seen rubbing his head as he sunk in his seat. The -year-old only had his headphones and microphone on his head, but no safety headwear.   He was commentating on the match between the Tampa Bay Lightning and Columbus Blue Jackets, last night. The spectators at the match are protected from the flying pucks by a wall of thick clear plastic which stops them getting hit. But Mr McGuire was sat at the players benches, which have no such protection. Players are kitted out with head gear and padding, but because they need to jump on and off the ice quickly the area is left clear of barriers.   Pucks leaving the ice rink can travel at up to mph, although it is thought the one that narrowly missed Mr McGuire, was travelling slower. The footage was uploaded to social media following the Tampa Bays - win against the Blue Jackets. Mr McGuire managed to maintain his composure and carried on commentating until the end of the game.

A rather disturbing study by Mattress Advisor has found theres a big dference in how long men and women wait to change sheets which have been soiled through sexual activity.   They discovered the average bloke will wait  days, compared to four days for women. Delightful. Surprisingly, guys are apparently less keen to change their sheets after a one night stand and on average wait  days, compared to  days with women. Generally, single guys admitted they only changed their sheets every  days. Some would argue this probably wont be helping their search for the one...

Now it’s a question of getting settled in as quick as I can and just playing football,” he said.“I had obviously spoken to Derek McInnes and he said to speak to Jim McIntyre before making any decision.“The gaffer at Aberdeen left it up to me.“He told me he’d love to have me still up there butI wanted to go and get games he understood.“So I spoke to the gaffer here on the phone and I loved everything he had to say. I jumped at the chance to come down here.”And the -year-old sees the draws against Hamilton and Kilmarnock since he arrived as proof this is a squad that can pull away from the relegation zone between now and the end of the season.“The only frustrating thing for me so far is that we’ve not taken six points out of six from the two games I’ve been involved in but I think all the fans and us as a team can feel from those performances that we are building momentum.“In the Hamilton game it was a case of everyone trying to get used to each other. A lot of us had only come in right before the deadline and we only really had one training session together.“It was about trying to get to know everyone’s games, their personalities. I think we are all starting to gel now and you can see that on the pitch.“Not having a game last weekend because we’re out of the cup has given us a bit more time to work on that. That gives us a better picture going into the game against Livingston this weekend.”Today’s trip to the Tony Macaroni Arena to face Livingston is a meeting with a team who have taken the Premiership by storm this term but have been struggling for a win of late.Since thumping Hearts - in mid-December, Gary Holt’s team have not won in eight outings. Wright does not see that as a sign this could be an easy  minutes for Dundee.“We have to treat it that every game from now on is going to be a big game for us and this will be.“We know how Livi will be and they will work hard but all we can do is just prepare the way we want to and work on how we can play. Hopefully, that will be enough.“They haven’t won in a few games but it’s a testimony to Livi how many points they have.

They have some very good players,” he said.“The first thing we have to do is try to win our battles but don’t forget they have scored some quality goals, some good team goals.“We have to try to make sure inidually we get the better of them and try to go and create opportunities to win the game.”Dundee go into the clash with controversy over plastic pitches like Livi’s rekindled by a PFA survey showing top-flight players are unied in opposition to them.The manager is also in that camp but hasn’t forgotten that defeat at the Tony Macaroni in his first game in charge was down to what happened in the air and not the surface.That day back in October his team conceded four goals from set pieces.“We didn’t deal with set plays and that killed us. It was an eye-opener that day in terms of what we had to work with,” he said.“There’s no doubt, though, the surface is an advantage. I was the manager of a team, Queen of the South, who had an articial surface andyou train on it every day it’s a definite help.“At the same time I’m not trying to detract from how well Livingston have done because they’ve done exceptionally well.”Dundee are still nursing a few niggling injuries from that Killie draw, but it’s hoped everyone who was on duty then will be available.

First performed in , Within This Dust has gone on to be staged all over the UK and internationally, including at the   memorial and museum.Especially inspired by Richard Drew#s unforgettable photograph, The Falling Man, Within This Dust details the experience of witness, Lisa Hood, and victim, Vince Virr, of the   attacks.The witness finds herself surrounded in dust, made of crumpled paper, and begins a grieving process of hunting through the papers, finding meaning in the words, as someone tries to tidy around her. The second act features the victim joining the witness, creating a connection that will inevitably be broken, when finally, in the third act, the victim is alone, caught between a choice of the smoke and fire within the collapsing building or the  metre drop to freedom.It was a very poignant performance, tenderly expressing the horror of the incident, perhaps now weakened due to overindulgence. When the lights came up everyone stayed where they were, perhaps a little too stunned to move.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

This next phase of the works is expected to last approximately  weeks.Commenting on the works, Eddie Ross, BEAR Scotland’s North West Representative said: #The installation of the next stages of the mitigation measures will provide more protection and resilience against any future landslips blocking this key route at both the Rest and Be Thankful and Glen Kinglas.#The temporary traffic lights are necessary to keep our teams as well as users of the route safe during the works, and the teams will do all they can to complete the project as quickly and safely as possible.#We encourage road users to plan their journeys in advance by checking the Traffic Scotland website for up to date travel information.#"},{"url":null,"title":"third sector interface launches new approach to service delivery","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Third Sector Interfaceis changing the way it supports all types of third sector organisations, including charities, social enterprises and community groups.Due to many people now finding information through digital means and the need for information and assistance to be accessible and consistent across the whole of Argyll and Bute, not just in the main towns, the organisation has launched a new website, argylltsi.org.The website, reflecting the TSI’s new corporate identity, contains a self-serve area allowing third sector organisations to find links to a whole iety of locally-based and more national resources that can support their development needs, as well as useful templates to use to run their organisations.The TSI will be growing and developing self-service over the coming months, with the site becoming a ‘one-stop shop’ for information that third sector organisations need to set up, govern and manage organisations – everything from how to start a social enterprise to raising funding from major donors.The TSI can also now be contacted through a central freephone number #   , available between the hours of am-pm, Monday-Friday.

Her conclusions drawn from experience was that when the monitors were around, there may have been unpleasant situations, but no tragedies. When there was no monitor around – clearly defined by their unorms – people died.Philippa had only been home for eight weeks when she spoke to the Justice and Peace Group, and she admitted that she was still processing the often brutal and violent scenes she had witnessed.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as .

Somerset Park is one of these grounds that sucks you inyou give them a snf. Its a good throwback and their fans make it intimidating and a good atmosphere for teams when you lose a goal. Its brilliant...one of the best grounds in the world to come and play your football. In the past we might have lost a game like this so Im delighted.  Ayr knew a win here would take them top of the Championship and started well with Robbie Crawford missing a good chance in the first minute. But they soon hit the self destruct button as their defence went AWOL to allow Nathan Austin in for a double before Liam Polworth rammed home a third. The game looked over with barely  minutes on the clock and shellshocked Ayr took time to regroup. Coventry-bound Michael Rose rocked the post with a header before Michael Moffat drew a fingertip save from Cammy Mackay. McCall turned to the bench at half time and introduced top gun Shankland who immediately turned the tide. He set up Declan McDaid to haul Ayr back into the contest with a close range finish eight minutes after the restart. And a resurgent Ayr thought they had a penalty when Carl Tremarco appeared to handle in the box but ref Nick Walsh waved away loud protests. United continued to pour forward as the clock ticked down and Shankland set up a grandstand finish when slamming home a  yard free kick with five minutes left.  But their comeback proved too little too late as Inverness clung on. Ayr boss McCall said: Im just gutted. Weve conceded three goals and at least two of them were gted with just crazy defending.

His death revealed he had left his entire fortune in his will to his native town of Troon. His legacy would provide education awards and grants for the people of the town along with a new public school. As Marr’s train travelled north he decided to break his journey, to pay a visit to his sister in Girvan. He was close to his sister Helen and visited her often after her marriage to ColonelABGrant, owner of Killochan Castle estate at Girvan, who was also a senior partner in the firm of Grant Somerville  Co in London and was later ordained as Revd. Grant in the Church of Scotland. Marr had intended to spend part of his fortnight at Girvan but extended his stay to a month. Perhaps his change of heart was due to the widespread unrest taking place in Glasgow at that time. The January of  saw the so-called ‘Harbour Riots’, where racial confrontations were breaking out between black and white merchant seamen on the town’s quayside and spreading into the town. A four day General Strike was called for on January  and four days later George Square was crammed with tens of thousands of angry workmen. Crowds of unemployed men joined in the fracas for a  hour working week. As tempers flared the army was deployed, troops brought in tanks and armored vehicles to control the crowds. As tensions heightened it was not an environment travellers would want to find themselves caught up in. Eventually CK Marr left Girvan on Saturday February  for his onward journey north to his annual shooting and fishing break in Perthshire. As the train made its way towards the city he took ill with acute appendicitis. When taken off the train at the Central Station he was rushed to the Glasgow Nursing Home, but it was already too late as he tragically died in the operating theatre. There is little known of Charles Kerr Marr, despite having a successful career in the coal exporting business. Born on October , , at  Welbeck Crescent, Troon, he was the third son of Captain John Marr, master of the merchant ship ‘Reciprocity’, sailing between Troon and Canada. John Marr and his we Amelia had five children, sons William, John and Charles, along with two daughters, Helen and Amelia. Up to the age of ten, Charles attended the Parish School in Academy Street at Troon, going on to join his two brothers at Irvine Royal Academy to complete his education. On finishing his schooling, Marr was apprenticed at A  J Guthrie, Coal Agents at Troon Harbour. Unlike his brother John, who followed in his father’s footsteps to become a sea captain, Marr left home as soon as his apprenticeship ended, to work as a Commercial Clerk with Kitstons, Iron Merchants in Glasgow. Moving later to take up the position of cashier at Clyde Ironworks, only to leave a short time later to be manager of the firm of GrantSomerville  Co in London. The move may have been influenced by A B Grant, who was a senior partner in the company and married to his sister Helen. By the time he met his future we, some years later, there is no evidence as to when he moved back to Glasgow, or indeed any explanation found as to his change of occupation. Marr is recorded in the Scotland census of  as residing in Renfrew Street in Glasgow and again on his marriage certicate a year later, where he is also recorded as being employed as a Soft Goods Warehouseman.  Little is known as to why he left coal exporting to go into the Drapery business, or where he met and fell in love with his we Agnes Murray Kinghorn. However, Agnes’s father was a General Merchant, so it would seem likely he met her in his line of work. Charles and Agnes married on March ,  and set up home at Sutherland Terrace in Glasgow’s Hillhead. Unfortunately, after only  months of married le, Agnes tragically died of Phthisis Pulmonalis . She was just  years of age. Her death was a severe blow to Marr, leaving him brokenhearted and distraught, which had a profound effect on him. Shortly after he laid his we to rest, he had thought of going abroad to work, but instead accepted an appointment with Hull Blyth  Company of London. Within a year he was made a partner in the company when he developed the firm’s export trade. His work of establishing depots in numerous ports in the world gave him an opportunity to travel abroad, especially to China and Japan, where he found an interest in collecting oriental treasures. During his time with Hull Blyth the firm went on to become one of the largest shipping charterers in the UK. Charles Kerr Marr played a signicant part in the company’s worldwide success. Charles Marr moved to London after his we’s death, he never again owned a house. All his years in London, he alternated between two clubs, the Athenaeum and the Constitutional. The nearest he came to having a home was in his later years, when he rented two rooms in Camden House at Chislehurst in Kent, which was originally built for Napoleon the rd. Just being there helped him to relax and take up golf. He was reputed to be good company with a great sense of humour and well known to be very generous. Marr was a lover of the arts and music and in all that time he rarely spoke of his we, or of her death and he never remarried, even his closest friends assumed he was a bachelor. When he retired in  he spent a good part of each year fishing and shooting in Scotland. Two years before his untimely death, Charles Marr carefully drafted out his will in , leaving his entire fortune to the people of Troon and setting out the way it was to be carried out. Marr’s coal fortune legacy has given the town a magnicent architectural school building with playing fields the envy of the country. Marr College on its own is a fitting tribute to this man of extraordinary vision. By the time Marr College opened in  the school had attracted the most renowned academics to come and teach. It was the only grant aided school in Scotland that didn’t charge fees. A public school for every child of the town, had oak led class rooms, inlaid parquet flooring, Italian tiled corridorsa copper domed library, purple velvet drapes and teachers attired in flowing cloaks with mortar boards on their heads, this was seen by all to be a stunning,not magnicent, comprehensive school, deemed to be the best school in Scotland and envied by it. The CK Marr Educational Trust, the only one of its kind in Scotland, has provided awards or grants to hundreds of Troon students, of all ages each year. The addition of the MarrEducation Resource Centre in Troon Library, the only one then in Ayrshire, is a valuable educational resource for all who use it. Marr College and the CK Marr Educational Trust are a testimony to the wishes of Charles Kerr Marr and a fitting memorial to this great benefactor. He was buried beside his beloved we in CathcartCemetery in Glasgow. Over the past century the people of Troon owe a huge debt to custodians of Marr’s vision, the Marr Trustees, past and present. Over the decades the many Trustees, Boards of Governors and ious Clerks, Treasurers and Accountants, who have and still do today and for many decades to come, have successfully upheld the wishes of the town’s greatest ever benefactor and extraordinary visionary, Charles Kerr Marr.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnChurch of ScotlandUniversities and CollegesGlasgowEducationFishingArmed forcesLove and romanceSchoolsRenfrewTroonPerthshireGirvanAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"cinema set return prestwick after","story":"NewsCinema set forto Prestwick after  year gapReturn to the golden age of screen in PrestwickShareByStephen Houston:,  FEB NewsFriends of Broadway - they want cinema open again \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCinema made a boldto Prestwick for the first time in more than  years.

Licensing bosses at East Ayrshire Council knocked back the flurry of applications for early morning drinking before the January  showdown. Despite the historic nature of the sporting event, the department decided to maintain their stance on trying to clamp down on excess boozing during football. The East Ayrshire Licensing board depute clerk Stuart McCall told councillors it was important to maintain the standard policy and have consistency. He pointed to Celtic and Rangers matches as examples of tense clashes requiring robust licensing rules. Mr McCall said: “The standard practice is games start early and the reason for that is to limit the amount of alcohol supporters can have.” “We all know the outcome excess alcohol can have in certain circumstances.” Congragulating Talbot, he added: “We are all delighted to see the result. “The maintenance of the policy is important so we are not accused of favouritism.” Some venues wanted to offer breakfast to supporters. Auchinleck Talbot defeated Ayr by one goal to nil. Alcohol was not permitted inside the grounds and fans were told they would be refused entryintoxicated.

John Senior has been an animal surgeon in the town for  years. He has also immersed himself in activities and volunteering for all sorts of causes. This week he was continuing his latest community activity as a hand bell ringer at Cumnock Old Church. John, , said: “All I want is the best for Cumnock and we are so fortunte to have so many things going on now. “I just want to make it better than it is.” The Keir McTurk Memorial Committee chose John after “much deliberation” from all the nominations. Chairman Colin Chisholm said: “John is someone who prefers to work behind the scenes rather than be at the forefront. “But his efforts for the community have proved invaluable.” John, originally from Edinburgh, has freshly retired from the Crossriggs veterinary practice in the town. When he arrived in  it was chiefly large livestock but treats mostly small animals. His we Heather, also a vet, remains involved in the management and their son Iain, the third member of the Senior family who is a vet, runs the practice. John is a very active member of the Cumnock Action Plan Committee, in which he has reformed the Cumnock Gardening Club assisted living in the arrangements for the Christmas festival and was actively involved in the poppy display marking the centenary of the end of the First World War.

Assistance he gives to both the Highland games committee and Camps is described as “invaluable.” But he said: “I don’t like standing on a pedestal. I prefer being in the background. “I somehow manage to find time for the things I want to do and I am not very good at sitting down doing nothing. “I enjoy being active and putting things back into a town that has supported me and given me a living for  years.” The presentation is likely to be at Dumfries House.

Cycling Without Age Prestwick is transforming lives of those with limited mobility in the area with their specially designed trishaw, a light three -wheeled vehcile with pedal used in Asian countries . The three-wheeled rickshaw is a little more than a ‘sofa on wheels’ as it is engineered to accommodate two passengers in the front and driven by a pilot in the rear. Those with mobility restrictions - old and young- can take a trip to the seafront, enjoy the Prestwick promenade views and have a good old natter. Now the community project, who’s base has been kindly gted by St Ninian’s Episcopal Church, are eager to find more volunteer pilots and those keen to get out on the trishaw. Chris Cheales, of Cycling Without Age Prestwick, said: “We now have two trishaws and we are in the middle of a training programme to help - people become qualied before starting the operation in spring. We offer two-hour sessions to two passengers and there is the opportunity to go for a drink, stop to chat, pet a dog or just enjoy the views. “We are looking for people with limited mobility who may or may not also struggle with loneliness and isolation and who would benefit from the freedom of feeling ‘the wind in their hair’. “Time is a wonderful gt to give anyone. The group hope to expand as the project grows and take their trishaws on tour to visit care homes in the area. Chris added: “We envisage days allocated to ‘user groups’, to include care homes, those recommended by Dementia Friendly Prestwick, retirement housing and local churches. “Trishaws are not cheap so we need ongoing help to keep all this on the road. “We are looking forward to another sunny summer and sharing the project with others.” The Prestwick Peoples Project has also benefitted those involved, helping volunteers flourish and gain confidence. Zara Crumlish has been a Young Ambassador for Cycling Without Age for six months. Zara, , said: “I’ve always wanted to ride a bike when I was younger but I didn’t have the balance. “The trishaw has helped me get my confidence up. “It gets me out and about with the community. “And I’m excited because I really can’t wait to take elderly people out and show them the Prom.” •Would you like to be trained as a Trishaw Pilot  Or a willing volunteer to be a co-pilot to accompany trips  .

In fact, on average, Borderers are forking out pound less than their Northumbrian opposite numbers.Since First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the end of the freeze in , Scottish Borders Council has taken full advantage of the ability to raise council tax by % each year, and this year is no dferent, as the council agreed to a three per cent increase in December .However, the deal agreed by the SNP and Scottish Greens allows councils to raise tax by up to . per cent for  .Council leader Shona Haslam, who represents Tweeddale East, has been adamant that Scottish Borders Council will not take advantage of the increased limit, and will not raise an extra . per cent on Borderersrsquo council tax, instead sticking to an increase of three per cent.Council will not introduce workplace parking levy:Scottish Conservatives in the Borders have been very vocal about their opposition to the Scottish Government plans to introduce a workplace parking levy, where employers will be charged an annual tax based on how many parking spaces they provide for their employees.The aim is to persuade more commuters to use public transport in a bid to reduce pollution, but the charge could lead to employers passing the bill onto their employees.Both councillor Haslam and Scottish Borders Councilrsquos SNP opposition leader Stuart Bell, who both represent the rural ward of Tweeddale East, have signalled their opposition to the plans, so it is extremely unlikely this will feature in the councilrsquos budget proposals.Borderers who travel to Edinburgh for work could possibly be affected by the levy though, as Edinburgh City Council is considering implementing the charges.A move to three-weekly bin collections:Rumours have been circulating amongst councillors that Scottish Borders Councilrsquos waste refuse collection service will move to three-weekly bin collections, from the current once-a-fortnight collectionThe local authority is currently reviewing its waste collection service, which is expected to feed into the new budget for  .In fact, at a meeting of the council in October , Selkirkshire councillor Gordon Edgar, the authorityrsquos executive member for roads and infrastructure, refused to rule out the possibility when questioned by Hawick and Denholm councillor David Paterson.,params: .pushThe veteran Hawick councillor said: ldquoIf they go to a three-weekly collection it would cause some very serious problems for many of the people that we represent and I am sure it would increase the incidents of fly tipping.No tourism tax:Another controversial aspect of the SNP Scottish Greens budget proposals is the introduction of a tourism tax on nightly accommodation.Much like the workplace parking levy, local authorities have discretion over whether to implement it or not, and again Scottish Borders Tories have ruled out introducing it here.Changes to grass cutting services:Grass cutting, or the lack of it, has been a constant thorn in the side of the council over the past year.As an issue which caused a large furore, Scottish Borders Council could well announce further changes to the grass cutting regime, particularly around the maintenance of cemeteries.Changing the frequency of grass cutting from a -day cycle to a -day cycle was widely criticised by communities, with residents reporting overgrown public spaces and ankle-high grass in the regionrsquos cemeteries.Many opposition councillors have called for a rethink on the councilrsquos grass cutting policy, and due to the large number of complaints from Borders resident it is expected to be addressed in Thursdayrsquos budget announcement."},{"url":null,"title":"may-blackmailing-mps-over-brexit-deal-corbyn-claims","story":"Theresa May is trying to ldquoblackmail MPs into backing her Brexit deal by running down the clock to prevent alternative plans being considered, Jeremy Corbyn claimed.The Labour leader accused the Prime Minister of risking a no-deal Brexit in order to keep the Conservative party together.Mr Corbyn, who has suffered a split in his own party ndash in part due to Brexit policy ndash called on the Prime Minister to accept his offer of working on a ldquosensible deal.\"Jeremy Corbyn claimed Theresa Mayrsquos Brexit tactics were an attempt to lsquoblackmailrsquo MPs into supporting her deal Addressing manufacturersrsquo organisation Make UK, formerly known as EEF, he said Labourrsquos plan ndash based on a customs union ndash ldquocould win the support of Parliament, be negotiated with the EU and help bring the country together.Mr Corbyn, who is due to hold talks with EU negotiator Michel Barnier on Thursday, said the Labour planldquohas been widely welcomed as a way of breaking the impasse.He added: ldquoIf the Prime Minister is unable to adopt a sensible deal because it would split the Tories, then there needs to be a general election.

Now, with less regulation in place, there are thousands.’True to the name, Viola FC is a family-run agency # his son Johnny joined its ranks in early  # with their main work both in representing players coming to the UK, and ‘brokering’.John explained: ‘We mostly represent footballers transferring to the UK, while brokering involves working with clubs, players and other agents to help bring those players here.‘That said, we have done a lot of work in countries such as Brazil and China in recent years, where there is a huge appetite for football. You make valuable contacts and get to see some exciting players.’However, for John the image of the football agent thrashing out a lucrative deal for himself as well as for the player, fails to tell the whole story.He explained: ‘Of course working in football can be financially rewarding, but it’s a hard job. People think you’re just walking around in a suit with a laptop and phone, but so much goes into being a player representative.‘You need to travel a lot, and that means lots of airport lounges and hotel rooms.‘You’re working long days and doing lots behind the scenes, and all year round,  because that’s what it takes.‘The public see the excitement of the transfer windows on TV and then think that’s all agents do.‘If an agent does their job properly, they are available day and night, looking after the whole package for the player, like houses and children’s schooling.‘We’re more than a ‘necessary evil’, we do an important service for both the club, and the player.’Thinking about Campbeltown visits again, John brings up a memorable trip to the Wee Toon, where his son Johnnybecame an unofficial pool champ.John said: ‘My uncle John took us to the Commercial Inn to watch a game of football on the TV. Johnny was only young but he ‘won’ a pool competition in the pub.‘Of course, the adults had let him win, but he believed for about ten years he was the pool champion of Campbeltown!‘That’s just one but I have lots of good memories of visiting Campbeltown, and the surrounding areas, such as Machrihanish.#For me Kintyre is a special part of Scotland.’Reflecting on a career in football of more than  years, including representing many Celtic and Rangers players, his hunger as an agent remains.John, whose recent travels include talent-scouting missions to Portugal and Ghana, added: ‘I am blessed to do this job.

The doorsquocot is a clue that once a residence of some signicance stood here. It was called Dolphingstone Castle. Nothing now visibly remains of the castle, but around  years ago ruins were still to be seen.It was at one time an elegant mansion, but before that, on the same site, an older castle once stood ndash now all gone, and the structures of modernity are hemming in what is left of this ancient site. A wave of new housing laps at its walls to the west, the A traffic roars past on its south, and roads surround it on other quarters.One wondersthis small slice of East Lothian history will survive the developers. I hope it does. It is a small, historic fingerprint and gives a mysterious glimpse into our countyrsquos past, in an area now being carpeted with thousands of new houses.Earlier maps suggest that Dolphingstone Castle was surrounded by woodland. So perhaps the planting of a small wood or orchard within the old walls could create an island of both nature and history amidst the tide of urbanising development in this area.Up above on the ridge of Falside Hill to the south, the restored Farsquoside Castle looks down on the developments below . It sits like an eagle perched on a high ridge, observing the land below.How dferent the landscape it surveys would have been in  when, according to an old story, a small force of hand-picked warriors descended from the castle under the cover of darkness.It was just past midnight when they left, guided by a slither of moon. It was a raiding party, bent on revenge and heading for Preston Tower in what is now Prestonpans.Tradition tells us a feud had existed between the houses of Farsquoside and Preston for some years. The cause of the feud was the breaking down of walls between the two estates and the animals of each side grazing on the land of the other. Regular, and sometimes violent, clashes had taken place.But then Hamilton of Prestonrsquos livestock had been poisoned, or so it seemed. They had drunk from a burn which flowed from Farsquoside and it was assumed the water had been deliberately poisoned. Hamilton of Preston Tower, making no investigation, sent his men on a raid of violent retribution.Farsquoside Castle was attacked and blood was shed. This was the act which the select band of warriors who had set forth from Farsquoside were to avenge.In darkness, they filed down from the ridge on a path now known as Whinney Loan. This took them down to where the new houses are now being built on the southern edge of Wallyford.From here, great care was needed lest they be seen or heard. Dolphingstone Castle lay ahead and although their grievance was not with the occupants of Dolphingstone, early discovery could ruin the element of surprise.So the raiders veered north of Dolphingstone, by way of Prestoungrange, and at dawn, with the smell of the salt pans in their noses, they set about their vengeful work.Screams and running bairns alerted the occupants of Preston Tower. Armed men were ready, for this raid was expected, although not from this direction.The walls of Preston Tower held the attackers at bay but the people of the village suffered the worst of the slaughter. What senseless violence: neighbours separated only by the brae of a hill had been whipped up into a hateful frenzy against each other. Gradually the raiders melted away, back up the hill, with blooded swords.But hate builds on hate and the reckoning was not slow in coming. The very next day, Hamilton of Preston led a force westwards. It arrived by the walls of Dolphingstone Castle and then rounded past them to head up the hill towards Farsquoside, crossing where now the A speeds by.No attempt at surprise was required, this was to be an open fight. The Lord of Farsquoside had arranged his men along the top of the ridge, looking down on the approaching force of Hamiltonrsquos men. The order to charge was given and the men of Farsquoside poured down the slope.The leaders of both sides were in the thick of the fighting. It was the Lord of Farsquoside who fell, pulled from his horse and hacked to death by Hamiltonrsquos men.Seeing the death of their leader, the men of Farsquoside fled back to the castle. But the Lady of Farsquoside, in shock and rage at the death of her husband, rallied the men. She led them out of the castle in a furious charge as the sun began to set, forcing Hamiltonrsquos men to flee back to Preston.The battle, or skirmish as some would call it, was over, and the feud had reached its bloody climax. Soon after it was discovered an infectious disease had stricken the cattle, not poisoned water. Cattle on both sides had been equally affected. No one was to blame.How easy it had been to make enemies out of neighbours based on  assumptions. We are told Hamilton attempted to make amends. But the dead could not rise and the Lady of Farsquoside was said to be devastated at the loss of her husband. We can be sure others of lesser status suffered no less.This feud was over little remains to record it except tradition passed down, captured and retold by th-century writers such as P MrsquoNeill and Robert Seton, from whose works this account is garnished.Preston Tower still stands in Prestonpans, in a ruined but still defiant state. Farsquoside, much restored, is a visual delight still keeping watch atop the ridge. But only those feint hinds of Dolphingstone Castle remain, most of it lost to time and mystery just like the details of this story.But all the more reason to preserve and value them, I think."},{"url":null,"title":"prominent-cockenzie-campaigner-larry-tomlins-remembered","story":"Larry Tomlins, who was chairman of Cockenzie West Tenants and Residents Association, was involved in campaigns to reduce speeding and upgrade local park facilities in his community.The grandfather-of-two was an active supporter of the recent fight to implement speeding restrictions outside new housing at The Chimneys, Cockenzie, and helped oversee the trial and subsequent introduction of  miles per hourspeed limits in the Whin Park area of the village.Mr Tomlins, , grew up in Ayrshire and moved to Cockenzie more than  years ago, where he raised his family with we Ann.A consultant engineer, he ran his own successful business and still found the time to be an active member of his local community.He was a founding member of the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association, which helped improve Whin Park for local families.Ward councillor Fiona OrsquoDonnell said: ldquoLarry made a huge contribution to the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association and the wider community.

But spring still feels like a long way off.I crave it, not just because it makes the evening walks in the woods possible once more, but because of the beauty it s to the landscape.The land is still dormant, with nature seemingly sleeping. Itrsquos at this time of year that the ugly results of peoplersquos disregard for the land can be most clearly seen. Litter of all kinds lsquodecoratesrsquo the roadsides. In summer it is partly hidden as hedges, roadside bushes and grasses grow. But in winter nature retreats and exposes the extent of peoplersquos uncaring behaviour.I canrsquot understand it, I really canrsquot. Our country is so beautul, yet so many people just throw rubbish from their car window. Do they not see the results and feel a sense of shame and horror  In a country where we have the facilities to dispose of our rubbish, there is simply no excuse to trash our landscape like this.And in a time when there are cuts to vital services, councils having to pay money to pick up peoplersquos rubbish from the sides of roads is just another unseen effect. Itrsquos not just that itrsquos ugly to look at, itrsquos polluting our environment, killing wildle and leaving an appalling legacy for our children.And so as we set off last Sunday for a walk, the sight of litter strewn everywhere along the roadside was quite depressing. And my children noticed its ugliness too. ldquoWhy do people litter like this  I was asked by my five-year-old Skye, and to be honest I struggled for an answer.ldquoI really donrsquot know, but it must be because they donrsquot care.My daughter seemed forlorn at this reply as we drove past a mass of discarded fast food remains, plastic bottles, beer bottles, plastic bags and yet more fast food rubbish.But I wanted to lt her spirits and so told her we were going on a hunt for something beautul. We were on a snowdrop hunt! And so as we drove to our destination, I reminded them of my version of the old story:lsquoMany years ago, Snow had no colour. It felt ashamed and left out to be colourless, especially when the land was so beautully covered in flowers of all dferent colours.And so Snow asked the flowersthey would be willing to share just a little of their colour. First Snow asked the daffodils, who were a beautul yellow. But they said no, they needed all their colour for themselves.Then Snow asked the bluebells, who were a wonderful blue. But they said they were too small to share any of their colour.Then Snow asked the whin bushesthey could share some of their vivid yellow, and they said no because they needed the colour.Snow even asked the roses of summer, but got the same answer: no.Then Snow heard a small voice and looked down. It was a small white flower. We can share some of our colour, with you it said.ldquoBut you are so small and you need your colour for yourself, said Snow. ldquoYes, the flower replied, ldquowe are small and we need our colour, but there are many of us andeach one of us gives a little then we can give you enough colour.ldquoThat is very kind of you but I donrsquot want to ruin your beautul appearance, said Snow.ldquoDonrsquot worry, said the wee white flower, ldquowe can all take a little colour from the inside of our petals, so it will not be noticed that any white is missing.rsquoAnd so that is how Snow became white. And because of the kindness shown by this little flower, Snow agreed to share its name with it, and so they became known as snowdrops.Snow also shared its space with the wee flower, so snowdrops and snow are often seen on the ground together. Andyou look carefully inside the snowdrop, you will see the hidden part where the white has been scraped off to give to Snow.With the storyrsquos end we arrived at Smeaton Lake, near East Linton, our destination for the snowdrop hunt. Itrsquos such a beautul place where a planted wood stands guard by a lake created  years ago. The woodland here is possibly unsurpassed in East Lothian for the canopy of snowdrops it displays.Excited screams at small patches of the flower soon gave way to ldquowow, look as we reached the end of the waterside and a wood carpeted by the wee flowers.My spirits were lted as I watched my daughter carefully examine flowers for evidence they had shared their colour. She showed her wee brother the green strips inside, explaining that is where the white was shared from. Both were careful not to damage or pick the flowers, despite their desire to do so.ldquoWersquoll find some growing in a less happy place and take those ones home, I assured them.And so we eventually headed back, a delicious bowl of ice cream at The Goth in Prestonpans, accompanied by traditional music, the reward for a good dayrsquos hunting.That night my daughter was reflective. ldquoI wish people wouldnrsquot spoil nature, she said. I felt guilty shersquos only five, I thought to myself, and shouldnrsquot have to be concerned about such things at that age. Perhaps I should have kept my thoughts to myself.ldquoBut I wonrsquot, and Irsquoll tell my friends not to as well. Can you tell me the snowdrop story again  So I told her the story once more.She had one wee snowdrop in a bowl by her bed. We had found it growing precariously at the verge of the road, surrounded by litter, and she wanted to lsquosaversquo it. So we did, hopefully with roots intact.ldquoWell we will plant the snowdrop in the garden and perhaps we will have our own snowdrops next year! I said to her, and she was happy at this.I went downstairs as she slept. My thoughts and emotions flooded me. My anger and depression at the ignorant mess we are making of our planet was superseded by my daughterrsquos determination to make a small dference, just like the snowdrop in the story.And perhaps therein lies the true message of that old tale: a dference can be made,we all do a little, but do it together.The children are the future, but letrsquos not leave all our ugly mess and destruction to our children to deal with. Let us all do something small, as many already are, to change the way we behave and how we appreciate what we have been gted.For our childrenrsquos sake, I really hope itrsquos not too late."},{"url":null,"title":"county-team-conquer-kilimanjaro-in-memory-of-vera-cameron","story":"Dougie Cameron and daughter Laura-Jane were joined by seven other men and women in climbing Mount Kilimanjaro last week.The trek was the latest fundraiser in memory of Vera Cameron and in aid of Cancer Research UK.Laura-Jane said that her mum would have thought the fundraisers were ldquooff our heads but would be ldquoreally proud of their achievement, which takes the fundraising total to about pound,.She said: ldquoIt was a really tough challenge but the fact we were doing it for charity kept us going.ldquoAt the end of the day, it was for such a good cause and we wanted to get to the top and keep the sponsorship going.ldquoThe whole experience was totally dferent to what I expected.ldquoBeing over seven days, we have never done anything like that before and it was tough mentally and physically.ldquoWe had one goal ndash to get to the summit ndash and we ended up making lots of new friends and spent a lot of time with other groups.ldquoIt was a really good experience overall.Vera, of Macmerry, worked for East Lothian Council as a senior administrator in transportation.Dougie, who is site attendant at Kinwegar Recycling Centre in Wallyford, was joined by seven colleagues from the council on the memorable trip.Laura-Jane, , and her dad set off from Scotland on January  alongside Ray Montgomery , Paul Ritchie , Lorraine Faulds , William Kelley , Stuart Baxter , Rachael Cormackand Vanessa Sanal .The group began the trip up the near-,-metre-high mountain on the Saturday and reached the summit last Thursday.Then it was back down before flying home on Sunday and back to work on Monday.Laura-Jane, who works as a PR officer, said it was ldquosurreal to think that just a few days earlier she had been standing at the top of Kilimanjaro.Already, more than pound, has been donated to the good cause, with that figure set to rise to pound, when all the money has been donated and counted.Previously, fundraisers have completed a number of other challenges ndash although nothing on the scale of the latest achievement ndash in memory of Vera, who was  when she passed away from cancer in .The West Highland Way, which stretches from Milngavie to Fort William , and the Three Peaks Challenge, which sees the highest peaks in Scotland, England and Wales ndash Ben Nevis, Scafell Pike and Snowdon respectively ndash climbed have been completed.Laura-Jane, who lives in Tranent, said: ldquoI think my mum would think we were off our heads for doing what we have done but really proud of us.

Irsquom not sure who exactly has been preventing transgender women using public conveniences. So far as I know, you donrsquot have to show a birth certicate, or undergo a medical exam to have a pee. But what do I know as a pale, stale male.What I do know is that ldquocis-gender is an ugly neologism which many women find offensive. They are content with their present sexual terminology. ldquoCis is in the same linguistic ballpark as ldquoTERF ndash trans exclusionary radical feminist, which is a term of abuse used against women who believe persons with penises are, er, male.

At any rate, the Scottish Government appears determined to press ahead with reform of the Gender Recognition Act, which will allow trans people to assign themselves legally and biologically female. Hitherto, trans people have had to undergo medical examination and get a diagnosis of ldquogender dysphoria. No more. From now on, anyone can change their birth certicate to whatever they wish.Earlier this month, Holyroodrsquos culture committee warned that ending binary ldquoMale or Female questions in the Scottish census will render much of the results meaningless and, willy nilly, import an unscientic definition of sex into the law.

They can complain that ldquosex is a protected characteristic under the  Equalities Act, and that women therefore have a right to their own unique spaces. But now that men can actually become women under the law, this right will be impossible to articulate. Trans women with male anatomy will be entitled to enter womenrsquos changing rooms, girl guide troops or womenrsquos prisons.

Irsquom not sure who exactly has been preventing transgender women using public conveniences. So far as I know, you donrsquot have to show a birth certicate, or undergo a medical exam to have a pee. But what do I know as a pale, stale male.What I do know is that ldquocis-gender is an ugly neologism which many women find offensive. They are content with their present sexual terminology. ldquoCis is in the same linguistic ballpark as ldquoTERF ndash trans exclusionary radical feminist, which is a term of abuse used against women who believe persons with penises are, er, male. I should be careful here because a number of TERFS have been banned from social media for saying that a person with a penis is a man. So I wonrsquot say that.Instead, letrsquos just take it as read that in future we are going to have to accept that the concept of sexual dferentiation with which we have been living for thousands of years is finally being exposed as a malign transphobic hood. At any rate, the Scottish Government appears determined to press ahead with reform of the Gender Recognition Act, which will allow trans people to assign themselves legally and biologically female. Hitherto, trans people have had to undergo medical examination and get a diagnosis of ldquogender dysphoria. No more. From now on, anyone can change their birth certicate to whatever they wish.Earlier this month, Holyroodrsquos culture committee warned that ending binary ldquoMale or Female questions in the Scottish census will render much of the results meaningless and, willy nilly, import an unscientic definition of sex into the law. But the Scottish Government is not listening. Nicola Sturgeon told a UN equalities conference last week that the concerns of feminists about the GRA are ldquomisplaced.Women ndash sorry, ldquomenstruators ndash who say that self-ID erases their sexual identity will be told: just get over it. They can complain that ldquosex is a protected characteristic under the  Equalities Act, and that women therefore have a right to their own unique spaces. But now that men can actually become women under the law, this right will be impossible to articulate.

Good riddance.To say This Week is past its sell-by date is an understatement. Launched in , it seemed fresh and quirky back then to have heavyweight Neil cosy up with a coterie of pals after dark to chat about political developments. Over the years, Michael Portillo and DianeAbbott,party rivals who had known each other since school, became the Richard and Judy of the show, giggling away with cheeky chappy Neil about the issues of the day under New Labour. It was all very self-congratulatory, a bit like the times themselves.Marianne Taylor: Onus is on men to stop abusing workplace powerSixteen years later, itrsquos not only the governing party that has changed. Over the years, as the issues being became more downbeat ndash the  financial crisis, austerity and now the Brexit crisis ndash the format looked ill-equipped to deal with the big questions. Most cringeworthy of all, however, was Paisley-born Neil himself.Donrsquot get me wrong, the aggressive, belligerent interviewing style he is known for had its place, certainly back in the alpha-male s and s when he was king of the jungle . But, as is the case with Humphrys, the increasingly arrogant behaviour on air and in public debate reveals a comically self-important figure who makes Alan Partridge look in touch with the times.Take his embarrassingly pompous monologue about the greatness of Winston Churchill on last weekrsquos show, following weeks of hysterical and pointless national debate about whether the wartime PM should be judged hero or villain. Casting himself as a cross between Margaret Thatcher and a s grammar school headmaster, Neil imperiously instructed us with a severe wag of the finger that Churchill was indeed the most heroic Briton that ever lived. Talk about condescending. And also plain bizarre.Why any BBC journalist would be allowed to showboat like this on live television is quite beyond me. But it just goes to show how unwieldy Neil has become. A couple of weeks earlier he had an equally cringeworthy on-air spat with left-wing columnist Owen Jones, who took him to task over his affiliations with the right-wing press. Surprise, surprise Neil did not take kindly to being put on the spot.Marianne Taylor: Onus is on men to stop abusing workplace powerAs to why he thought it was acceptable to take to Twitter and call respected Observer journalist Carole Cadwalladr, whose excellent work helped expose the Cambridge Analytica scandal a ldquomad cat woman, one can only surmise - rightly, it would seem - that he believes he should be held to dferent standards than other BBC journalists. He has refused to properly apologise for this blatant misogyny.Did this catalogue of awful behaviour have anything to do with him leaving This Week  Who knows. The BBCrsquos director of news, Fran Unsworth, says she is looking to ldquodevelop future projects with Neil. Well, wersquoll see.As for Humphrys, I donrsquot doubt that some will miss his Daily Mail-style sneering and harrumphing on Today at any societal development that wasnrsquot around in his day, his astonishing insensitivity when discussing sexual crimes and the unequal pay of his own female colleagues, his terrible condescension when interviewing young peopleand ethnic minorities, but I certainly wonrsquot. The way in which he has approached Brexit, meanwhile ndash suggesting truculently to the Irish foreign minister recently that Ireland should leave the EU and ldquothrow in their lot with the UK was a particular low point ndash has led many people, me included, to switch off.Irsquom not saying for a minute BBC journalists shouldnrsquot be robust in their questioning, and there are plenty, both male and female ndash Kirsty Wark, Gary Robertson, Emily Maitlisand Nick Robinson spring to mind ndash who can incisively demolish the arguments of those in power.But punching down and wearing prejudices on your sleeve is not only editorially questionable, leaving the Beeb open to accusations of bias, but also astonishingly arrogant.And here we come to the crux of the matter: Neil and Humphrys have had their day. They have worn their arrogance and male privilege as a badge of honour for too long, lacking the humility or self-awareness to examine their own behaviour. Put them out to pastureso they can moan away till their hearts content, perhaps even to each other, about how hard done by they are, how it wasnrsquot like this in the old days.As research highlights, the BBC is losing younger viewers and listeners in their droves. Andrew Neil and John Humphrys are part of the problem - and the Beeb is better off without them."},{"url":null,"title":"the-schools-using-pizza-and-cake-to-tackle-the-poverty-gap","story":"A Scottish council has introduced a range of new initiatives to help primary and secondary schools close the attainment gap between rich and poor.These include pizza nights for hundreds of families to encourage them to become involved in their childrsquos education as well as cake and coffee sessions for teachers to plan a smooth transition for pupils between primary and secondary school.Other projects adopted by schools in Renfrewshire include greater use of data to show evidence of what works, leadership training for teachers and specialised literacy and numeracy support for classroom assistants.Parents and teachers have worked together to ensure pupils from all socio-economic backgrounds can afford to take part in school activities and nearly , pupils have benefited from a programme which develops self-control leading to a signicant reduction in anti-social behaviour.New figures show the initiatives are having a signicant impact.The council achieved an  percentage point increase in expected levels of literacy and a five percentage point increase in expected levels of numeracy between  and .Over the same period, the poverty-related attainment gap has reduced by six percentage points in literacy and four percentage points in numeracy.Now the council is the first in Scotland to be rated ldquoexcellent for its progress in closing the attainment gap by school inspectors.Renfrewshire is one of nine councils in the Scottish Governmentrsquos attainment challenge, with more than a quarter of pupils living in some of Scotlandrsquos most deprived postcodes.

socialist said in an email to supporters.\"Our campaign is about transforming our country and creating a government based on the principles of economic, social, racial and environmental justice.\":Democratic Senator Bernie Sanders Congratulates Scotland on fracking banAn enthusiastic progressive who embraces proposals ranging from Medicare for All to free college tuition, Mr Sanders stunned the Democratic establishment in  with his spirited challenge to Hillary Clinton.While she ultimately became the partys nominee, his campaign helped lay the groundwork for the leftward lurch that has dominated Democratic politics in the Trump era.The question now for Mr Sanders is whether he can stand out in a crowded field of Democratic presidential candidates who also embrace many of his policy ideas and are newer to the national political stage.That is far dferent from , when he was Mrs Clintons lone progressive adversary.But there is no question that Mr Sanders will be a formidable contender for the Democratic nomination.He won more than  million votes in  and dozens of primaries and caucuses, and opens his campaign with a nationwide organisation and a proven small-dollar fundraising effort.\"Were gonna win,\" Mr Sanders told CBS.He said he was going to launch \"what I think is unprecedented in modern American history\": a grassroots movement \"to lay the groundwork for transforming the economic and political le of this country\".And he could be well positioned to compete in the nations first primary in neighbouring New Hampshire, which he won by  points in .But he will not have the state to himself.:The rise of Bernie SandersCalornia senator Kamala Harris, another Democratic presidential contender, was in New Hampshire on Monday and said she would compete for the state.She also appeared to take a dig at Mr Sanders.\"The people of New Hampshire will tell me whats required to compete in New Hampshire,\" she told shoppers at a bookshop in Concord.\"But I will tell you Im not a democratic socialist.\"Senator Elizabeth Warren, of nearby Massachusetts, will be in New Hampshire on Friday.One of the biggest questions surrounding Mr Sanderss candidacy is how he will compete against someone like Ms Warren, who shares many of his policy goals.Ms Warren has already launched her campaign and has planned an aggressive swing through the early primary states.Shortly after announcing her exploratory committee, Ms Warren hired Brendan Summers, who managed Mr Sanderss  Iowa campaign.Other staff from Mr Sanderss first bid have also said they would consider working for other candidates in .The crowded field includes a number of other candidates who are likely to make strong appeals to the Democratic base, including Ms Harris and senators Cory Booker, of New Jersey, Amy Klobuchar, of Minnesota, and Kirsten Gillibrand, of New York.The field could also grow, with a number of high-profile Democrats still considering presidential bids, including former vice president Joe Biden and former Texas representative Beto ORourke.While Mr Sanders had been working to lay the groundwork for a second campaign for months, it was unclear whether he will be able to expand his appeal beyond his largely white base of supporters.In , Mr Sanders notably struggled to garner support from black voters, an issue that could become particularly pervasive during a primary race that could include several non-white candidates.Last month, he joined Mr Booker at an event in Columbia, South Carolina, marking the Martin Luther King Jr holiday.In , Mr Sanders lost the South Carolina primary, which features a heavily black electorate, by  points.Mr Sanders also faces dferent pressures in the #MeToo era.Some of his male staff and supporters in  were described as \"Bernie bros\" for their treatment of women.In the run-up to Mr Sanderss  announcement, persistent allegations emerged of sexual harassment of women by male staff during his  campaign.Politico and The New York Times reported several allegations of unwanted sexual advances and pay inequity.In an interview with CNN after the initial allegations surfaced, Mr Sanders apologised but also noted he was \"a little busy running around the country trying to make the case\".As additional allegations emerged, he offered a more unequivocal apology.\"What they experienced was absolutely unacceptable and certainly not what a progressive campaign - or any campaign - should be about,\" Mr Sanders said on January  on Capitol Hill.\"Every woman in this country who goes to work today or tomorrow has the right to make sure that she is working in an environment which is free of harassment, which is safe and is comfortable, and I will do my best to make that

Connelly has worked in traffic control since  so theres not much he hasnt seen. The Beast from the East brought the worst weather conditions hes encountered during his many years of service. The team is both proactive and reactive in its mission to keep Scotland’s roads moving – planning for issues it can see coming and responding quickly to those that it can’t.Partnerships play an essential role in the day-to-day operations here.For example, we’re sitting in the resilience room where Transport Scotland, the Scottish Government agency which oversees our transport industry, meets during major crises, such as the Beast from the East.It is here, too, where action plans are drawn up to cope with major events on the annual calendar or roadworks on vital routes.A Police Scotland officer is based in the centre at peak times, along with Traffic Scotland’s media officers who Tweet updates throughout the day and INRIX, a radio team which transmits travel updates, both on the website and to most of our radio stations.From September to April, a MET office employee is also based in the centre.But Traffic Scotland has many more partners behind the scenes too.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fetoday webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"It looks likely that the council will raise the areas Council Tax rates by three per cent\"  Counterfeit cash alert after incidents reported in Fe viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FFPL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FFPL | Article Teaser\"Stein explained: “We work closely with event organisers to ensure people get to the Open or Royal Highland Show with as little disruption as possible, particularly when two major events are on at the same time.“We also work with the road operating companies, Freight Haulage Association and public transport providers, such as Abellio Scotrail. We co-ordinate road and rail works to minimise the impact for commuters and the Scottish economy.”With all of the country’s roadside SOS calls also being answered at the centre, there are few down times.It’s a round-the-clock job and often a tough one, with operators witnessing incidents that take a toll.Even Stein, despite his many years in the job, isn’t immune.He explained: “Operators can take a call from someone saying they’re going to jump off the Erskine Bridge, pan the camera round and see them jumping. That can really stay with someone.“One that sticks in my mind was an accident at Charing Cross in Glasgow.“The car was a mess and as we panned the camera round we saw a child’s car seat, empty, on the road.“The room fell quiet but nothing was said. Later on, the police told us there were no fatalities and no children had been hurt – the sense of relief here was amazing.”Staff have access to counselling, should they need it as a result of anything they’ve witnessed.But you get the sense of a camaraderie among the team too which undoubtedly helps get them through the tough days.Last February and March, the Beast from the East proved a real challenge – some operators didn’t make it home for days, while others couldn’t make it in.Stein was at the helm through it all, steering the ship through the worst road conditions witnessed in Scotland in a generation.He said: “It was pretty bad in  but the Beast from the East is the worst weather I’ve ever experienced.“Usually, we can marshall maintenance teams and gritters from one part of the country to help in other areas hit by severe weather. That just wasn’t possible. “I was camped out here for five days, as was Humza Yousaf, the then transport minister. The operators couldn’t get home either so they just got on with the job, like they always do.“It was the first red weather warning in Scotland – everyone learned from it.”A Hilltip Icestriker from Finland is now being trialled on the M to ensure recovery teams can access incidents and an electric powered spreader has been deployed on the M.As for daily operations, the public also has an important role to play.“We have just over  CCTV cameras on km of roads,” said Stein. “It’s not a lot to cover such a large area.“So the public are often our eyes and ears, alerting us to breakdowns so we can send out a recovery team.“We get a lot of thank you letters as a result.”Those worried about big brother watching need not fear either.Stein added: “We don’t record number plates or incidents, unless the police ask us to.“So while we get a lot of requests, we can’t help solicitors looking for accident recordings – we don’t have them.”Crossing over the Forth is now far more reliableTraffic Scotland’s National Control Centre was opened on April , , by then depute first minister Nicola Sturgeon. Also used as a contact and education centre for pupils to find out more about the £. billion Queensferry Crossing, thousands of children visited to get a bird’s eye view as the project unfolded. At . miles , it is the longest bridge of its type in the world and also the tallest, towering mhigh. But has it eased congestion for those travelling along the east coast artery between Fe and Edinburgh According to Traffic Scotland statistics, the crossing is very much doing the job it was intended for.Since September , there have been  occasions when the Forth Road Bridge would have been closed to high-sided vehicles due to high winds.Wind shielding on the new crossing enabled it to remain open, affording far more reliability for commuters and hauliers who regularly use it.The hard shoulder on the new bridge also means there are no longer lane closuresvehicles breakdown along its span.Stein said: “The crossing’s improved reliability is delivering benefits not only for commuters but for businesses and the wider Scottish economy too.”"},{"url":null,"title":"crossing borders with your dog after brexit","story":"A.

By working with the community, it will help to understand what transport services are needed, and what steps can then be taken to improve existing routes around the town. “The project also hopes to engage the villages around Inverurie.“By using focus groups and asking the local community about their ideas, it will help to shape rural transport to the benefit of those living in the area.”The project also has support from Colin Clark, Scottish Conservative MP for Gordon: “I would urge local residents and businesses in the Inverurie area to take part in this project and make their views known.“Many people depend upon public transport in rural areas – to get to work, to socialise or to keep appointments at local GP and dental surgeries.“We are fortunate in Inverurie to have a train station connecting the town with Aberdeen and Inverness and there has recently been major investment in the line. “However, in more remote parts of Aberdeenshire, public transport is less reliable and frequent.

He said some areas of the town, such as Shore Street and Upper Ormlie, had been designated as one-way streets some time ago but this had not been implemented. \"That needs to be corrected,\" he said at Tuesday nights meeting.Mr Potts and other community councillors felt something had to be done to address the issue of speeding and one suggestion was for more sleeping policemen to be installed in problem areas of Thurso.Councillor Rosie, who represents Thurso and Northwest Caithness on Highland Council, said what is needed is a transport review which can take a comprehensive look at the issue. \"We need a strategic look at the whole thing ndash something which covers transport management and pedestrians,\" he said.However, community councillor and former police officer Bert MacLeod urged caution. He said: \"You need to be careful you dont go overboard with this  mph limit. Modern cars can stop quicker than vehicles did in the past. We need to be sensible.\"Mr Potts claimed \"some of the driving in Thurso is abysmal\".Mr MacLeod replied: \"Why should you and I be affected because someone drives like an idiot \"He also pointed out there are problems with installing sleeping policemen on roads. New laws have been introduced as cars have been damaged by them, he said.\"It is not just a case of putting them down,\" stated Mr MacLeod.

We have been calling for more parking enforcement in Wick for a while now.\"High Street and Bridge Street are far too regularly packed with cars parked where they shouldnt be. Its an issue that has been raised time and time again by both drivers and pedestrians. Some people think they are above the rules and for too long theyve got away with it.\"He added: \"Under the current proposals Bridge Street and much of High Street will essentially become double yellows, meaning no parking at any time. This should also help stop the constant issue of people selfishly parking in areas like the Market Square.\"The parking bays there are intended only for those who are disabled badge holders but these rules are often ignored by people who just canrsquot be bothered walking.\"Councillor Sinclair said the order would give council officers the power to enforce parking restrictions once they receive the required training but, initially, existing enforcement staff would carry out the work.\"We should expect a much more regular presence than under the old system,\" he said. \"The discussions Irsquove had with the officer responsible for parking have been extremely encouraging.\"Having an enforcement officer in the town for regular and random visits is a great start butthe situation doesnrsquot improve we will still be pushing to get someone in this post locally to clamp down on rogue drivers.\"He explained that in Inverness several council employees have been trained to undertake parking enforcement duties as well as their day-to-day jobs. \"There is no reason why the same couldnrsquot be done up here. If these orders get the go-ahead, and I am confident they will, then I hope we will begin to see a dference in peoples behaviour.\"The Caithness civic leader, Councillor Willie Mackay, also backed the plan. \"It is a fantastic idea but it is the enforcement that is the key to the success of this,\" he said. \"If we can get enough staff trained up to act as traffic wardens ndash and I am pretty sure we can ndash then their presence will deter bad parking.\"Parking in the centre of Wick has been a contentious problem for some time and has often been raised by the local community council and others.

This was despite the fact that the name and address of the person they needed to contact — his mother Edna — was engraved on the memorial.#Vandals couldn#t have done a better job,# he said.Following this wave of public concern, OIC convener Harvey Johnston and chief executive Alistair Buchan have now released a statement apologising for the concern and upset that this project has caused.#Following a tragic accident involving a young child at a Glasgow cemetery, the Scottish Government asked councils to carry out detailed inspections in the interests of public safety,# they said.#We therefore engaged in the kirkyard safety programme for all the right reasons, but recognise that the process we have followed needs to be improved. It was never envisaged that the resulting work would leave kirkyards in the condition they are in. We are sorry about the concern and upset this has led to.#As a caring organisation, responsive to public concern, we will restore kirkyards to the condition people would expect. We will also consider how best to contact and discuss the remedial work required with those concerned. People’s safety is an important concern for us and we will continue to carry out headstone inspections.

Known today as Rae Strait, it was the missing link in what would become the first navigable Northwest Passage.He also reported back on the ill-fated Franklin expedition, reported evidence of cannibalism — findings which were effectively rejected by the then establishment, and which led to Rae#s achievements being almost completely ignored.The modern-day team, who hope to raise further awareness of these achievements, will be led by Scottish-born and Canada-based expedition leader David Reid, with Scotland also represented by Broxburn-based former Royal Marine Richard Smith.The team will also include two Canadians — adventure film-maker Gerry Tutte and adventurer Frank Wolf.Over  years later and supported with modern-day kit from outdoor specialists Tiso, the explorers are hard at work preparing for the physical and mental challenge of hauling kg sledges for nine hours daily and for up to  consecutive days.Their route will cover undulating, windswept tundra, river valleys and sea ice during what can be the coldest time of year.The Arctic expedition will finish once the four explorers have finally reached Gjoa Haven on King William Island.Mr Smith said: #The Arctic Return expedition will be extremely tough but ultimately our aim is to raise awareness fo the exploits of John Rae and to help restore his rightful place as one of the greatest Scottish explorers in history. It is also our hope that this awareness will inspire the public to support fundraising efforts by the John Rae Society, to restore Rae#s birthplace at the Hall of Clestrain in Oprhir.The team have said any addition funds raised are to be used to produce a documentary film and book about the le and exploits of Rae, the expedition and the history communities, culture and wildle of the Arctic.The public will be able to track the team#s progress at their official website and through social media.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

These include:* A possible community buyout of the Black Isle Leisure Centre run by High Le Highland for Highland Council.* Appointing a business consultant to update the  business plan and probe funding applications.* Appoint a design team by competitive tender to revise the building plans and invite tenders.It was noted that the Black Isle remains a growing area with future housing and an expanding population.While a lottery bid for pound million towards the estimated poundm cost of the scheme failed back in , negotiations with the Scottish Land Fund via Highlands and Islands Enterprise to consider developing the project as a community enterprise company have continued.Mr Sinclair said: \"A unanimous positive attitude was evident at the meeting which allows further progress to be made to develop this very important project for the benefit of folk on the Black Isle and beyond.\"A follow-up meeting is planned later this month.Whats your view  Email newsdesk@spp-groupTuesday  Feb  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Not just in the services they provide, but, as one of the biggest employers in Highland, council jobs are fundamental to the sustainability of many communities. So a budget for jobs is really good news for people.ldquoA key element of the feedback we received is that we have many cumbersome, complicated and bureaucratic processes.

Basically, we need to get a grip on our expenditure. As a result we have been examining every budget line and turning over every stone, to make sure that we are getting the best results from the resources being used and challenging where performance can be improved.ldquoIf you always do the same things in the same way, you will get the same results. It is time to change how we do things and so this is a budget for change.\"The change fund is an exciting element of our budget strategy and will underpin our programme of change over the coming year.Council leader Margaret Davidson said: ldquoThis is a decent, thoughtful and ambitious budget which will help move us into the future, protecting jobs and services.\"It aims to set the council on a journey of much needed change. We are all ambitious for improvement and what has struck me is the huge buy-in from all staff in challenging circumstances.ldquoThis budget will enable us to be sustainable and I am really confident that we have the necessary knowledge and expertise in our top team to take forward the change programme that is required.Chief executive Donna Manson added: ldquoThis budget process has been about us being connected. Connected to our communities, to our staff, to our partners, to each other ndash building relationships and enabling better conversations and improved understanding.ldquoI really appreciate the input from staff across the organisation during the whole engagement process, and for some really honest feedback. I am equally delighted with the really positive engagement across the political groups.ldquoWe need to manage all our resources, to redesign, to become more resilient, to be more efficient, to invest in our workforce and to plan for the future. We need to embed effective performance management and effective scrutiny.ldquoThe Corporate Plan will be coming to council in March and this will focus on scrutiny and driving performance.

It was a beautul thing and I cherished it for years. But I remember one of the strange things about that Christmas was going back to school.It must have been primary  or , and we had a group discussion in class about what Santa had brought us all.At the time, I wondered why so many of my classmates had asked for what I innocently termed “boring” things, like a new coat.Years later however, when Christmas began to bite into my own budget, I realised that my child’s vision of the world had not seen the real signicance of the gts.I do not come from a particularly well-off background.For the first decade and a half of my le we lived in a house rented from the housing association.We didn’t have a lot but I had both a new coat and a bike that year.I’m not sure but I think that memory had a lot to do with my recent determination to be my party’s spokesperson on the Department of Work and Pensions .Oh some witty person – probably one of my sisters – will say it’s more to do with me getting closer to my pension.But as any WASPI woman will tell you, that’s not as close as it used to be, which is an argument for another day.No. Every week constituents come to me who have been given what can best be termed as “the run around” by some section of the DWP.: Amber Rudd: Families on universal credit did have to use food banksIt could be pensions, it could be Universal Credit or it could be the system of Personal Independence Payments for those with a disability which, as assessment systems go, is not fit for purpose.In every one of them, I see someone who deserves to be treated better.In each case I’m reminded that in this, the fth richest nation on earth, there are still people for whom le is a daily economic challenge.And what we often overlook is that the majority of those who find themselves facing an uphill financial struggle are already working for a living – the ‘just about managing’ to whom Theresa May promised so much in her first speech as Prime Minister.In a meeting this week with the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, I was stunned to hear that of the already unacceptable number of children living in poverty in this country, two-thirds are from working households.How are we getting it so wrong in this country I have written in this newspaper before about my frustrations at the problem in our country’s welfare system, of which we were once so proud.I have criticised the management of the changes in state pension age for women.And I have railed at the issues with the well-intentioned but fatally underfunded Universal Credit.Only this week the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Amber Rudd, admitted that its failings have been responsible for sending so many people to food banks.But the crux of my gripe is that I realise that we have slipped very far from the fair society, backed by a strong economy, we aim to be.: Rudd urged to ditch DWP policies after damning UN reportOne half of that, the former, we have managed to achieve. The other still seems to be tantalisingly out of our reach. And it needn’t be.I am not in Government. ButI were, the first thing I would do in my new post would be to act on that recognition which Amber Rudd is the first in the Cabinet to publicly acknowledge.I would put back the £ billion which George Osborne took out of the budget for Universal Credit.Then I would pause the roll-out and migration from legacy benefits and fix the obvious problems that are leaving families with nothing to live on for more than a month, causing people to fall into rent arrears and adding stress to an already intolerable burden.After that, I would address the issues which still allow situations where the benefits of getting a job are undermined.But, more than anything , I would want to do something about those children in poverty.I thought about them this week and I thought about that Christmas when I was no more than eight or nine years old.At that time, le was simple for me.I had a big loving family and any financial challenges my parents might have faced were well hidden from us.For my younger sisters, it was slightly dferent.When my dad died at the age of , we went overnight from being relatively well off and living in a home we owned to a single-parent family with no income. My mum went back out to work and somehow managed to give my sisters everything I had known.But, at the age of , I realised how easy it is to fall through the cracks.Then, like now, I thought about those kids in my class that Christmas.Most of them had at least as much potential as I did, but not all of them got to fulfill it.Today that thought as much as,not more than, any political principle I have is what drives my daily le. I have been lucky. I have been able to give my daughter the start in le my parents were able to give me.Maybe because of that I want every child to have the opportunity to fulfill their potential, and feel it’s up to those of us who have to make sure it happens.No family should have to choose between Christmas presents and keeping warm.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

We would like to thank everybody for the great support locally.”The house was originally built in  for Eilidh#s great grandfather Samuel Campbell, and for many years it operated as a temperance hotel.Fire ravaged the building in the s and, although part of the domestic side was occupied up until around  years ago, it has since lain dormant.Councillors on the review body said the couple deserved sympathy and support in their vision to restore a building which had been in Mrs Mcniven#s family for four generations.The couple#s supporting statement before planners said: “It is important to remember that this is a property that has been in the same family for  years and is about to become a new home for a young local family. The historic value of the property is not lost on them. However without intervention it may very well be lost entirely.”Dingwall councillor Margaret Paterson said she thought it “sad” that obstacles had been placed in the way of a couple who proposed to put so much into a building that was “almost falling down”.Lochalsh councillor Biz Campbell and Raymond Bremner, who represents Wick and East Caithness, also spoke in support of the couple#s plans.Councillor Bremner said he believed the aluminium window frames, as proposed for the development, had changed considerably from previous types which did not stand up well to spray from seawater.He added: “I have a lot of sympathy with the applicants and with the points made in their appeal. I don#t have an issue with the change of use.”Broadford and Strath Community Council had lobbied in support of the couple, while neighbours and local businesses also backed the proposed conversion.Community council chairman Hamish Fraser said: “They are proposing to restore a building that will become an asset to the community. It#s a common-sense decision to support a young couple who want to live and make a business here.”Planning officials had turned down the original application on the grounds that it had breached three policies of the Highland-wide local development plan.In their reason for refusal planners said modern windows and a door with patterns “is not in keeping with the character of a historic building”.In his letter of support of the couple, local historian and broadcaster Professor Norman Macdonald said: “In many years of regularly attending Highland Council planning committee meetings at all levels I do not recall a single application where a big and ambitious idea has come to the brink of jeopardy over such relatively immaterial and tangential matters.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/WINTER-19-TRACTOR-1.jpg","title":"the waterboys set to kick off skye live festival","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLegendary Scottish-Irish folk-rock band The Waterboys are to kick-off the Skye Live festival’s fth-anniversary celebrations this autumn.The opening concert in Portree on Thursday th September will see the bandto Skye for the first time in nearly  years.

It is a safe bet that there are only three: Robert Somerville, John Keenan, and Bob Fulton.Back in March , when they were union shop stewards at the town#s Rolls Royce plant, the three men # and thousands of their co-workers # were responsible for virtually grounding the air force of Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet, who had seized power just a few months before in a savage CIA-backed coup. The documentary #Nae Pasaran#, screened in Portree last weekend, tells the story of how these principled trade unionists came to be awarded the highest honour the Republic of Chile can bestow upon foreigners.With much of the world appalled by the overthrow, in September , of the democratically-elected socialist Government of Salvador Allende, it fell to Bob Fulton # a burly, no-nonsense Christian with wartime experience of fighting fascist dictators # to set the ball rolling in East Kilbride. Arriving for work on the morning of th March  he uncovered a chilling truth about the eight Rolls Royce jet engines that had just been delivered to the plant for servicing: the engines came from the British Hawker Hunter jets used by Pinochet loyalists to bomb, amongst other targets, the presidential palace in Santiago where Allende died on the day the coup began.Now in his mid-s, Bob immediately #blacked# the engines that is, he declared them subject to an industrial dispute. As such, they could not be touched by any worker # or anyone , for that matter # until the dispute was resolved. His colleagues soon followed suit, much to the consternation of management and the UK Government. And so the engines sat, untouched, out in the open air for the next four years, until they became useless lumps of rusting metal. Moreover, the East Kilbride plant was the only place in the world licensed to service the engines. So, aside from the eight now-engineless jets, the rest of Pinochet#s air force could not be kept airworthy while workers thousands of miles away stuck to the principles of international solidarity. How many lives this saved on the ground is a moot point.#Nae Pasaran# is a paean to what can be achieved by collective action, and to what might be described as the golden age of trade unionism. But the documentary # written and directed by Felipe Bustos Sierra, son of an exiled Chilean journalist # also works as an emotionally-charged voyage of discovery.For over  years, Bob, John and Robert, and other former plant workers doubted whether or not their actions had any lasting effect on the lives of persecuted Chileans, many of whom were trade unionists like themselves. #Nae Pasaran# works in a dramatic sense because we watch as this gap in their knowledge is filled. The Scottish refuseniks did make an impact. Their stand mattered.What makes #Nae Pasaran# so moving is that the surviving union men, interviewed atby Sierra in his adopted homeland, are shown interviews he conducted back in Chile with survivors of Pinochet#s brutality. Now old men themselves, the victims recalled how they took solace in smuggled radios tuned to Radio Moscow, which broadcast regular updates on the Scottish union#s boycott. The action # or rather inaction # of the Rolls Royce workers gave many Chileans hope that they would not be forgotten or abandoned by the outside world. It may even have contributed directly to the saving of seven lives.Among the hundreds of Chilean exiles arriving in the UK were seven rumoured to have escaped execution or imprisonment because the air force acquired spare parts from Israel, South Africa, and India. So desperate were the Chilean authorities for this materiel they may have swapped the seven detainees for what they needed. Sierra never proves this conclusively, however, because the UK Home Office refused to release certain files relating to the boycott.And what of the jet engines, left to rust in East Kilbride  They were whisked away early one morning in . To this day no one knows who took them, but the Rolls Royce workers were told they were back in service with the Chilean air force. A year later Margaret Thatcher came to power and relations with the Pinochet regime were quickly normalised. Arms exports resumed in earnest.But the #blacked# engines were never used again. One of them, which Sierra discovered in a derelict yard outside Santiago, was shipped back to Scotland in , the year before #Nae Pasaran# hit the cinemas. It is due to be installed, as a lasting monument to the boycott, in a college campus in East Kilbride in the very near future.#Nae Pasaran# celebrates people power. After the screening, the topic was the subject of a short talk by Councillor Chris McEleny, leader of the SNP Group on Inverclyde Council, who also answered questions from the audience on British involvement in the destruction of Yemen, the desire by Tory Brexiteers to deregulate and deunionise even further, and the situation in Venezuela. Indeed, Mr McEleny drew an #obvious parallel# with Venezuela, where the democratically-elected socialist Government of another resource-rich South American country is being targeted for regime change.He said: #In Chile, before the coup, US corporations had huge commercial interests in copper mining and they sought to undermine and destabilise the Allende Government, and this is pretty much what we are seeing in Venezuela right now. Poverty in Venezuela has been engineered by the US, just as it was in Chile. We are seeing the same media pattern, a capitalist conditioning programmeyou like, drip-feeding propaganda to make intervention look like the right thing to do. We are seeing that right now with Venezuela so we need to see the same solidarity that Bob Fulton and others showed in the s.#Sadly, as Bob and his comrades lamented, in an era of weakened trade unions such a workplace boycott could probably not take place now.

James is  years old and is a professional cookery apprentice at the Galgorm Resort  Spa Hotel and Northern Regional College. James was studying for his A-Levels in Nutrition and Food Science, Le and Health Sciences and Applied ITC at Cambridge House Grammar School when he had the opportunity to take up work experience in Antrim’s Ramble Inn. For James – who had always dreamed of being a chef – his time in the Inn’s kitchens led to the realisation that his passion could be his full-time career. When he found out about the apprenticeships with Northern Regional College and the Galgorm Resort  Spa, he jumped at the chance. He said: “I love the creativity that comes with being a chef, you get to make people happy with your food.“So when I was given the chance to learn more and get hands-on experience in the kitchens of one of the biggest players in Northern Ireland’s hospitality sector I just couldn’t pass up that opportunity. It was a no-brainer for me!”James decided to leave school after his AS-Levels and hasn’t looked back since: “I really enjoyed school and I had thought that afterwards I would maybe go on to catering college. However, this apprenticeship is a chance to get experience in the industry and offers me an immediate route into the career I love – why would I put that off for another year ” What does a typical day at the work look like for James  At the moment, he has an enviable position looking after the restaurant’s delectable range of desserts. This means weighing out and prepping ingredients, plating up panna cotta, sticky toffee pudding and cheesecake and making sure the Galgorm’s fridges never run low of sweet treats. If you’re lucky enough to be on campus on a Wednesday, you might even get to sample some of James’ cooking. He and his colleagues spend their morning whipping up meals and being assessed on their abilities. Their top-class cooking is served up to hungry staff and students in the canteen. The afternoon is spent familiarising themselves with the extensive health and safety rules which every chef must know. When asked why he chose the apprenticeship route James says that for him it was the obvious choice: “With the apprenticeship you get to earn while you learn, and you have no student loans to worry about paying back at the end.”But most importantly, it’s the hands-on experience he has received throughout his training which James claims is most valuable.“You can read in a text-book that a professional kitchen is a high-pressure environment, but unless you’ve been in there at peak dinner-serving time, you can’t truly understand it.” James says he would “most definitely” recommend the apprenticeship scheme to someone : “If you want to go into the hospitality sector, I honestly think it’s the smartest career move you can make.” And his advice to them  “Just go for it! You have nothing to lose and so much to gain!”  "},{"url":null,"title":"spreading the message of hope","story":"The members of Loughbrickland Women#s Institute hosted Jo-Anne Dobson, Kidney Care UK Northern Ireland Ambassador as guest speaker at their President#s Night at the Belmont Hotel, Banbridge.

When we go back and look at the stats, those are the things we will be saying.#It was a slow start to this game with both teams hitting early wides, but the pattern was soon established with James McNaughton and Alan Devine trading frees before Aonghus Clarke fired over from range.Three McNaughton frees gave Antrim the edge as he then traded points with Devine before Nigel Elliott finally shot Antrim#s first from play on  minutes to make it - to -, but this was to be their final score of the opening half.Westmeath drew level thanks to a Devine free and a magnicent sideline cut from Derek McNicholas before Devine gave them the lead.It was to get even better for the visitors on  minutes as Devine got a touch to Robbie Greville#s long delivery to find the net, while McNicholas and Devine added points to make it - to - at the break.With the swirling wind at their backs in the second period, Antrim needed a bright start and they got it with McNaughton clipping over a free and then Nigel Elliott sent Keelan Molloy in to flick to the net.McNaughton and Kevin Rice added points but, crucially, Antrim could never get ahead.The visitors rallied with the next three points and this was a lead they were to hold for the majority of the second period as the teams effectively went score-for-score.Antrim did get to within one with Conor McCann – who had what looked like a good shout for a penalty waved away when hauled back by Tommy Doyle late on – and McNaughton hitting scores. But McNicholas – who earlier clipped over another sideline – landed a monster free.McNaughton had a free that was finally given as a wide deep into added time when it appeared over, but the goal Antrim needed wouldn#t come as Westmeath held on for a crucial win.ANTRIM: R Elliott S Rooney, J Dillon, P Duffin M Donnelly, S McCrory, C McHugh C McCann , N McKeague N Elliott , J McNaughton , K RiceE O#Neill, K Molloy , C Clarke.

After giving the matter some thought, Squinter has been unable to separate two candidates, and so the prize is jointly awarded. First co-winner is Andrea Leadsom, Tory Leader of the House, for her reaction to Donald Tusk’s statement that there’s “a special place in hell” for those who promoted Brexit “without a sketch of a plan”.Andrea’s response was rather more temperate than that of Sammy Wilson, who opined that Mr Tusk was a “devilish, trident wielding, euro maniac”. She remarked, with what would appear at first blush to be commendable restraint: “The man has no manners.”But on hearing Andrea’s mention of the word “manners”, a little bell went off somewhere deep in Squinter’s hippocampus and after a short period of beard-scratching and pencils-sucking, it came to Squinter why the Honourable Member is on rather thin ice when it comes to matters of polite conduct.Come back in time with Squinter to the summer of , just two weeks before Britain voted to leave the EU. Andrea was locked in a battle with Theresa May for leadership of the Conservative Party. In an interview with The Times, when asked why the party should opt for her, she replied that her rival “possibly has nieces, nephews, lots of people. But I have children who are going to have children who will directly be part of what happens next.”So there we have it. Andrea pitched for the top job by saying having children gives her more of a stake in the country. At which point, we should remind ourselves that Theresa May has spoken honestly and movingly about the fact that she and her husband Philip were unable to have children.Manners  Yih pays yer money…Joint winner is British Transport Secretary Chris Grayling who announced on Friday that he was cancelling the £ million contract he had awarded to Seaborne Freight just before Christmas to provide a ferry service from Ramsgate to Ostend to ease the pressure on the port of Dover should the UK crash out with no deal.Mr Grayling’s tenure has been one of the great comedy shows of British politics and it’s widely believed that he remains in office only to direct fire away from more senior colleagues. Not that he could have seen this mess developing. After all, Seaborne Freight was a highly respected company with a long history of professional and responsible conduct in the business of ferries and freight, right  Well, since the company only hit the news in December you probably don’t need Squinter to remind you that Seaborne Freight:• Was a completely new company• Didn’t own a ship• Cut and pasted its website terms and conditions from a pizza delivery firmand an online boutiqueThe high-flying cabinet minister sent out to back Grayling when the contract was scrubbed was Communities Secretary James Brokenshire. You know, the bloke was Secretary of State here for a while and nobody noticed.Chris’ll be gone by the end of the week, then.Fail to prepare#LET’S be honest, Jim Wells isn’t flavour of the month within the DUP. The South Down MLA had the party whip withdrawn last spring after he fell out with the top brass over his claim that they had reneged on a promise to reinstate him as Health Minister after he stepped down in  over an election hustings row.Jimbo claimed then party leader party leader Peter Robinson promised to reinstate him when andthe furious furoreblew over . He further alleged that when Arlene Foster took over as leader she ignored two written requests from him to honour Peter’s pledge. These days Jimbo’s something of a voice in the wilderness, technically still a DUP MLA but shorn of any authority to speak for the party. Which makes him of considerable interest to journalists, since the resentment he clearly still feels makes him a little bit more willing to open up about things than other DUP reps.Jim’s been at it again this week and, given the state we’re in at the moment, you’ll probably not be surprised to hear that it’s Brexit-related. Jim revealed that at the extraordinary meeting at which the party decided to back Leave in the months leading up to the EU referendum in , there was zero discussion of what a Leave vote would mean for the local economy. This would be an awkward revelation for most parties, but after the tsunami of controversies that the DUP has been through in the past couple of years, it seems to have reached the point that its brand is so polluted the tin can’t get any more dented, the label any dirtier. But that’s not the disaster that it would certainly be for any other party because the DUP’s substantial vote clearly consists of people who don’t care what they get up to as long as they’re not Sinn Féin.Lack of planning – it’ll do for ye every time. Fail to prepare, prepare to fail, that’s the old saying and nowhere does it ring more true than in the crazy world of Brexit. Let’s take a look at a few of the most notorious failures of a lack of foresight and seewe can work out where the DUP Brexit calamity fits in…Betamax’Member when video cassettes were the most exciting innovation in the history of technology  You don’t  Well, you must be under , so let’s seewe can explain. Two Japanese giants of the global electronics industry were caught up in the race to win control of the massive new market. JVC produced the eventually successful VHS format, while Sony produced the toploading Betamax system. Although the Betamax system was of a superior picture quality, it was considerably more expensive and had a shorter recording time. At a meeting in , Sony were advised by Matsushita engineers to switch to the VHS format, but declined. It wa a historic mistake, dealing the company a crippling financial blow from which it would take years to recover.Ford EdselFord were inordinately pleased with the Edsel, a new model released in the United States in , the year after the Ford family relinquished control of the company. The Edselwas designed to give Ford the upper-hand in the highly competitive premium intermediate market . The company missed the design boat, though, as the car harked back to an earlier age at a time when families were increasingly turning to compact vehicles. The Edsel was discontinued two years later, with sales signicantly less than half the break-even sales figure. Executives took their eye off the ball and didn’t realise the Edsel was flopping until over .bnhad been spent on design, manufacture and new dealerships. To this day, new models that fail are still referred to in the US automobile market as ‘Edsels’.New CokeIn the mid-s, as other soft drinks were increasingly threatening the dominance of Coca-Cola, the company decided it was going to ditch the original Coke formula and go with an improved ‘New Coke’.The  launch was a disaster and sales were badly hit, particularly in the southern states where Coca-Cola was considered an integral part of American culture. Tens of thousands of complaints flooded into company HQ weekly. The problem was not so much with the taste – the company had disastrously underestimated the hold that the Coca-Cola brand had on the American psyche. Smelling blood, rivals Pepsi began a new ad campaign with the strapline ‘Now I Know Why Coke Did It’ . Fans started booing ads for New Coke at large sports events. Just  days after New Coke was launched, the company announced that it was bringing back the old formula.Has to be a Brexit message in there somewhere, no "},{"url":null,"title":"belfast schools funding review after exam results excluded from statistics","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Photograph: ©Fran Veale NO REPRO FEE“A dog is a big commitment, soyou are still thinking of getting a dog in the New Year we would ask the public to do careful research on where you are sourcing your dog from, research the breed of dog to suit your lestyle and try to anticipate any major lestyle changes such as an upcoming move, a new baby, and consider how a dog may impact this before bringing one into your home.”Last week a litter of three puppies were dumped in a box with their mother and left for dead before being rescued by the animal welfare charity.The eight-week old puppies – Tayana, Tefi and Timoti – were left for dead in freezing temperatures with their mum Tati before the Dogs Trust rescued them.Tati has a deformity in both her front legs causing them to buckle outwards, which the charity said can be very painful, especially in later le.Her malformation is also suspected to be genetic, in which case it is very possible that her pups could also develop the chronic condition.Tati and her three puppies will be looking for homes over the next few weeks.To highlight how important it is to choose a dog based on their personalities, rather than the way they look, we have removed all photographs of the dogs in our Rehoming Centre today from our website #NotJustAPrettyFace #ValentinesDay— Dogs Trust IrelandFebruary , Head of operations Karla Dunne said: “It’s so incredibly heart-breaking to see these beautul creatures being discarded in this way with little thought for their safety or well-being.“We’re just grateful that they were found and brought to us so that we can care for them here until they find loving homes.“Thankfully all four of them are now thriving here and mum Tati can get the veterinary treatment she needs, but sadly many other puppies are not as fortunate and this could have been a completely dferent story had they not been found so quickly.”The Dogs Trust operates at full capacity and offers as many places as possible to dogs from Irish pounds, as they are the ones most at risk of destruction, so the charity is not in a position to take surrendered dogs from members of the public.However, in the majority of the cases so far this year, the welfare of the dogs found abandoned or surrendered was of such concern, that the dogs were admitted for immediate veterinary attention.The charity said this has impacted upon the number of dogs it can rescue from the local authority pounds."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37812018.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/kill.jpg","title":"ulster woman set alight by candle during mass saved by gaa star","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

That is far dferent from , when he was Mrs Clinton’s lone progressive adversary.But there is no question that Mr Sanders will be a formidable contender for the Democratic nomination. He won more than  million votes in  and dozens of primaries and caucuses, and opens his campaign with a nationwide organisation and a proven small-dollar fundraising effort.“We’re gonna win,” Mr Sanders told CBS.He said he was going to launch “what I think is unprecedented in modern American history”: a grassroots movement “to lay the groundwork for transforming the economic and political le of this country”.And he could be well positioned to compete in the nation’s first primary in neighbouring New Hampshire, which he won by  points in . But he will not have the state to himself.Calornia senator Kamala Harris, another Democratic presidential contender, was in New Hampshire on Monday and said she would compete for the state. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Kamala Harris is also a Democratic presidential contender She also appeared to take a dig at Mr Sanders.“The people of New Hampshire will tell me what’s required to compete in New Hampshire,” she told shoppers at a bookshop in Concord. “But I will tell you I’m not a democratic socialist.”Senator Elizabeth Warren, of nearby Massachusetts, will be in New Hampshire on Friday.One of the biggest questions surrounding Mr Sanders’s candidacy is how he will compete against someone like Ms Warren, who shares many of his policy goals. Ms Warren has already launched her campaign and has planned an aggressive swing through the early primary states.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Elizabeth Warren at an organising event in Las Vegas Shortly after announcing her exploratory committee, Ms Warren hired Brendan Summers, who managed Mr Sanders’s  Iowa campaign. Other staff from Mr Sanders’s first bid have also said they would consider working for other candidates in .The crowded field includes a number of other candidates who are likely to make strong appeals to the Democratic base, including Ms Harris and senators Cory Booker, of New Jersey, Amy Klobuchar, of Minnesota, and Kirsten Gillibrand, of New York. The field could also grow, with a number of high-profile Democrats still considering presidential bids, including former vice president Joe Biden and former Texas representative Beto O’Rourke.While Mr Sanders had been working to lay the groundwork for a second campaign for months, it was unclear whether he will be able to expand his appeal beyond his largely white base of supporters. In , Mr Sanders notably struggled to garner support from black voters, an issue that could become particularly pervasive during a primary race that could include several non-white candidates.Last month, he joined Mr Booker at an event in Columbia, South Carolina, marking the Martin Luther King Jr holiday. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Cory Booker during a campaign stop in Portsmouth, New Hampshire In , Mr Sanders lost the South Carolina primary, which features a heavily black electorate, by  points.Mr Sanders also faces dferent pressures in the #MeToo era. Some of his male staff and supporters in  were described as “Bernie bros” for their treatment of women.In the run-up to Mr Sanders’s  announcement, persistent allegations emerged of sexual harassment of women by male staff during his  campaign. Politico and The New York Times reported several allegations of unwanted sexual advances and pay inequity.In an interview with CNN after the initial allegations surfaced, Mr Sanders apologised but also noted he was “a little busy running around the country trying to make the case”.As additional allegations emerged, he offered a more unequivocal apology.“What they experienced was absolutely unacceptable and certainly not what a progressive campaign – or any campaign – should be about,” Mr Sanders said on January  on Capitol Hill. “Every woman in this country who goes to work today or tomorrow has the right to make sure that she is working in an environment which is free of harassment, which is safe and is comfortable, and I will do my best to make that happen.”"},{"url":null,"title":"derry college wins place semi final bbc northern ireland school choir year","story":"Thornhill College in Derry has won a place in the semi-finals of the BBC Northern Ireland School Choir Of The Year, which will take place at Regent House Grammar School, Newtownards.Over the course of nine weeks,  choirs from across Northern Ireland will be singing to impress as they battle it out for a place in the final of the BBC Northern Ireland School Choir Of The Year.

Mrs Mitchell explained that following her sonrsquos death, his owed back pay from the Army would have settled the debt.The soldierrsquos mother also revealed that he had told her about two incidents in Afghanistan which had upset him.In one of them, he had been due to be the soldier at the front of the patrol but was swapped with a colleague at the last minute. The soldier who replaced him subsequently suffered severe leg injuries in an attack.Mrs Mitchell also told the inquest that towards the end of , her son had become hyper vigilant, confided in her less, was jumpy and struggled to sleep.She described how he had successfully applied for his ldquodream job in the Army as an outdoor instructor, explaining this had involved undertaking courses in the UK, Spain and Germany which left him very tired.The soldierrsquos mother also described how her son had felt isolated after a knee injury held him back from joining his unit in Afghanistan, and instead had to serve with a dferent unit.She said that when he ed to Ballykinlar and the new job, he continued to feel isolated as a number of soldiers were taking redundancy at that time.ldquoEverything hit him at that precise moment. He thought everyone was leaving, he was exhausted, his back pay hadnrsquot come through, he had had a row with Cherand he had just got back after being away for a long time.Mrs Mitchell added that she did not blame the army for her sonrsquos death but felt more could have been done to help him.A statement form Rleman Mitchellrsquos friend, Kendall Gibson, also referred to an incident when the  year-old ran away from fireworks.ldquoHe said the fireworks reminded him too much of Afghanistan, stated Mr Gibson, adding that he was also concerned about his friendrsquos drinking.Three soldiers mdash friends of Rleman Mitchell mdash who had discovered his body were sent twice to another barracks in Lisburn for treatment which included counselling.The inquest also heard that it was common place for soldiers to refer to the local army base as ldquoBally-kill-yourself.Driving instructor William Riley, who had been taking Lance Corporal Ross for HGV lessons in the week before his suspected suicide, told the inquest that the soldier was one of many who used the term.Mr Riley told how the Lance Corporal had cut a ldquofrustratedrsquo figure in the week before his death, displayed an attitude problem and had been involved in a verbal altercation with another instructor two days before his death.The inquest continues..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Art","story":"A HIGHLY acclaimed Downpatrick-based charity has secured a signicant financial boost from the Department of Justice.The Le Change, Changes Lives organisation mdash based in Market Street mdash has secured a slice of a near poundm funding cake made available under the government departmentrsquos assets recovery scheme.Over poundm has been distributed to organisations across the province since the schemersquos launch in , with the Downpatrick charity aiming to use its pound, three-year funding package to provide its clients with basic food hygiene training, alongside cooking participation and demonstration skills.The charity helps and supports people suffering with a range of mental health issues and addiction problems, offering professional and confidential counselling, mental health and addiction support and suicide intervention services.It also works to help minimise social isolation, alongside encouraging wellness and recovery and family support.Since its launch, Le Change Changes Lives has provided opportunities for people with a iety of problems to engage in constructive activities, including giving new le to old furniture through the very successful Pop Up Art initiative.The money secured under the assets recovery scheme, which is managed by the Policing and Community Safety Partnership, will finance the charityrsquos No Lost Cause project.Charity officials say the project is designed to provide an ldquointergenerational ersionary and therapeutic community programme which aims to encourage disadvantaged and disengaged people to find their potential and build upon it, using activities, counselling, advocacy, training and support.A logo is being used to publicise the project inspired by the lsquoNot Waving but Drowningrsquo poem by Stevie Smyth which is often told in Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. It gives an account of a drowned man whose distressed thrashing in the water was mistaken for waving.Charity officials say the No Lost Cause initiative is designed to complement the highly successful Pop Up Art project which is funded by the Big Lottery until this October.Over the le of the No Lost Cause project, charity officials will strive to reduce crime through erting people away from substance abuse and associated links to criminal activity.Le Change, Changes Lives officials have confirmed that the new project also aims to reduce reoffending by providing training and skills development activities and counselling to deal with substance and relationship family issues and provide support to improve the self-esteem of participants to help them re-engage with family and communities.They hope that through the basic food hygiene training, cooking participation and demonstration project that it will help parents revive cooking healthy, affordable family meals, to be eaten together at the kitchen table, helping achieve interaction and involvement in young peoplersquos livesAilish Teague, who helped establish the Downpatrick charity with her husband Manus, is delighted with the Department of Justice funding.She said competition to secure the money for the next three years was competitive, with groups in each of the provincersquos  councils eligible to apply.ldquoThe application was made through the Policing and Community Safety Partnership and the asset recovery is a brilliant resource, with money taken from criminals invested back into community projects, said Ailish.ldquoWe can use this money for the programmes we deliver, working closely with people who have a range of addictions.ldquoOur clients are also delighted that we have secured this funding which will enable is to deliver an NVQ Level One in hospitality services from our Market Street base with the food hygiene aspect of the course designed to give people a taste of employment.While delighted to have secured funding under the Department of Justice scheme, charity officials are conscious that their Lottery funding ends this October.Mrs Teague says officials have met with Lottery representatives and has suggested that the chances of having their funding extended are ldquozero to nil.She added: ldquoIt will be dficult to secure more Lottery funding which could leave us with no money to finance our core costs including rent and other overheads.

They were well prepared.ldquoThey had carried out research which helped them to face questions about migration and environmental issues. There was no doubt, they had been given the short straw as the other countries were ready to attack them for their current position in wanting to leave the EU.ldquoHowever, the students put aside their own views and represented the country they were delegated, in this debate.ldquoBeing the UK is what made it so challenging and also so rewarding as they did a fantastic job.Mrs Orsi said: ldquoNot being able to participate in future debates is only one of the educational detriments to leaving the EU.ldquoI think our students are going to be greatly affected on many levels, both in terms of academic opportunities, funding and employment. It is the very people who were not able to vote who will be impacted upon most.Ciara said studying A-Level politics definitely helped the girls flex some political muscle in their challenge.She added: ldquoWe have been discussing Brexit a great deal in class and we felt secure in our knowledge.ldquoHowever, what we did find challenging was trying to find out the positions of other smaller EU countries in terms of their policies on migration and the environment.ldquoI am very interested in politics and as a language student, I feel it is important we are involved in these debates to ensure we continue to develop our understanding of our European neighbours.ldquoWhat is unfortunate is the fact this might be the last time we will be asked to participate as we will no longer be a member state.The debate was organised by the British Council with the aim of developing studentsrsquo intercultural understanding of other countries while learning more about the political workings of the ious states..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch farming family feature on BBC documentary  ","story":"THE trials of farming will be shown through the eyes of a Ballynahinch family as they are featured tonight in the BBC Two series, This Farming Le.Top beef cattle breeder Geoff Rodgers allowed a film crew to capture him and his family work their -acre farm between Ballynahinch and Dromara for most of last year.Geoff inherited the farm when his father died Martin and runs it with his we, Lizzie, who is a special needs classroom assistant at Spa Primary School, with their three children, Emma , Martin , and  year-old Lucy.He admitted that he had turned down previous offers to take part in other farming shows but finally agreed to take part as he was a real fan of the show.The result is a moving insight into what it takes to care for  animals  hours a day and what happens when it all goes wrong.ldquoI think some viewers will be reduced to tears. Well, thatrsquos what happened when all of the farmers featured watched the programme a few weeks ago, said  year-old Geoff.ldquoIt will show that there is a real connection between the family and the animals and itrsquos not all just about sales or winning competitions.Two months before the crew started filming last January, the family were hit with terrible news mdash Bovine TB was discovered in their pedigree herd and  animals had to be slaughtered.A movement restriction then had to put on the herd which meant that no animals could enter or leave the farm until two consecutive TB tests prove negative.The programme catches up with the family on the day a vet calls to carry to do the next test and to determine whether any more of the herd will have to be slaughtered.ldquoIt just happened that the crew came to us in one of the most challenging times for the farm, said Geoff.ldquoAnd while I wonrsquot gave too much away, what happens not only affects me but also my children as they all get involved, especially the youngest Lucy, to help me get the animals ready for the likes of Balmoral Show.ldquoWe not only lost some of the animals but you also lose years of breeding, particularly with some of the animals my father had bred them, which was hard, and then of course, therersquos a knock-on loss of new calves.ldquoIt was particularly hard as I had buyers waiting to buy bulls and cattle of me but we couldnrsquot do anything until we got the all-clear.The tension builds over the next few episodes of the show as the deadline looms to Balmoral Show mdash the highlight of the farming calendar in Northern Ireland and the major sales day for Geoff.Viewers will see that the Rodgers familyrsquos hopes of further success at Balmoral are pinned on bull Mario, who Geoff described ldquoas a real character and his young half-sister, Nadia.This Farming Le starts tonight at pm on BBC ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"British Irish group on High Street conference  ","story":"THE impact of online sales on the High Street was discussed at a recent meeting in Newcastle.Representatives from the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly were in the resort where they were met by South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Mark Murnin.Mr McGrath explained the committee has a dferent area of investigation each year and that in  is focusing on the impact of online sales on the High Street and how governments can deliver initiatives and projects to address the problem.The Assemblyman said with the nature of the traditional High Street changing, many people, especially the young, are shopping online with this trend only going to increase.ldquoWe are seeing and hearing that people want experiences and see their shopping trip as much more than simply shopping, wanting to incorporate food and activities as part of their experience, said Mr McGrath.ldquoHaving clean, welcoming public spaces, areas that can facilitate events and having a erse range of experiential shops and boutiques is critical in making the High Street thrive. In Newcastle, the public realm and promenade schemes, in tandem with the shop front improvement scheme, have helped the resort buck the trend and is reporting increasing footfall.Mr McGrath also highlighted the need to continue to develop experiences people can avail of to maximise footfall and is confident ambitious future proposals including a gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes will be critical to enhancing what Newcastle has to offer.He continued: ldquoIn Downpatrick, the former Irish Street police station and car park have the potential to redevelop the town and breathe new live back into its retail centre.ldquoDeveloping a space here which can enhance and deliver a customer experience and product will be critical to developing new shops and products, but also complement existing businesses too.ldquoRates and the entire rating scheme was a major recurring theme from business organisations and this will form part of a report being compiled by the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly following their visit.Mr McGrath said the inadequacies of the rating system were well known, with the British-Irish body, of which he is a member, keen to find other ways of helping businesses thrive.The MLA added: ldquoTimes are changing and local authorities and central governments must reflect this in the work they do. I look forward to the report our committee will deliver which will reflect on time spent in Newcastle, Belfast, Dublin, Newcastle Upon Tyne and Stockton on Tees.Cllr Murnin said he was delighted that representatives of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly view Newcastle as an example of good practice for their research into revitalising the high street.He continued: ldquoWe have worked very hard to make our district a better place to carry out business and as a place to visit. Regenerating the town centre and promenade in Newcastle has played a signicant role in increasing business and footfall to the town. I am pleased to see our work receive this recognition.During the delegation visit, local authority officials gave presentations on the regeneration of Newcastle and the tourism events strategy for the town.In addition, a representative from the Department for Communities spoke about the Main Street Environmental Improvement Scheme in the resort and the departmentrsquos role in the resortrsquos overall regeneration.At the end of the meeting, delegation members said the examples of successful regeneration they witnessed would prove beneficial to their enquiryrsquos conclusions and eventual recommendations..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan actor adds her opposition to disposal plans  ","story":"SHE may have left the Mourne Mountains to pursue an acting career on stage and screen but the Mournes have not left Niamh McGrady.The Castlewellan-born actress has spoken of her horror at recent media stories which claim the Government is looking to the Mournes as a possible location to store nuclear waste.An area of granite bedrock running from Slieve Gullion in Newry to the Mourne is being considered mdash amongst other locations mdash as suitable for an underground disposal facility, according to a preliminary report by Radioactive Waste Management , a UK State-owned company.Other locations include an area of rock between Omagh and Cookstown, a location between Belfast and Larne, areas around Coleraine, Co Londonderry, and Ballymoney and Ballycastle, in Co Antrim.Niamh, who has starred in Holby City and The Fall, called for all local people to lend their support as Newry, Mourne and Down District Council passed an emergency motion last week unanimously opposing any future facility.ldquoI am absolutely horried to hear about proposals to host nuclear waste in the Mourne area, said Niamh, who now lives in London.ldquoMourne is an area of outstanding natural beauty, which tourists and local people adore the area alike.ldquoWe do not create nuclear energy here, so why should we be treated as a dumping ground  We will all have to pull together to ensure that this travesty absolutely cannot happen.The Mournes are particularly beloved by the actor, who was born and reared on the Bunkers Hill area of Castlewellan.She married her husband, Dan, close to Spelga Dam just last August and regularly walks in the Mournes when she is home.The  year-old also admitted to often feeling ldquoemotional when it came to Mournes as she was interviewed on the lsquoEamonn Mallie: Face to Face withhelliprsquo series for UTV last night.Apart from giving her viewpoint on her support of the   movement, which calls for equal representation of women in all areas of Hollywood by , Niamh also opened up about her own issues with mental health.She told Mallie: ldquoI have experienced anxiety and depression off and on since my teens. Itrsquos something I have always had to be aware of in my own le. I feel very strongly that there are issues in Northern Ireland that arenrsquot being addressed as far as mental health is concerned.A former pupil of St Malachyrsquos Primary School in Castlewellan, Niamhrsquos dficulties compounded after leaving Assumption Grammar School in Ballynahinch. A talented actor, who shone in the schoolrsquos theatre productions, she applied for and got a place at Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama in Cardf.Niamh was fortunate that while not academically minded, she found that drama, theatre studies and English always came ldquonaturally to her in school.The youngest of five siblings, Niamh says that she had always wanted to leave Castlewellan for ldquoan adventure. But she did not realise that her living in Cardf, away from family and friends, would take such a toll on her.ldquoI was just very, very homesick because our experiences in Northern Ireland were so unique and I didnrsquot have anyone that I could explain that to, she said.ldquoI felt emotionally unsupported. I felt very much like fish out of water as I was surrounded by a lot of very wealthy people and I struggled to connect with them. I was longing for the familiarity and the closeness, and the craic of home. My homesickness lasted for many years, it didnrsquot just go away.ldquoEvery time I went home for Easter or Christmas I was in floods of tears going back to the airport but yet I made myself do it, nothing nor nobody  was forcing me to do it.She went gone to appear alongside actors such as Sir Patrick Stewart of Star Trek fame in an acclaimed production Macbeth which played Londonrsquos West End and New Yorkrsquos Broadway, as well as former X-Files star Gillian Anderson and  Shades heart-throb Jamie Dornan in the psychological murder drama The Fall.Niamh is currently working on two film projects and says that as a newly married woman, her professional and personal le is going great.However, she maintains her mental health by practicing yoga and mediation and feels it is important to be upfront about having had issues.She explained: ldquoI donrsquot see a problem talking about mental health because I donrsquot like that itrsquos still taboo. If it helps one person seek help, then thatrsquos great.ldquoPeople could be sitting with mental problems and they donrsquot know it. Because thatrsquos what anxiety and depression do, they sneak on you and it really starts to alter your view of the world without you noticing.ldquoOver time with mediation you can be in control of your mind.

Hutley was given another chance around  minutes and this time took full advantage after Enniskillen had been deemed to be offside on the back of a break from Down scrum half, Chris Gibson.For the remainder of the first half, and indeed for  minutes in the second half, the score remained at - with both teams trading blows, but neither were able to alter their account on the scoreboard.Down did have their chances to take the lead, but lacked the finesse in handling that they had shown against their rivals from Carrick and Omagh in previous rounds.As the game entered the final quarter, Enniskillen managed to extend their lead, scoring a try by barging over from short range following a well won line-out.With Enniskillen now in possession of a  point lead, Down were left with no alternative but to chase the game. Again, they created some opportunities and applied pressure in Enniskillen territory with some great carries from Josh Hanlon, Conor Moag and Joe Charles, but the dogged defence of the locals held out and with it, Down frustration grew which made putting quality attacking play together even harder.In the closing minutes and with the outcome of the fixture already beyond doubt, Enniskillen added a final unconverted try confirming them as the team who would progress to the quarter-finals.The final whistle brought bitter disappointment to the hard-working Down squad who knew they hadnrsquot been at their best on this occasion.The side now enter the Subsidiary Shield competition and they have drawn Royal School Dungannon at home in a quarter-final game to be played on Saturday, February, , at am.Having been finalists in this competition for four consecutive years and winners in , everyone at Down High knows there is plenty left to play for this season..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C February 13%2C 1979  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash A Ballynahinch horse breeder is a very disappointed man this week mdash and all because of the lsquoflu.

His parents and medical team are constantly working to ensure his lungs remain as clear of mucus as they can be.Jen said: ldquoItrsquos hard to believe when you look at him that anything is wrong as he looks so perfect, but inside him the mucus is causing havoc.ldquoDermot and I never expected to becomes nurses as well as parents to our child. We do his treatment willingly but with heavy hearts.ldquoIf the drugs didnrsquot exist, I think we could just accept things as they are and get on with our lives and make every day count.ldquoBut as it is we canrsquot rest until we have access to Orkambi and the pipeline of drugs for Lorcaacuten and all the others with cystic fibrosishere need.ldquoThis situation makes it dficult to enjoy our son without feeling pain at time passing.The couple, who live off the Vianstown Road, believe that the sooner their son starts on Orkambi the better.ldquoOrkambi not only slows the decline in lungby up to %, it also reduces hospitalisations by up to %, Jen explained.ldquoEvery day people go without access to these drugs is a day in which their body could become more damaged. Since he was  days old, Lorcaacuten has not had a single day without taking some type of antibiotic, as well as  enzymes.ldquoSome people [including young children] with CF have to attend the hospital for two weeks of IVs every three months and thatrsquos considered to be ok when there is a drug that could potentially help Families of CF sufferers believe that Orkambi can lsquostop the clockrsquo on further decline of the patient as they get older.However, the US drug company which developed it has so far failed to agree a price so that it could be introduced by the UK.Jen added: ldquoThe drugs currently in trials are supposed to give sufferers a chance at a near normal le, but this is partly dependent on them being healthy enough when they begin taking them. There is no time to wait.ldquoTwo hundred and twenty six people have died in the UK since Orkambi was licensed over three years ago. We need Orkambi and we need it now.The couple have been lobbying local politicians to get their help at keeping their campaign in spotlight in Government.Strangford MP Jim Shannon raised the plight of Lorcaacuten at Westminster this week.South Down MLAs Jim Wells and Sinead Bradley, along with Lagan Valley MLA Trevor Lunn, are planning to host a meeting in Stormont within weeks with Richard Pengelly, Permanent Secretary at the Department of Health in Northern Ireland.Mr Shannon said: ldquoI was contacted by people throughout Northern Ireland asking me to push government to allow a crown licence for this le-changing drug, as I have been vocal in my belief that this drug should be available on the NHS.ldquoWhat impacted me most was a mother in my area who sent me a picture of her beautul two year-old son with his little mask on, telling me that he was now old enough to get it and it would make such a dference to him.ldquoI supported the calls for the drug and will continue pushing government to find a way to overcome the issue between the drug company and NICE guidelines.While Jen says she has received local cross-party support, she is urging people to sign the petition

technology is to be used to inform peoplethe bathing water at Newcastle beach is safe to swim in.The beach is one of six across the province which features in a new EU-backed initiative to provide people with live updates of the water quality.The resortrsquos beach and surrounding river catchment area has been selected as part of a major new study, with a weather station and river water level recorders already in place to send real time data to a server which the public can access.A new electronic sign is to be erected at the Downs Road car park to provide live updates on the water quality, but the European Unionrsquos so-called SWIM project goes a step further with people able to get information via text messages and internet alerts.News of the new initiative comes just three months after it was revealed that while Kilclief, Ballyhornan, Tyrella and Murlough beaches continue to enjoy some of the best bathing water quality in Europe, it was a case of lsquomust do betterrsquo for Newcastle, with the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs labelling the resortrsquos water quality as ldquosufficient.Details of the SWIM project were outlined at Monday nightrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee.Councillors were told those involved in the scheme are working on developing a real time monitoring system, allowing local people and visitors to the beach to check the water quality via a series of measures.Council officials say the innovative project will enable what they have described as ldquoshort term pollution to be predicted.Funded by the Special EU Programmes Body, those behind the project which includes Newcastle, Castlerock, Portrush, Waterfoot, Ballyholme and Ballywalter beaches in Northern Ireland and Clogherhead, Enniscrone and Ladyrsquos Bay in the Republic, say it will help protect public health.In addition, they are confident that it will signicantly improve communication about water quality and contribute to tourism promotion in the resort.At Monday nightrsquos council meeting, Mournes councillor Willie Clarke said: ldquoThis new programme is good news for the resort and can have a positive impact on tourism.ldquoThe fact that people will have real time access to the quality of the bathing water builds confidence which is positive.ldquoThere is a problem with nitrates finding their way into the water at the beach and it is something that needs to be addressed.ldquoHowever, the fact that we will soon have a scheme which enables people to know the quality of the water before they take a dip is groundbreaking.Rowallane councillor Harry Harvey, said the decision was good news for Newcastle and could boost visitor numbers.ldquoThis is a forward step for a beach where the water quality has improved from what it was a number of years ago, he said.ldquoThe beach has yet to achieve blue flag status which in part recognises the quality of the water and it would be greatthis could be secured in the long term.ldquoWith the focus on the here and now, the provision of the electronic sign and the availability of real time information is indeed a welcome development and a forward step for the resort..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/9398593.jpg","title":"seans surreal abbey road experience","story":"With his great grandfatherrsquos fiddle in hand, local musician Sean Magee recently recorded a single at the iconic Abbey Road Studios, a place made famous by The Beatles.Calling the experience of recording in the same studio as The Beatles ldquosurreal, Sean explained how the opportunity arose.ldquoIrsquove just recently joined up with a guy called Rory Gallagher, hersquos from Kilcar, Donegal, and his project is called Rory and the Island for he owned the Island Bar over in Lanzarote for five or six years before he came home. He asked me would I come along and join him so we have been out on tour and we were over playing in Camden, in London last week, said Sean.He continued: ldquoHe signed with a record label called Buddy Records and they got it all sorted for us to go in and record with Abbey Road, so we were recording our new single lsquoCall My Name.rsquoWith the new single due to release on Spoty at the end of next week, Sean said: ldquoWersquove got it all nearly ready to go so therersquos just a few mixes that need to be done.Talking about the recording day, Sean said: ldquoWe were in early morning and we were just straight into it, I never really got thinking about it and about midday we took a walk around the building and seen all the big studios.ldquoWe recorded in the Gate House studio and we went into Studio Two and Studio Three to do wee bits of sample and background vocals. That was where The Beatles, Ed Sheerin and Adele all wouldrsquove recorded in as well. So it was just madness, he added.During the recording of the single Sean played his great grandfatherrsquos fiddle, an instrument which has a tale of its own to tell. Sean explained: ldquoMy great grandfather had ordered this fiddle in  before the First World War broke out and hersquod sent the money with the order. Basically then the war broke out and the fiddle didnrsquot turn up so he thought all was lost. As soon as the war was finished in , the fiddle arrived at the door. He couldnrsquot believe it. So I took it with me to Abbey Road and the song we were recording was a slow song, and therersquos a lovely deep tone out of the fiddle so I took it with me.ldquoIt was my grandadrsquos father and my grandad was delighted that I took it with me, he added.When asked how he first met Rory, Sean explained that it was through his dad, Conor Magee. He said: ldquoRory was in a band way back years ago called The Revs and they wouldrsquove been doing sets at the likes of Slane Castle. My dad is a sound engineer, and he done the sound for The Revs about  years ago. We were going over to Lanzarote and I didnrsquot know Rory at all and dad had messaged him to seehe would get me up for a song in the Island Bar.Sean continued: ldquoHe got me up and shortly after that he sent me a message to seeI wanted to do a couple of gigs over in Lanzarote. He asked me thenI wanted to go out on tour with him when he was home. So it came out of nowhere really.Sean has since been touring with Rory and the Island for the last six months, travelling all over Ireland and the UK. Talking about their upcoming gigs, Sean said: ldquoWersquove Germany for St. Patrickrsquos weekend and America then in April, over to New York.He added: ldquoWe also have a local gig in Charliersquos Bar on March .

If there are other ways of doing it that are just as effective that perhaps we haven’t yet explored then we will do that too.”Leading ERG member Steve Baker said only a “treaty-level clause” which gives the UK an unconditional right to exit the backstop would work.In light of these comments, the News Letter asked East Londonderry MP Mr Campbell whether securing changes to the withdrawal text was a red line for the DUP.He replied: “If theyare saying it can be done another way, then we are not going to quibble about what that other way might be.“The bottom line is that the withdrawal agreement is a legally binding document which puts NI at a disadvantage, trading wise, to the rest of the UK.“That has to change. We are not getting into the pedantics of whether that will be a codicil, an addition, or a deletion.“Whatever the change is, we will judge it against the fundamental position of whether it removes the disadvantage that exists for NI under the withdrawal agreement.”Mr Campbell said that, whatever form a change to the backstop takes, it must “override” the current arrangement contained within the withdrawal text. He added that the attorney general should be consulted to ensure this was the case.Heartbreak at sudden passing of -year-old Maddy-Leigh Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“Does it have legal standing and does it put us on the same path as the rest of the UK  That is the pre-eminent and paramount concern that we have,” he stated.But TUV leader and barrister Jim Allister said he was sceptical that any addendum could counteract the withdrawal text.He added: “Article  of the agreement sets out the supremacy of the text of the deal. So unless you get something that overrides that, then in any legal tussle over what has supremacy, Article  would rule the day.“It is imperative that there has to be a binding, irrefutable change to the agreement. Anything outside that is going to labour under the dficulty of being subsidiary. “I am totally with the ERG in arguing that there must be an upfront change within the agreement. Doing so would remove all doubt.”try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES: The  locations across N.I. where speed camera vans operateTwo cases of meningitis confirmed at NI primary schoolMan caught with  lsquopackagesrsquo of cocaine in his body at Belfast City AirportBallymena manager David Jeffrey praised his side after their - defeat to Linfield in the BetMcLean League Cup Final.LIVE BLOG: League Cup final  - Ballymena United v Linfield          ..

Mr McAteer was barred by law from acting as a spad because of a serious criminal conviction. However, Sinn Fein circumvented the law by making him a ‘super spad’, putting him over the party’s team of spads and ministers – something which civil servants agreed to, even though it was against the spirit of the law.Stormont Castle has not acknowledged the existence of minutes of the meeting between Sir Malcolm and the DUP and Sinn Fein spads, suggesting that no minutes of the meeting were taken. The following morning, Sir Malcolm emailed his two senior civil service colleagues with a draft of the letter which he had drawn up and asked them for any comments by lunch time.Three hours later Dr McCormick replied to say that he had discussed the issue with Mr Sterling and they had agreed a series of changes to the text. Mr Sterling felt it contained a section on agriculture which was “too long”, something which “unbalances the overall thrust of the letter”.Five days later the amended letter was sent to the private secretaries of the first minister and the deputy first minister. Not a word of that letter was changed by the ministers or their spads before it was sent to Downing Street the following day.Sinn Fein makes unity pitch to civic unionists Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES: The  locations across N.I. where speed camera vans operateTwo cases of meningitis confirmed at NI primary schoolMan caught with  lsquopackagesrsquo of cocaine in his body at Belfast City AirportBallymena manager David Jeffrey praised his side after their - defeat to Linfield in the BetMcLean League Cup Final.LIVE BLOG: League Cup final  - Ballymena United v Linfield          ..

Pic by Ben LowryMrs McDonald said it was impossible to “undo that damage or that loss” during her speech at the invitation of the fledgling Civic Space group.Although billed as a unionist event, a signicant number among the  or so invited participants were from Sinn Fein or the wider nationalist community, including Michelle O’Neill, Declan Kearney, Tom Hartley, Chris Donnelly and Professor Colin Harvey.The warmest applause of the night was for Belfast businessman Suneil Sharma who questioned whether the Sinn Fein leader’s reference to “changing demography” leading to a united Ireland was a polite way of talking up a sectarian head count.“Are you saying that soon there will be more Catholics than Protestants in Northern Ireland  Is this not the sort of crass, identity politics that is not about reconciliation, but reinforcing tribalism ” Mr Sharma said.Mrs McDonald said that the changing demographics was only one aspect of her belief that a united Ireland is inevitable.In a y speech, Mrs Donald said all suffering during the conflict should be acknowledged and remembered.The party president urged a duty of candour and acceptance of dference, and said reconciliation “sits above” the constitutional question surrounding the creation of a united Ireland.“We have an agreed process to deal with the constitutional question. We now need an agreed process for reconciliation.“I and my generation of republicans will work tirelessly to build a society in which no other parent is left without a child or a child left without a mammy or daddy.”Referencing the Carson-era opposition to an independent Ireland with a parliament sitting in Dublin, Mrs McDonald acknowledged that “in the south, Home Rule did indeed become Rome rule”.However, she said that although some people felt bewildered at the loss of their British identity, “it was mostly women that paid the price in the mothers and babies homes, as slave labour in the laundries”.UUP MLA Alan Chambers blasts Sinn Fein’s ‘double standards’ on legacy Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Rev Chris Hudson of the Non Subscribing Presbyterian Church askedshe now regretted opposing a small Orange Order parade in Dublin in the summer of .Rev Hudson also told Mrs McDonald there would be a better chance of getting an Irish Language ActSinn Fein been involved in pushing for one.Responding to the question about the protests that led to the parade being called off, she said her “politics had changed”.She added: “It was a very fraught situation” with “communities under siege” in Northern Ireland at that time, but parades can be accommodated “where it’s not seen as an encroachment”. The civic unionism event follows a much larger civic nationalist event at Belfast’s Waterfront last month which took place without unionist involvement.Among the audience last night were two young Ulster Unionists, Hannah Niblock, who works in Belfast, and Katie Armstrong, a student at Queen’s University.Hannah said: “No matter what your background you can tell Mary Lou speaks from the heart and she comes across well.”Katie said: “Despite having two very dferent backgrounds we have a lot of things in common in how we can move forward.”try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES: The  locations across N.I. where speed camera vans operateTwo cases of meningitis confirmed at NI primary schoolMan caught with  lsquopackagesrsquo of cocaine in his body at Belfast City AirportBallymena manager David Jeffrey praised his side after their - defeat to Linfield in the BetMcLean League Cup Final.LIVE BLOG: League Cup final  - Ballymena United v Linfield          ..

I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide.

These will be considered in accordance with the relevant legislation and guidance, part of which specically relates to the need for an Environmental Impact Assessment.ldquoShould a planning application follow, it will be considered in exactly the same way as any other of its type. In order to gain approval, among other factors, it will need to satisfy national and local policies, including those contained in the LDP, while members of the public will also have the opportunity to express their views before any decision is taken.Welsh Government and the architects have been contacted for comment. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief.

But I donrsquot get to determine this.Chuka Umunna has said he would like to see a new centre party up and running as soon as possible Senior Labour MP Mary Creagh said she had been approached to join the breakaway, but had declined.Ms Creagh told the BBC: ldquoI think whatrsquos important is that we now take a long hard look at ourselves as a political party.ldquoItrsquos clear that Brexit is pushing both parties to the brink. Itrsquos clear that anti-Semitism has taken root in our party.Meanwhile, the MPs who quit were branded ldquopathetic by Derek Hatton, the firebrand former deputy leader of Liverpool City Council who has been readmitted to the party  years after his expulsion for involvement in Militant Tendency.ldquoFor  years Irsquove stayed absolutely solid with the Labour Party. Never joined any other party, never actually voted for another party.

When he was in his s, Pat McKeever took over the farm after the death of his father Peter, who had run an apple canning business on the site. Pat said: “My daddy was one of three brothers who used to can apples. They’d get the apples from the local orchards, peel them and can them. Daddy then started growing his own apples and supplying the fresh market and the cider markets.”Now Pat’s son, and Peter’s grandson – also called Peter – is the third generation farmer who is set to carry on the business. Pat’s we Catherine and their four daughters also have integral roles to play as the craft cider making end of the agri-business continues to grow.Pat, Catherine and Peter McKeever of Long Meadow FarmLong Meadow started off with two craft cider drinks in  before introducing a mulled cider and a cider aged in oak barrels, some of which had been used in the original apple canning business. Over the past two years the company has branched out into flavoured ciders, apple juice and apple cider vinegar – famed for its health benefits.Catherine said: “I know everything goes through a bit of a fad, but I think the craft ciders are still holding their own. The mindset of cider has changed with craft ciders. “A lot of people would have associated cider in their younger days – maybe when they were at university – as a cheap drink you can buy in big quantities and get a hit off.“But that wasn’t craft cider. People are prepared to pay that little bit extra for the quality that comes with craft cider.“We’re using all our own fruit.

It’s your livelihood. You are depending on that fruit.“We harvest approximately , tonne of apples yearly.”Catherine explained how the orchard came to be illuminated: “A man called Walter Holt came to the farm last year to buy some apple cider vinegar. “I got talking to him and he gave me his card and told me what he did – an outdoor lighting artist.“I didn’t think much of it at the time, but I think the seeds had been sewn. I played about with it in my mind for a long time that it could be something we could work with.”Walter Holt and his assistant Orlanda Delaforce spent a total of  hours working on the installation of the lighting scheme.Walter commented: “The challenge on this particular scheme was working with smaller trees in an orchard setting. It’s a compact area and our solution was to develop a one way circular trail. “We tried to have as much creative iety as possible, implementing dferent approaches to dferent trees, with the whole colour scheme carefully thought out.”The light display is accompanied by music composed by Londonderry musician Sharon Graham.Catherine said: “We chose Valentine’s week for the treelumination launch as we felt it was a novel way in terms of adding to the romance of walking in the moonlight, but it’s by no means just for couples, it’s designed very much as a family experience for everyone.“I think we all have a vision of apple orchards complete with apple blossom or an abundance of fruit.“This illuminations event highlights the orchards in a totally dference perspective – a raw natural resting state before the cycle of growth begins.”The light show – designed by Walter Holt of Travelling Treeluminations – is the first of its kind to be held in an orchard environment and will open to the public from today until Saturday, from pm to pm each evening at  Loughgall Road.Entry is £ per adult and £ for children. A family ticket for two adults and two children costs £.Visitors will be given the opportunity to see the pressing and blending facilities on the farm as well as taste some of the products.Artisan food will be on sale as well as some free refreshment including tea, coffee and hot chocolate. Set to benefit from the four-day event is local charity ‘Katie-Rose’s Journey’.For more information on this week’s illumination event and other aspects of the farm go to www.longmeadowcidertry catch  TrendingThree vehicle crash near PortadownPartner and child were lsquomaking too much noisersquoDiscovery of mans body sparks murder probeJail sentence for man who spat and screamed at hospital staffConcern as disabled woman who carrys oxygen tank slapped with parking ticket          ..

Subject to confirmation by the all-island Single Electricity Market Committee, the auction for electricity generators to be awarded capacity contracts, on an all-island basis, has identied electricity capacityof , MW which will be in place for the year starting October ,  – , MW of that all-island total is attributed to Northern Ireland.This is a critical series of draft decisions which will reassure the large conventional generators about their contracts and will impose the discipline of revenue limits constrained by the capacity auction. The draft decisions also point to the expectations in terms of the capacity earmarked from renewable sources, from inter-connection with the Scottish grid and the capacity adjustments that may follow from demand-side adjustment contracts.SONI has not been as open and transparent as should have been possible. Readers must make the assumption that ties location to where capacity payments are identied in sterling and euro.The SONI statement lists  generator names ,  of which are identied as DSUswhich leaves  others. Eight are shown as part of the AES capacity in Ballylumford and Kilroot: four are small capacity generators, six each have capacity of over MW , and the last capacity source linked to Northern Ireland is the Moyle Interconnector.SONI does not present the capacity awards in a way that allows readers to identy the location of each successful unit.The Utility Regulator has agreed that the available Northern Ireland capacity should include  MW from the Moyle Interconnector which represents over % of locally available capacity. This is a judgement that might be queried. Is the interconnectora guaranteed source of capacity  If, at a time of peak demand in Northern Ireland, demand in the grid in GB had no spare capacity, presumably the capacity might not be available for supply to Northern Ireland. The regulator and SONI are well placed to judge the probability of this outcome and might argue that it is a minimal risk.There are some interesting features stemming from the assumptions made in setting the framework for the capacity auction. First, Northern Ireland has been treated as meriting some contract iations because of locational constraints. This is a reflection of the limited capacity of the electricity grid on the whole island to send electricity to the places where there is demand. Both the Dublin area and Northern Irelanddid not attract auction bids adequately to supply these area locational constraints. For Northern Ireland. the easy explanation lies in the absence of the long awaited north-south grid expansion from to the planned distribution hub in Co Tyrone.The capacity auction allowed for the acceptance of bids with prices which are higher than the main auction prices which would match supply and demand across the whole island. Because of the locational deficit, some Northern Ireland bids now show capacity payment prices above the all-Ireland ceiling of £, per MW which applies to most of the successful bids.In the quotation from AES for the two large fossil fuel burning units, the proposal is that they should attract payment prices of £, and £, per MW. At first sight this appears to allow a premium of nearly % on the payment price for each MW. This seems more than a marginal cost and points to the possible cost savingsthe proposed new north-south link had been operational.This answer for the older high capacity units at Kilroot is a further reflection of the doubt about the continued viability of these units. It will be remembered that a year ago, these same two units were deemed unsuccessful in the auction but, at a late stage when faced with a request for a derogation to be allowed to close these units, the initially agreed settlement was revised.A year ago, the first capacity auction under the rules of the newly instituted I-SEM, was accepted with a capacity supply of near to , MW for all of Northern Ireland. Now, in early , SONI has concluded that for security of supply Northern Ireland should contract for just under , MW. There is no obvious major uplt in demand in Northern Ireland so that, quietly, the suggestion is that the arithmetic in late  may now be thought to have been slightly too risky.The capacity auction is a fundamental building block of electricity supply policy for Northern Ireland. However, on its own, the allocation of capacity and the possible scope for investment in new generating capacity must also be seen in the context of increasing,market forces allow, the proportion of electricity supply that is supplied from renewable sources. The distribution of generating capacity is still dominated by fossil fuels. Northern Ireland’s capacity is nearly % from gas andcoal. However, the statistics showing the proportion of electricity supply from renewables points to average consumption from renewables of nearer to -%. Because of the iability in the contribution of wind based renewables, it would be hazardousgreater security dependence was allocated to renewables.In turn, the caveat about the possible role of renewables points to the possible value of further investment in energy storage for which no major scheme has been launched. If Kilroot power station survives for a further three to four years, then the experimental electricity storage capacity on that site may become an attractive asset.There are several continuing questions about Northern Ireland’s security of electricity supply. Will Kilroot be given further stays of execution after   Will the North South interconnector eventually be built  Will the proposed large natural gas burning power station be built in Belfast  Will the politically unpopular investment in anaerobic digestion plants be tackled  Will the Brexit settlement, or lack of it, damage the continued operation of the all-island single electricity market  But... it seems Kilroot has been given a temporary extension of its role in keeping the lights on.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pmcg.jpg","title":"ryder cup legend to address belfast leadership conference","story":"Posted on Friday February  by Ulster Business Ryder Cup legend Paul McGinley has been revealed as one of the key speakers at a leadership event taking place in Belfast next month.

The building is being marketed by Osborne King and RHM Commercial. “Given the lack of available grade A office accommodation in Belfast we are excited to bring a building of this size and quality to the market,” Richard McCaig of Osborne King said. “In our experience deliverability of projects is key in order to attract tenants and Lighthouse offers the chance for an occupier to secure the largest amount of existing office space available in the city.” Nick Rose of RHM said it is “extremely rare for an entire building of this quality to become available”. “The superb location combined with a signicant car parking provision will undoubtedly prove attractive to the market. Given that Lighthouse is a few minutes walk from Belfast City Hall and adjoins the -bed Radisson Blu Hotel we expect signicant interest from corporate occupiers.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"kainos taking on bankmore square for belfast office scheme","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by John Mulgrew Tech firm Kainos will take on a massive proposed office scheme in Belfast for its new headquarters, it has emerged.
