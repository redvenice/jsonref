However, one thing had remained the same – the belief that if we can help, even in a small way, what reason could we find for not doing it?\u0027   In 2017 Lenny resigned as a Comic Relief trustee after 27 years but has since been made an honorary life president of comic relief.  Victoria Beckham             Victoria Beckham, 44, posing in outfit worth £490, the t-shirt alone cost £90 from her own range In March 2018 Victoria made a controversial trip to the slums of Nairobi, Kenya, for Sports Relief along with her 9-person entourage. The 44-year-old fashion designer met school girls and gushed over a new born baby, named David, as he received life saving injections funded by USA Red Nose Day donations. Victoria faced a media backlash while on the trip for wearing an outfit which cost £490 around the Nairobi slums.The same week Liz Warner, chief executive of Comic Relief, which runs Sport Relief and Red Nose Day, announced that celebrities would take a back seat for on-location appeals following complaints about \u0027poverty tourism\u0027. In a press release about the trip Victoria said: \u0027I\u0027m so proud to have been supporting the amazing work of Sport Relief for over a decade.\u0027I first went on a field trip to Peru in 2004 for the \u0027A mile in their shoes\u0027 documentary. 14 years later, here I am in Kenya, visiting incredible community projects that are protecting, educating and empowering women of all ages.\u0027            Victoria sports a red nose while visiting a school in Nairobi, kenya, along with film crew   Reggie Yates            Reggie Yates, 35-year-old TV presenterIn 2017 Reggie took part in the African convoy through Africa delivering bikes to workers. In Kenya he spoke to a women named Olivia who was living a hand to mouth existence and struggling to afford food for her children. Her children washed behind the house in a puddle of water mixed with sewage.After Reggie\u0027s visit, two of Olivia\u0027s daughters (Faith and Felister) were enrolled into education, receiving counselling, life skills training and remedial education.The Comic Relief-funded project support Olivia to join a savings group, so that she can start a small business, which could give her children a more secure future.Reggie also accompanied Lennie Henry to Kiberia, Kenya, in 2011, living among open sewers for a week.Writing in The Guardian about the experience he said: \u0027Lenny Henry, Angela Rippon, Samantha Womack and I spent a week in Nairobi.\u0027I had some drinking water and the occasional sweet or chocolate bar, but I was living among open sewers, sleeping in shacks. I pretty much lost all appetite, for days on end.\u0027   One DirectionIn 2013 the One Direction boys Niall Horan, Liam Payne, Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson and Zayn Malik visited Accra, Ghana.The men were so affected by the children and young babies they met, most fighting for their lives against common diseases like diarrhoea and pneumonia at the children\u0027s hospital in Accra, that they broke down while filming, pleading with viewers to give generously.Harry Styles cried after meeting a three-year-old boy suffering from malaria and anaemia.            Harry Styles and Liam Payne talking to children in Accra, Ghana Zayn Malik also broke down in tears, admitting he was struggling to come to terms with the magnitude of seeing children fighting for their lives on a daily basis. He said: \u0027It\u0027s so hard. I\u0027ve never seen anything, never experienced anything like this in my life. The babies aren\u0027t even a year old.\u0027Begging viewers to donate to this year\u0027s Red Nose Day Appeal, he added: \u0027We all waste money but the most important thing we can all do is give £5 to protect children from these illnesses.\u0027        Samantha Womack, who played Ronnie Mitchell in EastEndersDuring the 2011 \u0027Rich, Famous and in the Slums\u0027 visit to Kiberia, Kenya, Samantha Womack, who played Ronnie Mitchell in EastEnders, went to live in the house of a woman who had been forced to resort to prostitution.The woman had had no choice but to send her children away to their grandmother while she earnt money and her family weren\u0027t aware she was a prostitute.The actress also spent time at a clinic and was reduced to tears while comforting a woman who had given birth to a stillborn baby. Samantha told Whatsontv: \u0027I wasn\u0027t prepared for the impact Kibera would have on me, it\u0027s a tragically beautiful place.

The British brand opened in 1990 and is now well known for its signature kitten heels favoured by celebrities and royals including Kate Middleton who is pictured wearing dresses from the brand during a tour of Australia in 2014Fashion brand Orla Kiely, which was also loved by the Duchess of Cambridge, also went out of business with debts of more than £7.25m (€8.1m) last year. High Street clothing giant Gap also announced today that it will close 230 stores worldwide as its US parent company launches a massive restructuring programme.The closures amount to nearly a fifth of its total shops although the company has not said where stores will shut or how many jobs will be affected.           Shoppers have said the brand put prices up after Kate Middleton started wearing their clothes          LK Bennett is the latest big name to become a casualty in the bloodbath on the high street          The Sludge wedge increased by £20 after it became popular with Kate Middleton          LK Bennett\u0027s Natalie clutch bag also increased in price by £20 in 2012Both of these items saw their price increase by £20 after the royal was snapped in public with them.  Branding expert Claire Shiels told Femail how labels can struggle to keep up with demand  after  public figures wear their clothes.She said: \u0027A sudden and unexpected spike in sales and demand\u0027 can \u0027involve huge costs for the label.\u0027                                                    However customers have said the store \u0027put their prices up\u0027 after Kate started being seen wearing their clothes and got engaged to Prince William.Others have also criticised the brand\u0027s prices, saying \u0027that not many people have £300 spare to buy one dress\u0027.  Branding expert Claire Shiels told Femail: \u0027Celebrity endorsement is the holy grail for any retailer, although it can bring with it as many problems as benefits.\u0027Having your high street label worn in public by one of the world\u0027s most photographed women can prove to be a nightmare if you\u0027re not forewarned, which is usually the case with Kate Middleton.Ms Shiels added: \u0027The problem for labels with Kate in particular, is that she chooses staple wardrobe items that are typically priced at the higher end for high street retailers and wears them more than once.\u0027This means that typically, her fashion followers will only purchase one item per season, rather than buying into the brand and shopping with them all year long.\u0027Fashion commentator Karine Laudort also told MailOnline: \u0027The Duchess of Cambridge may be a fan but the everyday woman in Britain may think twice before spending an extra £100 on a outfit, \u0027Especially when most online retailers now offer free 24-hour or same day delivery.\u0027 Today the brand was running an offer for 25 per cent off the entire new season range online and in store.Customers could also enjoy free UK delivery on all orders. Items  in the new range that were eligible for the discount included colourful court shoes priced at £195, a gold envelope clutch bag costing £175 and a variety of midi dresses costing around £300.  LK Bennett is well known for its signature kitten heels favoured by celebrities such as Holly Willoughby and royals including Kate Middleton.Kate took a two year hiatus from the brand and wasn\u0027t spotted wearing it on any public occasions after August 2016. But she reaffirmed her love for it, just a few months ago – wearing a green and cream silk polka dot dress for a visit to the Evelina London Children\u0027s hospital, in December 2018.           Kate, pictured at Kings Cross St Pancras station in London, also chose a teal suit from the brand for her first official engagement with the Queen in March 2012  Holly Willoughby, left in one of the brand\u0027s dresses at the Chelsea Flower Show in May and Katherine Jenkins, right in the Izzy dress and Priyanka Courts at her album signing in London in December, are also among the famous fans of the fashion label          Linda Bennett, pictured at Buckingham Palace, received an OBE for services to the fashion industry in the New Year Honours list in 2016Kate also chose a teal suit from the brand for her first official engagement with the Queen during her Diamond Jubilee UK Tour in 2012. This elegant look included the £395 Jude jacket and £225 Davina dress which she paired with a pillbox hat by James Lock. High Street clothing giant Gap to close 230 stores worldwide...The curse of Kate!

Linda Bennett, pictured, came back to the company in 2017 after leaving in 2008 when she sold her majority stake  for between £80m and 100mBennett founded the brand 29 years ago in 1990 with a store in Wimbledon, London. The brand grew quickly into an international chain and Bennett decided to sell the business to Phoenix Equity Partners and Sirius Equity in 2008 for around £80-100million.Despite having sold off the brand she retained a stake on the company board, before re-joining in 2017 as a consultant to the management team.In September 2017 Bennett increased her investment in the company and bought out the remaining equity from private equity owner Phoenix Equity Partners and at the time the brand was operating more than 260 shops and concessions in more than 30 countries.After the acquisition by Bennett the company stated that it would continue to expand and subsequently launched stores in China, Russia and the US.  The curse of Kate!

The high street store is set to file for administration\u0027Retailers must walk a fine line between supply and demand, with production based on a number of factors including historical sales figures, market trends and buyer behaviour. \u0027A sudden and unexpected spike in sales and demand, which is what happens to a garment when the Duchess is spotted wearing it, often means that another immediate production run is required to satisfy demand and maximise the sales opportunity. \u0027Unfortunately, this can involve huge costs for the label, which then is unable to forecast when the sales surge is likely to suddenly drop again. \u0027The science behind production is therefore thrown into disarray and costs can easily spiral.\u0027 The Duchess, 37, has been spotted wearing L.K. Bennett numerous times - from a printed blue and white dress to her go-to black booties.Claire added: \u0027The problem for labels with Kate in particular, is that she chooses staple wardrobe items that are typically priced at the higher end for high street retailers and wears them more than once. \u0027This means that typically, her fashion followers will only purchase one item per season, rather than buying into the brand and shopping with them all year long.           The Duchess of Cambridge sporting an LK Bennett dress for a dinner at Kensington Palace, London, during former US President Barack Obama\u0027s state visit to Britain in 2016          Kate, 37, wore a white and blue floral L.K.Bennett dress during a visit to Luton with national charity Youthscape in August 2016\u0027Despite the financial woes currently experienced by some of her favourite labels however, it is the market – not Kate - that is to blame for the mass closure of many high street stores. \u0027As well as L.K.Bennett Hobbs, Orla Kiely, Alice Temperley and Issa have all experienced significant financial difficulties.\u0027Although it\u0027s a difficult time for retail, Claire claims some lower-priced brands including Zara and Primark have got it right.She said: \u0027Zara is in the enviable position to have been able to bring its manufacturing process in-house rather than outsourcing abroad, meaning costs are reduced and the brand is able to react quickly to a sudden increase in demand. \u0027At the other end of the scale, Primark is continuing to thrive due, it is said to its mass market appeal and its focus on engagement with its customers through social media.\u0027It is the stores which are best able to adapt and have a supply chain flexible enough to cope with fluctuating demand and market trends which will survive.

Month of mad hares and parted ways. Maybe, after all, 29 March will come and go and Britain will still be in the EU by parliamentary vote and, who knows, a delay could produce a second referendum. But as things stand, this is officially the last month of Britain belonging to the community of European nations. And a sad exhibition at one London gallery muses on the miserable stupidity of it all.Should I Stay Or Should I Go? at Patrick Heide Contemporary Art is not a homage to the Clash song but an urgent personal question for Europeans living in Britain. And for some Britons, too. Gallerist Heide admits it’s one he asks himself. Like many artists and art professionals in London, he is from continental Europe – in his case Frankfurt – and his exhibition reflects the wretched sense that everything is going to be different, that Britain is shrinking. Susan Stockwell’s green woollen map of Britain shows this most succinctly. Scotland looks proper and correct, yet Brexit-voting England and Wales are collapsing in a shapeless mess. Brexit is not strengthening national identity in this acidic knit but melting this sceptred isle.When Polish artist Michal Iwanowski, who lives in Cardiff, came across the words “Go home Polish” daubed in his neighbourhood, he took a photograph and brooded. After the EU referendum he decided to take the advice and set out on a walk from Cardiff to Poland, photographing and noting what he saw from the green fields he tramped across to the barbed wire fences he observed at Calais.It is all quite low-key, perhaps because for now the battle seems lost. Britain is leaving Europe. It’s a moment when despair is understandable. Only a lunatic could be upbeat about the prospects for a happy outcome right now. Michael Landy laments this rancid reality in a group of small red and white paintings. One of them shows a Brexit fantasy of rustic Britain lit by a new dawn. Next to it a man is pissing to show the artist’s true feelings. Another image shows a swimmer not waving, but drowning. These gnomic foretellings of national disaster capture the sheer idiocy of our predicament.Moronic inferno it may be, but Brexit has made us aware we’re living in history. No doubt about it, March 2019 will be in the history books along with the outbreaks of civil war in 1642 and world conflict in July 1914. History paintings can preserve and monumentalise such mighty and heroic hours. Another London gallery, Ransom Art, is currently showing a crazed satirical history painting by John Springs called Mustn’t Grumble, that portrays the political establishment as a bunch of grotesques out of Gillray or Hogarth on a flag-bedecked Brexit train to nowhere. To be honest, I can’t even tell which side the artist is on, but it certainly appeals to my sense of alienation from the political system that got us here.Yet as we hurtle towards the edge and prepare to fall off the map of Europe, these protests – or wretched ruminations on the folly of it all – are mere blips in what remains, at this moment, a British art world comprehensively plugged into Europe. You would be forgiven for thinking the web that connects the British and continental art worlds is too complex and entangled ever to be really broken. Yet immigration from the EU is falling, and artists are among the most joyously migrant of communities.Maybe the moment this unhomely March truly resembles is the “phoney war” period at the beginning of the second world war, when no one really knew how events would develop. It is an unreal feeling. We’re about to sever our connection with our continent – brutally at worst, pointlessly at best – yet it feels unreal because the flow of modern life seems unstoppable.British artist Joe Sweeney captures the imminent tragedy of this infamous month in a public artwork that goes live today. +44 ...

Collectively the claimants, who gave talks for school tours and members of the public, had 500 years’ experience working for the gallery one inidual had been with the institution for 45 years.The National Gallery argued that the claimants were self-employed, but the employment tribunal judge said that “it is unreal to describe the dealings between the parties as transactions in which the gallery stood as the ‘client or customer of any business undertaking’ carried on by any of the lead claimants”.One of the claimants, Karly Allen, who worked for the gallery for 18 years, said: “This judgment cannot take away the fact that we have lost our jobs and the close relationship with the gallery which we loved it does go some way to acknowledge the losses we have suffered and our contribution to the life of the gallery.”Marie van der Zyl, a partner at law firm Ince Gordon Dadds, which represented the claimants, said: “This is an important case for all those who have unconventional working arrangements. The world of work is changing and there will be many iniduals who are unsure of their status and rights. This case gives those iniduals hope.”Adam Ohringer, a barrister specialising in employment cases at Cloisters chambers, said: “We have become accustomed to private employers denying workers their legal rights. This is a wake-up call to the public sector and, I am sure, the first of many cases in which public bodies will be challenged over the misclassification of their staff and the circumvention of employment rights.”“The gallery had no wish to get involved in litigation in relation to this matter. From the outset we would have welcomed the opportunity to resolve the issue through mediation, but the claimants did not respond to the Gallery’s requests to enable these discussions to begin since the claim arose.‘The Gallery has not ‘dismissed’ anyone as part of this process. The majority of the people involved are still providing these services to us on the same basis as previously, whilst others involved in these claims have already accepted either employment or new contracts with us.“It is important to state that this case should not be likened to the ‘gig economy’ debate that has been in the news recently, with legal cases brought against Hermes, Uber and Deliveroo. In fact, the National Gallery situation is exactly the opposite.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94ecf49094d035e41be87d1656720b31a92dcde8/0_1_1706_1024/master/1706.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c852f89b9c357eeb068a4b1af28df66b","title":"guantanamo diary author blocked from travelling for medical treatment","story":"Mohamedou Ould Slahi, who was released from Guantánamo Bay in 2016 after 14 years in detention without charge, has been refused a passport to leave Mauritania Mohamedou Ould Slahi, the author of an internationally bestselling memoir that detailed the torture he endured as a detainee in Guantánamo Bay, says he has been denied a passport by Mauritania, the country of his birth, three years after he was released from the US detention centre.The writer is petitioning Mauritania’s minister of the interior, Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah, over the denial of a passport. He had been told by the government he would be eligible to travel again two years after being released from Guantánamo. Slahi is supported by almost 200 writers, editors, publishers, teachers and human-rights advocates, who have written to Ould-Abdallah describing the rejection as “extrajudicial punishment of a man who has never engaged in terrorism nor ever been charged with or convicted of a crime”.Slahi was held at Guantánamo without charge between August 2002 and October 2016. He had fought alongside men who would join al-Qaida in the Afghanistan insurrection, but says he renounced the group in the 1990s. He turned himself in for questioning in Mauritania after the 911 attacks, and was subsequently rendered to Jordan, Afghanistan and then to Guantánamo Bay. His memoir about that time, Guantánamo Diary, details the torture he underwent, including isolation, beatings, sexual humiliation, death threats, and a mock kidnapping. It has been published in 29 countries and 26 languages, and was longlisted for the UK’s leading non-fiction award, the Samuel Johnson prize.Slahi was released in 2016 after 14 years in the detention centre, and transferred to Mauritania.The rejection of his recent application, however, prompted him to go public. The petition and attached letter of support is “a warning to the government. If you don’t give me my papers, I’m going to court,” he said. “They were very clear about it. They said the United States government asked them not to. I go to the United States, they said: ‘You are not a citizen, you are not in Guantánamo Bay. It is up to your country.’”The Mauritanian embassy in London did not respond to a request for comment. “It just demonstrates how arbitrary and absurd the restrictions are,” said Larry Siems, the author and human rights advocate who edited Guantánamo Diary. “People who know him best and know his situation understand how grossly unjust it is that he continues to be punished for nothing, and the international support from the letter shows he is reaching people … He appears frequently for classroom discussions by Skype around the world. He’s reached hearts and minds of students and faculty around the world. We live in this globalised world and those exchanges have all been incredibly positive, and there’s no reason to try to interrupt or impede them.”The letter describes the urgency of Slahi’s need for a passport, with doctors in Mauritania, the US and Germany stating that Slahi “requires advanced medical treatment for conditions associated with his ordeal of detention and abuse”, with one German doctor willing to “oversee and cover all costs associated with his treatment”.Slahi’s supporters in the petition described him as “an important international voice for justice, peace, reconciliation and faith” despite “the litany of injustices and human rights abuses” he has endured.The letter adds: “It is time to restore his freedom to travel so that he may enjoy his rights as a Mauritanian and fully represent his country and his values to the world … He is not just an important literary voice he is also an inspirational public figure who projects the essential human values of dignity, grace, peace, family, tolerance, faith and community. Authorising Mr Slahi’s freedom to travel will facilitate mutual respect and understanding across cultures, and enhance international appreciation of your country and its rich cultural heritage.”Slahi said that he has “so many people supporting me, but none of them can make decisions … It’s very dangerous. I’m exposed, very exposed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/726a16ed4a9f9f4d33da8eb009a6477515de24b1/0_256_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5165c6e063c72fa663949c77e125669c","title":"help to buy pushes uk housebuilder dividends to 23bn","story":"Flagship policy of former government drives up firms’ profits along with house prices Britain’s biggest housebuilders paid out £2.3bn in idends in their most recent financial year, as the help-to-buy subsidy pumped up their profits and house prices.The nine biggest housebuilders listed on the London Stock Exchange declared the idend payouts in their last full financial years, according to an analysis by AJ Bell, an investment platform.Help to buy, introduced in 2013 and recently extended until 2023 for first-time buyers, was one of the flagship policies of the coalition government. Former Conservative chancellor George Osborne hoped to boost home ownership among young people, as house price growth far outpaced wage growth.However, many economists believe the scheme boosted house prices without making a significant impact on the supply of new houses, enabling a profits bonanza for Britain’s biggest housebuilders and their shareholders.In 2012, the final full year before the help-to-buy scheme was introduced, the top nine firms – many of which had been battered by the financial crash – paid idends of only £57.7m, according to AJ Bell. Dividends declared in the companies’ most recent financial year were about 39 times greater.Since 2013 the nine housebuilders have paid out nearly £8bn in idends, while City analysts forecast another £5.2bn in payouts in 2019 and 2020. Furthermore, shareholders have also enjoyed appreciation in housebuilders’ share prices, which have been sustained by the promise of further profits.Persimmon, half of whose sales were part of help to buy, was responsible for 2018’s largest giveaway. Its shareholders collectively earned £732m in idends in the year ending in December, after the company earned more than £1bn in profits.Taylor Wimpey declared idends of slightly less than £500m during the same period. Barratt Developments declared £435m in the year ending in June 2018. Bellway, Berkeley Group and Bovis all declared idends of more than £120m in their last full financial year.The large profits of housebuilders have attracted heavy criticism, amid a continued housing crisis and rising homelessness. Persimmon’s former chief executive, Jeff Fairburn, resigned in November following public  fury over his £75m bonus, which had been scaled back from £110m after investor outrage.Greg Beales, the director of campaigns at the homelessness charity Shelter, said: “As all the big housebuilders announce soaring profits whilst the housing crisis worsens it couldn’t be clearer our housing market is broken. Whilst the big developers are doing better than ever, regular families are finding it harder and harder to afford somewhere to live.“Disjointed schemes such as help to buy have only made things worse by inflating house prices and giving big developers a leg-up, while doing almost nothing to for those most in need of a genuinely affordable home.”From 1 April 2013 to 30 September 2018, more than 195,000 properties were bought with an equity loan, according to government figures published this week. The total value of these equity loans was £10.7bn, with the value of the properties sold totalling £49.9bn.Help to buy is not thought to be the only factor behind rising house prices, which have also been pushed up because of supply constraints, improved economic growth and the effects of quantitative easing.However, the help-to-buy scheme has faced criticism across the political spectrum, from the Adam Smith Institute, a libertarian thinktank, to the Labour party – although Labour is committed to keeping the scheme open until 2027 for first-time buyers below a certain income level.Labour’s shadow housing secretary, John Healey, said: “Conservative ministers have given private housebuilders a free hand to make bumper profits off the back of homebuyers.“Labour will turn the broken housing market on its head – putting low-cost new homes at the heart of our plan to rebuild Britain.”The Office for Budget Responsibility, which provides the government’s official forecasts, in October said it expects the government to spend another £20bn on the help-to-buy scheme between the current financial year and 2022-23. The two-year extension of the scheme is expected to cost £7.3bn.A Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson said: “This government is committed to helping more people get on the housing ladder as we power through to delivering 300,000 homes a year by the mid-2020s. Our help to buy equity loan scheme has helped more than 190,000 households buy their home, helping to make the dream of home ownership a reality for a new generation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d297bea87f9134073239305f0493b88c296d6e49/0_0_5130_2754/master/5130.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9e37910cd94a5c4612aa63f4a0c27848 1440w","title":"a powerful argument for radical change readers respond to guardian concrete week","story":"From highlighting favourite Brutalist gems to suggesting construction alternatives, readers have had lots to say about our concrete coverageThis week  Cities has been investigating the contentious issue of concrete. While it has brought about improvements in public health and some celebrated works of architecture, the material is causing widespread destruction across the globe.As our coverage explored concrete’s different angles – its environmental impact, its influence on culture, the brutalist buildings under threat, and potential alternative materials – many of you joined in the debate.We were overwhelmed by your response, from photos of your favourite concrete beauties and detested monstrosities, to tales of how concrete has shaped your cities, such as this Instagram post from the Birmingham Civic Society about the legacy of its “concrete collar”.On Twitter there was an impassioned debate over whether the demolition of Birmingham’s old Central Library – a former brutalist landmark – was architectural vandalism or the right decision for the city.You also expressed alarm at the dangers that the production and use of concrete is posing to the planet, and several of you, inspired by Fiona Harvey’s report on alternatives to concrete, shared examples of more environmentally friendly materials and methods.Jonathan Watts, the ’s Environment editor, kicked off our Concrete Week with an in-depth report on the shocking impact of concrete on the planet. Here’s a selection of your many responses to his report:Fiona Harvey reported on the new alternatives to concrete being developed, such as cross-laminated timber. David Hopkins, managing director of the Timber Trade Federation, got in touch to reiterate the benefits of wood: “There are lots of advantages to building in timber – managed forests provide a range of environmental benefits, helping to produce oxygen, provide bioerse habitats and natural management of water, reducing flood risk. As a material that absorbs rather than emits carbon, timber continues to make a positive contribution to the environment after it is harvested, and has one of the smallest carbon footprints of any material used for building.”Other readers told us about other potential solutions we’d missed. Hemp – perhaps not commonly associated with the construction industry – has long been celebrated as an alternative building and insulation material. “Hempcrete” is made with a mix of hemp hurds, lime and water, and is used mainly for non-structural building materials and wall insulation. Once the plant is turned into hempcrete it continues to absorb CO2.Straw is another option. Straw Works, for example, manufactures pre-fabricated straw panels. The company says: “Load bearing walls are either built of load bearing straw bales, or timber frame infilled with straw.” As an alternative to concrete foundations it is also using car tyres for the new community hall by Holy Trinity Church in Tulse Hill, London.We also heard about Gnanli Landrou, a scientist and entrepreneur, who is developing a process to turn clay-based excavation material into a soil-based concrete, which doesn’t use cement – the key material that is most responsible for concrete’s shocking carbon footprint.You contacted us to tell us about cement companies that are attempting to make the production process less harmful to the environment. The manufacture of clinker is the most-energy intensive part of cement production, with half of concrete’s CO2 emissions created during this process. Dalmia Cement, Ambuja Cement and UltraTech Cement in India say they are trying to change the way they produce clinker, and are using recycled industrial waste. They use low-grade limestone, with fly ash (waste from thermal power plants) and slag (waste from the steel industry) in their blended cements.One reader on Twitter also said:Structural engineer Nawid Daoud, meanwhile, argued that – although he supports sustainable alternative materials – some elements of construction can’t be done using sustainable, commercially viable alternatives (yet). He says for certain components of buildings, concrete is still the most viable option both from a material strength perspective, and from a cost perspective.For example, the vast majority of building foundations are concrete, and you will struggle to find an alternative, more sustainable material which will perform in the same way as concrete does under intense compression, let alone one which is widely available (and therefore affordable).”You took to Instagram to post concrete-inspired photos, and wrote about your affection for certain concrete structures.Mark Cowan from UK Truckmixer Training got in touch to flag up the importance of training for drivers who deliver concrete. Cowan, who has worked as a concrete mixer driver for 28 years, says these vehicles are frequently subject to rollover incidents.… we received this photo of concrete hippos in Glenrothes, Fife.Thanks to all of you who submitted comments, emails, tweets, posts and images. We looked at each one, and although we couldn’t include them all we were hugely heartened by your passion and knowledge.

However, murga – a feisty, home-grown form of street dance and percussion performed during carnival season, once unfairly thought of as only performed by drop-outs and drunks – has flourished in recent years, providing a source of pride, happiness and salvation for the predominantly working class families that dedicate their lives to it.One of the capital’s approximately 100 official groups, La Locura de Boedo (the craziness of Boedo), invited me to tour the city with them 10 years ago while working on a newspaper assignment. I have been following their fortunes through carnival seasons ever since, travelling with the troupe on beaten up school buses to parades in far flung barrios across the city – unpretentious affairs in which street corners house makeshift scaffold stages.The carnival takes place during the humid summer months when the city’s well-off residents tend to relocate to the coast. Local children, many of whom can’t afford holidays away, peer transfixed through railings, in search of a different kind of escape, as their local idols fling their arms around and dance in a rapturous series of acrobatic kicks, to the hypnotic, thunderous beat of bass drums and cymbals.Like Rio’s Samba, Salvador’s Axe and Andean Carnavalito, murga’s roots reflect the cultural melting pot of Argentina’s colonial past, nodding back to the shores of Europe and Africa. The art form was repressed during the dictatorship of 1976-83, but went on to flourish during the 1990s among predominantly working class families, with the number of groups increasing more than tenfold.Over time I learned that behind the spectacle of the parades, murga is a powerful social force shaping people’s identities and providing a support network rooted in the local neighbourhood. It gives people a sense of pride, an outlet for collective creativity and an escape from everyday struggles.“Through the murga you give a hand to whoever needs it,” says Juanjo, the charismatic director who runs the troupe with his wife Monica and their two sons, Maxi and Jony. “You try to contain the kids on the street, get them out of drugs and put them within this circle, which is the most beautiful thing there is.”In the lead up to carnival, Juanjo and Monica’s humble grey-cement house is a hive of activity, as murgueros of all ages gather to put the finishing touches to brightly coloured satin suits, put on shimmering make up in their group colours of red, white and turquoise, and assemble the distinctive bass drums with brass cymbals on top that anchor the murga’s percussion.During weekdays, the troupe are taxi drivers, receptionists, pest controllers, teachers, cleaners, plumbers and students, many struggling under the weight of Argentina’s worsening economic situation, which has recently seen a dramatic currency devaluation and soaring food and utility prices.But on Saturday and Sunday nights they leave their troubles behind and transform into glittering performers, with coat tails weighed down by appliques made of thousands of beads they have painstakingly sewn by hand over months.Juanjo, Monica, Maxi and Jony’s decision to dedicate themselves to murga came in an attempt to take their minds off their sadness after Juanjo and Monica’s youngest son died of meningitis in 1995 at the age of two. Now the group feels like a giant family. The directors are looked at by many in the 200-strong group as parental figures. “The role that my father left, he (Juanjo) took on,” says dancer Makiú.Like many group members, Makiú met her partner through murga, and the couple made their three children tiny suits for carnival not long after they were born, carrying them through the parade in their arms until they were old enough to dance and play the drums.Murga still bears the scars of historical marginalisation, with many in Argentine society continuing to associate it with transgression and delinquency. However, in 1997, the activity of murga groups was given ‘“cultural heritage” status by the City of Buenos Aires, and in 2011 former president Cristina de Kirchner re-instated the two-day carnival public holiday that had been taken away during the dictatorship, supporting murga’s transition into a family friendly, more mainstream activity.Despite this, there are few adverts for the carnival in the local media, so the parades remain largely undiscovered by tourists and even many city residents. For those that come to watch and take part in it, however, murga has long been an empowering force against the mixed fortunes of their everyday lives.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db262009840e17da51a32c3242a88e739d6265c8/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcfa31443a9aa3f8dfce7a8659a3e5b5","title":"were wholly disappointed the industry responds to guardian concrete week","story":"This week  Cities has focused on the huge impact of concrete on the modern world. Here is some of the industry’s responseThis week  Cities is investigating the impact of concrete, revealing the terrible destruction it causes to the planet:• Concrete in cities exacerbates flooding that kills thousands of people every year.• Its dust can be toxic.• It contributes to the heat island effect, raising temperatures in some already dangerously hot cities.• It requires huge amounts of a kind of sand that is short supply, damaging natural environments, and that is mined under often deadly circumstances by “sand mafias”.• If the concrete industry were a country, it would be the third worst emitter of CO2 after China and the US.To round out our coverage, we also published articles about the history of concrete, including its use in Roman times and now in 3D printing its popularity in architecture its social history its use in modern day China and postwar Italy and many of the various alternatives and innovations currently being developed.And we called for engagement and action from the industry.Several industry figures did respond to our coverage.In an email, the Global Cement and Concrete Association said they were “wholly disappointed” not to have been consulted on “the thrust of the articles”. In a statement on their website, the association responded further:’s ‘Concrete Week’ is a great opportunity to look at a range of important issues associated with concrete, and it is right to examine some of the important challenges the world faces. However, inadequately covering the significant work already underway by the sector, as well as underplaying concrete’s critical benefits, gives an incomplete picture.We recognise there are challenges in cement and concrete production and have been working hard over many years to find solutions. There are some important innovations already underway and by collaborating with partners in the built environment we can make an important contribution to reducing global emissions. We are fully committed to continuing to take climate action and to move towards a sustainable future.Concrete’s contribution to society over its whole life should always be considered. It has many important benefits such as its ability to reabsorb CO2 from the atmosphere, as well as its thermal mass properties which means that it can reduce the energy needs of buildings.Only putting across one side of the debate is narrow and fails to address the realities of the needs of a significantly growing global population and increasing urbanisation. Safe homes and buildings, clean water and resilient infrastructure will be needed in the future world – all of which concrete can provide.”Other industry figures tweeted. Several of them claimed that, rather than contributing to climate change, concrete is actually “part of the solution”.Others said they were “disappointed” in us and were “looking forward to positive stories” about concrete.

But any extension of article 50 raises big issues that would take months to sort outFor two long years, Theresa May always insisted that Britain will leave the European Union on 29 March. So determined has she been to deliver Brexit by this self-imposed deadline that she has even had the date written into law. This week, she made an uncharacteristic bow to political reality and accepted that it may not happen after all. This was a pivotal concession and a watershed moment in Britain’s argument about Brexit.Mrs May’s statement on Tuesday should be read with care. It was hedged with conditions. She continues to pursue her original timetable. Her own deal – possibly slightly tweaked from the version that MPs threw out in January – would have to be defeated on 12 March for any delay to Brexit to be triggered. Parliament would also have to vote – again – against leaving the EU with no deal. If both these things happen, and both currently appear likely, the government will then put forward a motion to MPs for “a short limited extension” to the article 50 process. Mrs May made it clear that she will oppose any extension beyond the end of June 2019.The prime minister’s willingness to allow an extension is a welcome development. It had to be forced out of her by some equally welcome tough action by a group of cabinet ministers. But the terms in which she might approach any extension of article 50 remain unrealistic. She needs to be much clearer – with herself and the country – what she would use the extension for.Based on what she said this week, she appears to hope she can use an extension to get yet another variant of her existing deal over the line. But there is very little negotiating space for that. The EU is not willing to change the withdrawal agreement. Her hardline leavers are not willing to bend the knee and accept it. If she sticks to the strategy of making meaningless tweaks to her deal to make it acceptable to hardline leavers, we could arrive at the end of June in exactly the same mess as now. Mrs May therefore needs to recognise another truth. A delay will not mean business as usual. It will mean a rethink. This is why the agriculture minister, George Eustice, resigned over the issue on Thursday.Such a rethink could take several different forms. She could try for a softer Brexit deal, perhaps involving customs and single market alignment along European Free Trade Association terms. She could commit to lock Britain into a customs union. She could offer an early general election in return for votes for a changed deal or accept a second referendum in exchange for support for her deal in the way that Labour appears to be contemplating. She could embark on a deliberative democratic exercise to seek out public consensus.Any of these, or any combination, would involve reaching out to different interests and large changes of approach. That process necessitates new thinking. Mrs May is not a natural new thinker. But there is no alternative to trying. Her existing Brexit policy has failed. It will have to be replaced by a better policy that commands wider support. This will need time. Not unlimited time. But probably more than three months, especially if the outcome is ultimately to be put to the voters in an election or another referendum. All this suggests an extension of at least six months, and maybe more. The lesson of the current impasse is precisely that we cannot again let the clock prevent Britain from sorting Brexit out.Mrs May told MPs this week that no extension can go beyond June because that would mean the UK taking part in the European parliament elections in late May. That would be a problem if the Brexit outcome was settled. But it isn’t – that’s the whole point. Mrs May should get her priorities straight. The elections are awkwardly timed but it is silly not to take part. The priority of getting this national emergency resolved properly is worth the price of having British MEPs in place while it is being sorted.Election campaigning may even be useful at a dark time. Britain is in the midst of a deep national argument about future relations with Europe. Why not open that argument to the people? For once, the European elections might actually be about Europe. Britain should certainly make clear that, if Brexit is agreed, our MEPs would withdraw. In the meantime, Britain loses nothing by taking part. Let’s vote."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f12a385000e77ae123d86398d2932979929d063/0_372_5632_3380/master/5632.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4471d34aa76e903681c6b720a97f0ecd","title":"surge in demand for schools leaves councils struggling to cope","story":"Thousands of pupils in England denied place at their preferred secondary schoolCouncils across England are struggling to keep pace with rising numbers of applications for secondary school, leaving thousands of pupils without a place at any of their preferred schools.More than 600,000 families across England and Wales were told on Friday which secondary school their children would go to in September – but in many areas there was disappointment, with shrinking proportions receiving their first choice.According to some estimates, as many as one in four families did not get their first preference in England. Labour blamed the government policies that took the power to create new schools away from local authorities.The problem appeared most acute in London, the south-east and other big cities such as Bristol and Birmingham, where the twin impacts of the post-2006 baby boom and population inflows have been most keenly felt.Nick Gibb, the schools minister for England, said: “This government is determined to create more choice for parents when it comes to their children’s education and we have created 825,000 school places since 2010, and are on track to see that number rise to a million by 2020.”But Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, said: “In the years ahead, more and more children will miss out on a secondary school place unless we urgently provide new places across the country. The Tories have made it harder for councils to act on their legal obligation to provide new school places, with an inefficient free schools programme making it harder for them to create new places where they are needed.”In Greater London, less than two-thirds of children received their first preference of school as the total number of applications rose again. This year 95,300 requests for places were received by the 33 London boroughs, compared with about 80,000 five years ago."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edcd46c7a7eaa1ab299f781f3381347a3d2688b7/0_49_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64da247208155e1960647ea22b75d3ce","title":"youth climate strikers we are going to change the fate of humanity","story":"Exclusive: Students issue an open letter ahead of global day of action on 15 March, when young people are expected to strike across 50 nations • Read the climate strikers’ letterThe students striking from schools around the world to demand action on climate change have issued an uncompromising open letter stating: “We are going to change the fate of humanity, whether you like it or not.”The Youth Strikes for Climate movement is not centrally organised, so keeping track of the fast growing number of strikes is difficult, but many are registering on FridaysForFuture.org. So far, there are almost 500 events listed to take place on 15 March across 51 countries, making it the biggest strike day so far. Students plan to skip school across Western Europe, from the US to Brazil and Chile, and from Australia to Iran, India and Japan.“For people under 18 in most countries, the only democratic right we have is to demonstrate. We don’t have representation,” said Jonas Kampus, a 17 year old student activist, from near Zurich, Switzerland. “To study for a future that will not exist, that does not make sense.”The letter says: “We are the voiceless future of humanity ... We will not accept a life in fear and devastation. We have the right to live our dreams and hopes.” Kampus helped initiate the letter, which was created collectively via a global coordination group numbering about 150 students, including the first youth climate striker, Sweden’s Greta Thunberg.The strikes have attracted some criticism and Kampus said: “We wanted to define for ourselves why we are striking.” Another member of the coordination group, Anna Taylor, 17, from north London, UK, said: “The importance of the letter is it shows this is now an international movement.Taylor said: “The rapid growth of the movement is showing how important it is and how much young people care. It is vital for our future.” Janine O’Keefe, from FridaysForFuture.org, said: “I’ll be very happy with over 100,000 students striking on 15 March. But I think we might reach even beyond 500,000 students.”Thunberg, now 16 years old and who began the strikes with a solo protest beginning last August, is currently on holiday from school. She was one of about 3,000 student demonstrators in Antwerp, Belgium on Thursday, and joined protesters in Hamburg on Friday morning.In recent days, she has sharply rejected criticism of the strikes from educational authorities, telling the Hong Kong Education Bureau: “We fight for our future. It doesn’t help if we have to fight the adults too.” She also told a critical Australian state education education minister his words “belong in a museum”.In the UK, about Taylor said more than 10,000 students went on strike on 15 February: “I’m anticipating at least double that on 15 March.”The strikes would not end, Taylor said, until “environmental protection is put as politicians’ top priority, over everything else. Young people are cooperating now, but governments are not cooperating anywhere near as much as they should”. She said students were contacting her from new countries every day, including Estonia, Iceland and Uganda in recent days.Kampus, who was invited to meet the Swiss environment minister, Simonetta Sommaruga, on Wednesday, said: “The strikes will stop when there is a clear outline from politicians on how to solve this crisis and a pathway to get there. I could be doing so many other things. But I don’t have time as we have to solve this crisis. My dream is to have a life in peace.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3242255769bd1cdb4e1b0f363f82e9c7263b41da/0_0_6720_4480/master/6720.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d012a258544cdc0a2e453768c2ad8e15 880w","title":"how to work the spring green look in pictures","story":"Emerald, lime and mint are all good to go this season: wear head to toe or pick an accent"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000. Walker, the same age as Taylor and of similar background, found himself confronting a gang of local racists and, after first fighting back, went to extraordinary lengths to fit in and gain their friendship.The film features interviews with Walker looking back 15 years on from the events he describes, which are re-enacted in the locations where they took place, with Kai Francis Lewis playing Walker.Responding to the nomination, Walker said that he was, “humbled and proud. I worked on this film to tell my story and hoped that it would resonate with people.

She arrived at Gare du Nord in time to catch her train from Paris to London, but when she got there, she realised she had left her passport at home. She has just moved, she explains, to a new place in Paris, the city in which she has lived for decades, and nothing is where she expects it to be.“When you move, it’s quite disorienting. You don’t quite know where you are.” Not that she is in any way ruffled by the train fiasco. It is hard to imagine her being ruffled by anything. She needs a minute to put her bags down, she says, as she checks in at the hotel, then I should come up to her room and we can talk. She puts on her sunglasses and disappears into the lift.Rampling is 73, riding the crest of another wave of an extraordinary career. She is in the UK to talk about her latest film, Hannah, in which she plays a woman whose husband goes to prison for an unspecified but clearly terrible crime. We watch as her life begins to crack around her, but largely, that is it. It is so sparse that it makes the gorgeous 45 Years, for which she received her only Oscar nomination in 2016, look as action-packed as an Avengers movie.Hannah’s director, Andrea Pallaoro, had always imagined Rampling in the part, and no wonder. “I think he wanted, more than anything, a presence,” she says. “He thought I was the only actress of my generation that could really hold this character.” There is barely any dialogue, and it goes through the monotony of Hannah’s days in painstaking detail. Everything hangs on Rampling’s face, her familiar heavy eyelids and downturned mouth, showing horrors but not speaking them. With this and 45 Years, she says, she is finally making the kind of films she has always wanted to make.In her hotel room, she pulls an armchair around to face mine, folds her arms, and sits forward, legs apart, as if she means business. She looks out of the window, or off to the side, until she catches a thought, then turns those eyes to look at me. She speaks slowly and thoughtfully, and often pauses as she considers where she’s going with what she’s about to say.She has just returned from Berlin, where she received the Honorary Golden Bear award, a lifetime achievement affair. When she gets something like that, she always wonders if she has really earned it. “My career has been sort of marginal,” she says. “I’ve always thought of it as something that’s not really in the big time.”That may be so, to her mind, but Rampling has been in the public eye since the 60s. She was plucked from the secretarial pool as a teenager by an executive on the floor above who thought she looked pretty and asked her to appear in a Cadbury’s advert. She never quite felt comfortable in that world and thought she wasn’t very good at what she was doing.“It was too show-off for me, acting. It didn’t suit my personality, either,” she says. Nevertheless, she made the most of the swinging excitement in the air. Her breakthrough came as the pregnant and furious Meredith in Georgy Girl. “For a few years there was a wonderful innocence. We had money, we had jobs, people were making a fortune with clothes, and it was as if it was happening by magic, really.”Then, in 1966, when Rampling was 20, her sister, Sarah, killed herself. “After she died, I was obviously looking at life in a very different way. You go more underground, in a sense. You go into a certain form of darkness. You have to, because it’s just so weird, what you’re living, when somebody does what my sister did.” Everything had changed. She travelled to Afghanistan, and lived in a Tibetan monastery for a while. “It wasn’t only me, although my reasons for it were heightened. We were all searching for alternative ways of being and alternative ways of understanding the world we were in, trying to be much more together and spiritual, and less grabbing, less business.” She made a conscious decision not to lose herself in drink or in drugs. “I said: that’s going to send me completely out of my head, where I’ve got to remain in my head and in my body.”It can be easy to look back on Rampling’s career as a series of provocations. She never seems to flinch at sex or nudity. Her most infamous role, in Liliana Cavani’s The Night Porter, about the sadomasochistic relationship between an SS officer and a concentration camp survivor, was received with dismay by many critics, and banned in some countries. Was she trying to be provocative, or seeking out dangerous parts? “I think the danger is within me,” she says. “It’s always provocation, or daring, or wanting to ignite things, or wanting to make things live. Not just to repeat scenes.“Another thing about acting is that I got bored very quickly. I’ve got a very, very restless character … It’s a beast.” Does she know where it comes from? “It’s in my DNA,” she smiles.Depression stopped her working in the late 80s and much of the 90s. “It’s the reverse of you, the depression. You’ve got to start almost from zero, because you’re just dead to the world ... your desire for anything, everything’s gone. You’ve got to build yourself up again.” These days, she keeps a close eye on how she’s feeling. “If you have that form of sensitivity, where you can go up and down quite a lot, you have to be attentive about that. Because coming through a very big depression, you really, really know how to do things for yourself better, so that you can carry on.”On the surface, it seems as if she has been relentlessly busy since she started working again. She even returned to Hollywood, for a part in the TV series Dexter (she stayed at the Chateau Marmont, the most European hotel she could find) and in the Jennifer Lawrence blockbuster Red Sparrow, although she points out that she only had to go to Budapest to shoot it and didn’t set a foot in Los Angeles. Around the time of Red Sparrow, she says, she experienced something new. “I felt this strength I hadn’t ever felt in my life. I’ve been able to surf on that for quite a while. Whether it’s because getting older is easier, I don’t know. But I know that in my case, I had never felt, in that way, strong, capable, able to do it, no problem.”When she picked up the Golden Bear, Rampling said that Hannah and 45 Years were the films she had been working towards, “a coming-home of what I wanted to do in cinema, that form of expressionism. The kind of presence given to a character is what I always wanted to achieve. So I can say now that has happened, and that’s very beautiful.”It has been a long process, she says. “Not that I’ve studied all my work, which I could possibly do when I’m really an old lady, but there’s definitely an essence of it in there, somewhere. It’s a life’s work, in a sense.”It is rare to find a mention of Rampling that does not refer to her credentials as a muse. She has been a muse to François Ozon, who revived her film career in the late 90s, to designer Yves St Laurent and photographers Helmut Newton and Juergen Teller (posing nude for the latter in front of the Mona Lisa), and now to Andrea Pallaoro, too. Given that her career has, in its own right, been extraordinary, I wonder how she feels about the idea of being a muse. “Is it sort of now not acceptable?” she asks. “Are we being used if we’re a muse?” she hams, dragging out the vowels. “I think it’s a question of age, because when you’re much younger, you could be. She says that when Ozon came along, she was in her early 50s, and when Pallaoro sought her out, she was in her late 60s. “When it’s that way around, there’s something very beautiful about it. They just want to film an older woman. Especially for something like Hannah, a woman on the verge of having to handle all these very very difficult situations and emotional challenges.”At the Rotterdam film festival in January, Rampling declined to talk about #MeToo, saying she was wary of being misinterpreted. Does she still feel that way? She takes a moment to think. “What would you want to know?” Given her experience of the industry, from arthouse to Hollywood, from being at the heart of it in the 60s to where she is now, it would be interesting to know what she has made of it all. There is a longer silence. “It’s a vast subject, actually. I’d rather not go there.” Then she appears to be reconsidering. “It’s a very, very important one. I mean, I’m thinking, what would I say? It’s so vast.”In 2016, Rampling was nominated for her first Academy award, best actress, for 45 Years. Around that time, she gave an interview to a French radio station and said that the ersity row over that year’s all-white shortlist was “racist to white people”. It caused an outcry, and she subsequently apologised, saying her comments had been misinterpreted. “I had lost my husband, my companion for 20 years, just three months before,” she says, today. She had been engaged to Jean-Noël Tassez for 18 years he died of cancer in 2015. “There were a lot of interviews going on and I was so unbelievably happy about what was happening with the film, because it was suddenly so loved. I felt supported by it. She was a current affairs journalist, whamming it, and I sort of batted it away. Suddenly, just ...” She claps her hands together. “You know how things come out? I heard myself saying ‘racist’ and I thought: oh fuck, what have I said? Why did I use that word?”Still, she wasn’t aware of the fallout from the interview until a friend texted her about it that evening. She had been, until that point, relatively unaware of social media. “They listen to absolutely everything and there’s a whole group of people who grab, all the Twitters and the Tweeters that do it. They blast you and that was it. It was off.” Eventually, she shut out the news, and stopped reading about it. “Well, it calmed down, but anyway, some people were saying: ‘Oh, you didn’t get the Oscar because of that.’” She shrugs. “If that’s the way it is, that’s the way it is.” She didn’t watch the ceremony this year, because it was on too late, but was pleased that Olivia Colman, with whom she had worked on Broadchurch, won. “She really is a lovely woman. What a trip, I imagine, winning those two prizes. Boy, does she deserve it. She’s the real thing.”Rampling is so known as a woman of mystery, so often defined by her imperious, implacable characters, that I wonder if there is something contradictory in how open she seems to be, outside of her films. “I’m a complete contradiction,” she smiles. “And that, I think, is what saved me. I’ve always been at ease when I’m talking to people, all through my life. I’ve always enjoyed interviews, because I just talk, and if I say a stupid thing, you know, all right. It’s a way of understanding where I am at a given time.”Where are you at this given time? “I don’t know about that,” she bats back. “Because there’ll be a contradiction that comes in.” She is, though, still busy, still working. She is about to go back to Budapest to film a small part in Denis Villeneuve’s take on Dune (“I’m Reverend Mother Mohiam, who initiates Timothee Chalamet”) and then a Danish TV series, about which she can tell me absolutely nothing, other than that it’s in four languages. “It’s a very different story, I mean really chilling.” It sounds very Charlotte Rampling. “You know, I need the thrill of difference,” she says.•Hannah is on general release now"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6ae4ab4012703462379895f29ee7f913e832276/0_1243_4193_2515/master/4193.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab4cbf122a6c432fd77f9eb336123d4b","title":"cocktail recipe whirling dervish tequila pear recipe","story":"A pear-laced twist on the tequila sourYou can use readymade pear puree or homemade: for the latter, peel and core a pear, then blend in a processor with a little sugar syrup, until smooth.

That decision was reached despite Chelsea having released a statement immediately after the game in Budapest last December condemning those who had “shamed the club” and questioning “the brainpower” of anyone who had engaged in the chants, which had been heard in the opening three minutes of the tie and referenced “Yids”.Buck, who has been at the forefront of Chelsea tackling the issue of discrimination, had been asked about Uefa’s decision as he collected a Community Project of the Year award for their “Say No To Antisemitism” programme. “The charge in the first place was a waste of time,” he said. “Almost nothing happened. I really thought they were wasting their time, effort and manpower on something like this and missing some of the big pictures.”Chelsea would have faced a partial closure of their stadium as a minimum sanction had charges been proved. “It is of course hugely important that allegations of discriminatory behaviour are investigated,” said a Chelsea spokesman. “It is a subject this club takes extremely seriously, as evidenced by all of our public statements and our ongoing work and campaigns in this area.“We welcome Uefa’s decision in this case, but our frustration, and the chairman’s frustration which he expressed after the decisions, was that they rushed to charge before conducting a full investigation. Charging early only added to the media furore and speculation around the allegations and possible sanctions.”Kick It Out said in a statement: “Kick It Out will always support football’s governing bodies taking allegations of anti-Semitism seriously, investigating thoroughly and taking action where appropriate - regardless of the number of people alleged to have been involved.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/252a5fb778b5339f27e3d6a74762a4e333aa76dc/0_176_3814_2289/master/3814.jpg?width=645\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6dae930165283e6d2c86793894de42e4 645w","title":"only six countries in the world give women and men equal legal rights","story":"Sweden and France among states found by the World Bank to enshrine gender equality in laws, but implementation haphazardIf you’re a woman and want to be on an equal footing with men, it’s best to live and work in Belgium, Denmark, France, Latvia, Luxembourg or Sweden. The World Bank, which has tracked legal changes for the past decade, found these were the only countries in the world to enshrine gender equality in laws affecting work.The bank’s women, business and the law 2019 report, published this week, measured gender discrimination in 187 countries. It found that, a decade ago, no country gave women and men equal legal rights.The index assessed eight indicators that influence economic decisions women make during their working lives – from freedom of movement to getting a pension – tracking legal blocks to either employment or entrepreneurship. Each country was scored and ranked, with a score of 100 indicating the most equal. Only six were given full marks.Research found that, globally, average scores had risen from 70 to 75. Of the 39 countries with scores of 90 or above, 26 were high-income. Eight were in Europe, including the UK, and central Asia, where parental leave was a key trend. Two, Paraguay and Peru, were in Latin America and the Caribbean. Taiwan was also among them.South Asia had the biggest improvement in average regional score, recording a figure of 58.36 – up from 50 a decade ago. Sub-Saharan Africa increased from 64.04 to 69.63 over the same period, led by progress in Mauritius. Half the changes were related to work and marriage.Countries in the Middle East and North Africa made the least progress, with an average increase of just 2.86, to 47.37.The report was launched by the bank’s interim president, Kristalina Georgieva, who took over from Jim Yong Kim.“Gender equality is a critical component of economic growth,” she said. “Women are half of the world’s population and we have our role to play in creating a more prosperous world. But we won’t succeed in playing it if the laws are holding us back.”The report found that women’s rights advocacy groups had played a key role in driving reforms.This represents a missed opportunity, said Georgieva. The global economy could be enriched by about $160tn (£120tn) if women earned as much as men.“It is clear that giving space to women leads to richer societies,” she says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7164dd5e76fb467c2823b0560936112d06786833/0_184_5843_3506/master/5843.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0286c0a4d8208a77acf62f22430e5d69","title":"treasured island a family adventure on the isle of man","story":"With everything from goat walking and gorge scrambling to sunsets, scallops and Viking kings, the Isle of Man is an outdoor playground, as Rhonda Carrier and family discoveredThe boys are buzzing, grinning from ear to ear I haven’t seen them so excited in ages. I must confess, the grownup half of our family has been dreading the idea of donning wetsuits and clambering through a chilly freshwater gorge. But as we progress upstream through the Isle of Man’s Ballaglass Glen, climbing up rocks and under waterfalls and whizzing down natural slides, we concede it’s one of the best things we’ve done together.I wasn’t expecting the Isle of Man to be such an outdoor playground, but there’s far more to do here than you can fit into a week’s holiday. We choose gorge scrambling because it’s completely new to us, but local firm Adventurous Experiences also runs sea kayaking and coasteering sorties around this green island that’s just a 2hr 45min ferry ride from Liverpool.Getting here is all part of the fun, taking in the sea air from the deck of the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company’s ferry, watching the ports shrink and grow – or, if you’re my kids, watching movies in the cinema room.We pull into the seaside town of Douglas, just a 20-minute drive from our accommodation – Kionslieu Farm Cottages – where the owner, the charming Fiona, has organised a welcome basket of essentials. Arriving there, the kids are in heaven, barely stopping to check out our cosy converted stone barn when there are so many animals to meet, pet and help feed – from chickens and rabbits to goats and horses. They’re even more excited when Fiona invites us to take the goats out for a walk with her.Kionslieu’s location makes it the perfect choice for those exploring this tiny island – no point is more than a 40-minute drive from our cottage. One of the Isle of Man’s main attractions for us, though, is just a 10-minute cycle from the farm: the mountain bike trails of South Barrule Plantation. If you’ve travelled by ferry, you can bring your bikes for free, but if you don’t have your own, high-quality bikes can be pre-ordered and delivered to the farm, along with helmets, from Simpsons \u0026amp Pedal Power Cycles in nearby Peel.Perhaps the best thing about this hilly area, planted with conifers, is the mountain-biking skills zone. Here we have great fun – and all for free – on the brilliant wooden wall rides, jumps and drops. Then we swing by the popular Ape Mann Adventure Park for high-flying treetop rope courses.Other activities beckon snorkel safaris, horse riding, sea-fishing trips and stargazing are just some of the things you can do with the kids on the Isle of Man. But there’s history in spades too. We venture to the coast, 15 minutes north-west of Kionslieu, to explore the dramatic Peel Castle – originally constructed by the wonderfully named Viking king Magnus Barefoot. Here, we follow the spectacular walk around its ruined walls and steps down to the colourful scallop shells of Fenella beach.These scallops are one of the culinary highlights of the Isle of Man. One of the best and most family-friendly places to sample them is the Sound Cafe at the island’s south-west tip, just past the thatched crofters’ cottages of ridiculously scenic Cregneash. This circular stone-and-glass cafe was designed to take full advantage of the glorious views of the sunsets and the seals that bob amid the rocks below. We watch in wonder, feasting on local seafood such as Manx queen scallops cooked with bacon, garlic and lashings of butter.Other favourite eateries during our stay include Ballacregga Corn Mill tearooms – beside the island’s iconic Great Laxey Wheel, the largest working waterwheel in the world – where scallops come as part of a ine fish chowder, and the Creek Inn on the quayside at Peel.Heading back to the ferry at Douglas we also discover hip North Quay, where we have a last treat of piri-piri chicken and milkshakes at the Barbary Coast Grill \u0026amp Bar and stock up on fresh-from-the-oven sourdough bread at Noa Bakehouse. Pulling out of port, kids little and large agree that we’ve hardly scratched the surface of this high-octane island, and that it will be only a matter of time before we’re back onboard the boat to Douglas.The Isle of Man Steam Packet Company has regular ferry sailings from Heysham and Liverpool (Birkenhead during winter) and seasonal sailings from Belfast and Dublin.

But, eventually, restlessness kicks inSnuggled up in bed, my son is squished between me and my partner, my daughter is curled up in a corner, having stolen my pillow, and our big black fluffy cat is purring and walking across the lot of us, searching for an empty spot to lie down in. For 10 whole minutes it’s a blissful, cosy start to the day. Nobody needs to rush to work or school, so we have rare time together to chat and laugh in the dim light of the morning. Then my son’s hungry stomach rumbles, the cat digs his claws into my partner and the magic is broken. It’s still only 6.30am. There’s no rest for the wicked – or parents it seems – so I take my moments of calm where I can.Making a big pot of porridge for the family breakfast feels like instant cosiness at very little cost. Stirring the oats with a wooden spoon is hypnotically soothing and the sound of it bubbling gently, mixed with the enticing smell of warm porridge, gets everyone round the table faster than you can say Goldilocks. Each of us has our own favourite topping – maple syrup, bananas, cinnamon, pumpkin seeds – and we start the day full, warm and happy.For us, cosy Sunday mornings are a lazy affair of reading, drawing and playing board games in our pyjamas. All the usual rules about being tidy and quiet go out the window and my eight-year-old’s Beanos, Michelle Obama’s autobiography and my 10-year-old’s latest Jacqueline Wilson book are strewn around as we compete noisily at Connect 4 and Cluedo. There are happy winners and defiant losers but spirits remain surprisingly high as we all take turns DJing from our Spotify playlists. The morning passes to an eclectic mix of The Greatest Showman, Little Mix and Christine and the Queens.Eventually, restlessness kicks in and we pile on our clothes, boots, hats, scarves and gloves and head outside for a boredom-beating walk. Within minutes the kids have, of course, pulled off their hats, scarves and gloves (they have that enviable childhood power of not feeling the cold), dropped the football they’re carrying and asked if we’re nearly there yet, but we’re all still feeling pretty content as we head for the nearest wide open space. For big walks and dog-watching we go to Hampstead Heath, for a stroll through a farmers’ market we choose Alexandra Palace, or for impressive den-building sticks we head to Highgate Wood. The dens usually start out as half-hearted lean-tos made from a bunch of weedy twigs, but once we all get involved and uncover hefty fallen branches, they transform into Grand Designs-style creations that should probably have planning permission.I’ve learnt the hard way that outdoor family peace depends on having food supplies available at all times. To make sure I don’t end up wasting money on overpriced snacks, I have a flask of hot chocolate and some apples handy in case there are any sudden meltdowns by the kids (or the adults).When the cold finally starts to bite and tiredness creeps up on us, we head off to meet our friends for a pub lunch. Is there anything cosier than walking into a welcoming pub with a roaring fire in the middle of winter? We’re not fans of a formal, heavy Sunday roast instead we’ll share a selection of starters and tuck into something spicy and light for our main course. The children are happy with anything as long as it involves chips. The adults chat and catch up over a bottle of malbec, while the kids muck around and play games on their phones together. It’s a stress-free chance to relax and recharge, then it’s all back to ours for coffee and cake. It’s just the best way to spend quality time with loved ones and fend off any thoughts of Monday’s back-to-work-and-school blues.In the evening, it’s the four of us again, back in our pyjamas and settled down for a movie. The heating’s down low to save on costs and our sofa becomes a nest of cushions and thick, comfy blankets as we get sucked into the world of Fantastic Beasts, Minions or The Incredibles and share a bowl of homemade popcorn.Bedtime for the children comes once they start yawning, and I’ll read them a chapter of Harry Potter or How to Train Your Dragon before tucking them into bed. The lights are low and our voices are quiet, but as we share the adventures of whichever story we’re reading I know that these tranquil moments of togetherness are the ones that will stay with me.Finally, I head for my room and pick something to read from the stack beside my bed. My phone is off, our home is quiet and the cat is back and purring by my feet. It’s the calmest of ends to the cosiest of days.Download the Meerkat app and set up EnergyCheck so you’ll never have to spend time searching for better energy deals again.

We’ll be looking at the psychological cycles of buying, as well as the changes that need to come from government level. We want to gather questions from readers and supporters who are experts in related fields, but also those who have personal experiences or reflections to share. In particular we’re looking for positive solutions-based ideas about how we can improve the situation.Lucy Siegle, MP Mary Creagh, and others will be discussing this issue in our next recording. To share your questions, reflections and ideas with them, please email us at: weneedtotalkabout@… providing your question along with your name, age, and country of residence.The fashion industry is big business. In the UK alone, it was worth £32 billion in 2017. According to consultants McKinsey, the global apparel, fashion and luxury industry outperformed all other market indexes in profitability between 2003 - 2013, “outstripping even high-growth sectors like technology and telecommunications”. It is believed one in six people on the planet work in the fashion supply chain, yet it remains one of the most polluting industries on the planet. In our next podcast, we want to ask: How can the fashion industry as a whole be held accountable, and what role can the government, and we as iniduals, play in improving this growing issue?The UN says that given the growth in global population, by 2050 the equivalent of almost three planets could be required to provide the natural resources needed to sustain current lifestyles. Huge numbers of brands still depend on vastly underpaid workers to make clothing meet consumer demand. In 2013’s Rana Plaza tragedy, a Bangladesh textile factory collapsed, killing 1,134 people, despite warnings over the safety of the structure. It transpired that the building housed five garment factories supplying global fashion brands.In addition to concerns over worker safety, the fashion industry has come under scrutiny for its impact on the environment. During just one washing cycle, a washing machine can leach up to 1000,000 microfibres into our waterways, rivers and oceans, and be consumed by fish, other marine life, and in turn, humans. And clothing is often not recycled – it is believed that Americans dispose of about 12.8m tons of textiles annually. In the UK every year, £140 million worth of used but still wearable clothing (350,000 tonnes) goes to landfill. From an environmental perspective, fast fashion is disastrous.The Green Carpet Challenge (GCC) is one example of how celebrities are using their influence to affect change. This pioneering organisation was founded by Livia Firth and Lucy Siegle in 2010, when Siegle challenged Firth to attend all her red carpet commitments in sustainable clothing. At first she wore ‘ethical’ designers, to the ceremonies, including Orsola de Castro, who designed a dress made out of textile waste for the 2010 Oscars. Now, the business has expanded and the pair work with some of the world’s most famous design houses to help them implement more environmentally responsible business practices.Other prototype solutions that are being trialled include: solar textiles, garments made using biological catalysts which are capable of ‘eating’ plastic, 3D printing for clothes, compostable clothes made from materials such as orange fibre and apple leather, and lab-grown leather. But can any of these offer the practical and long-term solution we need? Is it a case of changing our shopping habits, and buying more second-hand clothes? Or should we be aiming for shifts on a bigger scale? How can we put pressure on fashion houses to implement change? And which is the most promising of the scientific innovations in this area?We look forward to hearing from you!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58130d73275d79049ef5070f76a2a307894ea471/0_691_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6c723d7cc43eccd139bfec8b7a80ae1","title":"lets move to stirling","story":"Once a stronghold of Scotland’s royalty, this historic town is a mighty fine place to liveWhat’s going for it? There’s no getting around Stirling. Well, OK, pedants, these days you can take the M9 or the Kincardine Bridge, or wiggle your way on the A814 along Loch Long. But in times of yore, when Scotland was more like Game Of Thrones’ Westeros, most roads led through Stirling. This is where Scotland’s waist narrows to a few score miles, and is the lowest bridging point on the River Forth. No wonder they built a castle to end all castles, high on a crag, with a sheer, almost impregnable western slope. No wonder this is where Scotland’s royalty held court from the 16th century. “He who holds Stirling holds Scotland,” went the saying. Of course, these days you can take said M9, so Stirling has settled nicely into a comfortable later life as a mighty fine place to live, with half Scotland’s population within an hour’s drive.

His publicist had muddled up the time of our meeting, and I rang up to his hotel room in Knightsbridge a whole hour too early. Previn was in town to conduct the London Symphony Orchestra and his ex-wife, violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter, the soloist in Brahms’ Violin Concerto was with him. “You want to do an interview? You just woke me up!” he snarled down the receiver. I apologised, and he said he’d see me in 15 minutes.When he arrived, hair uncombed and hobbling on a walking stick – “it’s not an affectation, I really do need it,” he said – grumpiness was etched into every pore. We sat in the bar, and things went from bad to worse. A waitress brought him the wrong drink and a fan hoping for an autograph went away empty-handed. And my first question, about how Previn’s background as an émigré Jew had informed his work, tanked. “Nothing to say about that. Next!”But I was aware of his history. The man sitting next to me had worked with Ralph Vaughan Williams and Olivier Messiaen with Oscar Peterson and Ravi Shankar had scored the film version of My Fair Lady, for which he won one of his four Oscars. He had recorded Shostakovich with Leonard Bernstein and Peter Maxwell Davies with Isaac Stern – and had been famously slapped on the cheeks by Eric Morecambe as Ernie Wise looked on in mock horror. I had to get this man to talk.And gradually – very gradually – he began to warm up. Born Andreas Ludwig Priwin on 6 April 1929, his family relocated to Los Angeles in 1941. By 1946, the young Previn was working for MGM Studios as an arranger, composer and occasional conductor. “I can’t pretend it was an awful life,” he reflected. “They hired me because I could do the work and I was cheap. The sun always shone but for my ambitions it was a dead-end street.”Previn explained that nobody was ever precious: “‘Here’s the movie, here’s the scene’, just go away and write the score. I got to conduct my own music for the first time, and I learned how to rehearse very fast, because the musicians were incredible. Even if the music was garbage, it was always played very well.”French conductor Pierre Monteux – famous for leading the premiere of Stravinsky’s Rite of Spring in 1913 – took him under his wing, and soon enough, ambition led Previn towards conducting classical repertoire. “Monteux came to a very early concert of mine,” Previn recalled. “‘Do you think the orchestra played well?’ he asked me after the concert. I nodded. ‘Me too,’ he said, ‘so next time keep out of their way’.”That matter-of-fact professionalism, drilled into Previn during his time in Hollywood, never went away. Not for him the neurosis of tonality versus atonality that kept Bernstein awake all night, or the ideological spats provoked by Pierre Boulez. Previn wanted to make the music work – for it to sound as brilliant, as lyrical or as sonorously rich as the composer intended.We talked through his groundbreaking 1977 recording of Messiaen’s Turangalîla-Symphonie with the LSO, and how, when he first performed the piece with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the musicians had loathed it. “‘What kind of rubbish is this?’ some players asked me, but the LSO came to like it – they were proud of themselves for managing it.”Previn’s period as principal conductor of the LSO, between 1968 and 79, was a golden era indeed for the orchestra, but not everything went to plan. “That record we made with Ravi Shankar was absolute, total, utter shit,” he said “When we got to the recording the studio was crammed full of incense sticks and Shankar was embarrassed because he hadn’t orchestrated it. Somehow we made the record, but I knew it was nonsense. Later, I heard Shankar talking on the radio, and he said it hadn’t been such a wonderful experience. ‘Good for you,’ I thought – it wasn’t so great for me, either.”I asked about composers he enjoyed performing. “Mozart – it’s always been Mozart,” while of his recordings, he said: “I remain extraordinarily proud of the Vaughan Williams symphonies I recorded with the LSO, and in the 1980s and 90s I made an almost complete cycle of orchestral works by Richard Strauss with the Vienna Philharmonic. That was a source of pride for me because that’s really their music.”Another drink, and I ask Previn about his work as a jazz pianist, styled after Art Tatum and Peterson. Did he consider jazz a parallel career to his classical work? “I remember reading an interview with Van Cliburn – who was indeed a very great pianist – and he said that he might try to play some jazz ‘next year’, and I thought, ‘Oh really?’ That infuriated me. I don’t want to consider jazz something you do once in a while.”By now Previn was gregarious, even jolly. The discussion turned to minimalism – “It’s kind of mean music, I prefer a lush sound,” – and a conversation he’d once had with Boulez (“a brilliant man”) about how electronic music could give every note computer-like precision, and from Boulez we moved seamlessly to Morecambe \u0026amp Wise. I told Previn that my favourite line of the sketch – which sent up Eric’s efforts to play the Grieg Piano Concerto – was “for another fiver we could have had Ted Heath”. Previn’s face creased with mirth, and I was pleased to see that the sketch meant as much to him as everybody else. “Eric was very worried that I wasn’t a comedian. He said, ‘If anyone thinks we’re trying to be funny, we’re finished. We must act as though it’s very serious.’ The sketch was scheduled at about five minutes, but when we did it on air it was nearer 10. Eric added bits as he went, like when he slapped my face. To this day, whenever I walk down a street in London someone will shout, ‘Hey, Mr Preview.’ Every single bloody time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/831ad82cc8c7bc4bb88f0587ec37dab9bfab0410/0_678_3280_1968/master/3280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca468a28e03e6c5d01a68386e12ea8c0","title":"morrissey collaborators respond to his politics","story":"The former Smiths singer’s new album features guest spots from Billie Joe Armstrong and Grizzly Bear’s Ed Droste. Are they not put off by his increasingly unpleasant right-wing stance?Given the left-wing values of his former band the Smiths, Morrissey’s embrace of the right over the past decade has been uncomfortable for some fans to stomach. He has expressed support for Nigel Farage, the For Britain leader Anne Marie Waters and EDL founder Tommy Robinson, suggested that London’s muslim mayor Sadiq Khan “cannot talk properly” and labelled Chinese people as “a subspecies”.Morrissey, 59, announced a new album earlier this week: California Son is his first covers album, and will feature protest-themed songs by the likes of Bob Dylan and Buffy Sainte Marie, along with various guest vocalists. Many were surprised to see ostensibly left-leaning artists such as Green Day’s Billie Joe Armstrong, and Ed Droste of cult indie group Grizzly Bear, among those backing the controversial singer.As US music magazine the Fader asked: “What possible reason could any of these people have for lining up behind Morrissey now?”Droste declined to comment. The only artist willing to speak with the  was Canadian vocalist Ariel Engle, who performs with cult indie outfit Broken Social Scene. She received a call from the American producer Joe Chiccarelli asking her to contribute backing vocals for a cover of Joni Mitchell’s Don’t Interrupt the Sorrow. “I thought, ‘Oh the Smiths, sure’,” she says. “It was $500 for two hours’ work.”Engle says she didn’t become aware of Morrissey’s political views until the album was announced and a friend emailed to question her involvement. “It’s a very weak argument to claim ignorance,” she says, “but it is my argument. It’s not an excuse but it happens to be the truth.”Morrissey’s manager, Peter Katsis, says he is unaware of statements made by any guest vocalists, but that the intention of the covers album was supposed to be fun. “This is where his head is at,” he says. “Maybe enough has been said with the last few albums being political.” Of Morrissey’s political views, Katsis says: “I manage his artistic career and sometimes I have to deal with things he says, but it’s not for me to comment.” Chiccarelli echoes Katsis’s sentiment. “I can’t speak to Moz’s politics,” he says. “I’m a record-maker. I’ve known him 10 years and he’s been a gentleman and a pleasure. I consider him a friend.” When asked about the far-right figures for whom Morrissey has expressed support, Chiccarelli says: “I’d really have to research it and see if it crossed a particular line for me.”Engle says that learning of Morrissey’s political opinions has left a “bad taste”, and that she stands in opposition to his views. “The inflammatory things he says are not my politics. I think he’s completely out of line. I grew up around multiculturalism and I am the product of multiculturalism and immigration. I feel like I’ve been had, but it’s my fault.”The American singer LP offered a statement through a PR representative: “As I’m a huge fan of his music and poetry, I was honoured to be asked to collaborate on the album.” Representatives for Lydia Night of California band the Regrettes offered no comment, but the 18-year-old told punk magazine Kerrang!: “I’ve grown up loving the Smiths – my cat’s name is Morrissey!” Representatives for Armstrong said he was in the studio and therefore unreachable. The guest stars on California Son are all North American, suggesting a difference between perceptions of the former Smiths frontman in the US and UK. Katsis, who is American, sees the critical focus on Morrissey’s politics as a British preoccupation.“I don’t think they know enough about it to care about it,” he says of Morrissey’s US fans. “I don’t feel knowledgable enough to comment on British politics, therefore it’s probably not as important to me or the international fans as it is to UK fans. This whole thing has had me perplexed. The subjects are very complicated and iding.”The figures bear out Morrissey’s enduring support across the Atlantic. He ended 2018 with arena shows in North and South America, and has announced his first Canadian tour in 20 years for this April. In November 2017, Los Angeles City Council declared 10 November “Morrissey Day”.“In America, he tends to be seen as the rock star who sang about queer life and spoke openly about feminism when nobody else did,” says Rolling Stone critic Rob Sheffield. “These two images define him, and he’s still seen in terms of his pioneering place in history. His grumpy old age is not really held against him. Americans tend not to follow UK politics very closely, so when he makes mind-blowingly offensive statements there might be outrage or humiliation for a few days, or hours, but then it’s back to listening to The Queen Is Dead”.Despite the headlines provoked by Morrissey’s every political pronouncement, the same may remain true in the UK. Penguin confirmed that Morrissey’s autobiography – titled Autobiography – has sold more than 200,000 copies, and continues to sell. In 2017, his album Low in High School entered the UK Top 5 and was the highest-selling vinyl record in its week of release. California Son is currently at No 7 in Amazon’s pre-order chart.There have been visible protests against the singer. “The backlash against him has been particularly strong in Manchester,” says author Dave Haslam, who organised an anti-racism party to coincide with Morrissey’s scheduled shows in his home city last July, “in response to Morrissey’s isive views, and his support for the far right”. The gigs were then postponed due to “logistical circumstances” that the singer’s management insist were not linked to the protests.But one prominent UK concert promoter says such controversies are still unlikely to have a significant impact on the star’s pulling power. “There’s always going to be demand for him. There are plenty of people willing to see past accusations, perhaps looking at things through rose-tinted glasses and able to take a more lenient stance because of their affections towards him.”Some British fans remain conflicted. “I listened to Bona Drag just this morning,” said one who wished to remain anonymous. “But I sold my Morrissey T-shirts, and I’ve taken down the framed posters and put them on eBay. It’s hard to switch off my feelings for him and the music, but I’m embarrassed by him. When I bought Low in High School, I joked in the record shop about taking it away in a brown paper bag.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a560dffd9e5f30818eceea0960fac955c3bdebaf/0_121_5105_3062/master/5105.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=433dec13629644f11199c1906e5a06e3","title":"hard brexit tories a party within a party","story":"’s Dan Sabbagh and Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan explore whether the European Research Group is as influential as ever - or has it overplayed its hand on Brexit?

I have not seen anything in writing at all. And there is no drafting going on.”A second EU diplomat offered a more optimistic reading. “Barnier seemed to think that the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, at least offered a more realistic position, brainstorming to find something that was within the EU’s red lines,” the source said.The Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, and the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, were expected back in Brussels on Tuesday for further negotiations.At the meeting of ambassadors on Friday morning, the 27 member states agreed that the length of a delay to Brexit would depend on the reason given by the prime minister.The EU is examining a range of options should the UK make a formal request for an extension, with the potential length ranging between two and 21 months.But legal experts have advised the German parliament that any Brexit delay beyond the European elections on 23-26 May could be in breach of EU law and leave the UK open to legal action, according to a confidential report seen by Die Welt.The newspaper said the Bundestag’s European law experts had concluded that even the “short, limited” two- or three-month extension to article 50 beyond 29 March promised to MPs by  May if they again vote down her Brexit deal could prove problematic.“Failure by the UK to hold European parliament elections in the event of an agreed extension of the negotiation deadline under article 50 raises deep concerns regarding the right of citizens to vote and stand, as well as … possible legal consequences,” Die Welt quoted the advice as saying.If the UK does not take part in the European elections while it is still officially a member of the bloc, “British nationals resident in the UK would be denied a core set of rights giving them EU citizenship status,” the advice said. This would amount to “a violation of the active and passive voting rights of British nationals”.The EU27 will insist that any Brexit delay is a one-off, senior EU diplomats said after May suggested this week that she would seek an article 50 extension if parliament again rejects her deal in mid-March to allow further time for negotiations.Other EU sources have warned that failure to take part in the elections risks the UK hurtling into “guaranteed no deal” at the end of June if MPs fail to finally back a Brexit agreement at the end of a short extension period.A three-month extension of article 50 to the end of June, coupled with missing the May elections, would make it legally impossible for the UK to continue as a member state, official sources said. The new parliament begins its work on 2 July."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1bb8acc960cf11d3618ab97e72496b63a4ba8236/0_24_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d751265b508dcac4a91c7deb1d6b2fb","title":"chuka umunna i never felt totally comfortable in the labour party","story":"Exclusive: Streatham MP says decision to breakaway and form TIG, ‘hugely liberating’Chuka Umunna, who quit Labour last week to form the breakaway Independent Group, has said he never felt “comfortable” in his old party – and found his mixed cultural and class background were “a chain round my neck”.One of eight Labour MPs who joined the Independent Group (TIG), citing antisemitism and Jeremy Corbyn’s handling of Brexit, the Streatham MP said the decision to leave behind what he called a “culture of fear” in the Labour party had been “hugely liberating”.“If truth be told, certainly culturally, I never felt totally comfortable in the Labour party, because I’ve never really been a massively tribal politician,” he told the , as he reflected on what he called the “roller-coaster ride” of the past fortnight, in his Westminster office.“I have quite a different background from a lot of people in the Labour party – I’m of mixed heritage,” he said. “My father was a black, working-class man who arrived here with no money in his pocket from Nigeria my mum came from more of a middle-class background, whose father had prosecuted the Nazis at Nuremberg. We have a really rich and erse heritage in my family – but I sometimes felt it was a bit of a chain round my neck in the Labour party if truth be told.”He added that when he briefly stood for the party leadership in 2015, before withdrawing, he was warned that being of BAME background could count against him.“The team who were helping me organise, were told by quite a few MPs that they weren’t going to support me, because they didn’t think their working-class constituents would ever vote for a black man – and I was quite taken aback by it,” he says, adding that his new TIG colleagues are more representative of modern Britain.Umunna only joined Labour in the 1990s, after the reforms initiated by Tony Blair, and said perhaps the period up to 2010, when Ed Miliband took over, was a historic aberration, and his old party had now reverted to type.“Maybe what we’ve seen happen in the Labour party since the late 1990s and through to 2010, was actually exceptional, and wasn’t what the Labour party really is?”The eleven MPs – eight Labour and three Conservatives – who make up TIG are not yet a political party, don’t have a set of formal policies, and admit that previous attempts to break the mould of British politics have not met with unalloyed success.But Umunna hailed Jeremy Corbyn’s cautious shift towards support for a second referendum on Monday as evidence the group had already made an impact.“I don’t believe it would have happened, were it not for our resignations. We appear to have had more influence on Labour’s Brexit policy out of the party than we ever had while we were in it,” he says, with a smile – although he still doubts whether Corbyn will whip his MPs to support a referendum.“The key test is, will the leader be able to ensure that at the very least, frontbenchers won’t be able to block a people’s vote from happening?” he says.Asked about the progress of the Brexit debate over the past two-and-a-half years, Umunna is fiercely critical of what he claims is the refusal of some Labour MPs to confront their constituents about the effects of immigration.“I recognise the challenges – and admittedly I represent a different area – but you can either lie, and say, ‘I agree with you that immigration is the cause of our problems’, which I think is fundamentally dishonest or you can try and engage with them, and resolve the anxieties and concerns and don’t duck the cultural issues.”Many MPs across both main parties concluded from the result of the Brexit referendum in 2016 that voters would like to see an end to unfettered free movement of people from the European Union.And some Labour MPs have rejected softer forms of Brexit, such as a Norway-style deal, because they would not allow the government to control who comes to work in Britain from the EU.Umunna says that when he hears the argument, “Oh, my constituents are telling me that the reason we have challenges in this community is because of immigrants, and I’m not sure I totally agree with that but I’ve got to roll with that”, it makes him wonder how the same politicians would have responded to previous waves of migration.“I just think, what the hell would you have said in the 1970s when my father came? Would you have been defending him, and many of the people who came from the West Indies, Asia and Africa? Or would you have been saying the same thing: ‘My constituents are saying that these brown and black people are the cause of our problems, so I’ve just got to run with it’?”.In his own south London patch, he says, there are “more acute social problems – substance abuse, domestic violence, housing shortages and so on, than many of the areas that voted to leave. But we just didn’t believe that voting to leave the European Union was going to solve those problems”.Umunna brushes off the idea that he and his new ex-Conservative allies will struggle to unite around a set of policies, insisting that the old left-right ide is rapidly being supplanted by others.“Your age, your academic qualifications, where you live in the country, whether you have a nationalistic or an internationalist view of the world. Whether you’re socially liberal or conservative. These factors are driving people’s voting behaviour more than ever,” he says. He describes what unites them as a “radical centrist” agenda.And he says the leadership’s response to the quitters has only reinforced their sense that they have done the right thing.“The points that we were making about the arid, aggressive, bullying culture within the party has been underlined by the reaction of a number of people to the departures that there have been – Emily Thornberry with her ongoing leadership campaign claiming that we will be ‘crushed’, Lloyd Russell-Moyle, calling us scabs, and other such reactions,” he says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/433585d4847ca08cb26f7c707b476c119a8eb280/0_86_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e1a0cf8895c0c15e1805167171d3cf7","title":"us seeks greater access to uk food markets after brexit trade deal","story":"US sets out aims for post-Brexit trade deal amid fears about chicken and beef standardsThe US has outlined its objectives for a post-Brexit trade deal with the UK, demanding greater access to the food markets where products such as chlorinated chicken or hormone-fed beef are banned under EU rules.The US laid out its aims for a trade deal to cut tariff and non-tariff barriers for US industrial and agricultural goods and reduce regulatory differences.The Trump administration is seeking to eliminate or reduce barriers for US agricultural products and secure duty-free access for industrial goods.It was also looking to remove “unwarranted barriers” related to “sanitary and phytosanitary” standards in the farm industry, something that would put it at loggerheads with the UK environment secretary, Michael Gove, who has repeatedly said British food standards will remain the same if not be better than they currently are.The US has long considered EU rules on food a barrier to trade and has said fears that its food is unsafe to eat because of differences in production rules – including use of pesticides, chlorine and hormones – were unjustified.The National Farmers’ Union (NFU) said it was not surprised that the US would be pushing for a trade deal that accepted its production standards and practices.The NFU president, Minette Batters, said: “It is imperative that any future trade deals, including a possible deal with the USA, do not allow the imports of food produced to lower standards than those required of British farmers.“British people value and demand the high standards of animal welfare, environmental protection and food safety that our own farmers adhere to. These world-leading standards must not be sacrificed in the pursuit of reaching rushed trade deals.”While the outline objectives are merely the opening gambit in trade talks, they indicate the many hurdles to the quick deal promised by Brexiters.The Eurosceptic Jacob Rees-Mogg told Sky News the publication of the outline objectives was a “positive first step” to a deal with the US which would be “good for UK consumers as it would open markets to greater competition”.He said: “It is encouraging that the US wants to move quickly and has made the first move before we have left.”A change in food standards after Brexit would have ramifications for an open border in Ireland as it would fuel fears that banned goods could seep into the food chain through cross-border production of meat and dairy products.Apart from differences of regulation in relation to the use of chlorine to wash chicken and the use of hormones in the rearing of cattle, US officials have also recently spoken about barriers in pork production.Gove has held firm on his position that the UK would not compromise on food standards. He has in the past expressed concern about antibiotics used for livestock and bee-harming pesticides, neonicotinoids, used on grain that goes into breakfast cereals and other consumer foods.The US is also seeking commitments from the UK to establish “state-of-the-art” rules to ensure cross-border data flows and not to impose customs duties on digital products.It wants guarantees on currency as well, with rules to “ensure that the UK avoids manipulating exchange rates in order to prevent effective balance of payments adjustment or to gain an unfair competitive advantage”.A Department for International Trade spokesperson said: “Negotiating an ambitious free-trade agreement with the US that maintains our high standards for businesses, workers and consumers is a priority.“So we welcome the US government publishing their objectives, which demonstrates their commitment to beginning talks as soon as possible.“As part of our open and transparent approach to negotiations, we will publish our own negotiating objectives in due course.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aee8af6c3b3459dbc062795f649595229a55e963/0_412_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e070f4ecc544ab343a5a96faa35bf84","title":"brexit latest news theresa may faces further backlash over decision to give mps vote on extending article 50 politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happenThat’s all from me for today.Thanks for the comments.And, while we are on Brexit, here are two columns published today that should be read by anyone who thinks that Jeremy Corbyn’s decision to embrace a second referendum means there is a good chance of one actually happening.Jeremy Corbyn’s decision to commit Labour to backing a second referendum is a bit like Corbyn committing to giving you a million pounds out of his own pocket. It’s a lovely idea but it falls down for one important reason: Corbyn does not have a million pounds lying around to spare, and he cannot create a parliamentary majority to stop Brexit.So why has he promised to do it? Well, just as if Corbyn promised to give you a million pounds you would probably like him more, it comes down to the question of Labour’s electoral viability. Labour is not looking in as healthy a position as it once was , for a variety of reasons. In England, it is being menaced by the creation of a new party, the Independent Group, and in Scotland and Wales it faces losing votes and seats to the two nations’ pro-EU and pro-independence parties, the SNP and Plaid Cymru. So the important question about Corbyn’s Brexit position is not “what does it mean for Brexit?” (a question to which the answer is “nothing at all whatsoever”). The important question is “will it make Labour more popular and see off the threat of TIG, SNP and Plaid Cymru?”Ever since the referendum result upended British politics, it has been claimed by many that Labour is in possession of a big shiny Stop Brexit button that it is spitefully refusing to press. This theory is about to meet its nemesis: political reality. When the amendment falls, there will undoubtedly be relentless attempts to blame Labour, that it didn’t whip hard enough. But such claims will be based in cynicism rather than truth.Yet there remains a political dilemma for Labour’s leadership. It needs to maintain the support of – and win more – economically leftist leave voters, whose voices are rarely heard on social media, but who are nonetheless numerous. After supporting this referendum it will have to tell them: look, we tried to make this work, we resisted relentless pressure for three years, we even endured a split, but the Tories’ disastrous mismanagement of Brexit left us with no option.And it is torn in another direction, too. One of the most striking political phenomena of the last three years is that while the “Stop Brexit” campaigns have failed to win over leave voters in any decisive number, they have succeeded in making existing remain voters more angry about Brexit than they were the morning after the referendum result ...Labour has to lovebomb those remain voters, too, emphasising the political chasm that exists between it and a Tory party increasingly dominated by the Rees-Mogg tendency. As well as speaking to the BBC (see 1.37pm), Nick Timothy, Theresa May’s most influential policy adviser until he resigned after the 2017 general election, has also given an interview to Channel 4 News. In it, he said that May should have been more robust in her dealings with the EU. Arguing that the UK had made mistakes in the Brexit talks, he said:Some of it is to do with negotiating style. Theresa was always of the view that the best way to get something out of negotiations, especially in Europe, is to consistently show goodwill and not descend into some of the name-calling and game-playing that sometimes takes place. I think her goodwill has sometimes been pocketed without Britain getting much in return.Timothy also said May thought that the main advantage of Brexit would be that it would allow the UK to control immigration.Theresa’s instincts have been that economically, this is a risk to be managed, but politically this is an opportunity and that main opportunity is to recover control of immigration. If you look at it like that, then you see why the deal she has negotiated actually makes sense and is potentially - according to those objectives - something of a success. But I think that for those of us who see it in much broader sovereignty terms and also see that there are economic opportunities - as well as undoubted risks to be managed - it doesn’t seem quite so successful.The Financial Times’ Alan Beattie has a good Twitter thread on the the US trade deal objectives. (See 10.54am.) It starts here.The National Farmers’ Union has said that any UK-US trade deal must not lead to a lowering of standards in Britain. Responding to the release in Washington of a document setting out the US priorities for a deal (see 10.54am), the NFU president Minette Batters said in a statement:It comes as no surprise that the USA is seeking comprehensive access to the UK’s agricultural market and is pushing for a trade deal that accepts US production standards and practices.The NFU has been very clear on this point. It is imperative that any future trade deals, including a possible deal with the USA, do not allow the imports of food produced to lower standards than those required of British farmers.British people value and demand the high standards of animal welfare, environmental protection and food safety that our own farmers adhere to. These world-leading standards must not be sacrificed in the pursuit of reaching rushed trade deals. We should not accept trade deals which allow food to be imported into this country produced in ways which would be illegal here.This is from my colleague Daniel Boffey in Brussels.The BBC has broadcast extracts from an interview with Nick Timothy, Theresa May’s former co chief of staff and her most influential policy adviser until he resigned after the 2017 general election. In it Timothy, a Brexiter who wrote the speeches in which May rejected a soft Brexit early in her premiership, criticises his former boss for not recognising the “economic opportunities” of leaving the EU. He says:I think one of the reasons we are where we are, is that many ministers - and I would include Theresa in this - struggled to see any economic upside to Brexit. They see it as a damage limitation exercise.The People’s Vote campaign, which wants a second referendum, has published its assessment of the US demands for a trade deal. (See 10.54am.) Rather than focus on the threat to agriculture, it is highlighting a single line in the document under the heading “Procedural fairness for pharmaceuticals and medical devices” which says a US negotiating objective will be to:Seek standards to ensure that government regulatory reimbursement regimes are transparent, provide procedural fairness, are nondiscriminatory, and provide full market access for US productsPeople’s Vote says this means Washington wants to remove rules that limit what American drug companies can charge the NHS. In a statement put out by the campaign, the Labour MP Jo Stevens said:Donald Trump’s administration has now made it clear just what it will be demanding from the UK in return for a trade deal - and one of those things is that we let big US companies run riot in the NHS.One demand of the US is that the NHS pay more to US drug companies and that that US drug companies, the very corporations that have caused the opioids crisis in their home countries through reckless marketing and pressure on doctors, get full access to the NHS – long a demand from US mega-lobbyists in the pay of Big Pharma.The People’s Vote analysis also claims that the US document shows it wants to end restrictions on the personal data being sent to the US, and that it wants to allow the resale of industrial goods in the UK that are currently banned as waste. This could lead to items that contain materials like asbestos being put on the market, People’s Vote claims.The SNP says Washington’s demands for a UK-US trade deal (see 10.54am) could cause lasting damaging to farming and the food and drink industry in Scotland. In a statement issued by the party, Gail Ross MSP said:The US government’s trade demands couldn’t be clearer – they want the UK to leave the door wide open to produce like chlorinated chicken and hormone-injected beef. Not only does that raise questions over health issues given that these products are currently banned by the EU, it is also a direct threat to Scotland’s world class food and drink sector. The Tories have repeatedly failed to ensure that Brexit will not put Scotland’s high-quality food and environmental standards at risk.And if they now give in to Donald Trump’s bargain basement demands, as seems likely, the Tory government runs the risk of causing long-lasting damage to our world-renowned agricultural and farming industries, and our food and drink sector.That reputation could be smashed to pieces if the Tories desperately succumb to every one of the US’s demands. This morning’s Downing Street lobby briefing was dominated by questions about the performance of Chris Grayling, after the beleaguered minister’s department agreed to pay out to ensure the Channel Tunnel is ready to continue to keep passengers and freight moving in a no-deal Brexit scenario. A Downing Street spokesman insisted that the prime minister continued to have confidence in the transport secretary, despite the payout, citing progress he had made on Heathrow development and with rail investment as successes for the minister.Downing Street was also forced to defend Grayling’s time as justice secretary, following a critical report by the National Audit Office into the part-privatisation of the probation service, and said that while his successor David Gauke had been forced to bring back the contracts in-house, 40,000 low and medium risk offenders were now being monitored after release from prison in a way they had not been before.A key plank of Theresa May’s “hostile environment” immigration policy has been declared incompatible with human rights law in a damning ruling handed down at the high court, Amelia Hill and Diane Taylor report. The controversial Right to Rent scheme forces private landlords to check the immigration status of tenants and potential tenants. Unlimited fines or even a prison sentence can be levied under the policy to any landlord who rents to undocumented migrants. In a robust judgement, Mr Justice Spencer said the much-criticised policy was unlawful because it caused landlords to discriminate against British citizens from minority ethnic backgrounds and against foreign nationals who have a legal right to rent.Here is the full story.Tim Farron, the former Lib Dem leader, says the US document setting out its priorities for a trade deal with the UK (see 10.54am) shows the “duplicity” of leave campaigners. In a statement released by the anti-Brexit group Best for Britain, Farron said:This shows the duplicity of Leave campaigners. Only last week Michael Gove told the National Farmers’ Union that farmers would be protected by tariffs after Brexit.Now it’s clear that the US won’t allow that in a trade deal and wants to flood us with chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-pumped beef. But the British people won’t be force-fed low quality products or a bad Brexit deal. That’s why we need a public vote.Labour is calling for Chris Grayling’s resignation in the light of the government’s £33m settlement in the Eurotunnel case. Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, said:On the same day a National Audit Office report highlights that disastrous decisions by Chris Grayling at the Ministry of Justice have wasted nearly half a billion pounds of public money we also learn that the transport secretary’s misjudgement over the award of a ferry contract has left taxpayer’s liable for £33m in compensation to Eurotunnel.This follows a damning public accounts committee report on Wednesday on his mismanagement of the railways.His conduct as a minister is one of serial failure and routine incompetence. In any other sphere of life he would have been sacked long ago. I say yet again: this trail of destruction has gone on long enough. It’s time for Chris Grayling to go.Here is my colleague Lisa O’Carroll’s story on the government settlement with Eurotunnel. (See 10.43am.)And here is how it starts.The government has settled a high court case over the Brexit ferry fiasco, after reaching an agreement worth up to £33m with Eurotunnel which was suing it following the award of a contract to a company with no ships.The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, said in a statement: “The agreement with Eurotunnel secures the government’s additional freight capacity, helping ensure that the NHS has essential medicines in the event of a no-deal Brexit.”Eurotunnel was suing after Grayling awarded a contract for a ferry service to Seaborne Freight from the disused port of Ramsgate. Two other companies, DFDS and Brittany Ferries, were awarded contracts worth £108m.Washington has confirmed that it wants any UK-US trade deal to remove any barriers to American agricultural produce being sold in Britain. The Office of the US trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, has set out the demand in a 15-page paper (pdf) setting out the Trump administration’s negotiating objectives for a trade deal.Agriculture is likely to be a flashpoint because the prospect of chlorine-washed chicken (allowed in the US, but banned in the EU) arriving on British shelves has already triggered considerable controversy. It is unusual for a trade policy issue to resonate with the media in the way the chlorinated chicken row has. But in practice it is just one of many areas where differences between US agricultural standards and EU standards could lead to the UK having to make uncomfortable compromises if it wants a trade deal with Washington.The objectives included in the US paper include:Secure comprehensive market access for US agricultural goods in the UK by reducing or eliminating tariffsEstablish a mechanism to remove expeditiously unwarranted barriers that block the export of US food and agricultural products in order to obtain more open, equitable, and reciprocal market access.My colleague Lisa O’Carroll has the full story here.Eurotunnel has withdrawn its legal claim against the Department for Transport over post-Brexit ferry contracts after reaching an agreement worth up to £33m, the government said today. In his Today interview Dominic Raab, the former Brexit secretary, also accused the EU of being “dishonourable” in its handling of the Brexit negotiations and of trying to “bully” the UK.Referring to George Eustice’s resignation letter yesterday, in which Eustice said “I do not believe that the commission has behaved honourably during these negotiations”, Raab said:George Eustice referred to, frankly, the dishonourable way that they have tried to bully us and shove us around, and it is time for us to stand up and show some mettle, as a government and as a country ...It is very clear that they have used the Northern Ireland protocol and backstop as a means of trying to press on the sensitive issue of Northern Ireland, with all the sensitivities around that, in order effectively to try and lock us into a range of their laws, really just to undercut our competitiveness ...I think trying to use Northern Ireland, given the history of that conflict, given the secessionist tendencies in other European countries, in order to put pressure on us in the way that they have, no, I don’t think that’s right. And, frankly, I don’t think it’s right from the point of view of European unity and solidarity. In response, the SNP MP Joanna Cherry said Raab’s accusation was “disgraceful”.And here is an assessment from Anand Menon, director of the UK in a Changing Europe academic project. He thinks Raab is wrong about the EU’s motives. On Tuesday night, when just 20 Tory Brexiters voted against the amendment backing the plan to allow MPs a possible vote on extending article 50 (although dozens more abstained), it looked as though the Conservative rebellion against Theresa May’s plan had been contained. But then, yesterday, George Eustice resigned as fisheries minister because he could not support the move he had voted for less than 24 hours earlier. And this morning there is evidence that the backlash against May’s decision to agree a possible vote to extend article 50 is growing. On the Today programme Dominic Raab, the former Brexit secretary (he resigned in November because he opposed the PM’s deal) and one of the many Tories interested in succeeding her as leader, said that he was “strongly against” delaying Brexit and that talking about an article 50 extension sent the “wrong message” to Brussels.Raab, who did not vote in the ision on Tuesday on the article 50 extension amendment, explained: Now we need to stand firm. And I think the point of George Eustice’s resignation ... is that suggesting to the EU that we might delay Brexit, or take no deal off the table, weakens the negotiating leverage in delivering the very aims that the government has set out. And that is what I think is so frustrating ...The issue with delay is at this point in time it weakens our leverage - why would the EU make concessions now? The chances of a deal get that bit slimmer because they are less likely to compromise ...If we have a delay ... the question is what are the challenges that we face now that will get easier after that. I think all our of problems get more difficult. So I’m strongly against any delay, and I think from the EU’s point of view it signals to them that actually their intransigence pays off, and that’s the wrong message for the UK to be sending to Brussels at this moment.When asked if he thought a no-deal Brexit would be better than delay, he replied “absolutely” - echoing the line adopted yesterday by Boris Johnson, the former foreign secretary (who also resigned because he was opposed to May’s Brexit plan, but four months ahead of Raab).I will post more from the Raab interview shortly.The Commons is not sitting today and the political diary looks fairly empty.

If the recipients do not follow strict advice to limit their calorie intake, the coaches tell them they need to be punished – in some cases asking them to send nude pictures. found at least 71 pro-anorexia groups with a combined total of more than 2,000 members operating under easily searchable terms. On joining the groups, people are asked to give their age, height, current weight and goal weight.This comes despite community guidelines for the app saying self-harm, eating disorders or suicide should not be shown or promoted.Dr Louise Theodosiou, of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, described the findings as “extremely concerning”.Luciana Berger, the MP for Liverpool Wavertree, said: “It is incredibly disturbing that users of Kik are able to exploit and manipulate vulnerable young people in this way.“The government’s announcement that they intend to introduce new legislation to compel social media companies to remove content that encourages suicide and self-harm earlier this month is welcome, but well overdue. It also does not go far enough.” revealed this month that there has been a big rise in hospital admissions for eating disorders in the past year, prompting concern from experts about a growing crisis of young people experiencing anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa.Figures show year-on-year rises in hospital visits, with admission numbers more than doubling from 7,260 in 2010-11 to 16,023 in the year to April 2018. The latest figure is up from 13,885 the year before – the highest rise in eight years.One woman who has an eating disorder, and worked with an anorexia coach on Kik, said she was asked to send naked pictures when she did not meet her calorie limit for the day. “If you deviate from a diet plan they would demand you send naked pictures of yourself as punishment,” she said.She added that she felt most of the coaches were men. “They ask for photographs of any food you eat and say you also have to ask permission to do anything, such as exercise.”One of the people who appears to be a male coach running a group has been on Kik for more than three years. Another user has been on for more than four months and is an admin of multiple groups.A main attraction of Kik that differentiates it from other messaging apps is its anonymity. The Canada-based app, which was founded in 2009 and claims 300m accounts worldwide, says users who feel unsafe should report content to them. “Kik is being used to promote eating disorders and contains pro-anorexia groups despite the platform’s community guidelines which prohibit such activity,” said Jennifer Grygiel, a social media expert and assistant professor of communications at Syracuse University.The app has come under fire in the past for its approach to extremist groups who have used the platform. Chief constable Simon Bailey, the child protection lead for the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC), said last year that Kik was prone to abuse by paedophiles after the number of UK child abuse reports relating to the service quadrupled in the last two and a half years.Charities and experts recently called on Instagram to crack down on images of eating disorders in the same way the app was planning to do with graphic self-harm images, as part of a series of changes made in response to the death of the British teenager Molly Russell. A spokesperson for the eating disorder charity Beat said: “So-called ‘pro-ana’ and ‘pro-mia’ content is widespread on social media and can be very harmful for people suffering from an eating disorder. People will not develop an eating disorder by being exposed to content that glamorises eating disorders, but research shows that such content helps perpetuate the illnesses for people who are already suffering.” A spokesperson for Kik said: “We take online safety very seriously, and we’re constantly assessing and improving our trust and safety measures … We encourage users to report content that they believe violates the Kik Terms of Service and Community Standards. Users are also able to block other users they no longer wish to chat with, or ignore chats from people that they don’t know.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7db2dd7c6b13e42a801e6b40d6d4d4899e87607/0_103_4955_2973/master/4955.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f72de933f93c694575ee6dbe32c884d1","title":"amy jones england cricket","story":"Being back-up to the best wicketkeeper in the world must be a tricky business. When you do get a chance to take the gloves, you know that it will be only for a short while, that the No 1 will be back soon.Amy Jones is in exactly that situation. With the three one-day internationals against India completed, Sarah Taylor will fly home as she continues to manage her anxiety problems, which means Jones will keep in the Twenty20 matches, then for another six fixtures when the team move on to Sri Lanka later this month. One way to deal with it would be to just accept your position, know that usurping Taylor is virtually impossible. That is not the way Jones is approaching it.“It’s not something I’ve shied away from. I’ve always known that if I’m going to be the first-choice keeper I’ve got to be good. Now that I’ve been at a good standard for a few years I can push her to improve and we can see how good we can get.”Jones has not just been running drinks and pining for the gloves over the past couple of weeks. She is established at the top of the order, opening (despite enduring a sticky tour so far) against India but some keeper-batters see taking the gloves as a badge of honour, that their status is somehow diminished if they do not do both jobs.That is not the case for Jones, although the 25-year-old “can see how you could think like that”, and these days she does not think keeping has a particularly significant impact on her batting.“When I was younger I used to really think if I wasn’t keeping there would be more pressure on the batting,” she says, emphasising that even if she is not behind the stumps, she can still contribute significantly. “I think now how the game has evolved with fielding, you can really impact on the game that way. I still have two strings to my bow, even if I’m not keeping.”These games will be the first T20 internationals England have played since the desperately disappointing end to the T20 World Cup in the West Indies, where they reached the final but were easily swept aside by Australia. Jones’s 92-run partnership with Nat Sciver won the semi-final against India but in the big one only Danni Wyatt and Heather Knight reached double figures. Australia cantered home with 29 balls to spare.“We watched it and reviewed our batting the other week, which was horrible,” Jones says. “There’s lots of learning there and it will only make us stronger.”On a personal level the tournament was another example of Jones having a clear run batting at the top of the order and keeping wicket. “I’ve been to a lot of World Cups running drinks and playing the odd game, so it was brilliant to know I had a run and had a regular role. I loved it.“In an ideal world everyone would play at their best without knowing whether they were playing in the next game or not but psychologically going into a tournament knowing you’re the first-choice keeper and batting at the top of the order – it eases the pressure. Knowing you have the backing of the coach and the people around you, it does just allow you to play with freedom.”There are some big challenges ahead: these games against a strong India, the Ashes in the summer, then another T20 World Cup next year. And for the next month or so, Jones has the chance to prove she is not just a stand-in."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/242cbec944b0d5022eca154b97f81ee68ea9b0eb/30_397_2954_1772/master/2954.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a742ce33dfcf0871b09e0b2e85b2b31b","title":"malcolm brogdon interview milwaukee bucks nba","story":"The guard has helped his team to the best record in the NBA. He talks to Donald McRae about race, Giannis Antetokounmpo and his drive to fight povertyIt’s still winter in America, with downtown Milwaukee lined by banks of dirty snow, but there is sunshine in this room. Donald Trump remains in office, as anger and disillusion festers, but Malcolm Brogdon defies these downbeat days. Fiery eloquence and hope pour out of the NBA’s 2017 Rookie of the Year who plays for the most exciting basketball team in America. The Milwaukee Bucks lead the Eastern Conference and have the best record in the league.Giannis Antetokounmpo, a 6ft 11in Greek immigrant of Nigerian descent, is the Bucks’ exhilarating star who now bears comparison with LeBron James and Steph Curry. But Brogdon is the steady heart of this young team. Antetokounmpo is called the Greek Freak while Brogdon’s stately nickname is The President. Having come late to the pro ranks after completing his post-graduate degree, the 26-year-old talks with the resolve of a man destined for more important matters than his current drive to help the Bucks become NBA champions for only the second time in their five-decade history – and the first since a young Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was in their fold.“It speaks to America as a whole,” Brogdon says as he considers the perennial question of race in a country where Trump sits in the White House. “We’ve elected someone who allows hatred and racism to continue and, in some way, supports it. It was shocking when we put him in office but having him there has allowed everyone to see what people in the country really feel. Now we can rebuild the country properly. It’s about electing someone that unites people and supports progressive ideas. We no longer need a president who tries to destroy people.”Brogdon, a quietly impassioned orator, pauses. “It’s ironic because, while Trump tries to break people down and tear them apart, he’s brought so many of us together. This is especially true for the black community. One of our main problems is that, after the Civil Rights movement, black people did not look after each other. But having Trump in office has brought us together.”An hour-long conversation with Brogdon is very different to a routine sports interview. I am struck by the cool intelligence and defiant optimism that surges through him and can understand why a superstar like Antetokounmpo has stressed his teammate’s nickname is not a joke – but echoes a belief among the Bucks that they could have a giant of a man in their midst.Brogdon takes a difficult subject such as racism and turns it over to find something new to say. “It builds mental toughness. It builds character. It builds identity. From a young age you figure out I can be a smart, articulate, educated black man and still identify as an African American. I’m named after Malcolm X and Malcolm always said: ‘If you don’t have education then you have no future.’ My parents are huge Malcolm X fans and raised me according to his guidelines.His father, Mitchell, is a lawyer, while Brogdon’s mother, Jann Adams, is the former chair of the psychology department at Atlanta’s Morehouse College, among the most famous of America’s historically black colleges and universities. She is now the associate dean of the science and maths department. “I was lucky I had a mom who had seen it all. From seeing my grandfather march in the Civil Rights era, she understood the depth, character and stability you need to go through racism. She taught me not to accept it to but deal with it, and be better than it. My mom grew up in Waco, Texas, when the KKK was still prominent. She remembers them burning crosses in the front yard. The racism was palpable every day.”Brogdon tells me the remarkable story of how his parents made the decision, when he and his two brothers were still young, to move the family out of a middle-class neighbourhood. “We moved into inner-city Atlanta. It was a developing neighbourhood but it was lower income. It was one of the best moves my parents ever made. It was a conscious decision on their part to make sure we grew up with an understanding of what other people had to go through.”His parents also took their boys to Africa, on a three-week trip to Ghana where, instead of a vacation, they worked in day-care and maternity centres. While playing soccer with barefoot local kids, Brogdon realised how fortunate his family were in comparison to most people. “I have great memories from childhood. Of course the orce, when I was 11, was tough. But my mom, especially, did a great job in raising us. She rooted us in black environments while situating us in private school. We tasted both sides.”There was a basketball court just behind Brogdon’s backyard in Atlanta and his face lights up at a surreal memory. “We had crackheads, all types of users, coming by the court. We befriended all of them. They would come play with us. My mom saw no danger. She thought it was a great environment for us to learn how to be with different people. They knew our names, we knew their names. We had fun every day.As a kid did Brogdon believe a career in the NBA was impossible? “My parents never planted the seed that anything was impossible. They planted the seed that things were doubly hard for a black man. My brothers and I made sure we outworked people and were better than everyone we were around.”Brogdon smiles. “Anyway, I really wanted to play professional soccer. I loved Arsenal and Thierry Henry. Soccer is still my favourite sport. I was a striker – like Henry. But things changed when I got to the ninth grade. My brother was always playing basketball and I wanted to be more like him. I wanted to be around more black people.”It does not sound like an isolated incident. “There were multiple teams. But it’s not disheartening. It’s empowering and a chance for me to break the mould for younger black athletes get their degree, their master’s, and come into the NBA and shock the world.”The Bucks have been inspiring on court. At their new arena, the stunning Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, I saw them demolish the Dallas Mavericks. With Antetokounmpo and Brogdon in full flow, it’s easy to imagine the Bucks facing the Golden State Warriors, the imperious champions, in June’s NBA finals.He laughs when asked what it’s like to play with Antetokounmpo. “Giannis does so many amazing things on the floor. A lot of time you just watch him play – like the fans. Sometimes you just have to get out of the way, and let him do his thing. For six or seven minutes, long stretches, he dominates. There are times when he needs support but Giannis attracts so much attention that often all you have to do is stand on the perimeter and shoot at the ring – or cut to the basket and score a lay off. He makes the game easy for us.”Peter Feigin, the Bucks’ charismatic president, is a New Yorker who offended many locals in 2016 when he said Milwaukee is “the most segregated and racist place” he had known. Was Brogdon surprised? “Not at all. Before I came to Milwaukee I’d heard the city was the most segregated in the country. I’d heard it was racist. When I got here it was extremely segregated. I’ve never lived in a city this segregated. Milwaukee’s very behind in terms of being progressive. There are things that need to change rapidly.”Is this an opportunity to change Milwaukee? “Absolutely. Leadership and change starts from the top down – with our owners being progressive. They encourage players that also want to be forward thinking. For them to support Peter Feigin is a big sign and encourages us to do the same. To speak out for what is good and right.”Is Milwaukee, agog with the brilliance of the Greek Freak and teammates like Brogdon, already changing? “It’s amazing how sports is a way to control the masses. But it also unites people. When you have a team on the rise, with a player like Giannis, it brings the city together. The owners, and Peter Feigin, have trademarked the team as something the city can really get behind as a progressive unit.”Before he won Rookie of the Year, Brogdon persuaded the Bucks to ert all the money they had earmarked for his campaign to charity. “I thought my play would speak for itself and all the money put into that should go to something more important. The award is superficial. It’s more important to give back when you can.”Brodgon’s master’s thesis was on the necessity for clean water in rural South Africa. “When I first went to Africa, aged 11, it was the trip of a lifetime. It ignited a fire in me. I saw people less privileged than me. But they were still happy – even if they didn’t have clean water. They didn’t have food to eat. They were starving to death. From then on I wanted to make a change.Brogdon is the founder of Hoop2o which, last October, he and four other NBA players launched to help people benefit from clean water in Tanzania. By late January they had raised $125,000 and built two wells which now provide water to 11,000 people. Brogdon also works with the NFL player Chris Long, who started Waterboys – an initiative that funds 55 wells and provides clean water to 210,000 people in Africa. Their aim is for their wells to reach a million people – as a child in Africa dies every 90 seconds from a water-related disease.“Clean water allows little girls traveling miles to school to get an education,” he adds. “It allows them not to be eaten by animals when they’re trying to get water.”Brogdon and Long went to college in Charlottesville where, in August 2017, members of the far-right marched with burning torches and chanted “You will not replace us” and the Nazi slogan “Blood and soil”. A car ploughed into a crowd of counter-protestors and a woman was killed.“That’s not my experience of Charlottesville,” Brogdon says, “but it was a powerful reminder of racism and prejudice. I see the news, I read, and there’s so much hatred and violence.”Trump initially refused to comment on Charlottesville – and when he did speak the President praised the “many fine people on both sides”. Despite the constant accusations swirling around Trump, many Americans believe he will be re-elected. “It’s very realistic,” Brogdon says of that bleak possibility. “It’s very discouraging. But the focus has to be on getting the minorities, especially African Americans, voting. We have a history of not voting. But people died for our right to vote. We must get out and vote and change the outcome of these future elections.”What will Brodgon be doing in 10 years? “I’ll be finding something that will impact people’s lives. I’d like to stay in the non-profit sector whether it’s clean water or fighting poverty. I have a passion for Africa and I would love to continue to use my resources to help others.”Is politics too dirty a business? “No, it’s not too dirty. There are good people in politics that are doing great work. But is a business where there is dirt. If I want to get into that I have to be ready to take on every aspect – including politicking. It’s similar to the NBA. You have to fight for what you want. I need to decide if I want another career like that because, by that time, I’ll have kids. But it’s possible.”How did his presidential nickname arise? “That came up when President Obama was in office. People said I spoke like him and looked like him. I was articulate and had my master’s degree. People started to call me The President.”Brogdon, who will surely do even more in life than chase down an NBA championship in Milwaukee, smiles when asked if he likes his nickname. “I love it – as long as you know the context. We need context for everything.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88b0be9a20a33cc7fb7c5eb555655c6df4ff70cb/0_334_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d3b741149e36944f76b82d0ba8758b73","title":"pacific island players vote possible rugby union world cup boycott","story":"Leading players from Fiji, Samoa and Tonga will vote on whether to boycott the 2019 World Cup in a remarkable response to World Rugby’s controversial proposal to omit the Pacific Island nations from its planned annual competition.In a move that could throw this year’s tournament into unprecedented chaos, the representative body Pacific Rugby Players Welfare (PRPW) is canvassing its 600 members – including England’s Samoa-born centre Manu Tuilagi – over a potential “legitimate player protest” in response to World Rugby’s “calamitous” plan.The threat comes after details of World Rugby’s latest proposal became public on Thursday and were greeted with uproar for its attempts to exile the Pacific Island nations. The proposed World League would consist of 12 teams – the Six Nations and Rugby Championship as well as Japan and the USA, excluding Fiji, Samoa and Tonga for financial reasons – and start as soon as 2020. There are also fears the World League would not include promotion or relegation, signalling “the death of Pacific Island rugby” according to another representative body, Pacific Rugby Players. As result, both organisations are calling on the unions of Fiji, Samoa and Tonga to join them in taking action.Amid widespread condemnation for what the Rugby Football Union described as an “undercooked” proposal, World Rugby sought to play down reports of the Pacific Islands snub. The vice-chairman, Agustín Pichot, insisted he was in favour of promotion and relegation – the inference being that the Six Nations are not – but regardless, Leo believes plans for the new league must be stopped.“This would be a disaster for the Pacific Island nations, and for any nation omitted from the top 12 teams,” Leo said. “Even if promotion and relegation were involved, all that would happen would be that the top teams would pull away from the rest.”The threat of a World Cup boycott comes after leading players from around the world joined forces with International Rugby Players to condemn World Rugby’s proposal. The England captain Owen Farrell, New Zealand captain Kieran Read and world player of the year Johnny Sexton were among those to voice fierce criticism over concerns that the World League was “money-driven” and showed scant regard for player welfare.The proposed league would culminate in semi-finals and a final, meaning five Tests in consecutive weeks for some players. Farrell said: “Players are open to discussing a new global season, but what we develop has to work with the club game in order to reduce conflict, deal with player release issues and make sure their welfare is looked after. The proposal doesn’t seem to have considered this properly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8355e2681330903b7b00614977875a7d911ee693/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d6704717b4f9334b56ab89f84715a3f","title":"mwc 2019 folding wrist phones 5g and quintuple cameras 8 standout gadgets","story":"Also unveiled in Barcelona: Microsoft’s Hololens 2 and phones with folding screensThe annual mobile technology jamboree in Barcelona has revealed the latest exciting developments that will feature in phones, tablets and watches over the next 12 months. From folding handsets and ultra-sophisticated cameras to brick-like smartphones with a very long battery life – here are eight of the most notable products from Mobile World Congress 2019 this week.Annoyed with your phone’s battery not lasting a day? What if you could have a phone that lasted a full week? That’s the idea behind Energizer’s Power Max P18K Pop.Looking more like a phone strapped to a brick, it has a humongous 18,000mAh battery that’s almost seven times the size of the one in the iPhone XS. It has a 6.2in screen, runs on the latest Android software and will cost €599 in the summer. Whether you’ll be able to squeeze it into a pocket remains to be seen.Move over 4G, the 5G network is coming later this year. Unlike previous jumps in mobile phone network technology, the handsets are already here, with almost every manufacturer launching a version of their top-end phones with 5G capability.With much higher capacity, super-quick speeds and ultra-low latency (the time it takes for your phone to contact the internet and get a reply), 5G promises to be the enabler for all sorts of things, from self-driving cars and all sorts of smart devices to high-resolution movies downloaded in seconds.With the first 5G areas expected to go live in the UK in the summer, it will be some time before everyone can try it out. But you have to start somewhere.What if your phone could unfold to be the size of a tablet? That’s the basic idea behind Samsung’s Galaxy Fold, which was the first phone with a foldable screen to be launched by a big manufacturer. Samsung put a smaller 4.6in screen on the outside and a bigger 7.3in screen on the inside that opens out like a book for watching videos, browsing the web or multitasking with three apps on the go simultaneously.It will be available in the US in April and in Europe the following month. The only catch? It will cost $1,980 (£1,500). Or about twice the cost of its new Galaxy S10+. Ouch.Not to be outdone, the Chinese smartphone giant Huawei had a foldable phone on show at MWC, too. But where Samsung’s had the screen on the inside, the Mate X looked even more futuristic, with the foldable screen wrapped around the outside.When shut it has a 6.6in screen on the front and a 6.38in screen on the back. Turn it over and it swaps the screen from the front to the back of the device, for taking selfies or similar. Unfold the screen outwards and you’re left with one large 8in display ready to go. It has cameras on one side and is 5G-capable.Huawei said it will be available in the summer for €2,299 (£1,975). No one said pushing boundaries was going to be cheap.If you like the idea of having a phone that unfolds with a bigger screen but aren’t sold on the idea of a bendable screen, LG has the answer: slap your phone in a case that also contains another phone screen on the inside.The new top-of-the-range LG V50 ThinQ has a case accessory called the Dual Screen, which attaches to the phone to double the display. It is far from seamless, with a big hinge in the middle, but you can use one screen for your email with a keyboard on the other, or one can be turned into a games controller. Not quite as revolutionary as a folding screen but at least you can take it off when the novelty wears thin.Holding your phone in your hand is so last century. If the Nubia Alpha is anything to go by, we’ll all be wearing our phones around our wrists. It may look like a sci-fi electronic tag but the 4in flexible display wraps around your wrist like a snap-band with a camera mounted on the front.It can be activated by touch or even mid-air hand gestures, while users can take calls on it, send messages, shoot photos and watch films on it. Available in April from €449.Forget virtual reality. The future is mixed or augmented reality, according to the tech giants. Think of what Arnold Schwarzenegger’s character sees in the Terminator film: information overlaid on your real view of the world, albeit via a set of glasses. Microsoft’s Hololens 2 is the latest iteration, now with a larger field of view and more comfortable to wear, even if the helmet-like product is quite chunky.Users have a virtual display floating in their vision, such as a map of wires and pipes behind a wall about to be subject to your DIY, or instructions on how to fix your your bike, leaving your hands free to do the work. That’s the pitch to businesses – who are the target customers. A consumer version will have to wait for smaller glasses that don’t cost $3,500 a piece.The days of only having one camera on your phone – or maybe even two - are dead. Now it’s five or bust. Or so says Nokia, with its new 9 PureView smartphone, which has five separate 12-megapixel cameras mounted in an array on the back alongside a flash and a depth-sensor.Nokia says the system collects up to 10 times the amount of light normally captured by one camera. Instagram influencers will take note. Expected to go on sale for around £550 in March."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05839fc1ad502740ed5e5fe33d6247c43f8c2cc6/0_216_4057_2434/master/4057.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ecd146c8bbbbd9925a53c12050d20a7","title":"private firm defends school factsheet on momo hoax","story":"Charities say parental guidance about scary-doll challenges may have worsened issueA private company that provides schools with internet safety material has insisted it behaved responsibility by issuing factsheets on the Momo challenge hoax, despite concerns it may have exacerbated the panic surrounding the issue.National Online Safety produced a factsheet entitled “What parents need to know about Momo”, which many UK schools sent home with children.The guidance offered straightforward advice on internet safety but also quoted media reports about the Momo challenge in which a “scary doll-like figure reportedly sends graphic violent images, and asks users to partake in dangerous challenges like waking up at random hours and has even been associated with self-harm”.Children’s charities have said well-intentioned warnings from schools about a seemingly non-existent threat may have inadvertently caused young people to be genuinely scared by what was previously a hoax. Some copycat videos have started to emerge, with YouTube removing adverts from any videos mentioning the topic.National Online Safety is a private company based in Scunthorpe that sells training services to schools and parents on how to be safe online.Schools are increasingly buying such resources, often due to a lack of in-house knowledge, raising questions about who is providing the guidance and why it is being left to the private sector.Teachers have said the regulator, Ofsted, will penalise schools who fail to teach children about online risks but that there is no central government guidance on which internet threats they should take seriously.“We’re fighting a losing battle on safeguarding because we can’t keep up with the technological changes,” said one assistant headteacher at a south London primary. He said his school had decided against warning parents about the Momo challenge and this may have played a role in ensuring there was no outbreak of the panic among its pupils.Many of the claims in the factsheet were sourced to reports on the BBC and newspaper websites, including articles which have since been retracted for including false information.“We noticed a lack of information for parents and we had no choice but to respond. We did so by producing a guide for parents and carers which is balanced. If that has enabled conversations between parents and children about online safety and led to more monitoring of children’s online activities then that is a good thing.”Julie McCulloch, the director of policy at the Association of School and College Leaders, said it was understandable that teachers turned to outside providers: “One of the benefits of the digital age is that schools are readily able to access a wide range of sources to support lessons and provide information. It saves time and resources, and allows them to utilise external expertise and advice.”“The downside is that in a fast-moving environment of rolling news and social media, information which is produced and utilised in good faith may not turn out to be as reliable as it first seemed. The Momo hoax reminds us all to be sceptical about a phenomenon which suddenly goes viral.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/716c3a6c78b435d213cc65f413275c259a0905d9/0_246_7301_4382/master/7301.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b00bc26267b3b157b8cbab85cf801a6","title":"tip a great beach cafe or bar in europe for a chance to win a 200 hotel voucher","story":"Good food and drink can set a beach venue apart from the rest, especially if there’s a cool view.

The few exceptions to this rule are in mainly gender-stereotypical jobs, such as infirmière (nurse) or nourrice (childminder).But to widespread surprise, the academy this week voted by an overwhelming majority to approve a report compiled by three of its five female members that recommended ending its centuries-old official ban on feminising the names of professions and trades.“The académie has shown a marvellous spirit of openness,” said Dominique Bona, one of the report’s authors. “It has shown it is sensitive to the fact that women are thinking about the definition of their jobs. It will now tolerate feminisations that have long been banned.”Members of the academy, which was established in 1635 under Louis XIII, last objected to the feminisation of job titles in 2014, rendering gramatically incorrect the title that the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, insisted on being called, Madame la Maire (as opposed to the authorised Madame le Maire).This week’s report marked a minor revolution in the academy’s traditionally prescriptive approach. There would, it said, be no attempt to set fixed rules on how titles should be feminised, this being an “insurmountable task”. Instead, the academy was prepared to allow usage to evolve organically.Many titles could be easily feminised, the report noted, simply by adding a silent “e”. Others were more problematic: adding an “e” to médecin (doctor) risked confusion with médecine (the science of medicine).And some will doubtless prove a downright headache: should a female boss (chef), for example, be a chèfe, a cheffesse, a cheftaine or even a chève? Years of thoroughly agreeable debate await."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da70fc332cbef5d811ec418d88bbc14cd0d69670/0_227_3264_1958/master/3264.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dfd000c8166edcbda8619074a0ec396e","title":"are women more generous than men upside weekly report","story":"This week female readers piled in to offer books, toys and money to Yazidi women trying to turn their lives aroundFirstly, a big thank you.

But the “restaurant” is actually a classroom at Konan primary school in central Japan, where the pupils need only the gentlest encouragement to eat their greens.When the  visited the school in the Pacific coastal city of Fukuroi, the classroom, momentarily transformed into a lunchtime cafeteria, reverberated to a chorus of “Itadakimasu” – a polite Japanese term for “let’s eat”.On the menu today is baked cod, sautéed sweet corn and bok choy, minestrone soup, a small carton of milk and, as a Friday treat, a slightly less wholesome combination of white bread with a soy-based chocolate “cream” – a challenge to spread evenly on the bread with chopsticks.The portions are modest, but then so is the total calorie count – 667 kcal for a meal that will sustain the 11-year-old children until they get home.Konan is not the only school in Japan producing a range of lunches – or kyushoku – that combine flavour with fresh ingredients and contain levels of iron, calcium and fibre stipulated by a government-run programme for children attending kindergarten through to the end of junior high school.The kyushoku system was introduced in the 1950s to ensure that children did not have experience the dietary privations of the immediate postwar years. More than seven decades on, the programme is credited with contributing to Japan’s impressive life expectancy, and child and adult obesity levels that are among the lowest in the OECD group of nations.Local officials refer to their school meals as the healthiest in a country with one of the healthiest cuisines in the world. It is no empty boast: last year Fukuroi won a World Health Organization best practice award for promoting healthy dietary habits among schoolchildren, with the help of local producers.The city’s school lunch centres prepare and send out more than 10,000 lunches to kindergartens, primary and junior high schools every day. Most of the meals are inspired by Japanese cuisine, with the occasional inclusion of Chinese, Korean and European dishes. Parents pay ¥250 (£1.70) a meal, about half of what they cost to make, with the local government contributing the rest.“We devise the monthly menu so that there is something different every day,” says Koji Ishizuka, the manager of the school lunch ision at the city’s board of education. “And each month differs depending on what’s in season.”In 2005, the government took its school lunch programme a step further by requiring school boards to educate children about the provenance and composition of their lunches.As the children at Konan tuck into lunch, Mihoko Kobayashi, one of two nutrition educators in Fukuroi, tells them where the bok choy they are eating was grown and why, despite clear reservations among some pupils, they should eat every last morsel.“Please remember that a lot of people were involved in preparing your lunch,” she says. “Especially when you come across a vegetable you think you won’t like.”The bok choy converts have Toshiyuki Suzuki to thank for a portion of their lunch. The local farmer sends 4 tonnes of the leafy vegetable to Fukuroi schools every year. “Freshness is absolutely essential,” he says. “The vegetables I sell commercially have to go through a distribution system, but I sell directly to schools, so the vegetables the kids are eating are the freshest around.”“Children generally acquire their long-term eating habits by the time they’re 10, so that’s why we think school lunches are so important,” says Ishizuka. “The results of regular health checks on the children are generally good, and we believe school lunches have something to do with that.”Dr Atsushi Miyawaki, a health policy specialist at Tokyo University’s graduate school of medicine, says removing choice from the menu and banning packed lunches are the “most remarkable” features of the programme.“It offers a uniform menu to all children in each school five days a week, unlike the cafeteria-style school lunches often found in the US and UK,” Miyawaki says. “That means the children have no choice regarding menu items, or whether to eat school lunch or bring it from home.“That helps avoid an imbalance in nutritional intakes. And the lack of choice can help hide disparities in the children’s socioeconomic background that may be evident in packed lunches.”The lunch monitors load trays of empty plates on to trolleys and wheel them to the kitchen while their classmates file out to complete the final task of their day’s food education: brushing their teeth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17059a68dc9fea310fcbe4b8c7dd6805625fd928/212_0_4363_2619/master/4363.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14183f4a2c63d1fc825cdee25daba751","title":"bike country n0 1 dutch electric record numbers e bikes netherlands","story":"E-bikes now outsell standard bicycles in Netherlands, with quality prized more than price In what was already a long-running purple patch for the Dutch cycle industry, domestic sales records have been broken in the last 12 months despite spiralling prices, as technological developments push the standard push-bike into the annals of history.The Dutch love affair with the bicycle is well chronicled – there are 22.5m of them in a country of 17 million people – but has moved up a level, according to a study by the RAI Vereniging, an organisation representing the automotive and cycling sector.Asked whether rising prices would begin to put the Dutch public off the two-wheeled mode of transport, RAI’s Floris Liebrand said: “Not in the Netherlands. It is in our culture, in our blood.“We are bike country No 1 in the world so we are used to investing in innovative bikes so there is difference there compared with other countries, including the UK.“For us it quite normal to spend €1,000 on a bike. An average for an e-bike is over €2,000 but that is in our culture. We believe in the quality of our products. There are e-bikes of €700 or €900 but they are from south-east Asia and the quality is lower.”The buoyant sales are partly being put down to the good weather of the summer of 2018.But Liebrand said there had been a change in the Dutch mindset as electric bikes have moved on from being seen as the choice of older people. “In the future we will not talk about e-bikes, but just bikes,” he said. “E-bikes will be the new normal, I think, within 10 to 15 years. We think that all bikes will be supported by small engines.The RAI Vereniging is pushing for an increase in investment before provincial elections on 20 March."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5984563305efdcfe3a36c8dd61f1a915f23d5863/0_343_5140_3084/master/5140.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ec1af342bd4e6616e8db287e5c8da8e","title":"canada boreal forest toilet paper us climate change impact report","story":"Major brands’ refusal to use sustainable materials is having a devastating impact on forests and climate, new report saysWe’re all becoming more aware about the damage single-use plastics and fast fashion has on the environment. Yet there is one product we all throw away every single day that, so far, has not been a major part of conversations about sustainability: toilet paper.But America’s heavy use of toilet paper – particularly the pillowy soft kind – is worsening climate change and taking “a dramatic and irreversible toll” on forests, especially the Canadian boreal forest, according to a new report by two major environmental groups, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and Stand.earth.Major toilet paper brands have refused to use more sustainable materials, the report says, because Americans tend to more concerned than the rest of the world about ideal toilet paper texture in their homes, largely due to decades of marketing around toilet paper softness.Previous reports into the environmental impact of toilet paper have found American desire for super-soft multi-ply toilet paper to be “worse than Hummers” for the environment.Fortunately, we are unlikely to have to resort to such measures. Not all toilet paper is equally damaging and many manufacturers are already making more environmentally friendly products using recycled materials.The authors offer a scorecard system to rate the brands that have the biggest environmental impact. It’s mostly the big brands of quilted paper that score badly, with Charmin Ultra Soft, Kirkland Signature and Angel Soft all receiving F grades because they contain little or no recycled material. Brands that use recycled paper, such as Seventh Generation and Natural Value, received an A grade.Notably they say that “recycled materials are more commonly used in away-from-home tissue brands, like those found at offices or airports, where marketing for softness is less crucial”.

Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireIn a doorstep with journalists and later when speaking at an Alliance Party dinner on Saturday, Mr Varadkar spoke of the necessity to be an “honest broker” when dealing with Northern Ireland politics.Speaking at the Alliance dinner in the Stormont Hotel Mr Varadkar said Fine Gael wanted to be able speak with and work with all parties as an honest broker.“We want to be able to talk to parties in confidence and without fear or favour. I don’t think you can really do that if you have a privileged relationship with one party over the others,” he said.“We’ve all witnessed the dynamic created by the Conservative party’s Agreement with the DUP,” he added.“We need to be wise to the possibility that a similar dynamic could arise were Fianna Fáil to be in Government in Dublin given its partnership with the SDLP.”Mr Varadkar said Fine Gael had established and resourced a Northern Ireland Engagement Group to “work with people who consider themselves to be British or Irish and the growing numbers who feel that they are and can be both”.Conservative comparisonsAsked earlier by reporters in Belfast did he believe that the British government was being impartial considering its arrangement with the DUP, in order to remain in power, Mr Varadkar said his view was that governments should try to be “honest brokers and impartial when it comes to dealing with the political parties in Northern Ireland – to work with everyone”.He said the Conservatives-DUP confidence and supply agreement had created a new dynamic.“Whether it’s true or not some people certainly perceive that it means that the British government listens more to the DUP than to other parties,” he said.He said Fianna Fáil had created a “similar partnership” with the SDLP and that “could create a similar dynamic were they to re-enter Government south of the Border”.“My view is that we should try to speak to all parties and be an honest broker. But I particularly want to reach out to the centre ground,” he added.Asked did he consider the Fianna Fáil-SDLP partnership as unhelpful to North-South relations Mr Varadkar said the Belfast Agreement required governments to be impartial. “That does not mean not taking positions but it does mean treating political parties with parity of esteem”.He said Fine Gael wanted to work with all parties and would not be entering into any such partnerships, at least certainly “not in the foreseeable future anyway”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3811492.1551467594!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"may tells irish americans she ll uphold good friday agreement","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t‘No Government that I lead will ever take risks with the hard won relative peace and stability’ created by the Good Friday agreement, Theresa May has said. File photograph: GettyBritish Prime Minister Theresa May has written to a group of prominent Irish-Americans underlining the British government’s commitment to upholding the Good Friday agreement. In a letter seen by The , Mrs May highlighted the government’s commitment to the 1998 accord. “The agreement, along with its successors, has been the bedrock of the significant progress that has been made in Northern Ireland over the past two decades,” she wrote. “No Government that I lead will ever take risks with the hard won relative peace and stability that these agreements have established.”Her letter was a response to a letter written by more than forty representatives of the Irish community in the United States to Mrs May and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar last month in which they warned of the perils posed by Brexit to peace in Northern Ireland and the Good Friday agreement. Representatives of the group will meet Northern Ireland secretary Karen Bradley later this month when she visits Washington DC during the week of St Patrick’s Day week. They also met with Britain’s deputy ambassador to the United States this week in the US capital.Speaking on Friday, James Walsh, the co-chair of the ad hoc committee of Irish Americans, established to highlight the concerns of Irish-America as Britain prepares to leave the European Union, said he welcomed the prime minister’s affirmation of the importance of the Good Friday agreement in the letter. “As she notes in her letter the Good Friday agreement has been the ‘bedrock’ for peace and economic prosperity in Northern Ireland in the last 20 years,” he said. “We will work closely with the British and Irish governments and with our many friends in the US Congress to continue to sustain the Agreement.” The development comes as the White House issued a statement on Friday celebrating Irish-American heritage month to mark the “indispensable contributions Irish Americans have made to every chapter of our Nation’s history”.“Generations of Irish immigrants have carried to our shores character, culture, and values that continue to play pivotal roles in the strength and success of America,” the official White House statement said. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar is due to travel to Washington to meet President Donald Trump later this month for the annual shamrock ceremony in the White House during a crucial week for Brexit as a series of votes are scheduled to take place in the House of Commons. His visit will take place against a backdrop of heightened concern among Irish-Americans on Capitol Hill about the impact of Brexit on the Northern Ireland peace process. Some senior members of Congress have also said that no return to a hard border is a precondition for their support for a future US-UK trade agreement."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3810324.1551384136!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"local radio layoffs continue to loom for real life alan partridges","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Steve Coogan as Alan Partridge: Dozens of presenters on commercial local radio stations  are to lose their jobs, with hundreds more at risk. Photograph: Andy SeymourBBCPALike most British television comedy, This Time with Alan Partridge is anything but funny, it is\u0026nbspa weary half-hour of obvious, laboured and inevitable gags. This didn’t prevent its first episode from winning an audience of more than three million and five-star reviews from critics, enraptured by what one described as Steve Coogan’s “tortured monster of insecurity and discontent”.Coogan’s creation occupies a special place in the hierarchy of humour in Britain, a country where people will still recite Monty Python’s Dead Parrot sketch almost 50 years after it was first aired. Classic television comedy like Alan Partridge and Fawlty Towers can generate in Britain, more than anywhere else, what Emile Durkheim described as “collective effervescence”, an exalted sense of shared identity.In the new series, Partridge has a job as\u0026nbspa presenter on a dismal local radio station but is standing in for the co-presenter on a parody of BBC’s The One Show. Coogan said Brexit made it feel right to bring back Partridge, whose prejudices are just what London audiences associate with those who voted Leave in 2016.The series opened the same week as Britain’s real-life Partridges, presenters on commercial local radio stations, heard that dozens are about to lose their jobs with hundreds more at risk. Global Radio announced that it would replace more than 40 local breakfast shows on its Capital, Smooth and Heart networks with just three national programmes broadcast from London.Local newsRadio Today estimates that more than 95 presenters will lose their jobs, along with journalists,\u0026nbspengineers and other staff. Global is closing 10 of its 24 local radio studios in Brighton, Cambridge, Chelmsford, Exeter, Gloucester, Kendal, Kent, Lancaster, Norwich and Swindon.“The loss of more than 100 local radio jobs across the country is a travesty and particularly damaging at a time when local news is already under extreme pressure,” Labour’s shadow culture secretary Tom Watson said.“Replacing local voices with London-based presenters will be a terrible loss to communities across the country. Radio has unique reach, providing listeners with national and local news and friendly company. This announcement is a terrible blow.”Global’s decision follows new guidance from Ofcom (the broadcasting regulator) last October, reducing the weekday requirement of locally made programming from seven hours to three and removing the obligation to include breakfast in those hours.Radio Today estimates that if Global and its main rival Bauer take full advantage of the new guidelines, the number of local radio presenters could fall by more than 250 with up to 70 per cent of Global’s presenters losing their jobs.Licence areaEarlier regulatory changes made it easier for stations to merge, with one serving an area that might previously have been covered by three. Ofcom’s guidelines allow commercial radio stations to introduce “hubbing” of newsrooms so that journalists no longer have to be based in the licence area. Stations that choose to network all but three hours of output each day must provide an “enhanced news service” during those three hours.“The enhanced local news option gives stations the flexibility to reduce the number of local hours produced, should they wish to make associated cost savings. The provision of local news bulletins during daytime, as well as peak-time, helps to ensure that the station’s local content and identity is maintained during these daytime networked hours,” the guidelines say.Ofcom insists that local bulletins “should not be merely tokenistic box-ticking exercises”, but there is no minimum duration for these bulletins as long as “at least one of the local stories in each bulletin needs to be directly relevant to listeners in each of the licensed areas”.The Press Gazette reported in February a net loss of 245 local newspaper titles in Britain since 2005, with a net loss of 14 in 2018 leading to more than 200 job losses. Many of the local radio studios identified for closure are, like the lost newspapers, in parts of Britain that voted for Brexit.If the referendum was, among other things, a revolt of provincial England against a metropolis that ignored its concerns, the centralisation of local radio programming can only deepen the malaise. And listeners in towns and cities across the country will lose another of their increasingly rare opportunities to experience collective effervescence."},{"url":null,"title":"history cadbury pictures","story":"This collection of photos from a book by Diane Wordsworth ( see last slide)  looks at Cadbury\u0027s early years in Bournville, Birmingham.

Everyone says Huawei!” the Zhoudan Children’s Singing Classroom croons in the three-minute number.“Teacher tells me to love my country, and to love our domestic brand Huawei! Huawei is good, Huawei is beautiful, Huawei wins glory for our country!“The battery is durable and the appearance is nice. The China-made chip is very precious,” sing the children, in white t-shirts emblazoned with “China.”Huawei has been at the centre of a global spying row after foreign governments including the UK and US began to scrutinise the company, a major supplier in global telecoms infrastructure and expected to be a key player in expanding 5G networks.The lyrics to the hit tune were written by Li Yourong, who was previously in the People’s Liberation Army’s song and dance troupe, and Zang Sijia, who also writes for the national security department.  The video went viral on Weibo, China\u0027s version of Twitter, with some decrying the product placement, and others saying they had been inspired to upgrade their Huawei phone. Huawei has come to symbolise the world’s fear and awe of the might a growing China and its fast-advancing technology industry can exercise globally.While China distinguishes between state-owned and private enterprises on paper, companies are thought to receive implicit state backing if they succeed on the level of a firm like Huawei.In December 2018 Canada arrested a top Huawei executive on an extradition request by the US relating to violating Iran sanctions. That executive, Meng Wanzhou, also the daughter of the company founder, has since been charged by the US.Huawei, Beijing and Chinese state media have repeatedly claimed these allegations are unfair and politically-motivated, accusing the US of trying to restrain Huawei’s global rise. The row has been intensified by an ongoing trade war between the US and China.The plot to bring down Huawei and sever its \u0026#039deeply disturbing\u0026#039 ties to the UKHuawei, which appears to have no part in the song, has responded to the controversy by engaging in a public relations blitz.Earlier this year, schools in Henan province found themselves at the centre of a row when students were told to watch a video about Huawei phones.The pupils were then asked to answer questions including: “What is Huawei’s competitive advantage? A. quality. B. design. C. functionality.” Gao Wuqiang, a regional education official, told Chinese media: “Teaching materials have remained unchanged for years and students got bored... Students’ parents all use Huawei mobiles. I hope the exam could be closer to students’ lives.”Allegations against dead politicians will form part of Westminster strand of the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual AbuseJack Shepherd: Britain officially puts extradition request to Georgian prosecutorsPolice renew appeal for witnesses to Salisbury nerve agent attack in attempt to prosecute Russian military agents for mother\u0026#39s deathExclusive: Britain will follow all EU food and farming regulations for nine months in a \u0026#39no deal\u0026#39 BrexitComment: The EU smells our fear and thinks we are biddable.

This is a New India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, facing a tough election due by May, said Friday.This is an India that will return the damage done by terrorists with interest, he said.India\u0027s junior foreign minister and former army chief, Vijay Kumar Singh, tweeted that the welcome release of the pilot was the first of many steps that #Pakistan must take to reinforce their commitment to peace.Kashmir has been ided between India and Pakistan since the end of British colonial rule. Both claim it in full and have fought two wars over the Himalayan territory.India has half a million troops in the part it administers, with militants - backed by Islamabad, according to New Delhi - fighting for independence or a merger with Pakistan.Tens of thousands of people, mostly civilians, have died since a revolt that broke out in 1989. Last year was the deadliest in a decade with almost 600 killed, monitors say.Matters escalated alarmingly after a massive suicide bombing killed 40 Indian troops on February 14, with the attack claimed by a Pakistan-based militant group.Twelve days later Indian warplanes launched a strike inside undisputed Pakistani territory, claiming to have hit a militant camp.An infuriated Islamabad denied casualties or damage, but a day later launched its own incursion across the LoC.That sparked the dogfight which ended in both countries claiming they had shot down each other\u0027s warplanes, and Abhinandan\u0027s capture.Prime Minister Imran Khan unexpectedly announced Thursday that he would be released in the first sign of a potential thaw.Khan alluded to the catastrophic consequences of nuclear war and called for talks - even as he warned India should not take the announcement as a sign of weakness.Indian Air Force pilot Abhinandan has become a national hero in India, with his parents receiving a standing ovation as they boarded a flight to welcome their son.Pakistani foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi meanwhile said he was boycotting a meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) held in Abu Dhabi, as India had been invited.The tensions prompted Pakistan to close down its airspace, disrupting major routes between Europe and South Asia and grounding thousands of travellers worldwide.Pakistan\u0027s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said Friday that flights could land and depart from its main airports from 1300 GMT, and that others would be opened gradually.The parents of handlebar-moustached Abhinandan were given a standing ovation by fellow passengers as they boarded a flight to Amritsar near Wagah to welcome their son.He has become a national hero after purported footage that went viral showed him being beaten by locals after being shot down before Pakistani soldiers intervened, with social media abuzz with #GivebackAbhinandan and #Abhinandanmyhero hashtags.His subsequent polite refusal to proffer more details than necessary - I am sorry major, I am not supposed to tell you this - won him particular sympathy in India.His father, a retired air force officer, told the Times of India newspaper, Just look at the way he talked so bravely... a true soldier... we are proud of him.Please review our commenting policyAllegations against dead politicians will form part of Westminster strand of the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual AbuseJack Shepherd: Britain officially puts extradition request to Georgian prosecutorsPolice renew appeal for witnesses to Salisbury nerve agent attack in attempt to prosecute Russian military agents for mother\u0026#39s deathExclusive: Britain will follow all EU food and farming regulations for nine months in a \u0026#39no deal\u0026#39 BrexitComment: The EU smells our fear and thinks we are biddable.

It has been suggested the new earphones could have better Bluetooth technology, the ability to monitor their owners health and a new material that would allow them to be more easily held.The new AirPods\u0026nbspcould also be available in different colours and at a different price, rumours have suggested.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There are concerns that a hard Brexit could lead to long delays and disruption, with potential for prices to jump and shortages of certain foods. \u0026nbsp“Consumers may see some changes in what is available every week through the year with more space for offers where retailers can respond quickly to opportunities and deliver surprise,” researchers warned.Meanwhile, while retailers have traditionally had very strong rules related to the size, shape and colour of fresh produce items many companies are now changing these rules.“As Brexit draws near, retailers will be rejecting less than ever. Ultimately, this means many shoppers will need to spend extra time learning how to pick their own,” Kantar said. Created with Sketch.

Total constitutional constipation. Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.“Overall, this may help retailers accelerate the war on packaging and plastics, on food waste, and on obesity. The only downside is that shopping will take just a little bit longer than before.”Ray Gaul and Fraser McKevitt, who wrote the report, said: “The decision to leave the EU has affected consumers in different ways, but it’s apparent that ongoing uncertainty is already having a definite impact on purchasing trends and behaviours. From a supplier’s perspective, there is little doubt amongst retailers, producers and farmers that Brexit will result in a significant disruption to the UK’s food supply, including unharvested produce and empty supermarket shelves.”British shoppers have also begun to display “several recessionary behaviours” in the run-up to Brexit, according to the research. Consumers are beginning to follow buying patterns last observed during the post-financial crisis recession: the long-term trend of choosing foods for health reasons has “plateaued”, while the number of lunch boxes taken to work by adults has risen. Overall out-of-home food and drink growth has also slowed, reversing the boom of recent years. Brexit is the last straw for young people – so give us a Final SayEU net migration drops to 10-year low ahead of BrexitWhat happens to UK citizens living in the EU under a no-deal Brexit?I’ve resigned my position in the Tory party over Brexit- here’s whyWhile it is difficult to make\u0026nbspdefinitive forecasts about the grocery landscape due to the ongoing uncertainty around Brexit, Kantar said: “The sector faces medium-term challenges around sourcing adequate levels of staff, particularly in London and potentially also in Northern Ireland. “This will disproportionately affect grocery retailers with large portions of their estate in London but may yet be relieved to some extent if UK immigration remains open to EU nationals and even expands to allow easier employment of overseas nationals hailing from beyond the EU.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Levels of snacking have\u0026nbspincreased. More people are taking lunch boxes into work, rather than buying from sandwich shops or the canteen, because it’s cheaper. The eating out boom of recent years has slowed dramatically.\u0026nbspIt appears that the ‘we’ll be alright if we just keep calm and carry on’ propaganda is being taken with a pinch of salt.\u0026nbspEurotunnel settles Brexit ferry contract dispute for £33mLiam Fox mocked for spending £107,000 on Brexit podcastUK supermarkets lowering standards ahead of Brexit, study showsNo wonder. Kantar makes the point that, according to the Department for Environment, Food \u0026amp Rural Affairs, in 1988 domestic foods accounted for 66 per cent, or two-thirds, of all of what was consumed in Britain. Today, that figure has fallen to 50 per cent, or half.\u0026nbspMuch of the new consumption has arrived from the European Union, from where 62 per cent of all free foods are imported. In the absence of a deal, or a Brexit delay, in less than a month from now the smooth, uninterrupted flow of that food Britain enjoys through its membership of the single market will come to a juddering halt.\u0026nbspThat’s a big problem because while UK consumers may say they like the idea of buying locally, their buying habits speak otherwise. For example, just 41 per cent of the strawberries bought in Britain are consumed during their June, July and August season. The remainder is imported out of season, some from Europe or North Africa, some from further afield.\u0026nbspRetailers have done their best to respond. Range reviews have been conducted. We don’t tend to notice, but they regularly change through the year. They are changing now in ways they don’t usually change. Imported ranges have, for example, been simplified. Tesco has stated that it didn’t return fridges it rented during Christmas. It and Lidl have said that they’ll be hiring extra customs officials to get their produce fast tracked. Investments have been made in software and logistics planning.\u0026nbspMoney has also been spent on beefing up security too. One of the more specious arguments against a second referendum is it would cause social unrest. A no deal would all but guarantee it. It would brutally expose the lies told by Britain’s politicians.\u0026nbspIt would be remiss of me not to note that there will be some positives, and they may persist if Britain avoids the looming cliff edge. They include supermarkets becoming less likely to reject ‘wonky’ or odd shaped veg (although that was already in train) and their efforts persuade shoppers to eat seasonally. Packaging may reduce, and the top to bottom reviews some retailers have conducted of their businesses will serve them well whatever.\u0026nbspHowever, as a palliative these are rather like taking a paracetamol to deal with the after effects of major surgery.Kantar’s report is a superlative piece of work. Its authors, Fraser McKevitt and Ray Gaul, are to be commended.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.High-end slipper retailer Mahabis has gone into administration. 2 Jan 2019Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

There are concerns that a hard Brexit could lead to long delays and disruption, with potential for prices to jump and shortages of certain foods. \u0026nbsp“Consumers may see some changes in what is available every week through the year with more space for offers where retailers can respond quickly to opportunities and deliver surprise,” researchers warned.Meanwhile, while retailers have traditionally had very strong rules related to the size, shape and colour of fresh produce items many companies are now changing these rules.“As Brexit draws near, retailers will be rejecting less than ever. Ultimately, this means many shoppers will need to spend extra time learning how to pick their own,” Kantar said. Created with Sketch.

Total constitutional constipation. Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.“Overall, this may help retailers accelerate the war on packaging and plastics, on food waste, and on obesity. The only downside is that shopping will take just a little bit longer than before.”Ray Gaul and Fraser McKevitt, who wrote the report, said: “The decision to leave the EU has affected consumers in different ways, but it’s apparent that ongoing uncertainty is already having a definite impact on purchasing trends and behaviours. From a supplier’s perspective, there is little doubt amongst retailers, producers and farmers that Brexit will result in a significant disruption to the UK’s food supply, including unharvested produce and empty supermarket shelves.”British shoppers have also begun to display “several recessionary behaviours” in the run-up to Brexit, according to the research. Consumers are beginning to follow buying patterns last observed during the post-financial crisis recession: the long-term trend of choosing foods for health reasons has “plateaued”, while the number of lunch boxes taken to work by adults has risen. Overall out-of-home food and drink growth has also slowed, reversing the boom of recent years.

Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHIt was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right.

CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHBy 1963, when the group disbanded, The Springfields\u0026nbsphad had a series of hits and pre-empted the “British invasion” that would see The Beatles, The Kinks et al take the US by storm.In November that year, Dusty Springfield went solo and was free to pursue her own ideas, drawing influence from R\u0026ampB girl groups like The Exciters, whose\u0026nbsphit “Tell Him” is a clear blueprint for her orchestral-pop sound.Her first single “I Only Want to Be With You” was a smash, as was the album that followed it, A Girl Called Dusty (1964). The record’s highlights included\u0026nbspcovers of Lesley’s Gore’s “You Don’t Own Me”, The Shirelles’ “Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow?” and Ray Charles’s “Don’t You Know?” as well as her first collaborations with Burt Bacharach and Hal David: “Twenty Four Hours from Tulsa” and “Anyone Who Had a Heart”.Further Bacharach-penned\u0026nbspsingles would follow: “Wishin’ and Hopin’” and ”I Just Don’t Know What to Do With Myself”.By now, Dusty was an established star, her only serious rivals on the UK scene Cilla Black, Sandie Shaw and Lulu, after whom she jokingly named her three beehive wigs.But there were controversies: she was deported from South Africa for playing for an integrated audience and\u0026nbspdeveloped a reputation for being difficult after throwing a cake at an objectionable waiter.She also suffered the indignity of being knocked out of the Italian Song Festival in San Remo\u0026nbspat the semi-final stage in 1965, a competition that would\u0026nbspinspire Eurovision. However, she heard an Italian ballad,\u0026nbsp“Io Che Non Vivo (Senza Te)”, sung by its composer Pino Donaggio\u0026nbspat the same event that would provide the biggest hit of her career when translated into English: “You Don’t Have to Say You Love Me”.A skilled interpreter of songs, Dusty Springfield was also an influential tastemaker in the Swingin’ Sixites, sometimes credited with bringing the Motown sound to British TV audiences for the first time\u0026nbspwhen she curated a special edition of the ITV\u0026nbspprogramme Ready Steady Go! that\u0026nbspfeatured Stevie Wonder, The Supremes, The Temptations and The Miracles.A Life in Focus: Dusty SpringfieldWhile a single\u0026nbsplike “The Look of Love” brilliantly captured its moment, Springfield nevertheless faced\u0026nbspcriticism for being\u0026nbspinauthentic and adopting American tropes, an ersatz Nancy Sinatra.To address this, she signed with Atlantic Records – home of her heroine, Aretha Franklin – and relocated to Tennessee in 1968 to record Dusty In Memphis.Despite featuring “Son of a Preacher Man” and “The Windmills of Your Mind” (Michel Legrand’s\u0026nbsppsychedelic theme for The Thomas Crown Affair)\u0026nbspand songs by Bacharach and David, Carole\u0026nbspKing and Gerry Goffen\u0026nbspand Randy Newman, the record was a commercial flop but has since gone on to be recognised as one of the greatest albums of all time.The disappointment was to mark the beginning of the end for the singer. The 1970s were marked by a steady decline in interest in her records, a period that coincided\u0026nbspwith an increase in tabloid prurience\u0026nbsptowards her personal life after she revealed her bisexuality in an interview with Ray Connolly of The Evening Standard to promote her single “How Can I Be Sure?”Reappraised\u0026nbsptoday, her remarks are startlingly frank and brave indeed:\u0026nbsp“I don’t go leaping around to all the gay clubs but I can be very flattered. Girls run after me a lot and it doesn’t upset me. It upsets me when people insinuate things that aren’t true. I couldn’t stand to be thought of as a big butch lady. But I know that I’m as perfectly capable of being swayed by a girl as by a boy. More and more people feel that way and I don’t see why I shouldn’t.”“Do you realise... what I’ve just said could put the final seal to my doom. I don’t know, though. I might attract a whole new audience,” she told Connolly.Springfield relocated to America to avoid the subsequent furore but struggled\u0026nbspto fit in with the suburban social milieu of Los Angeles. She was rescued from obscurity by The Pet Shop Boys in 1987 to duet with Neil Tennant on “What Have I Done to Deserve This?” before being diagnosed with breast cancer in the mid-Nineties and passing away at her home on Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire.After a funeral attended by hundreds of fans – Elvis Costello, Lulu and Tennant\u0026nbspamong them – her brother and former bandmate, known as “Tom Springfield” ever since, scattered her ashes over the Cliffs of Moher in Ireland.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

However, the problem with negative Ofsted judgements is that they stigmatise schools making it more difficult for them to improve.“What these schools need is targeted support and an inspection system which is less stark.”Nick Gibb, school standards minister, said: “This government is determined to create more choice for parents when it comes to their children’s education and we have created 825,000 school places since 2010, and are on track to see that number rise to a million by 2020.“Standards have also risen, with 86 per cent of schools now good or outstanding, compared to 68 per cent in 2010, and last year more than nine out of ten pupils got a place at one of their top three choices, setting them on the path for a successful future.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Actually, it’s a two-man show: most of the landscape paintings in this exhibition are by David Hockney, but they’re juxtaposed with landscapes by one of his great artistic heroes: Vincent van Gogh.“He’s one of the great, great draughtsmen of all time,”Hockney, fielding questions from a crowd of journalists, who’ve flown in from all around the world. “The drawings are fantastic – he could see space very clearly.” And the paintings are something else. “Van Gogh is telling us that there’s a marvellous world in your own back garden. You just have to look at it – really look. I think that’s his message. It’s thrilling if you really look.”Hockney is wearing a natty flat cap and a lime green cardigan – he’s always been a stylish dresser. He seems cheerful and contented – he’s always been comfortable in his own skin. However he looks older and frailer than he did a few years ago, and he talks a lot more slowly. This should come as no surprise – he is 81, after all – but somehow it’s still a shock. With his boyish good looks, he was the Peter Pan of Pop Art. Even in late middle age, he seemed a lot younger than his years. Now he finally looks his age, but we should be thankful he’s still alive and still painting. If Van Gogh had lived as long as Hockney, he would have still been alive in the 1930s.“I’ve been deeply influenced by Van Gogh – it’s very visible in this show,” he says. “Van Gogh, to me, is a contemporary artist. Any artist that speaks to you is a contemporary artist. Brueghel is a contemporary artist to me.” Another big influence in his life has been Van Gogh’s letters to his brother Theo. “They’re marvellous,” he says. “If it had been 10 years later he might have been on the phone and the letters wouldn’t exist.”Hockney’s first encounter with Van Gogh was back in 1955, when he was a student at Bradford School of Art. The art school arranged a trip to a Van Gogh exhibition in Manchester, and Hockney was blown away by the energy, the vitality, the joie de vivre of his paintings. “I was 16 years old and I’d just started at the art school,” he recalls. “I thought, ‘Well, he’s quite a rich artist, because he could use two whole tubes of blue to paint the sky’. Not even teachers at the art school could afford that!”Created with Sketch.David Hockney\u0027s first brushes with genius Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Hockney (right) at the Walker Art Gallery with Sir John Moores in 1967‘Cold Water About to Hit the Prince’ (1969)‘Peter Getting Out of Nick’s Pool’ (1966)Hockney’s entry form for the 1967 John Moores Painting Prize‘Cleanliness Is Next to Godliness’ (1965)Hockney (right) at the Walker Art Gallery with Sir John Moores in 1967‘Cold Water About to Hit the Prince’ (1969)‘Peter Getting Out of Nick’s Pool’ (1966)Hockney’s entry form for the 1967 John Moores Painting Prize‘Cleanliness Is Next to Godliness’ (1965)It was the colour that moved him most of all. “I’d never seen paintings like that before – at the art school everybody just painted grey pictures of Bradford. There was not much colour at all. At first I thought he’d probably exaggerated some colour, but now I don’t think so.” Sixty-four years later, the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, which holds the world’s largest collection of Van Gogh’s work, has had the bright idea of juxtaposing a large array of Hockney’s Yorkshire landscape paintings with a smaller selection of Van Gogh’s landscapes, painted in the 1880s in the south of France. Hockney is flattered by this association. “Van Gogh is a terrific inspiration.”Of course there are some similarities between Van Gogh’s woods and wheat fields and Hockney’s, but this show isn’t about narrow comparisons, of style or subject matter. It’s about their shared love of light. Above all, it’s about their lust for life. They’re both artists who adore the natural world, and paint it compulsively. “They’re just so joyful,” he says, of Van Gogh’s landscapes. You could say the same of his. Fittingly, the show is called The Joy of Nature.As Hockney says, it’s a far better title than Dave and Vince. It’s ironic that such joyful paintings were made by a man who chose to kill himself, but that paradox is part of what makes Van Gogh so compelling. “He was joyful when he painted – I know that, because that’s what he loved.”‘Kilham to Langtoft II’, 27 July 2005, oil on canvas (David Hockney)This exhibition also represents a kind of renaissance, for Hockney’s landscape paintings, like Van Gogh’s, were cut short by a tragic, self-inflicted death. In March 2013, one of Hockney’s assistants, Dominic Elliott, died from drinking toilet cleaner in Hockney’s home in Bridlington, the Yorkshire seaside town where Hockney had been living intermittently since the early Noughties. Hockney was entirely blameless, but he’d been asleep in the house when it happened, and the shock was immense. He sold the house and moved back to Los Angeles, his adopted home for the past 30 years. For several months, he was unable to paint at all.In July 2013 Hockney sent a picture to his friend and curator Edith Devaney. It was a portrait of his close friend and studio manager, Jean-Pierre Goncalves de Lima, sitting in Hockney’s LA studio, his head buried in his hands. Straight away, Devaney spotted the similarity with Van Gogh’s Old Man in Sorrow. This wasn’t just a portrait, Hockney told her – it was also a sort of self-portrait.This portrait led to many more, and the result was his 2016 exhibition, 82 Portraits and One Still Life, at London’s Royal Academy, curated by Devaney. After the trauma of Elliot’s sudden death, Van Gogh helped to bring Hockney back into painting. And now Van Gogh has brought his Yorkshire landscapes, cruelly curtailed by that tragic accident, back to life.Van Gogh is telling us that there’s a marvellous world in your own back garden. You just have to look at it – really look. I think that’s his message. It’s thrilling if you really lookThe selection was mainly made by the Van Gogh Museum, but Hockney did ask them to include The Road to York through Sledmere, which he painted a decade earlier, as homage to his friend Jonathan Silver. Silver revived Salts Mill in Saltaire, Yorkshire, as a cultural centre (and as a museum of Hockney’s work). He died of pancreatic cancer in 1997, aged just 48. When Silver was very ill, Hockney spent a lot of time with him.He asked Silver if there was anything he could do for him. Silver asked him to paint east Yorkshire – a subtler landscape than West Yorkshire, where Hockney was born and raised. “That picture was painted when Jonathan Silver was dying, and I was driving constantly from Bridlington to Saltaire, and I always went through Sledmere,” remembers Hockney. “It’s always been on my wall.”English landscape paintings are often muted, a blur of browns and greys. Hockney’s English landscapes are glowing – bursting with bright colours and brilliant light. “I’d lived in California for 30 years. It’s bound to have an effect. But I don’t think I exaggerated the colour that much – no, I don’t think so. I think it’s there, but you have to look – hard. Colour is a very fugitive thing.”As he says, we all see colour differently. Some people see it more intensely. Hockney’s intense vision makes us look closer and the world look brighter. “When you’re looking at the world, there’s so much to see.”David Hockney was born in Bradford in 1937, the fourth of five children. During the war his father Kenneth was a conscientious objector, which meant that when he lost his job, as a clerk, he wasn’t eligible for national assistance. He subsequently scratched a living renovating old prams. David drew from an early age, in chalk on the kitchen floor and in pencil in his brothers’ comics.In 1947 he won a scholarship to Bradford Grammar School. He didn’t shine at school, which was just as well. If he’d been top of the class his teachers might have pushed him into a more respectable occupation. “He should realise that ability in and enthusiasm for art alone is not enough to make a career for him,” wrote his teacher on his school report.Fortunately for Hockney, and the rest of us, he paid no attention to his teachers. He went to Bradford College of Art, which gave him a solid foundation in skills like life drawing, then on to the Royal College of Art, in London, where he found his voice. He came out as gay – a brave move in an era when homosexuality was still illegal – and his work blossomed. He made his first visit to America, and returned with his hair dyed blonde, after seeing a TV ad for Clairol which claimed that “blondes have more fun”.By the time Hockney left the Royal College he was already represented by a Bond Street gallery. He moved into a two-room flat in London’s Notting Hill, still a rundown area back then. He slept in one room and used the other room as his studio. His immense talent was bolstered by his insatiable appetite for hard work. GET UP AND WORK IMMEDIATELY was painted in big block capitals on the chest of drawers at the foot of his bed.His first solo show in 1963 earned him enough money to spend a year in America. As he told his friend Henry Geldzahler, he never felt lonely over there. He spent some time in New York but he was drawn to Los Angeles, where he’s lived, off and on, ever since.“Southern California has a marvellous clarity in the light. That’s why Hollywood is there. I always loved the place. I never got bored of it.” The sun-drenched pictures he painted there would have been inconceivable in Britain. “In a cold place like Bradford you hardly see anybody without their clothes on,” he once remarked.Hockney painting ‘May Blossom on the Roman Road’, 2009 (Jean-Pierre Goncalves de Lima)Then as now, LA is commonly derided by snobbish Brits (and New Yorkers) as a spiritual desert, devoid of culture, but Hockney saw a vivid, lively cityscape that no one else had painted, a city with “the only architecture in the world that makes you smile”. He took to calling himself an “English Los Angeleno”. He vowed to become the “Pirinesi of LA”.His LA paintings made his name, in Britain and America, particularly his swimming pool pictures like A Bigger Splash and Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures), which last year became the most expensive painting by a living artist when it sold at Christie’s in New York for $90m (£68m).David Hockney interview: \u0027I thought I was a peripheral artist, really\u0027“The auction prices for my work have nothing to do with me – I ignore it,” he says, emphatically. “I think people have forgotten Oscar Wilde’s remark, ‘The only person who likes all kinds of art is an auctioneer’.”He’s worked in all kinds of media, from film and photography to set design. He’s embraced every new innovation, from fax machines to smartphones. His iPad paintings were groundbreaking, proving that this new medium could be a new way to make great art.“The first things I did were lots of sunrises from a window, and I realised that with the iPad I could draw without moving from my bed. I didn’t have to get up to get water, or a brush, or pencils, and I could draw in the dark, because of the back light, so I started drawing just before the dawn.” He painted dozens of pictures of the sun rising, on his iPad, through the same bedroom window. “Every day was different, different colours. No two sunrises are the same.”Woldgate’, 2008, oil on 2 canvases (David Hockney)Yet despite his love of hi-tech, he’ll always be remembered as a painter, and a traditional painter at that. “Modern art generally ignores skills and crafts,” he once said, in an interview with Art Monthly. When abstract art was all the rage he flew the flag for figuration. When conceptual art was all the rage he flew the flag for fine art.“There’s a lot of the boring old northern art schoolmaster in what he says about representation versus abstraction,” wrote Tim Hilton, in . But as a new generation of artists rediscover draughtsmanship, it seems Hockney has been proved right.Despite his conventional views on art, he’s no reactionary fuddy-duddy. He was a tireless advocate for gay rights, long before such causes became chic. His friend Henry Geldzahler once wrote down a list of his faults and failings: stubborn hard of hearing unintentionally rude suffers fools gladly generous to a fault. It’s notable that several of these faults are actually virtues.It’s hard to find an artist who’s so universally admired. And after all these years, his hunger for experience remains. “On Saturday I’m going off to Normandy to paint the arrival of spring,” he says. “I can’t think of anything better than watching the spring happen in Normandy in 2019.”Hockney – Van Gogh: The Joy of Nature is at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam (vangoghmuseum.nl) until 26 MayWe’ll tell you what’s true.

Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHIt was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made.

While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHSheeran has previously explained that he uses a loop station during his live shows, as opposed to a backing track.A looping pedal enables musicians to record a sound once before it is played over and over again, with the possibility of layering additional sounds to create an entire track.Muse released their latest album,\u0026nbspSimulation Theory, in November 2018.The band just started a world tour in Houston, Texas, on 22 February, and they are set to continue through October 2019.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.220 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.220 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show.

It remains surprising that one of their few films to evade any nominations is this endlessly quotable mistaken identity comedy starring Jeff Bridges as The Dude.Brian De Palma doesn’t exactly make films in the hope of winning award, but his political thriller - based on Michelangelo Antonioni’s Blow Up – would have deserved any Oscar it was nominated for.Breathless\u0027 failure to receive a nomination is proof that the Oscars can’t be trusted. Despite being one of the most studied films in the world, Jean Luc-Godard’s French masterpiece has an Academy Award tally of zero.The Academy rewarded many notable screwball comedies, though this Howard Hawks-directed standout starring Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn - who’d go on to hold the record for most wins - wasn\u0027t one of them.Courtesy of BFINicolas Roeg, who directed this Venice-set chiller, is one of the most unfairly overlooked directors in Oscars history.  Richard Kelly’s science-fiction mind-bender, which made a star of Jake Gyllenhaal, was a festival favourite upon its debut in 2004. Many expected a screenplay nomination to manifest.1047 The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)It wouldn’t be until the 1990s that western films found favour with the Academy. It was ironically  thanks to Unforgiven, a film directed by Clint Eastwood whose career flourished after starring in this Sergio Leone film that many consider to be the genre’s peak.Mathieu Kassovitz’s black-and-white drama – translated in English as Hate – follows three young friends and their struggles living in the suburbs of Paris.The Academy may not be frothing at the mouth to nominate horror films, but do have previous (see: The Exorcist and The Silence of the Lamb), which makes the absence of John Carpenter’s influential Halloween a glaring oversight.1347 Harold and Maude (1971)This offbeat romantic drama was a critical and commercial flop at the time of release, which probably accounts for its lack of Oscar nominations.

It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.220 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.220 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show.

Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.When his son’s mom runs afoul of Paris’s criminal underworld, a thrill-seeking superbike racer begins moonlighting as a drug courier to clear her debt.An odd encounter with a fan and a tryst with that fan’s ex-boyfriend leads a sexually adventurous singer on an escapade in Chile.Naval unit PASKAL is among the most elite special forces in Malaysia.

The lawmen made history. From director John Lee Hancock (The Blind Side), The Highwaymen follows the untold true story of the legendary detectives who brought down Bonnie and Clyde. When the full force of the FBI and the latest forensic technology aren’t enough to capture the nation’s most notorious criminals, two former Texas Rangers (Kevin Costner and Woody Harrelson) must rely on their gut instincts and old school skills to get the job done.Veteran Bollywood actress Madhuri Dixit turns producer for this lighthearted snapshot of life in the chawls of Mumbai.Jimmy Carr: The Best of Ultimate Gold Greatest Hits\u0026nbsp Jimmy Carr has gathered a selection of his very best jokes for the ultimate comedy special.

Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb – the “best friend” character eaten in the second episode – went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix’s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid. An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox’s blind lawyercrimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck\u0027s turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D\u0027Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson – charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife – the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It’s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix’s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it’s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it’s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-Götterdämmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. 625 A Series of Unfortunate EventsThe wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let’s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). If you’re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It’s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a “travel buddy” sit down and read you adverts. The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord’s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino’s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix’s biggest hits – the company doesn’t release audience figures – the fourth season turns its attention to Mexico’s interminable drugs wars. A cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari’s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. One of Netflix’s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about. You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We’re firmly in Martin Scorsese\u0027s Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Brühl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs’s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms – but Love’s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there’s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs – but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman “mansplained” away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix’s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs.2125 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda “Britannica” Richardson.Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings.Breaking Bad for those with short attention s. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero’s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family.A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).A cartoon about a talking horse, starring the goofy older brother from Arrested Development… on paper little about BoJack Horseman screams “must watch”.

AI is everywhere, its proponents claim – if it\u0027s not somewhere already, then it\u0027s about to be.And the latest place it has arrived is perhaps the most personal yet: in your mouth. Oral B\u0027s latest toothbrush hopes to bring the power of AI and machine learning to your teeth, using artificial intelligence to coach you into brushing your teeth better.It\u0027s not the first toothbrush to use technology usually preserved for mobile phones and other gadgets to make sure your brushing is as effective as possible. But Oral-B thinks it is the smartest, and the brush has a fitting name: the Genius X.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe toothbrush was revealed in Barcelona this week at Mobile World Congress, an event usually focused on phones. This year, many of the exhibitions focused on foldable handsets and 5G.Oral-B staked its claim not only on the basis of its smart toothbrush but also its general vision of the future of healthcare and its connection to dental hygiene. That vision included a full-scale smart mirror, which could be controlled by people\u0027s hand movements and showed information about the day to come and the overall health of the person using it.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

At this biennial event, the participating companies exhibit their latest service robotic technologies and componentsThe robot developed by Seed Solutions sings and dances to music during the Japan Robot Week 2016 at Tokyo Big SightOral-B does already have a toothbrush that relies on some smart features: the Genius. That too operates as a brushing coach as well as a brush itself, watching how you clean your teeth and encouraging you to avoid bad habits and ensure your entire mouth is brushed.Scientists developing toothbrush to diagnose deadly heart problemsTo know where it is, the toothbrush uses built-in sensors that build on a host of experimental work to understand how people brush. The company put huge numbers of people in front of a camera and asked them to brush, feeding that information into an algorithm that allows the toothbrush to know where it is, no matter which of the widely varying ways of brushing their teeth that people use.But it does so using your phone\u0027s camera, meaning that you have to stick a special holder\u0026nbspto your mirror and then stick your phone inside. When it\u0027s there, it can watch the brush as it moves around in your mouth, monitoring where exactly you are brushing and where needs extra work.That is a rather complicated process that requires a fairly complicated process just to brush your teeth, and might not always work if the phone doesn\u0027t have the right view. Instead, the Genius removes some of that: it just needs to be within Bluetooth distance of your phone, and then will relay information that is displayed on your handset.In the app – which was available to use at MWC, in a booth that let visitors brush their teeth – all of that information is displayed. Brushers are given a score, which factors in whether they press too hard and how long they brush for as well as how effective and complete their coverage was.Over time, people are encouraged to improve that score by better brushing their teeth. Those scores can be viewed historically through the app, which also keeps data on things such as how often your gums bleed.The Genius X is due to be released later this year and pricing has not yet been announced.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Ms Wong made the discovery after coming across\u0026nbspthe words “Hide Tweet” in the app’s code, which Twitter later confirmed to be the new feature.“Thanks to Jane and @MattNavarra for starting the conversation about this feature we are developing. We wanted to provide a little more context on it,” Twitter’s senior product manager Yasmeen Haq\u0026nbspwrote on Twitter.“We often hear from heavy Tweeters that they want to be able to protect their conversations. People who start interesting conversations on Twitter are really important to us, and we want to empower them to make the conversations they start as healthy as possible by giving them some control.”Twitter is secretly keeping hold of deleted DMsTwitter is ‘thinking about’ a new edit featureMs Haq\u0026nbspexplained how Twitter categorises\u0026nbspconversations as an ecosystem containing\u0026nbspfour different groups: Authors, repliers, the audience and the platform. “We try to balance the experience across all four groups, and we are continuously exploring ways to shift the balance without overcorrecting.”She added: “We think the transparency of the hidden replies would allow the community to notice and call out situations where people use the feature to hide content they disagree with.“We think this can balance the product experience between the original Tweeter and the audience.”Twitter said it planned\u0026nbspto start testing the new Hide Tweet feature publicly “in the coming months”.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At the same time, our toxic air in London is a major public health crisis that is stunting the lung development of our children, leading to thousands of premature deaths and increases the risk of asthma and dementia.“Most other motorists, from private cars to small business owners, are liable for the Congestion Charge. Removing the Congestion Charge exemption for private hire vehicles is a key part of our plans to both reduce congestion and to protect Londoners from harmful emissions from polluting vehicles.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

to June illegal unless\u0026nbspUK takes part in MEP elections at end of May, German parliament toldClick to followIndy PoliticsA Brexit delay of longer than two months could be illegal unless the UK elects new MEPs, lawyers are warning, appearing to torpedo Theresa May’s strategy.Article 50 cannot be extended beyond the end of May unless the UK takes part in fresh European parliament elections, according to a legal opinion issued by the German Bundestag.The conclusion came amid fresh evidence that the exit talks remain in trouble, with a lack of progress that might persuade MPs to approve the prime minister’s deal.The controversy over European elections is crucial\u0026nbspbecause Ms May told MPs a delay to June would be possible without a U-turn on withdrawing MEPs – if parliament forces her to abandon the 29 March deadline.A proposal to keep seats in the parliament would trigger uproar among Conservatives who are already angry\u0026nbspover the Commons being granted a veto over a no-deal Brexit.Post-Brexit US trade demands ‘would allow in chlorinated chicken’However, the EU would almost certainly reject a delay of only two months as pointless, given it has not been possible to agree an acceptable UK orce deal in two years of trying.The blow came as Michel Barnier, the EU’s Brexit negotiator, is believed to have warned there has been no progress in the negotiations designed to secure changes to rescue the agreement.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with

exit mechanism from the Irish border backstop, which the EU has rejected, it was reported.On Tuesday, Ms May – while insisting she remained opposed to delaying Brexit – told MPs: “An extension beyond the end of June would mean the UK taking part in the European Parliament elections.”However, the legal opinion warned of “a violation of the active and passive voting rights of British nationals” if there was a delay beyond 23-26 May, when the elections are held.Leave supporters to pay £50 to join Nigel Farage on Brexit marchEurotunnel settles Brexit ferry contract dispute for £33mLiam Fox mocked for spending £107,000 on Brexit podcast“British citizens living in the UK would be denied a fundamental right conferred on them by citizenship of the European Union,” the German paper Die Welt quoted the advice as saying.They could take action in UK courts “in defence of their rights to vote and stand for election … in accordance with applicable national rules”.And EU citizens in the UK would also be prevented from “exercising their right to vote and stand in elections to the European parliament in their state of residence”, laying Britain open to possible action by the European Commission.The European Court of Justice could issue a preliminary ruling on “whether or not Britain’s non-participation in the European elections is legally permissible”.It is increasingly plausible that the EU will insist on a much longer extension – possibly 21 months, to allow a trade deal to be agreed while the UK is a member, avoiding the backstop controversy.This week, Emmanuel Macron hinted at that approach when he said France would block a Brexit delay unless it had a “clear objective” based on a “new choice” by the British.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Struggling to hold back tears, the 31-year-old Scot said that the continuing pain from what he described as his “severely damaged right hip” had led him to decide to end his career this year.

But given parliament looks set to extend Article 50, there’ll be further opportunities to secure support for Labour’s alternative Brexit deal.“This would bring the country together and defend jobs, rights and our security.”Labour’s David Lammy, a supporter of the anti-Brexit group Best for Britain, said: “It’s become clear today that there is no majority in the house for May’s deal, but also that Labour’s alternative plan cannot command a majority either.“In the key votes ahead of us we must extend Article 50 to take a catastrophic no deal off the table and use that time to put this decision back to the people to decide if they back the government’s botched Brexit deal or staying in our current EU deal.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

The prime minister told MPs that if the next “meaningful vote” on the withdrawal agreement is defeated, then they will have the chance to vote for an extension of Article 50, thus\u0026nbspdelaying Brexit.Some Brexiteers –\u0026nbspfearing a lengthy delay to the exit process – may decide to climb down, even though their fundamental objection to the backstop remains.Still, plenty of pro-Brexit\u0026nbspMPs still argue the backstop must be time-limited, or replaced in its entirety. On balance, it seems likely that most\u0026nbspwill vote down the deal again, unless Ms May obtains significant concessions in the next fortnight.With no breakthrough in sight as Ms May’s officials\u0026nbspcontinue discussions with their counterparts in Brussels, it\u0026nbspremains an extraordinary (and probably\u0026nbspunlikely)\u0026nbsptask for the prime minister to overturn the biggest defeat in the modern British political history and secure MPs’ backing for her Brexit deal.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

Just holding out possibility of a short delay, too short for a #peoplesvote” she tweeted.Significantly, the prime minister refused to say whether she would “argue for no-deal or argue for extension”, if her deal is thrown out again on 12 March.Labour’s Yvette Cooper hinted she would continue to press her amendment tomorrow, to legally compel Ms May to seek an Article 50 extension if her deal is not approved.Suggesting the legal force was crucial, Ms Cooper warned: “Promised votes have been pulled before, Commons motions have been ignored before.

He said that he had been planning to make this summer’s Wimbledon his farewell tournament, but feared that he might have to bring down the curtain before thenThe multi-pound bungler has wasted £2.7bn of taxpayers money that could have gone to cash strapped local councils, hospitals and schools. Yet no matter how many mistakes he makes or how much public money he squanders, he remains in post.\u0026nbspMr McDonald attributes £2bn of the money\u0026nbspto the collapse of the Virgin Trains east coast franchise in 2018 and the decision of the government to take the route back into public ownership.The party said a\u0026nbspfurther £437m\u0026nbspcould be attributed towards his prison probation service reforms while £72,000 was spent on unsuccessfully defending a policy of restricting books being sent to prisoners.In response to Labour\u0027s analysis, a spokesman for Mr Grayling, however,\u0026nbspsaid: “In the old days Labour used to do properly sourced attacks rather than ad hominem nonsense based on a hodgepodge of half-truths and made-up drivel.“The only truth we’ve had out of Labour in the last decade is a note saying \u0027there is no money left\u0027 after the crashed the economy leaving Britain with a £120 billion annual budget deficit and soaring unemployment.Here The Independent looks at some of Mr Grayling\u0027s most contentious policies\u0026nbspwhile in government - and the cost.In 2013, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) embarked on major reforms of probation services - known as Transforming Rehabilitation.\u0026nbspAccording to a fresh report from the National Audit Office into those services, it was found that the number of criminals being sent back to prison for violating licence conditions has increased since the government\u0027s dangerous part-privatisation of the service.\u0026nbspThe head of Whitehall\u0027s spending watchdog, Sir Amyas Morse said the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) had set itself up to fail as Chris Grayling - then head of the department - had ignored warnings over contracting out the supervision of criminals.These have had far-reaching consequences, he added. Not only have these failings been extremely costly for taxpayers, but we have seen the number of people on short sentences recalled to prison skyrocket.\u0026nbspAccording to the NAO, problems with the system mean the MoJ is to pay at least £467m more than was required under the original contracts.On the same day the NAO released it\u0027s damning report, it was announced that Eurotunnel had dropped its legal claim against the government over post-Brexit ferry contracts - after ministers agreed to pay out £33m to the firm.The challenge was launched by the company as it claimed the government\u0027s lucrative contracts to increase cross-Channel capacity in the event of a no-deal scenario - totalling £108m - had been doled out in a distortionary and anti-competitive way.\u0026nbspDowning Street said the decision to pay out to Eurotunnel was a cross-government one, but the Department for Transport (DfT) took the lead on the ferry contracts, and was at the centre of a storm recently when one of the firms awarded a contract, Seaborne Freight, did not actually have any ships. The contract was worth over £13m, but the money was never spent.Books for prisoners\u0026nbspIn 2014, Mr Grayling\u0027s restrictions on sending books to prisoners in England and Wales was declared by the High Court to be unlawful - and was eventually overturned by his successor, Michael Gove, the following year.But in an attempt to defend the ban, Mr Grayling spent £72,000 of taxpayers\u0027 money in the courts, which at the time was described as a scandalous waste of public money.\u0026nbspWhile justice secretary, Mr Grayling also awarded a £23m contract to a firm for a bespoke prisoner tracking scheme to give Britain one of the most advanced GPS tagging systems in the world.Unfortunately for Mr Grayling, this was another policy overturned by Mr Gove and the vast majority of the money had already been spent.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The event, which UNESCO added to its list of intangible human heritage in 2017, is the largest congregation of pilgrims on earth.

The last thing Mrs May needs now is Cabinet rebellions, backbench grandstanding and a leadership beauty contest.Too many Tories seem not to realise what damage they are doing to the party’s hard-won reputation for competence when they go completely off-grid.Or to faith in politicians and our political process in general when they fight tooth and nail to stop Brexit, but aren’t even honest about their intentions.Theresa May has a tough job for the next two weeks. The least her Party can do is let her get on with it in peace.EVERY insight into what a Corbyn government would look like makes the prospect even more terrying.This weekend he, again, brushed off the anti-Semitism in his party as a matter of personal opinion.

But Labour’s more paralysing fear is more Remainer MPs abandoning the party. They have clearly decided to throw their Leavers under the bus.The party is now in desperate straits.It’s not just Brexit. For years it has rubbished claims that it has been over-run by racist anti-Semites and rabidly hard-Left conspiracy lunatics. Now ­Corbyn’s ally Jon Lansman, founder of Momentum, admits that it’s all true.“We have a major problem,” he says. “It is obvious we have a much larger number of people with hardcore anti-Semitic opinions... polluting the atmosphere in constituency parties and online.”Deputy Leader Tom Watson is in open revolt, launching a “party within a party” to prevent more moderates defecting.It may be too late. Corbyn’s own anti-Semitic extremism attracted all the racists and cranks who have forced out one Jewish MP and her colleagues. All the while he has faced both ways on Brexit.If he is about to pay the price for it all, it is well deserved.FOR too long we have allowed the supporters of terror to wave their sickening flags during protests on our streets.Enjoying free speech protections, they have spread the lies and vicious hatred of one of the world’s most violently anti-Western and anti-Semitic groups.Police have had to let goons march through London with Hezbollah banners emblazoned with an assault rle.Tory Home Secretary Sajid Javid has outlawed them entirely.

But no longer.In recent months Big Ben has stood silent. Officially, it has been muted for repairs but you could not be blamed for wonderingthere was a dferent reason.Has this most resonant symbol of parliamentary democracy been gagged — had its clacker nicked — while our appalling, promise-shredding, treasonous politicians plot to overturn the  referendum’s whacking vote to leave the European Union Almost three years ago the voters gave MPs a clear instruction: Get us out of the EU. Unbelievably, the MPs are refusing to obey.Whatever tricksy waffle they spout, be in no doubt about this. The parliamentary class is telling voters to get stuffed.The last  hours have seen British politics sink to a new, squalid, guttering low.In clear daylight the express will of the people is being violated.Democratic honesty is being casually abandoned by a knot of pro-Brussels obsessives who think they can do whatever they like. And they suppose we won’t notice!Cabinet ministers yesterday tarted their Remainer consciences like dollybirds flashing their bits on Blackpool beach.Led by Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd, they threatened to resignTheresa May did not do their bidding and delay our departure date from Europe.Oooh, look at us, their blatant behaviour said. Look at our importance and our Europhile goodness. All this while they accused pro-Brexit MPs of being “extremists”.Is it really extremist to respect the biggest vote in British history In any normal circumstances, a Prime Minister would have turned to Rudd and her fellow drama queens Greg Clark and David Gauke and said: “OK, resign. If you won’t support the Government, you can kiss goodbye to your six-figure salary, your free limos and all the other perks.”But Mrs May, pitiably weak, tolerated their rebellion and trotted off to the Commons to accept Brexit may be delayed.It wasn’t just Rudd, non- entity Gauke and Clark, a former SDP supporter who has resented the Leave vote from day one.A trio of lower-ranking ministerial numpties put their names to a newspaper article saying they would quit unless Mrs May obeyed their pro-EU agenda.These connivers included an insufferably moist specimen called Richard Harrington, who is barely a familiar name in his Watford constituency let alone in national politics.Even a premier as puny as Mrs May should have had the backbone to tell Harrington to fetch his coat. But no. He was allowed to keep his job.Things are just as bad in the Labour party, where ­Jeremy Corbyn has casually scrapped his  manesto promise to respect the result of the EU referendum.Now he says he wants a second referendum. You thought the one thing loonytunes Corbyn had going for him was that he said what he believed A manesto should matter. It should be a solemn undertaking to the voters about what politicians will do.But Corbyn, supposed beardie prophet of ethics, now snootily thinks we voted the wrong way in the referendum and must capitulate to the European empire, ditching the national independence .million voters demanded.Why the hell are these people in politicsthey think so little of the voterswho opted for Leave Theirs is the behaviour of a tyrannous clique whose “delay” to our departure helps only their fellow technocrats in the European Commission.And that’s what it’s all about. They feel a greater kinship with their fellow elitists on the Continent than they do with working-class British voters.The likes of Greg Clark and Amber Rudd and their slippery pal Philip Hammond looked smug yesterday when Mrs May announced the possibility of a delay to Brexit.For them, it’s a game, a ploy, a bid to show that they — and not the unwashed electorate — run the show.Can they not see the dangers  Respect for Westminster, already whacked by the expenses scandal, will take another terrible hit. People will look at the wriggling and the grand- standing and the lies and procrastinating blether of the last day and a half and will conclude that our Parliament is now a place that scorns its electors.Some of you may have greater faith.Some of you may say: “Brexit will prevail in the end”, albeit in diluted form.But eventhat is true, what are we to think in future of the House of Commons Things have reached the stage, I am truly sorry to say, that I now find I hate the very sight of Big Ben and the Palace of Westminster.It is no longer, for me, the proud cockpit of our national le.It has become a nest of aggressive, desperate elitists prepared to do anything to save their greasy grasp on public opinion.They lie. Deceive. Betray. Dissemble. They can delay Brexitthey want but there will be no rebuilding the country’s trust. Not for years.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But who really believes that MPs will prevent that too, maybe by backing the second referendum Labour now supports. A delay may well be fatal.We are outraged at the Cabinet Remainers and no-mark ministers who held the PM to ransom to secure a vote over halting No Deal. A clearout of this sorry bunch cannot come too soon.But it is plain that they are calling the shots now, not the ERG’s Brexiteers — despite the  claims of  Anna Soubry.All Tory MPs must remember this: Their party can avoid complete destruction — and indeed can capitalise on  Corbyn’s poll collapse — ONLY by  delivering Brexit. Yes, even Mrs May’s version . . . with an improved backstop.No Brexit leads to No Tories — and the collapse of our political system.IT beggars belief. A Labour Party already engulfed by an anti-Semitism crisis backs a violently anti-Semitic terrorist group.This is our official Opposition,  challenging the Home Secretary for more evidence that Hezbollah’s political wing should be banned from Britain.They’re not convinced by its own  deputy leader admitting there’s no dference between its politicians and its military wing, which is already banned.Nor by the catalogue of atrocities Hezbollah has carried out against  civilians, including children, in Syria.Nor by the fact it is dedicated to driving Jews from their homes.Corbyn and his  aide Seumas Milne won’t bend. They are two upper-class idiots who have spent all their pampered lives romanticising left-wing violence.And yet Labour still wants voters to believe it is not racist — and that our nation’s defence is safe in its hands.What a sick joke.WE commend Facebook, for once, for finally pulling the plug on Tommy Robinson.He may pose as a fearless truth-seeker exercising his right to free speech. In reality he is a criminal thug whose page stirred up violence against Muslims.We’d have more time for Facebook, though,they were equally decisive over removing Islamist extremism.Or self-harm videos.And we ask this of Google’s YouTube, where Robinson still has a presence:What exactly are you waiting for Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That would be a democratic disaster.Yes, this Government has made a catalogue of errors from triggering Article  with no plan, to letting Brussels decide the sequencing of Brexit talks.But at this stage, with the clock ticking towards midnight, there is no time for “coulda woulda shoulda” about what went wrong when.Sun readers knew all along that in a negotiation there’s always give and take.You can’t get everything you want.And although the Prime Minister’s deal has flaws, it’s actually far better than many critics will admit.Those same critics can also be wildly unrealistic about the actual alternatives on offer now.The most likely alternative is in fact a far softer Brexit, which leaves Britain with less not more control.ImagineDavid Cameron had won from Brussels a deal that took back control of immigration, let us set our rules covering the key services sector, and allowed us to scrap the wasteful Common Agricultural Policy.Let’s suppose it gave us control of our fishing waters, let us choose environmental and employment laws as long as we kept to certain general standards, and which got us out of the EU’s political project. He would have been a hero.Yet that is precisely what Theresa May has secured. Even in a worse-case scenario —we end up in the backstop — we will have achieved all those things and will get a veto over new EU directives.We wouldn’t have to pay a single penny of membership costs.I’m not pretending the deal is flawless. We need to improve it to know we can’t be trapped in the backstop forever, and to ensure the EU can’t impose dferent rules in Northern Ireland from the rest of our country.But it sometimes seems that the Prime Minister’s critics cannot see the wood for the trees.Eurosceptics used to say what we wanted was to turn off the tap of endless new European laws, to stop the ratchet where the answer to every question seemed to be “more Brussels”, and to go back to a trading relationship. That’s ­literally what this deal does.So why did her deal suffer such a ­historic defeat last month Some MPs have deeply held concerns, particularly about the backstop, that the Government is rightly trying to address. Some are pursuing perfection. Others — especially in the Labour Party — are just playing politics.But there’s also a group for whom the real issue is personal as well as the policy.They just don’t have faith in the Prime Minister. This is no big secret.More than a third of Tory MPs —  of them — voted against her leadership back in December. To get through that, Theresa May had to promise she wouldn’t lead the party into the next election. But now she may have to go further.I’ve heard senior backbenchers on all sides of the Conservative Party say that their concern about voting for the deal, is that it could mean the Prime Minister stays in place to negotiate our future relationship with the EU.They want someone  to take forward the next phase.If Theresa May manages to agree a deal — and I think she ultimately can — she will have achieved Mission Impossible.But to scrape that deal through the Commons she might, as Sun columnist James Forsyth has suggested, have to throw the kitchen sink at it by agreeing to step aside.Downing Street aides privately acknowledge that she doesn’t want to “go on and on”.

It is a shareholder in hundreds of ­companies, from Greggs and ­Wetherspoons through to Superdry and Moneysupermarket.The UK is already the third-largest destination for this Norwegian investment, and now they’re putting in more.It seems almost surprising, given the endless choruses of woe about Brexit and the pathetic state of our political class in Westminster. Who would want to bet on a country where the job of economic cheerleader is held by Philip Hammond, and the ­alternative is an out-and-out Marxist like John McDonnell The answer is that the Norwegians can see what we sometimes miss about our own country: The UK is a fantastic place to do business.Our legal system is respected around the world for its fairness and is viewed as a “gold standard” under which to sign contracts and do deals.Our corporate taxes are competitive, and are set to fall further. Our location and time zone help to make us a good bridge into markets around the world.Our language is spoken by billions of people, and is the chosen tongue of global business.Our culture is one that still prizes innovation and hard work, despite the best efforts of some Chancellors over the years.And most of all, our people — our greatest asset — are skilled and creative, as employers, inventors and workers alike.It doesn’t come naturally for us to blow our own trumpets and talk ourselves up, so sometimes it feels a bit awkward to ­consider the many things we have going for us.And we all love a good moan, to the degree that it’s essentially a national sport. But we should be careful that we don’t go too far and start to talk ­ourselves down.There’s a dference between being modest and acting like Eeyore with a hangover. Brexit in particular seems to have driven some people a bit loopy, so that you hear some who were once quite ­sensible now ranting about “destroying the country” or “falling off a clf edge”.To hear them, you would think we are a repellent disaster zone, about to slip beneath the waves never to be seen again, like Atlantis crossed with Towie.This is obviously ridiculous. Of course it’s possible that the process of leaving the EU will be dficult.Thanks to politicians who are still ­incapable of honouring their promises and agreeing a clear way forward, the uncertainty about our future ­relationship with our European neighbours has been allowed to drag on for far too long.But it isn’t Brussels, or even Westminster, that made this country wealthy and successful. It is an enterprising approach to le, combining imagination and hard work, that got us this far.Businesspeople and workers, not ­politicians, created the UK’s success.That won’t go away just because we aren’t paying Jean-Claude Juncker’s lunch expenses any more.And once we escape Brussels’ control, we will be free to be even more ­innovative and nimble in response to all the challenges and opportunities the modern age throws at us.The people entrusted with Norway’s £billion national wealth fund can see that. And they aren’t alone.In the latest available data, the UK was Europe’s top destination for foreign investment.Unlike the blowhards and scaremongers chucking out doom and gloom for ­retweets and laughs, these are serious investors, putting their money where their mouth is and betting that our country has a bright future.I know who I’d believe.Norway fund has holdings in:Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

was thrown out by MPs this week, causing him to officially throw his weight behind a fresh poll.They could bring forward their own plans to defy their own pro-Brexit voters with a new Commons vote on a second referendum as early as next week.Backbencher Peter Kyle said he was confident that the leadership would back his idea and senior figures are looking at the wording.He told the : I have every reason to believe that this will get the necessary support when the time comes.This ticks every single box and is the only credible proposal on the table right now, he added.The words could say Labour will withhold support for the PMs deal until its passed in a fresh peoples vote.They would then abstain on her agreement in the Commons to permit it to go through.Labour figures are speaking to MPs across the party to seethey can find a referendum motion they can get the whole party behind.But Brexiteers will be fuming with the idea that a second isive vote could be on the cards once more, and their own seats in Leave-voting areas could be at risk.Another high-stakes vote would open the door for Brexit to be cancelled completely as top Labour figures are desperate to put Remain on the ballot paper again.Brexiteer John Mann wrote today in LabourList: My voters are fed up with being patronised by a London-dominated, metropolitan elite within the Labour Party who seem to think they know best for what they want and why they voted to leave the EU.Two thirds of Labour-held seats voted to leave the EU and this must not be ignored in an attempt to reverse Brexit.And Remainers in Mr Corbyns party will be infuriated too at the thought of allowing Mrs Mays Brexit deal to go through at all, because they dont want to have anything to do with it.But evenMr Corbyn forces his MPs to vote for another referendum, its not likely there will be enough in the House of Commons to vote it through.This way the Labour boss keeps his Remain supporters happy by putting forward another vote, but its not likely to happen.Some Tories Remainers could get behind the plans but they arent likely to vote with Jeremy Corbyn.Earlier this week the party formally said they would get behind another isive poll, risking the total betrayal of millions of Leave voters.But he said that the party will try everything we can to influence and change Brexit - including an election.Mr Gardiner, who has long spoken out against another vote, told Question Time last night: If we do end up with a second referendum, I still believe that that does undermine trust in democracy in this country…I’ve always been clear that I think it is isive, I think it does undermine trust, but I now believe it is the only way that we have to stop no deal.Mrs May has said she will bring her deal back to the Commons before March , and is still seeking legal changes to it in the hope MPs will go for it.Labours John McDonnell revealed yesterday the party would either bring forward their own plans or support a fresh amendment at the same time.If her deal doesnt do through then MPs will be given a vote on whether to leave the EU with no deal in place at all - which is highly unlikely to pass.Then they will be

The hearing came just a day after his orce to Mrs Ainscough was finalised in the same court building.

What’s not to love about a couple of free extra days by a hotel pool while the sun is shining  I thought. Until it happened to me and my family this week, after Thomas Cook twice cancelled flights from Cancun while we were at the airport, leaving us delayed for  hours. Because with your head already checked out, your clothes stinking and information blackouts worse than Theresa May’s on Brexit, it was about as much fun as being locked in the gold-plated bathroom of Philip Green’s Med-sailing yacht watching him take a thrice-daily dump. But there was a silver lining. A chance to observe Brits abroad at their most stereotypical and realise that we probably survived the Blitz due to the quality of the comedy that adversity brings out. There’s the Smug Silver Surfers, with no jobs to worry about, who whooped when they heard they were being put up in a five-star hotel, told everyone  to chill as they grabbed another GT and bragged that the compo cheque would pay for another tan-tastic break.

As in “I used to deliver parts to engineering firms and I can tell you for a fact the part this plane’s waiting on won’t get here ’til next week.” The middle-aged man in the replica football shirt accosting random yellow-bibbed airport workers and demanding to know what’s going on, only to be told “Que  I am cleaner”. Who then walks back to his we, shaking his head in disgust and shouting: “Pedro over there hasn’t got a bloody clue. Typical.” There’s the Angry Teacher who thinks he’s in charge of a school trip who shouts down the pilot as he addresses us: “You’re feeding us misinformation. This is just like Kafka.”   Which draws puzzled looks from certain bystanders who think: “Ooh, Kafka sounds worse than Thomas Cook. I won’t be travelling with them.” Your daughter’s on shyFacebook telling schoolmates “THIS IS LIVING HELL”, while your son posts pictures back to shyworkmates of him by a swim-up pool bar with a glass of draft Corona saying: “The sheer agony of a plane delay.” Your partner head-butts her phone as she rows with a Twitter feed ironically called Thomas Cook Cares.

A poll of , festival-goers revealed the tradition of a festival in a field watching band after band is no longer what people want. According to the results, seven in  want activities to get involved with rather than just music to listen to. Popular pastimes Brits want to see on offer at festivals include dining out experiences and local tours, suggesting they’re after more of an overall holiday experience. Cosmin Sarbu, head of Admiral Travel Insurance, whose Ski Festivals Finder tool can help Brits find their perfect festival in the snow, said: “While a lot of people go to a festival to see their favourite bands, many also go for the atmosphere, a new location and other activities to take part in. “It’s important for festival goers – particularly those choosing their first festival – to find the right one for them to fully enjoy the experience.   “For an event which lasts on average a few days, there’s a lot of planning beforehand such as how to get to the festival, what to wear, and how much to budget.” The study also found tying in with the decline in the desire for classic field festivals, one in  are bucking the trend for summer festivals and would prefer a winter event now. It also emerged attendees would like to learn skills when not watching bands, such as playing an instrument, cooking and even skiing. And six in  said the perfect festival includes a mix of activities in the day and parties into the night. The most important factor when choosing from the endless choice of open air music events is the line-up, closely followed by cost and location.   Expectations have changed, as other top factors when deciding on a particular festival were revealed to be the uniqueness of the experience and the key theme. And far from the traditional tent, a hotel was named the ideal place to sleep, closely followed by a log cabin. In fact, three quarters would prefer a festival with a comfortable bed to go back to at night, with the average festival goer considering .am as the perfect time for their head to hit their pillow. But it also emerged rain, litter and insects are among the aspects Brits don’t want to see. Brits polled via OnePoll said the perfect festival will last four days and have no temporary toilets in sight.  While music festivals are clearly the most popular, with three quarters having been to one, other festival favourites include literature, skiing and food. The majority of Brits appear to be home birds, with  per cent choosing the UK for their perfect festival, followed by America and Spain. Cosmin added: “Festivals are no longer just for music – there’s huge ersity in festival types, from skiing and comedy events to food and literature festivals. “All this choice makes it even more important to make sure you’re heading to the right festival for you – location, atmosphere, cost and activities on offer are all part of the experience. “That’s why we’ve created the Ski Festival Finder, to allow people to filter for their preferences and find the best winter festival to suit them.

CRINGE!   But David Lammy is right, it’s both patronising and condescending to the people they’re trying to help and I’m glad he’s called her out for acting like a “white saviour” who’s perpetuating “tired and unhelpful stereotypes”. Comic Relief has a huge  and privilege and it’s the first major way children learn about Africa,” he said. “If they only show Africans as helpless victims to be pitied, children missed the broader picture of huge progress in Africa.” How can anyone disagree with this  Dooley weakly hit back at the politician saying: “You could always go there and try to raise awareness ”   In fact he’s been asked but he said no because he was didn’t want to become “part of a PR exercise”. Instead of launching an attack on Lammy, Dooley and Comic Relief should listen to what he has to say. Like David, I too feel deeply uncomfortable with this tired negative narrative that portrays Africa as a nation of starving, helpless people waiting for white people to come and save their lives. Throwing money at men, women and children is not to only way to help. For example, Comic Relief could save thousands of pounds on travel expensesthey used local camera crews, producers and editors.   This way they would be giving jobs to people to provide for themselves and their families. As someone who regularly goes to Ghana, west Africa, I can tell you the pictures of starving children covered in flies and living on rubbish dumps are not one that I see. In fact that’s one of the reasons AfroBeats artist Fuse ODG turned down Bob Geldof’s request to take part in the Band Aid  – he was frustrated with how negatively the lyrics portrayed Africa. I see a country undergoing rapid transition, incredible growth and one with a very bright future. If you’re planning a holiday, I can’t recommend it highly enough. Sometimes I think it has more going for it that Brexit Britain right now. While Comic Relief has done an amazing job in raising money and awareness it needs to change the record we need to hear more balanced stories about Africa, which, by the way is a continent, not a one country.

A spokesman for Harrow Council said this week: “A mother who kept her child off school for an entire year, without any permission or authorisation, has been given a curfew order, an electronic tag, community service, a fine - and a criminal record.  “Harrow Council took the woman to court after she not only refused to send her child to school, but also turned down all offers of help from the authorities. “The judge at Willesden Magistrates’ Court was unimpressed with her defence and ruled that her offence was one of the most severe of its kind.” Cllr Christine Robson, Harrow Council’s Cabinet Member for Children, Young People and Schools, said: “We take no pleasure in fining parents, or taking them to court, but we have a duty to make sure that children receive an education. “I trust that the severity of this punishment will make it clear to that small minority of parents that they cannot just keep their child out of school, simply because they want to. “Every child deserves a high quality education and the opportunity to develop the knowledge and skills that will help them into adulthood.” "},{"url":null,"title":"prince george princess charlotte adorable","story":"NewsPrince George and Princess Charlotte have adorable nickname for grandad CharlesPrince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis are said to believed very close to their grandfather Prince Charles, and he has said its \"bedlam\" when theyre aroundShareCommentsByZoe ForseyAudience Writer:,  MAR NewsPrince Charles is clearly very fond of his grandchildren\"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPrince Charles already has three adorable grandchild to keep him busy, and it wont be long before number four arrives.

Audio of the newly-released information is expected to be released by the the Colorado Board of Investigation on March .“Watts provided investigators with additional information about the murders of Shanann, Bella, and Celeste,” the agency said in a Thursday statement provided to ABC News.It comes after chilling footage emerged of Shanann just hours before she was murdered by her husband at their family home in Colorado.CCTV captured by the doorbell camera of their house shows the woman, who was  weeks pregnant, entering her house after being dropped off from the airport by a friend. The friend is seen waiting until the mum enters her home before driving off, unaware of the atrocity lying ahead.  After killing his we he buried her in a shallow grave at Anadarko Petroleum Corp in Colorado, while the girls were found stuffed in a nearby barrel of crude oil. Despite Watts admitting to first-degree murder, his father Ronnie said in my heart I know he didn’t kill those girls. He said his son calls him every night and knows the Bible inside and out. Its over and done with, Mr Watts said of the case. I am confused why they [the investigators] went out there in the first place.

It was thought McKenna Kenni Shea Xydias was suffering from a large gas build-up in her bowel after her stomach bloated and she came down with a C fever. Her concerned parents, Meagan and Mike, took her to see a paediatrician on February  and were left devastated when an MRI scan later revealed metastasised tumours, including as big as a grapefruit. With Kenni undergoing surgery and intensive chemotherapy to battle stage  yolk sac oian cancer, her devastated mum and dad have issued a desperate plea, saying: This poor baby needs your prayers.   Kenni, from the US city of Senoia, Georgia, is believed to be the youngest person in the US with this form of cancer, which targets the oian yolk sac. It normally affects girls and women aged between  and . She has since undergone surgery to remove most of the main tumour and her right oy. After going to the doctor with worrying symptoms, Kenni was taken to a doctor who ordered a scan, which revealed a tumour measuring cmand a number of smaller ones in her abdomen.   She underwent her first surgery on February , allowing doctors to remove  per cent of the main tumour and some of the smaller cancerous ones. Surgeons were able to save one oy but had to take some small intestines, according to a GuFundMe page, which so far has raised ,in financial support for the family. They hope chemotherapy treatments, which began on Wednesday, will help her to beat the disease. The GoFundMe page, launched by a family friend,states: McKenna Shea is a rambunctious two year old who has never let anything stop her, and never will!  It adds: Meagan and Mike are both educators who just recently started new jobs in dferent counties in Georgia, bought a house, and moved. Kenni also had two amazing older brothers which makes this family of five a little tight on finances. I hope that raising this money will help to ease their worries as they will be taking time off and be without income. Anything will help, including prayers. God has this all planned out, lets do our part.  After the youngsters latest round of chemo on Thursday, an update read: [Kenni] was a bit more sluggish and just happy to hang around and colour. She slept through her chemo treatment for the day. We went for a walk later this evening and made sure she got her exercise in. Other than that, K has been in a great mood acting her silly, goofy, spunky self - and we couldnt be more thankful for that!  The family added: We want to thank everyone for their continued love, support, and prayers. Thank you also for your donations as we continue to prepare for unpaid leave throughout treatment and medical expenses that we cant even comprehend at this point. Thank you for the Smile Grams, letters, and care packages as well. The caring and selflessness that we have encountered on this journey continues to astound us.  Please continue to pray for Kenni, for those who have shared in our comments their own battles against cancer, and for the children we have encountered who are fighting for their lives. Kennis parents have met with fertility doctors to discuss her ability to have children herself in the future. Mike wrote on the fundraising page: Having to consider how these tumours and consequential chemo will potentially effect Kenni in the long run, forces us to look at the big picture as well. Earlier, he told ABCs Good Morning America he had no idea a girl of such a young age could be affected by oian cancer. He said: I know Meagan and I both agree that Kenni is our hero with how shes dealing with this. She is a ball of energy and a stereotypical two-year-old. Shes the youngest child, where she is the boss and shes extremely stubborn, which a great character trait in going to fight cancer. She doesnt let anything stop her.

The Symphony of the Seas ship was docked at Nassau port, and passengers had been given an all-aboard time of .pm. At .pm, the gangway was removed and doors were closed – the couple arrived five minutes later. Footage of the couple running desperately for the ship was then shared across the world.  The video, taken from the neighbouring Norwegian Bliss cruise liner, shows them arrive, run to the front of the ship and converse with workers onboard, who presumably told them it was too late. The clip shows the pair waving their arms in hopes the ship would stop, and desperate screams of “No!” can be heard from as the vessel moves away. After three minutes, the ship starts blaring its departure horn signalling a final goodbye to the port — and the helpless couple are left behind. Maria, , explained on her Instagram that the cruise on the trip had always left at .pm but that day the ship left earlier.   The honeymooning couple had been given a new itinerary but didnt read it and assumed - wrongly - that the ship would leave on the same schedule as at other ports. Maria also claimed they were not the only passengers stranded at Nassau with six others also making the same mistake. The incident occurred on the sixth day of a seven-day cruise and from Nassau, the ship was ing to Miami, Florida.

A carwash manager named as Irina Volkova, , who has two older children, decided she did not want to keep her third baby, according to claims by local law enforcement. She is accused of selling the boy to a married woman called Anna, , who believed she could not have her own children. The women are suspected of a passport scam to fool medics into handing the baby to the buyer. The case is is seen as the tip of the iceberg of a disturbing black market trade in babies in Russia.   The women met online and concocted a scheme by which Anna pretended to be the biological mother, said Vladimir Tsurkanu, of the Russian Investigative Committee, which probes serious crime, cited by Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper. He warned: “Similar stories are taking place all around Russia. Police seek to block such attempts. “But women are trying to give birth using someone ’s documents to fool the legal system for adoption.”   There are fears that children can also be traded by for sex crimes or body parts. Irina went from her home city Penza to give birth in St Petersburg where Anna lives, he said. “The pregnant woman tookpassport and was admitted to hospital under the younger woman’s name. “Doctors spotted that the woman and the passport photograph did not match and made a note about it. “Next day after giving birthleft the maternity hospital without the baby.”   She handed back the internal passport - used by Russians as an ID document - to Anna who was detained when she went to the hospital to pick up the child. Both women were detained on suspicion of “trading a minor”, said Tsurkanu. “The birth mother was accused to selling her son.   “She pleaded guilty and repented. The other woman also gave evidence. “So far we have all the proof of the guilt of the women accomplices.” A court instructed that the baby should be given up for adoption - so neither Irina nor Anna will raise him. The St Petersburg prosecutor’s office said: “Both accused women face up to ten years in jail.” "},{"url":null,"title":"comeback kid paul mcmullan set for new dundee united deal","story":"Paul McMullan’s rebirth as a Dundee United player is set to be confirmed with a new contract for next season.As recently as last August, the former Celtic kid was told he was free to find a new club.At that time Partick Thistle were showing a strong interest but he decided to stay on and fight for his place at Tannadice.And since Robbie Neilson took over as manager in October, the -year-old has made  appearances and is again seen as a part of the squad.McMullan was signed up by Ray McKinnon in the summer of  and was a regular until falling out of favour under Csaba Laszlo early this season.Under the current boss, however, he’s played his part in United hauling themselves back into the Championship promotion race."},{"url":null,"title":"dundee airport set for a closure after air traffic controllers vote to strike because they earn less than london counterparts","story":"Air traffic controllers in Dundee are to strike because they don#t earn the same as their counterparts in London.The trade union Prospect has notied Highlands and Islands Airports Ltdof its intention to strike, following a ballot where staff voted #overwhelmingly# in favour of industrial action.Prospect has indicated the action could take place on days between April  and August .HIAL managing director Inglis Lyon says the decision #will impact services# at Inverness, Sumburgh, Kirkwall, Wick John O‘Groats, Stornoway, Benbecula and Dundee airports.The dispute involves a claim from the trade union for a double-digit wage increase in   or a long-term commitment to above inflation pay awards.More recently, Prospect has called for air traffic controllers in the Highlands and Islands and Dundee to have parity with controllers at London airports including Heathrow and Gatwick.Mr Lyon said in a statement: #We do not believe comparisons with staff in London control towers are germane, because the volume of traffic experienced, type of air traffic control practiced and cost of living in the South East of England are not comparable with HIAL airports.#As a government sponsored agency, HIAL must follow the Scottish Government pay policy.#Last year HIAL awarded up to three per cent, plus incremental progression, or a one per cent non-consolidated payment to those on the maximum of their grade, to all HIAL staff.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks. Why have we in Argyll after nine years, four dferent Transport Ministers and £m spent and still have no guaranteed safe passage   on The Rest and Be Thankful Follow the Argyll Advertiser#s campaign #Invest in the Rest#. Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"celtic and pictish festival returns","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead#s Celtic and Pictish Festival is back.On Saturday August , Lochgilphead#s front green will be swarmed with visiting figures of yesteryear, brandishing swords and helmets.In a celebration of our ancestors, last year#s festival included battle re-enactments and weapons demonstrations, ious living history demonstrations and workshops where adults and children can try their hand at traditional crafts such as spinning, weaving, stone carving, woodwork, dressing up and blowing a Celtic war horn.Visitors will get a taste of what le was like for those who came before us."},{"url":null,"title":"casa hair to host charity variety show","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowArdrishaig hair salon Casa is hosting a iety show for the most fabulous of days.Run by Lilia Sinclair, on Saturday February , the doors to Casa will open to a world of hair turned new, vibrant colours, stalls full of items to make you look and feel good and a fashion show of dresses to try on for your wedding day whether the groom is chosen or not.There#s also something for youngsters with a disco in Ardrishaig North Hall.The day starts at am with a coffee morning, stalls, jumble sale, bottle stall and home baking, followed by the Casa hair and fashion show at pm, featuring designer brides dresses and the latest #hair colour applications, ideas and trends of #.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"emergency glasgow prestwick airport cessna","story":"NewsEmergency at Glasgow Prestwick Airport as Cessna plane overshoots runway after engine failureThe incident saw a Cessna  overshoot the runway following the loss of engine power.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB News \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn emergency was declared at Prestwick Airport this afternoon after a light aircraft overshot the runway.

Little Saul Wylie will travel to America for le-changing treatment on his severe form of cerebral palsy. The six-year-old, who weighed just lb at birth, has made the waiting list for pioneering surgery. There has been a massive charity effort across Ayrshire to fund the trip, with pound, raised in little over six months.Mum Karen, , told the Ayrshire Post : “To achieve this so quickly is beyond our wildest dreams.“We set a target of two years to get the money but the community reaction has been incredible.” Saul, of Tarbolton, has to go to the States because his aggressive condition is not treated on the NHS. The brave kid lives with spastic diplegia cerebral palsy, which affects his muscle tone and leaves him unable to walk unaided. Karen said: “Saul’s dream is to be able to stand by himself and take independent steps and maybe even one day walk around school with his friends. “Like every parent, we long for endless opportunities for our boy. “Saul is very happy and determined but we just want him to have the best opportunity at a better quality of le and to become as independent as possible.”  Medication, Botox, and even trampoline therapy have all been used to try and limit Saul’s pain. But his spot at St Louis Children’s Hospital in Missouri could be the ultimate answer. Karen said: “The operation is called selective dorsal rhizotomy, which will reduce Saul’s muscle stfness. “Added to intensive rehab, it will allow Saul to stand independently and potentially walk again. Unfortunately there is a waiting list for international patients so Saul’s surgery is not scheduled until . “But because we are in a position to go we have been put on their cancellation list and are keeping our fingers crossed.” Karen and husband Stuart have thrown themselves into a string of fundraising events with the ‘Steps For Saul’ campaign gathering momentum. Karen said: “We’ve done everything from coffee mornings to quiz nights and we can’t thank people enough for their response. “There have been skyes, race nights, sponsored cycles and I also did the Great Scottish Run. “People have taken Saul to their hearts and we’ve even had donations from as far afield as America, New Zealand, Canada and Ireland. “Hopefully he now has the chance he deserves.” • An open ice skate for Saul will take place at Ayr Ice Rink on Sunday, April , from -pm.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnDrugsCerebral palsyCharityAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14070383.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/0_wrtwrt.jpg","title":"hmv re opens three scottish","story":"NewsHMV re-opens three Scottish stores after successful negotiations with landlordsThe companys managing director confirmed the move was \"the best outcome for our staff and customers\".ShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsGeneral view of HMV at Ayr Central\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMusic giant HMV has re-opened its shop in Ayr Central shopping centre.

Sleazy retired architect Ross McKay will also be kept under court supervision for the same period. McKay, , insisted he was innocent of the sordid behaviour but he was found guilty after a trial last month. Sherf John Montgomery told McKay: “You have been convicted of conduct which, in my estimation, contains a substantial sexual element and a signicant sexual aspect by clandestinely taking photos of female schoolgirls wearing short skirts. “At  years of age you really should be able to control yourself more appropriately than you have done by indulging in this sort of behaviour.” Sherf Montgomery warned McKay: “I detect an air of defiance from you, both at your trial and in what you have told the author of your criminal justice social work report. “My advice to you is keep a low profile. Do not put yourself in a position where it can be construed you have the aim of self-gratication.” Defence lawyer Gillian McBlane successfully argued against the imposition of a stringent sex offender prevention order against her client. This was requested by depute fiscal Vicky McMillan, and would have kept McKay out of public parks and well away from schools.   Ms McBlane said: “He is first offender and there is little to suggest he presents a signicant risk to the public.” Sherf Montgomery reminded her: “He continues to deny responsiblility.” But Ms McBlane maintained: “He very much recognises the authority of the court and he has assured me of his commitment to any order you might impose.” McKay, of Ardlochan Terrace in Maidens, insisted at his trial that he had not taken the photos of Belmont Academy schoolgirls in mini skirts that were found on his phone. He also denied stopping his car in Peggieshill Road to take the images, although the court heard evidence of a vehicle with the same registration as McKay’s parked there. The offences took place in mid- and again in March .

Bernard Cotton was at Alloway Bowling Club when he collapsed and died on Thursday last week. He had been club champion on ious occasions, the last time in . But it was as manager of the Gaiety from  to  that Bernard made his biggest impact. He took over at a critical time when the theatre’s ownership passed from the Popplewell family to the Royal Burgh of Ayr. But Bernard was the perfect man for the job, having managed the Empire Theatre in his home town of Sunderland. There he had hosted shows featuring The Beatles and Hollywood legend Marlene Dietrich. “He even shared a McEwan’s Export with Marlene,” said son Sam, . “They didn’t have any champagne to give Marlene so she had what dad was drinking - only with ice.”. Bernard was no ordinary theatre manager and often directed big showpiece events like pantos and summer season shows. He quickly became respected by some of the biggest names on the Scottish scene. He booked acts like Jimmy Logan, Billy Connolly, Rikki Fulton, Jack Milroy and perennial Gaiety favourite Johnnie Beattie. Bernard also knew some of the biggest UK stars, bringing Ken Dodd, Barbara Windsor, Pat Phoenix and Lionel Blair to the Gaiety.  He did not shy away from tough decisions, booking the controversial erotic revue ‘Oh! Calcutta!’ in . He later recalled: “It brought much adverse publicity and even the poster was frowned upon - to such an extent that the management agreed to cover over the female posterior that was displayed upon it.” However, the show was a massive financial success with only two unsold seats in a week-long run. Sam remembers his dad sharing a story of a couple walking out of the show in high dudgeon. Bernard asked them why, as it had been advertised as an X-rated show. The shocked couple told him they thought they had booked to see ‘Oklahoma!’. Another of Bernard’s controversial - but highly successful - bookings was ‘The Rocky Horror Show’, which attracts enthusiastic fans who often dress in stockings, corsets and suspenders. For although Bernard principally ran a family theatre, he believed it should cater for all tastes. A post on the Gaiety Facebook page says: “We are deeply saddened to hear about the loss of Bernard Cotton, a much loved colleague, dedicated family man and friend to all. “Bernard was and is a Gaiety institution, from his own time managing our Old Lady to helping us shape her future. We simply couldn’t have done it without his support. “His guidance, golden nuggets from years gone by, witty humour and love for delivering high-quality theatre for all were second to none. He will be sorely missed by us all. “At this sad time we are thinking of his beloved we Vida and children Julia and Sam. “We wish them moments of peace and comfort as they remember a husband, father and friend who was so cherished. “He will forever be in our hearts and minds and will always have a place in his beloved theatre.”  Musician Martin Henderson commented: “Bernard was witty, professional and a family man, a privilege to have worked for many years in the Gaiety while Bernard and Vida were at the helm. “He ran a tight ship but embraced risky ventures like our annual mock panto, which needs no explanation to Gaiety staff. A sad loss to Scottish theatre and his family.” Journalist Alistair Nicol said: “I met Bernard when I was deputy editor of the Ayrshire Post in  and he was always helpful and a great inspiration to all around him in the entertainment world.” Bernard Cotton was a former president of the Rotary Club of Ayr He is survived by we Vida, a stalwart Gaiety volunteer who formerly ran the theatre’s costume department London-based daughter Julia, , a former dancer and Brighton-based son Sam.

and a foot-tapping reminder of the swinging sexism of the late s.For anyone who enjoys those wonderful kitchen-sink dramas of the decade - A Taste of Honey, Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, or Poor Cow - this is for you.Although, in fairness, at times it feels more Sid James than Shelagh Delaney as the humour and slapstick of Carry On provide plenty of laughs.And for anyone, like myself, who doesnt already know Made in Dagenham the Musical, dont despair... the songs, like the early Ford Cortinas, are instantly adorable.Kirsty Cleland has all the allure of a young Rita Tushingham as she enchants, enthrals and entertains in the lead role.As a strike-leader and long-suffering we, the Galashiels actress is both convincing and commanding.And the ever-reliable Stuart Mitchell, who plays hard-done-by husband Eddie, has to be at the top of his game not to be outshone.But, in true socialist fashion, Made in Dagenham the Musical isnt just about the leads... everyone has their part to play - and how well they play it.Tracy Borthwick is having a blast as the potty-mouthed Beryl.And Amanda Blacklock is pitch perfect as the hapless Clare who attempts to keep up with the flow of double-entendres.Ellen McFadzen, with her Viv Nicholson hair-style and shortening mini-skirts, is a delight as sassy Sandra.And the shopfloor resolve is perfectly pitched by Ellen Halliday, as Cassie, and Julie Craig, as Connie.Relationships, friendships and even governments are tested in this factual story which, historically, helped females eventually earn an equal footing when it came to filling up pay packets.Robin Murray could challenge Mike Yarwood with his hilarious performance as Harold Wilson.And hes regularly brought down a peg or two by the feisty Rachel Inglis as Barbara Castle.Made in Dagenham the Musical is a battle of the classes as much as the sexes, with Jodie Millar and Yvonne Mitchell providing some gentried grace.The dialogue is a delight, the foot-to-the-floor pace is perfect, and the choreography, costumes, straight from Carnaby Street, and score makes sure this is a production that will strike a chord for decades to come.But for any musical production to be a success, it needs songs.From the brilliant opening scene, this show doesnt disappoint.Busy Women, Everybody Out and Viva Eastbourne are nothing other than tremendous encore numbers that bring out the very best of this talented cast.But perhaps the highlights are Julie Craigs sensational take on the riveting Same Old Story, Rachel Inglis reaching the high notes in the incredible Ideal World, and the delightful duet of Stuart Mitchell and Kirsty Cleland with the making-up masterpiece Im Sorry, I Love You.Made in Dagenham the Musical is a celebration of women fighting for their rights.While it succeeds, this move away from the comfort zone is more of a testament to just how good Selkirk Musical Theatre Company has become.If you havent yet got your tickets... join the picket line quickly and dont be disappointed.Made in Dagenham the Musical runs every night this week at .pm with an additional matinee performed on Saturday at pm.CASTRita OGrady -

So far,  volumes of Hoggrsquos work have been collected, and  have been published.The project started in the mid s and the estimated finishing date wonrsquot be till .The programme of events is still

One of the ways is by going into local businesses to encourage them to cut down on what they use.ldquoAn idea we have also had is introducing a pint deposit scheme, similar to the one which is in place at Murrayfield.ldquoThat is something we could look at bringing to Melrose at events such as the Rugby Sevens to cut down on single use plastic.

Now, with less regulation in place, there are thousands.’True to the name, Viola FC is a family-run agency # his son Johnny joined its ranks in early  # with their main work both in representing players coming to the UK, and ‘brokering’.John explained: ‘We mostly represent footballers transferring to the UK, while brokering involves working with clubs, players and other agents to help bring those players here.‘That said, we have done a lot of work in countries such as Brazil and China in recent years, where there is a huge appetite for football. You make valuable contacts and get to see some exciting players.’However, for John the image of the football agent thrashing out a lucrative deal for himself as well as for the player, fails to tell the whole story.He explained: ‘Of course working in football can be financially rewarding, but it’s a hard job. People think you’re just walking around in a suit with a laptop and phone, but so much goes into being a player representative.‘You need to travel a lot, and that means lots of airport lounges and hotel rooms.‘You’re working long days and doing lots behind the scenes, and all year round,  because that’s what it takes.‘The public see the excitement of the transfer windows on TV and then think that’s all agents do.‘If an agent does their job properly, they are available day and night, looking after the whole package for the player, like houses and children’s schooling.‘We’re more than a ‘necessary evil’, we do an important service for both the club, and the player.’Thinking about Campbeltown visits again, John brings up a memorable trip to the Wee Toon, where his son Johnnybecame an unofficial pool champ.John said: ‘My uncle John took us to the Commercial Inn to watch a game of football on the TV.

Such days are ones which have been borrowed from another month, and I think given the temperature and weather we have had recently the days have been borrowed from May.In , May will have borrowed Februaryrsquos days, so we can expect some unseasonal weather in that month as well, but in a dferent way.Sunday was a borrowed day for sure it was so mild and the later part sunny with a feeling of spring in the air. It was a perfect day for a discovery.We set off to find a place Irsquod only recently heard about. A friend had asked me what I knew about the lsquoKingrsquos Chairrsquo by Gullane. I had to admit that Irsquod never heard of it. He told me one of the holes at the golf course there has this name, but it seems it is named after a location nearby.This set me investigating. Sure enough, I found it marked on the map and searched for an image, which I found on a website called Ancient Stones: a large boulder, shaped like a throne, guarded by two other stones either side. It intrigued me and so our quest began.The starting point of our adventure was Gullane Beach car park. I knew roughly where to look but purposefully hadnrsquot brought the map so that we had a challenge to find the lsquochairrsquo. We knew what it looked like and that we needed to walk along the upper path, not the one that heads for the beach.We went the wrong way at first and got stuck in a mass of sea buckthorn, but on reflection that just added to the sense of adventure and achievement. We soon found our way and then suddenly there it was, up on Gullane Hill. The kids ran excitedly towards the stones, shouting: ldquoFound it, found it.I felt quite exhilarated at the discovery, and to be honest impressed by the sight of the Kingrsquos Chair. I can see how it got its name, as it looks something like a majestic reclining armchair. The two boulders on either side of it look like sentries keeping watch.The kids sat on it, of course, and I had to wait my turn after my we, who reckoned it could just as easily be a lsquoQueenrsquos Chairrsquo.When I finally got a chance to seat my majestic posterior on the chair, I realised the view was majestic as well, with Gullane Beach very visible in the near distance.I reflected on the fact we had recently visited Edinburgh Castle and seen the Stone of Destiny or Stone of Scone, along with the crown jewels. This rather uninspiring stone in Edinburgh Castle may be the coronation stone used for  years in England, but it is not, I am sure, the coronation stone used by ancient kings of Scotland, despite official claims that it is.I think itrsquos pretty clear that Edward I never got his hands on the real Stone of Destiny and I am convinced it has remained in Scotland, hidden somewhere, ever since. It occurred to me that this stone actually better fitted the early description of the original coronation stone at Scone than the one in Edinburgh Castle.ldquoImaginethis is the real Stone of Destiny and has been here all the time, I said fancully out loud. I know it isnrsquot, of course, but I have to saythis Kingrsquos Chair was on display at Edinburgh Castle it would certainly look more authentic.But sadly there seems to be no recorded tradition connected to this Kingrsquos Chair. I could find no story, or reference to the origin of its name. Perhaps some local people have some information on this There is an entry from the s that records the name, citing locals as the source, so there is some historic veracity in its title. But no suggestion is offered for the origin of the name, or any tradition associated with the stone. Its geology I could not say but it doesnrsquot seem to be a glacial erratic.And so we are left to wonder. We discussed how the stone got here and how it got its name. Maybe some children played here many generations ago and gave the boulder its title. Perhaps a Viking king who landed on Gullane Beach sat himself down on this natural throne to survey his warriors at their bloody work.Whatever the origin, the name, the location and the nature of the stone make this a worthwhile and fun discovery, even without a firm legend attached to it.And as I sat on the chair I watched smoke billowing from the coastline a little further to the west, close to the edge of Aberlady nature reserve. What caused the fire I didnrsquot know, but even from a distance it seemed destructive.It was a prophetic sight to witness from the Kingrsquos Chair. It looked like a burning coastline from a Viking raid. Thankfully the distant screech of fire engines told us help was on the way. The children wanted to go see the fire, but we kept our distance from the flames and let the firefighters do their job.So the trip to the Kingrsquos Chair had been an adventure in more ways than one. On our way back, the children advanced dferent theories about the origin of the name. It was universally agreed that a story must be made, but no agreement on the actual tale.ldquoPerhaps, I said, ldquowe should leave it to the imagination of those who search for and discover it, so they can sit and feel the power of the place and get ideas.My imagination was certainly ablaze. I saw the leader of the ancient Gododdin tribe, King Loth, sitting on the stone, looking out to the Firth as he watched his terried daughter in a small coracle being taken out to the open sea, his brutal punishment for her defiance of his authority.The story would fit as her journey began at Aberlady Bay, and so her small craft would have been seen from the Kingrsquos Chair as it passed by, being pulled out to sea by one of the kingrsquos boats.Itrsquos all a fancy of my imagination, of course, but thatrsquos my story.

Irsquom not sure who exactly has been preventing transgender women using public conveniences. So far as I know, you donrsquot have to show a birth certicate, or undergo a medical exam to have a pee. But what do I know as a pale, stale male.What I do know is that ldquocis-gender is an ugly neologism which many women find offensive. They are content with their present sexual terminology. ldquoCis is in the same linguistic ballpark as ldquoTERF ndash trans exclusionary radical feminist, which is a term of abuse used against women who believe persons with penises are, er, male. I should be careful here because a number of TERFS have been banned from social media for saying that a person with a penis is a man. So I wonrsquot say that.Instead, letrsquos just take it as read that in future we are going to have to accept that the concept of sexual dferentiation with which we have been living for thousands of years is finally being exposed as a malign transphobic hood. At any rate, the Scottish Government appears determined to press ahead with reform of the Gender Recognition Act, which will allow trans people to assign themselves legally and biologically female. Hitherto, trans people have had to undergo medical examination and get a diagnosis of ldquogender dysphoria. No more. From now on, anyone can change their birth certicate to whatever they wish.Earlier this month, Holyroodrsquos culture committee warned that ending binary ldquoMale or Female questions in the Scottish census will render much of the results meaningless and, willy nilly, import an unscientic definition of sex into the law. But the Scottish Government is not listening. Nicola Sturgeon told a UN equalities conference last week that the concerns of feminists about the GRA are ldquomisplaced.Women ndash sorry, ldquomenstruators ndash who say that self-ID erases their sexual identity will be told: just get over it. They can complain that ldquosex is a protected characteristic under the  Equalities Act, and that women therefore have a right to their own unique spaces. But now that men can actually become women under the law, this right will be impossible to articulate. Trans women with male anatomy will be entitled to enter womenrsquos changing rooms, girl guide troops or womenrsquos prisons. Women who complain will be guilty of transphobia, and are likely to be visited by the police recording a ldquohate incident.Now, I have nothing against adults changing their gender, or identying as women, queer, non-binary, intersex or whatever. It seems to be reinforcing outmoded concepts of gender to suggest that, because someone wants to wear dresses, play with dolls and put on makeup, they must have a lady brain in a male body. I thought we had left pink-for-girls gender stereotyping behind. But never mind. No-one wishes trans people any ill ndash certainly not me. But now that we are abandoning the very biological definition of sex, there are some anomalies that need to be addressed.Last week, a British transgender man, who had IVF by sperm donation and gave birth, won a court battle to prevent his child having ldquomother on its birth certicate. It will be the first child in history to have no mother. The The AIRE Centre, a human rights charity, contested this on the grounds that it would make le dficult for the child in future, when they apply for visas or anything which enquires about family background. The Government said simply that this isnrsquot a problem. From now on, fathers can give birth ndash end of.But Irsquom not sure this is the end of the matter. Children have not been included in the gender recognition debate thus far, even though they have rights too. It could be psychologically disturbing for a child to find, one day, that its mother has decided to become its dad. That song ldquoSometimes I feel like a motherless child takes on a whole new meaning.Of course, the trans parent will still be present, but is it OK to expect a child to suddenly start calling her natural mother her father  I would have thought that a child has a continuing right to a legal motherthey were born with one. If misgendering a trans person is unacceptable, surely demothering a child should be too. This is going to be confusing to say the least.Then there is the question of sport. The controversy over athlete Caster Semenya, a woman with high testosterone, raises the question of how to regard trans womenrsquos participation in women-only sport. Athletes who have testes, and therefore posses greater body mass, muscle strength and bone density, have an unfair advantage over old-fashioned women who have genetically female bodies.Next week, the International Association of Athletics Federations will argue in a hearing in Switzerland that people like Semenya should take testosterone-suppressing drugs before competing. Not only would this drive a coach and horses through the anti-doping protocols, it surely poses problem for transgender athletes who, of course, also take drugs like testosterone to help them transition to their ldquocorrect male sex. I hope the sporting authorities can get their heads around that because I canrsquot.Yet this is a very live issue in many sports. In the US, the ban on trans women taking part in power-lting events is being lted to prevent accusations of discrimination. You might have thought that having beefy, male-bodied women participating in these contests is discriminating against women athletes. Though, of course, only transphobes would say that, so we wonrsquot go there.The logical solution to this conundrum is to end sexual segregation in sport. Andwomen who are born biologically female never win any medals, tough. Strangely, there doesnrsquot seem to be the same issue about female-bodied trans men participating in male-only sport . Irsquom sure that has nothing whatever to do with the fact that they wonrsquot win anything.So welcome to the brave new world of post-sexual dferentiation, where men become women and fathers have children. It is one of the most radical and abrupt cultural changes in human history.Women have had a pretty bad deal in previous centuries, when they were regarded often as chattels without rights. In some Muslim societies theyrsquore still second-class citizens. Now, as women are finally emerging from the shadow of patriarchy, they are being told, by men, that they no longer have exclusive rights to their sexual identity.Itrsquos a weird turn of events. It seems women are just on the wrong side of history. But somehow, I donrsquot think theyrsquoll go quietly."},{"url":null,"title":"Marianne Taylor  Last chance for Mundell to put country before party","story":"The majority of these demands are perfunctory, of course, made in the knowledge and expectation that they will be ignored by the target, while playing well with the initiatorrsquos supporters.The craziness of the last few months has precipitated a flurry of genuine and warranted resignation demands, however, which under normal political circumstances would have resulted in multiple ministerial heads rolling in any other era the Prime Minister would have been forced out long ago.Marianne Taylor: BBC is better off without Neil and HumphrysAnother case in point is Scottish Secretary David Mundell, whose stubborn insistence on being ineffectual in the face of the biggest crisis this country has faced in generations is matched only by that of Jeremy Corbyn. Mr Mundellrsquos wan smiles and empty words about doing the best for Scotland as the Government he is a member of readies itself to push us off the no-deal Brexit clf, is as astonishing as it is appalling. He, too, should have gone months ago, not least over the manner in which his party has arrogantly steamrollered over the views and interests of the country he supposedly represents.Read more: Mundell should resign there is no-deal BrexitRemarkably still in post, Mr Mundell now has one last chance to make a meaningful contribution to the ridiculous and dangerous situation the Westminster parliament has created for itself. The SNP is right to call for Mr Mundell to show some mettle and make clear that he will not serve in a Government that is willing to take us out of the European Union without a deal, a situation that would put the already fragile Scottish economy on the road to ruin. As the Scottish Secretary is well aware, businesses will fail, jobs will be lost and real people will suffer the sort of real hardships that will be dficult to recover from.Marianne Taylor: BBC is better off without Neil and HumphrysSNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford has written to Mr Mundell, laying out the gravity of the situation and calling on him to back growing cross-party demands to halt the Brexit process by extending Article  and making clear to his boss, Theresa May, that he will resign unless she faces up the extremists in her party and takes no-deal off the table.At this critical juncture, the least that the people of Scotland deserve from the man who represents them at Cabinet level is honesty about where his loyalties lie: will he put country or party first  Mr Mundell, it really is that simple.Read more: Mundell should resign there is no-deal BrexitOf course, Mr Blackfordrsquos letter also highlights the bleakness of the dilemma facing the SNP. If Mrs May gets her way and Parliament is faced with a last-minute binary choice between her terrible deal - which deprives us of the key benefits being in the EU - and an even more catastrophic no-deal, it leaves the party in a dficult position. How should Nicola Sturgeon instruct her MPs to vote in this scenario  Backing Mrs Mayrsquos ldquomy way or the highway deal would be criticised by many as a U-turn of epic proportions and a sign of weakness. Not voting for it, and thus facilitating a no-deal Brexit, would likely be viewed by many voters as unforgivable, leaving the party open to allegations that this is the outcome it has been secretly hoping for all along, in order to boost support for independence.Ms Sturgeon and her colleagues will be hoping the growing number of Tory ministers and backbench MPs ndash including Cabinet secretaries Amber Rudd, Greg Clarke and David Gauke - poised to revolt against their leader should she refuse to rule out a no-deal Brexit, will come to their rescue in the frantic days and weeks to come.Marianne Taylor: BBC is better off without Neil and HumphrysThe emergence of the The Independent Groupmay also end up helping the SNPrsquos predicament, at least in the short term. Formed last week when eight MPs resigned from Labour unhappy at Mr Corbynrsquos disastrous leadership, it did not initially appear to be an important development. But when three Tory MPs also resigned and joined up, using the moment to launch a blistering attack on Mrs Mayrsquos disastrous Brexit strategy and their partyrsquos lurch to the right, it started to feel more signicant.What binds these MPs from dferent sides of the House of Commons is dismay at the drt of both parties to the extremities. And despite not being a proper party - yet - or having any actual policiesit seems many voters quite like what they see.Read more: Mundell should resign there is no-deal BrexitMomentum has grown over the weekend, with polls already putting the group on  per cent, just one behind the increasingly irrelevant Lib Dems.Many are asking whether TIG has a future. Surely, however, whatrsquos most important is the future of the country, andthis new movement serves only to facilitate the halting of Article , so that a new road out of the current mess can be found, then it will already have done more for the UK than Mr Corbyn. Or indeed Mr Mundell for that matter."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7808758.jpg?type=article-full","title":"match-made-in-heaven-helping-you-plan-your-dream-wedding","story":"Moda DeaThe award-winning fashion boutique specialises in Mother of the Bride and Groom, cocktail and casual wear in sizes eight-, and accessories including hats fascinators to match every outfit.Their award-winning Rainbow shoes are also available and can be dyed to any colour.

Some clubs - and he did not name them - have up to  of such fans.The Scottish Police Federation, which represents the forcersquos rank and file, was even blunter. Its vice chair, David Hamilton, said Scotland ldquohad a resurgence of old problems.Legislation - widely criticised - to deal with sectarianism and hooliganism has been repealed. This, rightly or wrongly, suggest some sources has emboldened problematic elements of Scotlandrsquos football clubs.:Police warns of rising sectarian attacks on officers at Scottish footballEnter Will Kerr, the national forcersquos new deputy chief constable. The Northern Irishman crossed The Sheuch to Scotland in September after decades policing his home turf. He knows about sectarianism. And yet, he told a meeting of his ruling board, he was surprised by what he had seen at Scottish grounds.Will Kerr when still in Northern IrelandSpeaking at a meeting of the Scottish Police Authority in Greenock, he said: ldquoThe vast majority of fans who go to these football matches do so entirely peacefully and just want to enjoy the wonderful spectacle that is Scottish football.ldquoBut what Irsquove been surprised at over the last six months, particularly when it comes to behaviour at football matches, has been two things.ldquoOne has been that level of sectarianism on display and I say that having policed in Northern Ireland for nearly  years.ldquoIrsquove been surprised at how much it is seen as normal... It feels almost visceral in a way I havenrsquot experienced for quite a while.Mr Kerr added: ldquoIrsquove also been surprised just at the level of disorder on display at the some of the football matches and we have been concerned, particularly over the last  months, that there has been a rise in both disorder, that type of offensive behaviour and the levels of aggression to police officers.ldquoWersquove had officers pulled off horses, spat at, attacked - very aggressive behaviour towards them.ldquoWe had a police horse which had pyrotechnic flare thrown at it a couple of weeks ago and was injured to the extent it had to go to the vet.ldquoAgain, Irsquove been surprised that the consistently thuggish behaviour of a very small number of fans is considered normal. This is not normal. It is a sport.ldquoOn both fronts there is a responsibility and a need for everybody, including the police service, to collectively challenge ourselves about how much thatrsquos considered normal and what we can actually do to address it.:Scottish football needs strict liability - heres why we wont get itMr Kerr admitted it was hard to measure the rise in aggression. His remarks, he explained were based on feelings of officers policing the matches.The issue, he said, should not be left to the police. Mr Kerr said clubs, fans, and councils all need to look at what can be done dferently to change this behaviour ldquofrom being normal to being unacceptable.He said part of that will be enforcement but ldquowersquore certainly not going to arrest our way out of this.Scotland is getting outside help. An independent review of policing at football matches in Scotland is due to be launched next week.The sport, meanwhile, is resisting calls for strict liability, when clubs could be punished for the behaviour of their fans. Anti-sectarianism campaigners favour that response.Dave Scott, director of Nil by Mouth, said: ldquoWe canrsquot ignore the loud and angry minority that seem to revel in this behaviour and feel the laws of the land donrsquot apply once they buy a match ticket.ldquoThis problem is compounded by the total lack of action by clubs and governing bodies being allowed to repeatedly bury their heads in the sand on this issue.Other solutions  Liberal Democrats Thursday mooted closing the stands of clubs plagued by trouble."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-set-to-call-for-power-to-hold-indyref2","story":"With the UKstill mired in negotiating a way through Brexit, sources claim there is an expectation at Westminster that the First Minister will soon request a section  order, granting the Scottish Parliament the right to hold another referendum.But it is widely expected that the answer would be no, with a member of the UK Government telling the BBC: ldquoThere is no answer to this, other than now is not the time.Some commentators believe Ms Sturgeon may even be expecting a firm rejection from Downing Street to stir the pot.But a national broadcaster has reported that, based on internal polling for the Conservatives, opposition to another referendum is hardening and one minister said: \"Once youve hit the iceberg, youre all on it together.In response, Ms Sturgeon tweeted: ldquoThe justication here from a UK Minister for trying to block Scotlandrsquos right to choose independence is quite something - lsquoonce youve hit the iceberg, youre all on it togetherrsquo.\"Well, actually, no, Scotland does not have to sink with the Brexit ship.Ms Sturgeon indicated in January that details of the timetable for a second referendum would be revealed within ldquoweeks.Opposition leaders were quick to attack the prospect of a second independence referendum.Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: ldquoThere is no mandate for another isive independence referendum. The SNP failed to win a majority at the last election and the Greens have failed to deliver their million signatures they said would be required before another referendum should be sanctioned.ldquoIn any case, why would we compound the chaos of Brexit with the chaos of independence. Breaking up a  year old partnership is proving to be a disaster, breaking up the  year old UK would be so much worse.ldquoWe all need to focus on stopping Brexit, not breaking up the UK.The last occasion the Prime Minister knocked back a call for a second referendum was in  when she used similar wording then, saying: ldquoNow is not the time.The BBC further reported, though, that senior figures in the SNP may use an election to force the issue, saying itis \"pretty obvious what well campaign on andsuggesting such a vote would largely be about the right to hold a referendum.Scotland - where  per centvoted to stay in the EU - voted by % to remain in the UK in the referendum of September , which was billed as a ldquoonce in a generation event.But Ms Sturgeon has been open about her intention to have a second referendum because \"Scotland is being dragged out of the EU against its will.Earlier this month, one of Ms Sturgeonrsquos closet advisors said she should offer the softest possible form of independence in order to win over voters.Andrew Wilson, who chaired the SNPs Growth Commission, said: \"In the parlance of Brexit, we offer the softest of possible changes to the current arrangements, not the hardest. We recognise the level of integration and all the ties that have bound us for centuries. We create a  that can uny a majority for progress that stands a chance of winning and winning big.\"The comments infuriated many within the wider Yes movement keen to have another referendum as soon as possible - SNP MP Angus MacNeil, former MP George Kerevan and former SNP leader Alex Salmond have all argued for using the chaos over Brexit to press for a second referendum, but debate continues within the party on the timing of another vote.Responding to the latest reports, an SNP spokesman said: \"The Toriesrsquo arrogance is exceeded only by their incompetence.\"The fact is that the future of Scotland will be decided by the Scottish people not by Theresa May who, letrsquos be frank, is fast becoming a parody of herself.\"The last couple of years are littered with examples of the PM taking lsquocast ironrsquo positions that later crumbled to dust.

Designed to stand in Parliament Square, it was rejected due to fears it would become a target for protestors.In rejecting the effigy, Westminster councillors said the administration has a -year principle of waiting a decade after a persons death before erecting a statue, which seems far too liberal. A century would be wiser, and never wiser still.Having wholeheartedly rejected Maggies statue, the borough has re-gted it to the former prime ministers home town of Grantham.Initially, it was recommended the statue be placed on a plinth three feet high to protect it. Now, though, the ft work will sit on a granite block the same height to keep it well out of the way of politically-motivated vandals.In the interim, the statue is being held in a secret location and Im quite sure there are many who would like it to remain there, as would I. Not because its Maggie, but because its a statue.The day after the death of George Mendonsa, the US sailor famously photographed kissing a stranger at the end of World War Two, a statue depicting the moment was vandalised with #MeToo graffiti.

Pity poor Victoria Wood, whose statue has been panned for looking more like Tory MP Michael Fabricant. Your les work immortalised with a statue looking more like the passable likeness of a passport photo than a flattering commemoration.The sculptor behind a bronze bust of footballer Cristiano Ronaldo had to have a second crack at it, it bore such an appalling resemblance to the man.In Glasgow, a campaign is underway to build a statue to Benny Lynch, Gorbals boxing sweetheart, one of the best boxers Scotland has ever produced.Lynch, born in , died at the age of  from alcohol-related malnutrition, but prior to that had had an astounding career that included winning the British, European and world flyweight titles.Lynch was also a convicted child abuser and domestic abuser. He assaulted two young girls of seven and  in a Glasgow cinema, and he was convicted of assaulting his we and his -year-old sister-in-law. A charge of trying to gas his baby son over a kitchen stove was found not proven.As a society, we take the bizarre view that offences of real gravity can be overlookedthe perpetrator has sporting prowess. A talent for sport is repeatedly held up as a mitigating factor when a sportsman has been found guilty of, in particular, domestic violence or sexual assault.Bennys case is further complicated by his alcoholism. He made real efforts at rehabilitation but these all failed, not least because in the s and s we did not have the same understanding of addiction as we do now. And yet, not all alcoholics beat their wives and assault children. The drink is an excuse, not absolution.There is no nuance to a statue. A statue is unequivocal praise. Here stands Benny Lynch, proudly and with glory, a bold and brave son of Glasgow. Respected, revered. Not everyone will respect and revere him. With a museum exhibition theres the chance to give historical context and a balanced take on the man.What does one do about a statue  Install a plaque alongside  Doesnt quite cover it, does it The Hungarians have a neat solution in Budapests Memento Park.

It is therefore unsurprising that barn owls in the north of Scotland have a hard time during the winter months, with peak mortality rates being between December and March due to starvation.As temperatures start to drop in winter, small mammals become less active, meaning a lot less food is available for barn owls, and they need to work extra-hard to find it. This often results in the owls being forced to feed during daylight, even though they are naturally nocturnal hunters.This lack of food is particularly dangerous for barn owls as they are poorly insulated and need more food in winter to provide them with enough energy to stay warm.The Barn Owl Trust estimates that between  and  barn owls are killed each year on UK roads.RSPB Scotland site manager Dave Jones recently sent a deceased barn owl to the Scottish Agricultural College in Thurso for autopsy, when some concerned neighbours reported it after finding it at the roadside.The results of the autopsy showed that the bird was fit and healthy, \"in good shape and hunting successfully\", and that the death followed trauma to its wing and abdomen ndash suggesting that the bird died as a result of being hit by a vehicle.Dave said: \"It is extremely sad to discover that a fit and healthy birds le ended in this way. The barn owls in Caithness really are at the edge of their natural comfort zone and are particularly vulnerable in winter, so it isnt an unusual result, unfortunately. Its not all doom and gloom, though. Although we still find some casualties in this way, our population of barn owls in Caithness has recovered from the particularly poor winters of   and  , and they are considered to be the most northerly population of barn owls in the world.\"While we cant control the weather, there are some things we can do to help. If putting up a nest box, please make sure it isnt placed close to any busy roads.

It is a safe bet that there are only three: Robert Somerville, John Keenan, and Bob Fulton.Back in March , when they were union shop stewards at the town#s Rolls Royce plant, the three men # and thousands of their co-workers # were responsible for virtually grounding the air force of Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet, who had seized power just a few months before in a savage CIA-backed coup. The documentary #Nae Pasaran#, screened in Portree last weekend, tells the story of how these principled trade unionists came to be awarded the highest honour the Republic of Chile can bestow upon foreigners.With much of the world appalled by the overthrow, in September , of the democratically-elected socialist Government of Salvador Allende, it fell to Bob Fulton # a burly, no-nonsense Christian with wartime experience of fighting fascist dictators # to set the ball rolling in East Kilbride. Arriving for work on the morning of th March  he uncovered a chilling truth about the eight Rolls Royce jet engines that had just been delivered to the plant for servicing: the engines came from the British Hawker Hunter jets used by Pinochet loyalists to bomb, amongst other targets, the presidential palace in Santiago where Allende died on the day the coup began.Now in his mid-s, Bob immediately #blacked# the engines that is, he declared them subject to an industrial dispute. As such, they could not be touched by any worker # or anyone , for that matter # until the dispute was resolved. His colleagues soon followed suit, much to the consternation of management and the UK Government. And so the engines sat, untouched, out in the open air for the next four years, until they became useless lumps of rusting metal. Moreover, the East Kilbride plant was the only place in the world licensed to service the engines. So, aside from the eight now-engineless jets, the rest of Pinochet#s air force could not be kept airworthy while workers thousands of miles away stuck to the principles of international solidarity. How many lives this saved on the ground is a moot point.#Nae Pasaran# is a paean to what can be achieved by collective action, and to what might be described as the golden age of trade unionism. But the documentary # written and directed by Felipe Bustos Sierra, son of an exiled Chilean journalist # also works as an emotionally-charged voyage of discovery.For over  years, Bob, John and Robert, and other former plant workers doubted whether or not their actions had any lasting effect on the lives of persecuted Chileans, many of whom were trade unionists like themselves. #Nae Pasaran# works in a dramatic sense because we watch as this gap in their knowledge is filled. The Scottish refuseniks did make an impact. Their stand mattered.What makes #Nae Pasaran# so moving is that the surviving union men, interviewed atby Sierra in his adopted homeland, are shown interviews he conducted back in Chile with survivors of Pinochet#s brutality. Now old men themselves, the victims recalled how they took solace in smuggled radios tuned to Radio Moscow, which broadcast regular updates on the Scottish union#s boycott. The action # or rather inaction # of the Rolls Royce workers gave many Chileans hope that they would not be forgotten or abandoned by the outside world. It may even have contributed directly to the saving of seven lives.Among the hundreds of Chilean exiles arriving in the UK were seven rumoured to have escaped execution or imprisonment because the air force acquired spare parts from Israel, South Africa, and India. So desperate were the Chilean authorities for this materiel they may have swapped the seven detainees for what they needed. Sierra never proves this conclusively, however, because the UK Home Office refused to release certain files relating to the boycott.And what of the jet engines, left to rust in East Kilbride  They were whisked away early one morning in . To this day no one knows who took them, but the Rolls Royce workers were told they were back in service with the Chilean air force. A year later Margaret Thatcher came to power and relations with the Pinochet regime were quickly normalised. Arms exports resumed in earnest.But the #blacked# engines were never used again. One of them, which Sierra discovered in a derelict yard outside Santiago, was shipped back to Scotland in , the year before #Nae Pasaran# hit the cinemas. It is due to be installed, as a lasting monument to the boycott, in a college campus in East Kilbride in the very near future.#Nae Pasaran# celebrates people power. After the screening, the topic was the subject of a short talk by Councillor Chris McEleny, leader of the SNP Group on Inverclyde Council, who also answered questions from the audience on British involvement in the destruction of Yemen, the desire by Tory Brexiteers to deregulate and deunionise even further, and the situation in Venezuela. Indeed, Mr McEleny drew an #obvious parallel# with Venezuela, where the democratically-elected socialist Government of another resource-rich South American country is being targeted for regime change.He said: #In Chile, before the coup, US corporations had huge commercial interests in copper mining and they sought to undermine and destabilise the Allende Government, and this is pretty much what we are seeing in Venezuela right now. Poverty in Venezuela has been engineered by the US, just as it was in Chile. We are seeing the same media pattern, a capitalist conditioning programmeyou like, drip-feeding propaganda to make intervention look like the right thing to do. We are seeing that right now with Venezuela so we need to see the same solidarity that Bob Fulton and others showed in the s.#Sadly, as Bob and his comrades lamented, in an era of weakened trade unions such a workplace boycott could probably not take place now. Those responsible would be handed their Ps."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/PORTREE-BRAES-TRUST-FIONA-AND-SOPHIE-2.jpg","title":"new skye gallery to bring celebrated artists studio back into","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe former studio of the late, much-loved and acclaimed artist Tommy MacKenzie was reopened as a new gallery space in Skye this week by a local businessman.Robert MacAskill, owner of the Relish Deli in Wentworth Street, Portree took on the studio following the passing of Mr MacKenzie in March last year and has decided to open it as the ‘Isle of Skye Gallery’, maintaining the space’s connection to the rich arts legacy set in place by the former Glasgow Print Studio member.Born in Shetland in , Tommy MacKenzie moved to Portree a year later and, after attending the local high school, he went on to study at Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design in Dundee. In  he was accepted into the prestigious Hornsey School of Art, where he made his mark in etching and printmaking with his graduation piece ‘At the Ebb’ being selected for exhibition in the Royal Academy Summer Show.After further enhancing his reputation and craft as a member of the Glasgow Print Studio, which he joined in the mid-s, Tommy ed to Portree in  and founded Skye Original Prints.A combination of gallery and workshop # that drew in many visitors- the space also provided a base for the printmaker to create works which he would go on to sell around the world.With the Isle of Skye Gallery opened this week, the former creative hub of the celebrated Sgitheanach artist could act as an exciting  for current talent on the island.. “It just needed a wee bit of decorating really. I think it is a good space for local artists and photographers to show their work.”As well as welcoming new artists, the gallery’s ties to Tommy will also remain intact through a connection with one of his siblings, as Robert explained.“Tommy’s brother Rory has some work in the gallery – which is quite a nice connection,” Robert said. “He does landscapes – mostly small works which are water-based.“He heard I was renovating the gallery and gave me a call – I had no idea he painted, and I was delighted when he phoned up and asked.”The Portree businessman added: “I have about a dozen dferent artists and photographers – six of which are showing work at the gallery already. Jeremy Rossiter is one, he was the first person I spoke to.“I also have work from a couple from Skeabost, Gill Williams, who is a photographer, and her husband Ian Williams – who is more of an abstract painter.“What I like might or might not be what other people like, so I am intrigued to see how things go.”Robert said that he planned to open the gallery through to at least October and would operate on a commission basis, giving the artists the freedom to price the work themselves.He added: “A lot of galleries just focus on professional artists, but I want it to also be a place where amateur artists and photographers can sell their work.”He went on to say: “When people are buying something, especially work that’s expensive, it’s better to see it in the flesh than on a computer. It’s a  for people to sell their work, and I am just acting as an agent, selling it for them and supplying the location.”He added: “We are calling it the Isle of Skye Gallery – keeping it simple. That way everyone knows where it is, and it doesn’t prioritise one type of artwork over another. We have a Facebook page — Isle of Skye Gallery, and we’re on Instagram too — it’s not my forte but it’s a good  to promote it.” that while the gallery was due to open this week, an official launch would take place next month.With th March marking the one-year anniversary of Tommy’s death, perhaps the new crop of artists present will draw inspiration from the indelible impression left by the gallery’s former incumbent as the space is brought back into use."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland olympic hero dame mary peters further honoured by the queen","story":"Dame Mary, from Northern

The First Responders received its first donation on February . Braid Valley Vintage Enthusiasts presented the Scheme with a cheque for pound, for the purchase of two defibrillators and response packs.John Crothers presented the cheque to Stephen Lamont and Alan Murray, two of the team working to get the scheme operational by early summer. Alan Murray thanked them for their generosity and emphasised the importance of the new venture.“Last year in Northern Ireland there were almost  out of hospital cardiac arrests: an average of four a day. Only one in ten of these people survived to be discharged from hospital. However, with CPR and defibrillation within  to  minutes of collapse, survival rates can rise to % and above.Braid Valley Community First Responders aims to train and organise local people to respond to cardiac arrests in their own community while the ambulance is on its way and improve survival rates in Broughshane and Ballymena and the surrounding rural areas. This generous donation will be of great help to us in achieving our aim.”Stephen Lamont issued an appeal for local residents to ensure that their addresses were identiable.“Clear signage is vitalwe are to get to you quickly in a le threatening emergency. “Our plea is that you identy your house number or name clearly so that it can be read from the road. “ If you live up a shared drive, please talk to your neighbours and label the end of the drive with all the house numbers and ensure that each inidual house is numbered. “This will help us to help youyou are having an emergency.”  "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1462209.jpg--.jpg?1550660974000\n","title":"moy park general manager shines a light on factory life","story":" AARON Whiteman has been with Moy Park for almost  years, working his way up from weekend sht worker to front line manager, to his current role as General Manager at the Ballymena site. As Moy Park celebrates  years in business, Aaron reflects on changes in the sector and milestones along the way. He said: “I first joined Moy Park in  when I was still at school, working part time at the weekends as a factory operative. “As a student, it was a great insight into the world of work and business. It taught me the value of hard work, money earned, and motivated me to want to do more of both! “After gaining a degree in Health and Leisure from Queen’s University Belfast, I was keen to move into a business environment and decided to apply to Moy Park’s Graduate Management Programme, to find out more about a career in one of our fastest growing industries, agri-food. “The two-year programme was the ideal way to find out more about ious strands of a business, from operations to finance, HR and marketing, and what might suit my skillset best. “From my time as a sht worker on the factory floor, I had a healthy respect and interest in the processing side of Moy Park, and the opportunities and challenges therein. “Once I completed the Graduate Management Programme - which we still use as a recruitment tool today - I took up a position as a sht manager, capitalising on my people management skills and interest in operations. “Since then, I have worked my way up across a number of Moy Park’s sites – moving from factory manager to area manager and have now been General Manager at Ballymena for two years. “Ballymena is a great place to work. From a business point of view, it’s strategically located with fantastic transport links and from a social standpoint, you’ll never find yourself wanting for something to do – from shopping to socialising over a drink or a bite to eat. It’s also quickly becoming the spa capital of Northern Ireland! “While Ballymena has faced a number of economic challenges, it’s an area with a rich history and heritage of business success. This spirit is still very much evidenced by the people, businesses and organisations in the town today. “Mid and East Antrim Council has an ambitious integrated economic development strategy for the area to help encourage business growth across the borough, and it’s one we are keen to help support. “It’s a strategy important not just to Moy Park as a business, but to me personally. “I sit on Mid and East Antrim Council’s Manufacturing Task Force Team, a working group committed to supporting and fostering growth. I was delighted to attend Westminster with a delegation from the Task Force recently when Northern Ireland representatives presented their plans for a Belfast City Deal. “Hearing these plans certainly gave us food for thought when it comes to nurturing growth locally. “As Ballymena’s General Manager, I’m responsible for all business s at the site – from technical to HR and finance. “With over , members of staff, it’s a erse and busy job but that’s what makes it worth doing. In the last  years, business management has evolved signicantly. “While there might be more paperwork, regulations, travel and late nights, there is also an incredible amount of collaboration - with customers, industry, educational bodies and government and our local communications. “Managers today cannot afford to work in silos, you need to adopt an attitude of knowledge sharing and foster an environment of innovation to truly succeed. “My key piece of advice to anyone viewing management as a career is to do your research and bolster your skillsyou need to. Being a good manager isn’t a static position, you constantly need to challenge yourself, and a good employer is one who lets you not only challenge yourself but equips you with the skills to overcome these challenges. “One of my own personal highlights over the last  years was been being named ‘Young Processor of the Year’ at the Meat and Poultry Processing Awards in . “Given my background working on the factory floor, it was great to win an industry award. At a business level, I’ve been very proud to see Ballymena evolve to become a Centre of Excellence, focused on driving innovation in food manufacturing. “As General Manager, it’s my ambition to see our facilities continue to grow.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460456.jpg--.jpg?1550570314000\n","title":"mp hails amber light on scotland bridge plan","story":"North Antrim MP Ian Paisley has welcomed talks about a prospective bridge connecting Northern Ireland and Great Britain.Mr Paisley recently, along with South Antrim DUP MP Paul Girvan met with the Secretary of State for Transport, Chris Grayling to discuss the bridge.After the meeting between the three MPs, the Transport secretary said he would be in contact with the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer in order to discuss a feasibility project which would investigate the economics of the bridge and whether it would make financial sence to construct the bridge.The proposed bridge could be placed anywhere along the Northern Irish coast line, either at the shortest distance to Scotland at  miles or at the longest of  miles. A similar structure linking Denmark and Sweden will be used as a guide when investigating the logistics of the bridge.Ian Paisley welcomed the positive discussions.He said: “This move from a Red Light to an Amber Light shows progress and is encouraging for a future Green Light on the bridge project.”Speaking to the , Mr Paisley added: “This is a matter I have raised at our select committee and now the transport secretary is taking this forward to find a way of supporting a feasibility study. “That would be a signicant move and would be most welcome.“Obviously this is at an early stage but it wouldn’t take a blind man on a galloping horse to miss the opportunities for employment commerce and tourism!“Any feasibility study would have to look at where the bridge would leave NI and enter the mainland all of that will now need to be considered.“As a unionist it’s very obvious to see the added attraction of linking our kingdom in this physical way.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460409.jpg--.jpg?1550570234000\n","title":"children from gran canaria welcomed to ballymena","story":"A group of children from Gran Canaria have been visiting Ballymena to take part in the annual local music festival.The group of  children are pupils of the British School of Gran Canaria, and are taught by local woman Claire McDonald.Claire, who is the head of the music department at the English speaking school has accompanied her pupils to Northern Ireland to take part in the festival, sightsee, improve their English skills and experience the culture of Northern Ireland.The young people, who are all aged between  and  years old are keen musicians, with some playing the piano, drums, violins while others are singers.They have experienced success at the festival, with some winning first and second prizes and others were highly commended.The group have been travelling around NI, visiting the Giant’s Causeway, Hillsborough Castle and the Titanic museum and performed in a local concert with Kellswater Flute Band.This has been their first taste of Northern Ireland, and it did not disappoint!One of the students, Miguel said: “I’ve really enjoyed my trip. “I play the drums and the musical festival has been great.“We learn English at school so it’s good to speak it here.”Fellow student Alicia, said: “Northern Ireland is great and the festival has been a wonderful experience.“I was really excited to play with the band but my favourite part was the Giant’s Causeway and the music festival.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460481.jpg--.jpg?1550570359000\n","title":"rodney quigley announces independent candidacy","story":"Ballymena man Rodney Quigley has announced he plans to stand in this year’s Council elections.Announcing his candidacy on Facebook this week, the well known community activist posted: “I intend to stand as an Independent candidate in the Mid and East Antrim council elections on nd May.“As someone who has worked tirelessly as a community worker for over  years, and as a member of the policing and community safety partnership for  years, I feel that I have something to offer at local council level.“I have dealt with many community issues in the past and will continue to put the community first on any issues that are brought to my attention. “Ive also worked with many councillors on many issues in the past and would continue to work along side them for the good of everyone in Ballymena.“I know that many people have said its time for change and it would be good to see a few new faces within Mid and East Antrim council.“If this is the case Id like to be one of the new faces.“I can assure people thatelected, I will put my best foot forward every time and will work to resolve local issues for everyone in Ballymena.”Election datesNomination forms for prospective candidates must be ed to the Deputy Returning Officer by pm on Monday April , .The election will be held on Thursday, May , .

Her teammates were equally determined and with Nadia Radclfe placing th, Ruby McNf st and Lucy Bradshaw th they ran out comfortable winners by some  points from their nearest challengers. A truly awesome effort from a very talented and committed group of girls.Pictured at the Ulster Schools Cross Country Championships is champion Bethany Nixon from Banbridge Academy.Bethany set the tone when she ran hard from the start at the Mallusk Playing fields venue and took the race by the scruff of the neck. Over the course of the race she kept up the pressure, and the pace, and left everyone trailing in her wake. Despite a late attempt at a comeback by her nearest rival, Bethany responded with a kick at the end and won the race by some  metres. A truly outstanding race from a dedicated and hard-working young girl. It was made all the more special as older sister Rebekah, who won the Senior Ulster title last year, was spectating and was on hand for a celebratory hug at the end. When Nadia, Ruby and Lucy followed in high places there was jubilationwhen the girls realised they had achieved their own bit of history by being the first Banbridge Academy team to claim a Gold in the long history of the championships. All four girls will now travel to Clongowes Wood College near Dublin on Saturday, March  for the Irish Championships and they have every reason to believe they have a medal shot therethey emulate the fantastic runs they all achieved in the Ulster Finals.In the boys races, the Academy had two other athletes who also qualied for the Irish championships with brilliant runs of their own. In the Junior Boys’ race Simon Ferris ran strongly to finish th in a huge field and in the Minor Boys’ Matthew Stevenson fought off many challengers to finish th and claim his spot. Excellent performances by both boys who should be justiably proud of their achievements.Pictured at the Ulster Schools Cross Country Championships is Simon Ferris from Banbridge Academy.The Academy also had three other runners who had qualied through from the Districts to run in these Ulster Championships. In the Mini Girls’ race, Kate Ferris, sister of Simon, led with a really competitive run to claim st place. In the Minor Boys’ race Kian Moran also ran strongly to finish st place and finally Emily Cantley was excellent in the Senior Girls’ race to claim th spot.All the athletes deserve huge credit for their efforts at the Championships and the  qualying runners are now looking forward to Irish Schools Championships’ in three weeks time.Pictured at the Ulster Schools Cross Country Championships are Kian Moran and Matthew Stevenson from Banbridge Academy.Pictured at the Ulster Schools Cross Country Championships is Kate Ferris from Banbridge Academy.Pictured at the Ulster Schools Cross Country Championships is Emily Cantley from Banbridge Academy.Latest Pictures: NI Royal visit Day  Hillsborough and BallymenaRoyal Visit round-up: The Duke  Duchess of Cambridge in Northern Ireland Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"a spanish adventure for local pupils","story":"Banbridge Academy pupils and their teachers set off on last month for Zaragoza, Spain on the eagerly awaited Spanish Exchange trip and by all accounts they had an amazing trip.They all chose the colour of their hoody and, coincidentally, all chose a dferent colour so by accident they spread joy all the way from Banbridge to Spain and back.The pupils were a credit to Banbridge Academy and the teachers thoroughly enjoyed bringing the pupils to Spain to experience Spanish culture.The pupils were polite, grateful and very brave, to stay with Spanish families they didn’t know, but they even made an effort to set aside their mobile phonesto chat with their hosts.As well as trying the local cuisine and having to eat at very dferent times of the day in comparison to Northern Ireland, the pupils visited lots of places in Zaragoza, in the Pyrenees, and even spent time in a Music class learning to dance a typical Aragonese dance.Everyone was sad to say goodbye to their hosts but it won’t be long until the Spanish pupils arrive in Banbridge later this month for the corresponding exchange visit.Everyone is looking forward to sharing our culture, providing hospitality and showing them our beautul country.

They visited a mix of work-based credit unions and community credit unions to provide much-needed technical assistance, especially in rural districts of the Bwiam region.The technical assistance provided by Rosaleen and the coaches included providing support to Gambian credit union staff on day-to-day operations, loan management and credit control.Following each credit union visit Rosaleen and Michael had the opportunity to meet with their Boards and put forward recommendations on how to further develop their credit union .Rosaleen and the coaches also organised for a meeting with local taxi drivers to discuss the potential of them setting up their own credit union.At the end of the visits the coaches hosted a two-day workshop for credit union personnel in Banjul. This allowed for the coaches to discuss credit union issues and share their knowledge with the participants.Rosaleen presented on the topic of governance to the participants.Throughout the two weeks Rosaleen and her fellow volunteers were able to share their skills and knowledge to build the capacity of the credit union personnel in The Gambia and empower them to further strengthen their movement.Rosaleen also had the opportunity to meet credit union members and hear about how the credit union is making a real dference in their lives.The Irish credit union movement is highly regarded across the world and the visit by the Irish coaches was hugely appreciated by the credit union movement in The Gambia.Speaking about her visit, Rosaleen said: “I would like to take the opportunity to thank the members of Newington Credit Union who have supported the ILCU Foundation for many years.“To be able to visit one of the countries which benefit from our support and come back and share my experience enables me to highlight the needs of small rural communities who live in abject poverty.“In facing such conditions the people remain cheerful and are always smiling – hence the name given to The Gambia: the Smiling Coast of Africa. The Gambian credit union volunteers and staff are so keen to enhance their knowledge and skills to develop their credit unions and I hope in the coming years they go from strength to strength.“I would like to thank my fellow coaches, the ILCU Foundation and NACCUG who helped make the trip so successful. ”Baboucarr Jeng, General Manager NACCUG, expressed his thanks to Rosaleen and the coaches for giving their time to help the credit unions in The Gambia and he emphasised the need for the participants “to use the education from the training to develop their skills and the credit unions they represent”.Alan Moore, CEO ILCU Foundation, added: “It has been great to have Rosaleen on board for our coaching programme for the past two years, she has been a fantastic ambassador for the ILCU Foundation and indeed the wider Irish credit union movement.“Throughout the course of her time in The Gambia, our partner credit unions have learnt a great deal from Rosaleen and her fellow coaches.“We are very grateful to Rosaleen for giving up her time to volunteer to help our partners, who, like Rosaleen, know the value of having a credit union and what it means for the members.“I would like to take this opportunity to thank Newington Credit Union who supported Rosaleen to participate in the Coaching Programme and for their continued support to the ILCU Foundation’s work.”Newington Credit Union.- Duncairn Gardens,Belfast,BT GF.Tel:   "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"full steam ahead for carryduff gaelscoil","story":"THE committee of a new Irish-medium nursery school in Carryduff has said it is confident it will open its doors as planned despite losing out on a proposed school building.The new naíscoil is expected to open in September this year and will pave the way for an Irish-medium primary in the area in .Gaelscoil an Aodha Dhuibh faced a setback recently after a lease on the proposed nursery site fell through. However, committee member Suzanne Warring said she is confident it will open as planned.“We’re looking at everything that is available in the whole postcode,” she said.“There are very few commercial properties in the area, but we have seen everything that there is, so we’re reaching out to everyone to make sure we get an appropriate site. “At this stage we are still confident we will be opening in September. My daughter is one of the ones who will be going to the school in September and we certainly expect that to happen. Over the next couple of weeks we hope to get the building secured and then we will have enough time to prepare. Because we have the money in place and all of the groundwork has been done in advance, we should be able to open as planned.”According to Ms Warring, the naíscoil has already had an unprecedented amount of applications, which are indicative of a growing demand for Irish-medium education in the area.“It is massively encouraging,” she enthused.“To think that your kids can go to a local naíscoil, bunscoil, or meánscoil in the future is fantastic. It really shows how much things have changed here. The naiscoil is the start and we hope to build on that. We’re trying to build a community around it. There are a lot more Irish speakers in the area than we would have known and it will create a place for those people, and for those who just want to learn.”She continued: “Because of the non-denominational ethos of Irish medium education, we welcome applications from everyone in the community and the inclusive, child-centred nature of Irish medium is exactly what the area needs. “We had an amazing turnout at The Ivanhoe in December for our information morning. Many parents don#t have Irish themselves but we know from the success of our existing Gaelscoileanna that this is not an issue. “The momentum is there and the funding is ready to go. “The committee is working diligently to secure suitable premises to open the doors in September  as planned.

Speaking to the Andersonstown News Councillor Baker said the service willas of Wednesday and Thursday this week, but that there will be no evening service on Friday or Saturday night.Mr Baker said he will also be walking the bus route and “jumping on and off the shuttle buses over the next two nights” to restore confidence in the service. “A lot of work has been going on behind the scenes since the service was pulled last week,” he said. “Everyone has got involved to have this restored. “We need this vital service back. We have to be aware that driver safety, passenger safety is what is important it’s about building confidence. I have to be on the ground with inspectors to build up that confidence. “If anything happens at least I am there, I can identy people because at the end of the day what is happening here is a serious offence, young people could end up with a criminal record here,” he said. “We are looking towards sustainability, working together with the community, Translink, the union, working on a strategy to prevent this from happening ever again. The impact since the service was pulled has been huge. “It’s a one-mile walk from the bottom of Lagmore never mind the safety aspect at night. It’s a service we really need but it’s about making sure the drivers and Translink staff are safe doing their job.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"seamuss inside story of life on the blanket","story":"THE COURSE of Irish history has been marked by insurrection against British rule. The impacts of the ious campaigns have been extensively debated, but certain events, such as the republican struggle against criminalisation in the H-Blocks and Armagh Gaol, are almost universally recognised as catalytic in effecting social change. While we know the blanket protest and the deaths of  men on hunger strike would completely alter the political landscape in Ireland, the lived experiences of the blanket men and women and the horror they endured is much harder to comprehend.As part of wider effort to tell the prisoners’ stories, ex-prisoner Seamus Kearney, who is one of hundreds of people who experienced the ordeal of the H-Blocks, is set to give a talk on his time in prison in St Gall’s GAC on Friday.Seamus was arrested during an IRA operation in Finaghy Road North and was imprisoned in January . He was placed on remand in Crumlin Road Gaol where he admits he was looking forward to some rest after years of struggle, but he didn’t know what to expect.His imprisonment coincided with the building of the H-Blocks, where the first blanket man, Kieran Nugent, had begun his protest against criminalisation just three months earlier. At that time, however, Seamus said, “Nobody knew what way the jails were going.” Indeed, during an early encounter with Kieran Doherty, who would die on hunger strike in , he was informed that his comrades were “disappearing off the face of the earth” after sentence. After his own sentencing, Seamus was moved from the Crumlin Road to H-Block  in June . It was there that he first met future hunger strikers Kevin Lynch, Thomas McElwee and the then block OC, Bobby Sands. During their short time in H, which was then used as a transitional block, Seamus and his comrades resolved to join the blanket protest. Non-conformity meant being locked in a cell for  hours a day and a ‘Number ’ starvation diet.“After refusing a unorm you were told to strip ‘everything’,” he said. “It was all men looking at you, so it was a bit weird. They put the clothes into a brown bag and I remember thinking to myself ‘I’m going to get them back.’“It seemed quite daunting because I thought I was getting some R and R,” he added.“We ended up in H and took each day as it came. One day led to another. Your legs start getting tingly from the lack of exercise, but the idea was to keep walking to keep moving. “After a few months, we were lucky, because at the end of January  Brendan Hughes, ‘The Dark’, arrived. I ended up in cell next to him. Bobby ended up at the far wing of H. Getting Brendan Hughes was amazing. He was already a hero, even then.”According to Seamus, the arrival of Brendan Hughes, who took up command in the blocks, was pivotal in the escalation of the prison protests. The blanket men were isolated from the outside world and the British government was “winning the propaganda war”, but with the men voting in favour of Brendan Hughes’ idea of no-wash protest in February , the protest began gaining public attention.“We needed to recalibrate,” Seamus said.“It was then that we were told that this was not a local jail dispute. This was a part of governmental policy and that it was bigger than we thought. I think the Brits thought we weren’t of the same calibre of Connolly or Pearse – that we would do what we were told. But they were wrong. They were hitting a raw nerve and they didn’t realise it, and maybe we didn’t. We weren’t thinking about what it all meant, but our backs were against the wall.”Seamus continued: “It was about attracting national international interest. We had to open new lines of communication to the outside world and get our story out there, because at that time they were winning the propaganda war.“We were already getting harassed on the way out of our cells, so The Dark said we were going to exploit that going into the no-wash protest. The screws were already beating some of the lads. You were going out one cell at a time and it was one man being hit by about  screws.”Seamus was soon moved to H where he lost Brendan Hughes’ counsel, but said he and his comrades were emboldened at the onset of the no-wash protest. Their ingenuity in sending communications within the blocks and to the outside world is now legendary. It was during that time, amid increasing brutality from the screws, that the prisoners took the decision to smear excrement on walls – a decision that Seamus said was taken reluctantly.“We didn’t know how we would even do it – the mechanics of it,” he said.“We were improvising again. Some bright spark, Tom Martin, had the idea of taking a piece of the mattress and using it as a sponge. That seemed to be the only way to do it. Eventually we did it together. We started smearing it on the wall – it was horrible. After about two weeks the screws went ballistic. I remember the screw opening the cell door and saying ‘you dirty bastards – you fucking animals.’ I think that’s when the real hatred started forming. We didn’t feel good about putting it up anyway. We weren’t animals, but we felt that we had to do it to highlight the case.”Seamus recalls  as bad year for the blanket men, particularly in ‘an seachtain dona’of April that year, when “people were literally beaten off the blanket”. He said the remaining blanket men were determined to “save the IRA from obliteration” and, often, it was comedy that got them through. While you were getting beaten you were still laughing,” he recalled. Seamus tells with a smile of a visit from an old neighbour who cajoled him into singing ‘Smoke Gets in Your Eyes’ by Bryan Ferry – a move that brought applause from the visiting room and, later, a beating from the screws. Needless to say, she never visited again.While the torture endured by the blanket men was immense, Seamus faced one of his toughest challenges when he received word that the IRA had executed his brother, Michael Kearney, as an informer in July . The screws initially mocked his brother’s death, but later offered supposed salvation and a chance to leave the blanket. Michael’s name would not be cleared until  when it was revealed that he had been killed at the behest of IRA informant Freddie Scappaticci, codename Stakekne. However, Seamus remained undaunting in his commitment to the IRA during his  years in prison. “I gave him my blessing to join the IRA,” he said.“I felt he betrayed me and he betrayed Ireland. I didn’t know what I was going to do. Everything stood still.“I was in the middle of no-man’s land. I was neither with the IRA or the British and I felt shell-shocked. The first thing that went through my mind was ‘What am I going to tell the lads ’“It was the first time I realised the distinction between mind and body, which you’ll not understand until it happens,” he added.“My body was telling me I’d had enough – I was starving, I had lice, I had dysentery – but my mind was saying, ‘Tell themto fuck off.’ “I told them I had lots of brothers. There were  of them, one of them was dead, but I had Sean on the outside and I had brothers in the H-Blocks.“I told the lads that the only way they would take me out isthey carried me out. They weren’t going to break the back of the IRA.”The H-Blocks saw a hunger strike in  that saw the British government renege on a deal it had struck with the prisoners. Tragically,  men – Bobby Sands, Francis Hughes, Raymond McCreesh, Patsy O’Hara, Joe McDonnell, Martin Hurson, Kevin Lynch, Kieran Doherty, Thomas McElwee and Michael Devine – died on hunger strike the following year. Of the  that died, Seamus knew six of them personally, and he vividly recalls the last time he saw Bobby Sands during Mass in February .“At the end of the Mass Bobby went round the lads clockwise,” he said.“He came to me and smiled and said ‘I see you’re still here,’ and I knew it was in relation to our Michael. I said ‘There’s nowhere  to go, Bobby.’ He looked straight into my eyes and said ‘Good man – goodbye.’“I had doubted him. Most of our wing had doubted him. To me he was just like a Rod Stewart lookalike. I had given him the words to ‘This Old Heart of Mine’ before – he liked that song. When I looked into his eyes that Sunday they were like a shark’s eyes. He had resigned himself and I knew he was going to go through with.“The hunger strike was a formality. Bobby didn’t really die on May the th – he died in February. One after another they died and it was like losing a part of yourself. It was the same reaction I had to losing our Michael. It was like losing brothers. It was so catastrophic – and it still is. “Maybe it’s a physiological thing that I don’t understand, but when I talk about it I can still feel that emotion asit was yesterday and I still struggle to get over it. I know I speak for a lot of the lads who can’t have this conversation, but something broke inside me.”Those who knew the men who died most keenly feel the sadness of . For Seamus, the death of his friend Thomas McElwee, who he knew from H, was most dficult of all, and one that he finds most painful to speak about. He talks about his friend fondly, and will no doubt do so as he tells his own chapter in the dramatic account of the blanket men. “You are trying to bring people into that world and a lot of the lads can’t talk about it – most of them don’t,” he said.“For me, you don’t just talk about the protest, you actually relive it. Once you open that Pandora’s box you don’t know what you’re letting out, so a lot of the lads keep it closed.“Today, with the rise of Sinn Féin, the republican movement is healthy. It is a direct result of the fight against criminalisation. We thought it would be a footnote in Irish history, but it became a pivotal moment. Of the ten men who died on hunger strike I knew six of them personally. It was such an intimate death for all of them that it’s dficult to talk about.”Seamus will give his talk about le on the blanket in St Galls GAC this Friday evening, March , at .pm. All are welcome to come along."},{"url":null,"title":"how ireland rugby hero jacob stockdale tackles being christian in rugby world","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSpring EditionHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I am a leader there with the youth group.\"Reflecting on his childhood, the player said there is a \"certain expectation placed on the children of ministers, but that he \"enjoyed\" the experience as he \"always had somewhere to live, a community to be part of\".\"But there is also the other side of it - youre expected to be this perfect child and when you dont live up to the ideal it results in rumours and I was always aware of that,\" he said. He added that his \"first real profession\" of his Christian faith was at a summer camp when he was . Revealing that he was \"pretty small\" until a growth spurt at , Jacob said the fact that he had a \"bit of a late start\" in rugby meant he focused on other things such as school work, becoming \"more of an all-rounded person, to a certain extent\"."},{"url":null,"title":"hyponatraemia doctor removed from medical register","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSpring EditionHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It was again planned to coincide with an anti-interment rally on August , .Martin Galvin continued: \"On July ,  I wrote a letter from my office at the Irish People, offering the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and unionist leaders an opportunity to speak to us at a mutually agreed time and venue.

Durkan MLA described it as a “ticking time bomb” which could turn a “huge environmental crime” into an “even bigger environmental crisis”.Previous waste management activities on the CIW site include an old landfill regulated by the legacy Derry City Council.At the stakeholder meeting on November , , the estimated volume of controlled waste illegally disposed at the Mobuoy waste site was reported to be a minimum of , m.The nature of the illegal deposits includes municipal waste, construction and demolitionwaste and municipal waste mixed with CD waste.Both the CIW site and CSG site have been subject to illegal waste disposal activities, according to local council officials.Paul Hughes has been a member of the Mobuoy Road Stakeholders Forum which has been meeting at regular intervals over the past number of years.The forum is made up of local youth and community representatives, elected representatives as well as members of the River Faughan Anglers.‘Justice for Mobuoy’At recent meetings remediation options have been explored and outlined by the Northern Ireland Environmental Agency in terms of cleaning up this illegal toxic “super dump” - which is understood to be one of the biggest illegal landfills in all of Europe.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshMr Hughes said: “We are continuously told that that the Department is working towards cleaning up the dump. Its time to make it happen. At a recent meetingthe Councils Environment  Regeneration Committee the officer charged with heading up the clean-up said that they have been lucky with Mobuoy so far. What a statement to make.“Mobuoy Dump must be cleaned up without further delay. The floods of August  proved just how fragile the situation is.  The River Faughan remains under constant threat from pollution.“We should all be concerned about the issue.  We must all stand up for the Faughan.  I would encourage everyone to get along to this meeting and ask questions. I would suggest that everyone writes down all their questions and puts them directly to the NIEA on Wednesday th of March.”He added: “Our elected representatives have failed Mobuoy and have failed the River Faughan.  Despite a public inquiry having been unanimously agreed back in , it never ever happened.“Its time for concerned citizens to take control of this process and now is the time to demand that Mobuoy Dump be cleaned up once and for all and lessons learnt do that a disaster like this is never allowed to happen again.“It’s time to stand up for the River Faughan.  Make a point to attending this meeting, demand answers, demand a full clean up, demand a public inquiry. Its time to get Justice for Mobuoy!”‘Subject to funding’When asked what would need to be done to make the area safe and prevent any risk of contaminating the DAERA said would be dependent on funding.A spokesperson explained: “The Northern Environment Agency has agreed an integrated approach for remediating the Mobuoy illegal waste sites that takes full account of the need to protect the River Faughan.“At this stage DAERA through the Northern Ireland Environment Agency, is seeking to enforce the former operators to remediate. In parallel to this, DAERA is developing a signicant business case to support remediation of the site.“The solution is not a simple one. The protection of the River Faughan needs to be managed through a remediation programme that comprises of several complementary phases in which there are a number of treatments on site within each phase of works. All elements of this programme will need to be supported by an extensive environmental monitoring programme.“At this stage, the remediation programme is subject to DAERA securing funding for the preparatory works required prior to remediation commencing on site.”Further detail will be presented by NIEA to the local community at an event on Wednesday th March at .pm in Drumahoe Primary School.Photo: Environmental Campaigners Paul Hughes  Eamonn ODonnell at the Environmental Gathering rally in Derry last October."},{"url":null,"title":"people profit accuses sinn fein touch reality welfare reforms","story":"People Before Profit has accused Sinn Féin of being out of touch with the reality of welfare reforms.People Before Profit candidate for Foyleside Shaun Harkin said Universal Credit has left people in debt and poverty, while denying thousands disability benefits.He commented: \"Sinn Féin MLA Karen Mullan has called for the Department of Communities to ensure welfare mitigations continue.

I just want to try and put out what Irsquove been feeling for a long time.Conal first developed a love for music by listening to his big brotherrsquos Elvis Presley records.He later began to perform as the lead singer with the local band Bone Idle before moving on to Freak Out and then to Sweet Leaf mdash the band he fronted for  years.ldquoIrsquove been fronting rock bands for the last  years since my early twenties and it was always just covers like AC DC, Led Zeppelin and Lynyrd Skynyrd, Conal continued.ldquoBut when I started to write music, that wasnrsquot what was coming out of me. It was more singer songwriter, folky stuff.ldquoIt wasnrsquot really a surprise to me as the stuff I would have listened to outside my giging would have been the likes of Bob Dylan and Steve Earle.Conal is recording his new songs with the band Stillwater, which also features Killyleagh musician Damien Hanna.While he is experiencing a creative purple patch, the father-of-four does not yet know when the music will be available.ldquoI donrsquot have a title for my new EP yet as Irsquom still writing and Irsquom still recording. I would hope that the EP would be out by the summer and the album by the end of the year but you never know, the EP could turn into the album.He and Stillwater performed two of Conalrsquos new tracks, Venus and All of the People, in an interview on That Like That on NVTV.Conal says that the second track is really resonating with people.ldquoThis track is aimed at society in general, not only young people on Facebook, but all those who point the finger at somebody and gang up on some poor soul, he explained.ldquoThen when something happens to that poor soul, then yoursquoll get the smiley faces and comments of lsquoHe was a great fellarsquo or lsquoShe was a great girlrsquo and hopefully it teaches them a lesson to realise what people might be going through on the inside.Conal is a regular at Denvirrsquos in Downpatrick and will next perform with Stillwater in Portrush Town Hall at the North West  in MayTo watch Conalrsquos interview and performance on NVTVrsquos Talk Like That visit twww.nvtv shows talk-like-that-conal-montgomery Conal and Stillwater on their Facebook pages or ring Conal on  ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"De La Salle head ‘disappointed’ at decision  ","story":"THE principal of De La Salle School in Downpatrick has spoken of his ldquodisappointment in this weekrsquos statement from the Red High Parents and Friends Association.Mr Ciaran Maguire called on all four schools earmarked for the proposed lsquosuper schoolrsquo in Downpatrick ldquoto come together and put their best foot forward.Mr Maguire said he was disappointed for the trustees of De La Salle and St Patrickrsquos, who ldquohave given so much of their lives to the families in East Down.He described their involvement in education has been one of ldquogreat success and achievement.Mr Maguire said De La Salle and St Patrickrsquos were ldquotwo highly effective schools meeting the needs of young men and women in the greater Downpatrick area.He said the trustees had the confidence of staff, pupils and parents at De La Salle and from the wider business community.Mr Maguire remarked: ldquoWithin my last two years as principal of De La Salle, I have witnessed on a daily basis children going to and from St Patrickrsquos, to St Maryrsquos to De La Salle, accessing a curriculum that isnrsquot possible within their own school and sharing both the knowledge and expertise from each of these schools, where the results have been nothing short of excellent for each pupil.ldquoThis collaboration has been up and running successfully for years and is a model of good practice for other post-primary schools to see.ldquoWhat is wrong in having a rsquosuper schoolrsquo  Do the families in the greater Downpatrick area not deserve it  A school where children regardless of ability can achieve their potential He continued: ldquoThe new school will cater for every child.

No child will be turned away because of not making the threshold grade. They will wear the same unorm, access the same curriculum and extracurricular activities and be treated with the same care and respect that they currently receive in their respective schools.Mr Maguire added: ldquoThis is something that very few communities in Northern Ireland can avail of.

Longford settled first and leading marksman Darren Gallagher registered the first score with a free in the fourth minute, but despite a lot of possession, the home side struggled to get scores on the board.Downrsquos defensive cover was superb with Saulrsquos Pierce Laverty making a more than impressive debut at half back.He received great support from Downpatrickrsquos Gerard Collins, Castlewellanrsquos Colm Flanagan and Bryansfordrsquos Ruairi Wells as Down closed up shop.Mind you, Down also struggled early on to get scores, but all that changed in the th minute.A measured long ball in from Caolan Mooney was ruthlessly pounced upon by OrsquoHare and he finished to the net with panache.Points from Gallagherand Liam Connerton drew Longford level in the th minute, but Down responded in style and regained the initiative with unanswered points from OrsquoHare , Conor Poland and corner back Gerard Collins.Longford had a goal chance in the th minute when Darren Quinn carved out an opening for the lurking Gallagher, but Burns made am outstanding save to deny the danger man and send Down in at the break with a - to - lead.Paddy Tallyrsquos men stretched their lead to seven within one minute of the second half when another long ball in, this time from Poland, picked out OrsquoHare and he grabbed his and his sidersquos second goal.Longford got a much needed point from Connor Berry in the th minute, but minutes later Burns denied Gallagher. Longford were made to rue those missed goal chances in the th minute when Jerome Johnston found Daniel Guinness and he played it to OrsquoHare who got his third goal.Berry kicked over a free in the th minute and two minutes later Longford had a chance for a goal when they were awarded a penalty after Quinn was fouled.

Taking part in the mass were Canon Sean Rogan, who is a former school governor, family friend Fr Seamus McGinley and Diocesan priest Canon Noel Conway.Among those attending were Mr Eamonn McGrady, chairman of the schoolrsquos board of governors, and Mrs Darlingrsquos husband, Martin.Mrs Darling is leaving the school in the equally capable hands of the incoming principal, Miss Rosemary McLoughlin, who is the current vice-principal.Having worked at St Maryrsquos since , Miss McLoughlin is the perfect person to steward the school over the next few years as St Maryrsquos faces the prospect of joining the new lsquosuper schoolrsquo proposed by the CCMS for Downpatrick for .Itrsquos a challenge that Mrs Darling wishes she was around to oversee.ldquoRetiring is something thatrsquos really quite bittersweet for me because I will really miss the school and everyone here, and seeing the girls every morning, said Mrs Darling.ldquoBut of course I wonrsquot miss the administration. I actually thought of leaving last year but as we had our th anniversary I wasnrsquot going to leave before I had handled all of that.ldquoI think itrsquos nice for a principal to take over a school a little bit before the begining of an academic year.She sees the proposed new lsquosuper schoolrsquo as a great opportunity for the school and its students.ldquoI would have absolutely loved the challenge to ensure that every single child going into that school would be properly catered for and would be treated respectfully and fairly, she said.ldquoNot only our girls but that the children from the other schools would be treated equally and fairly.When Mrs Darling looks at her students, she unrelentingly sees promise and potential in each and every one and makes no apology for it.She is well-known for her high expectations for the students.ldquoI believe I have helped the children here to raise their aspirations, to hold their heads up high, be proud of who they are and realise that they are as good as anyone , that they are capable of being successful in their own right and to bring that success to their families and their communities, said Mrs Darling.ldquoOur children in this school have seen GCSE and A-Level results increase year on year. They know that I expect them to achieve. I expect them to work hard and to keep going until they get it right and until they get to where they want to be.ldquoTheir parents have been a wonderful support to me as a principal. They have been very engaged and we have travelled the same path together. We have built a very constructive partnership to support their children to be the very best they can be.ldquoItrsquos very important to me that every child coming through the door of this school know that they are valued, they are cherished and that they are provided with a first-class education, to progress and to be the best that they can be.Mrs Darling speaks highly of her teaching staff and all the staff who help make St Maryrsquos the school it is today.ldquoI was very warmly welcomed into the Downpatrick area and the parents were extremely supportive. We have a wonderful board of governors who have been very supportive in working with me and the vision I had for the school and Irsquom very fortunate to have had the staff that I had, she added.Like many other teachers, she was called into education due to being inspired by her own teachers from Newtownhamilton in Co Armagh where she was raised.ldquoI always wanted to be a teacher, recalled Mrs Darling. ldquoI think I was fortunate to have wonderful teachers as a pupil and was really inspired by many of them.

He asked me would I come along and join him so we have been out on tour and we were over playing in Camden, in London last week, said Sean.He continued: ldquoHe signed with a record label called Buddy Records and they got it all sorted for us to go in and record with Abbey Road, so we were recording our new single lsquoCall My Name.rsquoWith the new single due to release on Spoty at the end of next week, Sean said: ldquoWersquove got it all nearly ready to go so therersquos just a few mixes that need to be done.Talking about the recording day, Sean said: ldquoWe were in early morning and we were just straight into it, I never really got thinking about it and about midday we took a walk around the building and seen all the big studios.ldquoWe recorded in the Gate House studio and we went into Studio Two and Studio Three to do wee bits of sample and background vocals. That was where The Beatles, Ed Sheerin and Adele all wouldrsquove recorded in as well. So it was just madness, he added.During the recording of the single Sean played his great grandfatherrsquos fiddle, an instrument which has a tale of its own to tell. Sean explained: ldquoMy great grandfather had ordered this fiddle in  before the First World War broke out and hersquod sent the money with the order. Basically then the war broke out and the fiddle didnrsquot turn up so he thought all was lost. As soon as the war was finished in , the fiddle arrived at the door. He couldnrsquot believe it. So I took it with me to Abbey Road and the song we were recording was a slow song, and therersquos a lovely deep tone out of the fiddle so I took it with me.ldquoIt was my grandadrsquos father and my grandad was delighted that I took it with me, he added.When asked how he first met Rory, Sean explained that it was through his dad, Conor Magee. He said: ldquoRory was in a band way back years ago called The Revs and they wouldrsquove been doing sets at the likes of Slane Castle. My dad is a sound engineer, and he done the sound for The Revs about  years ago. We were going over to Lanzarote and I didnrsquot know Rory at all and dad had messaged him to seehe would get me up for a song in the Island Bar.Sean continued: ldquoHe got me up and shortly after that he sent me a message to seeI wanted to do a couple of gigs over in Lanzarote. He asked me thenI wanted to go out on tour with him when he was home. So it came out of nowhere really.Sean has since been touring with Rory and the Island for the last six months, travelling all over Ireland and the UK. Talking about their upcoming gigs, Sean said: ldquoWersquove Germany for St. Patrickrsquos weekend and America then in April, over to New York.He added: ldquoWe also have a local gig in Charliersquos Bar on March .

fishermen whose boats were impounded by the Irish navy amid a row over fishing rights have said they just want to put the incident behind them andto earning a living.Jack Brown, , and -year-old Kevin Trainor pleaded guilty to breaching fishing regulations on Friday after their trawlers were seized in Dundalk Bay.The Northern Ireland-registered vessels, Boy Joseph and Amity, were seized by the Irish navy on Tuesday amid an ongoing dispute over their right to fish in Ireland’s waters under the Voisinage agreement.After being released by Co Louth District Court and reunited with their boats on Friday afternoon, the men said they want to put the incident behind them andto fishing.A statement issued by representative bodies the Anglo-North Irish Fish Producers Organisation and the Northern Ireland Fish Producers Organisation said: “Our members, owners of MFV AMITY and MFV BOY JOSEPH, are hardworking and respected fishermen, who wish to put this incident behind them andto their livelihood.“The men are grateful to the Judge, Gardaí, Irish navy and the local fishing community in Clogherhead, who treated our members at all times professionally, and with courtesy and respect.”During Friday’s hearing, Judge John Coughlan told the court that the men were people of absolute integrity, but he was bound by a Supreme Court decision which effectively banned Northern Ireland boats from fishing in Irish inshore waters.The judge asked at one pointhe could strike out the charges.“It’s clear these are people of absolute integrity, and I should be as lenient as possible,” he said.“This should be dealt with with absolute discretion, but I am bound by the Supreme Court.”Solicitor for the two men Karina Kinsella said that not being able to access their boats was “affecting them greatly” and that it was “unfortunate that Northern Irish fisherman are missing out” because of the Supreme Court ruling.Judge Coughlan agreed, and added that he did not feel the men deserved any conviction.They were given the benefit of the Probation Act and the boats were released early on Friday afternoon and ed to Kilkeel, Co Down, where they are usually based.Hundreds of

Teaser\"The incident came amid an ongoing fishing dispute caused by the demise of an informal deal between the UK and Irish governments.The Voisinage agreement, which collapsed months after the Brexit referendum, was a reciprocal understanding between the UK and Irish Republic dating back to the mid-s which allowed vessels from Northern Ireland to fish in Irish inshore watersand vice versa.But the agreement hit the rocks in late  when a number of Irish fishermen took a case to the state’s Supreme Court, challenging the right of Northern Ireland vessels to fish in their waters.The court ruled that Voisinage was an informal agreement of insufficient legal standing to formally grant access to foreign-registered boats.That decision effectively banned Northern Ireland boats from fishing in Irish inshore waters - a move which affected fishermen north of the border who traded in species such as lobsters, crabs, mussels and whelks.The UK has continued to recognise the Voisinage agreement so Irish vessels remain free to fish inshore waters around Northern Ireland.The joint statement by the Anglo-North Irish Fish Producers Organisation and the Northern Ireland Fish Producers Organisation added: “We hope that this incident will now bring renewed focus on the broader Voisinage issue, and look forward to news of legislative changes over the coming days and weeks.”try catch

The five recordings were found on a USB pen discovered in a classroom in November . The then schoolboy later admitted it was his and that he had made the recordings.According to the NASUWT, he was suspended for his actions in December , but permitted toto school the following month with a management plan in place.The following year, despite his past history, he was made a prefect of moving image arts – a move which led to grievances being lodged by the union on behalf of the two teachers.It is understood  was the first year that all upper sixth pupils at the school were made prefects.One teacher at the school, who didn’t want to be identied, said: “He could have been made a prefect of any subject he studied at A Level. He could have been made a prefect of the library or whatever, but they made him prefect of moving image arts. It was quite shocking.”Justin McCamphill, NASUWT national official for Northern Ireland, commented: “The school knew he had videoed under the skirts of teachers, yet they still decided to make him a prefect for this subject and that has added to the hurt felt by our members.Momo: children ‘crying in fear’ over internet hoax Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“The school has let these teachers down. They have refused to acknowledge the gravity of the situation from early on.”His colleague, policy and casework officer Maxine Murphy-Higgins, insists the school should have expelled Boomer for his actions. “I think the school should issue a public apology,” she said.The News Letter submitted a series of questions to Enniskillen Royal Grammar, including askingthe school thought it was appropriate to make Boomer a prefect of moving image arts why he wasn’t stripped of the title or made prefect of a dferent subject when the teachers’ complaint was raised andit would be making a public apology to the two teachers.Declining to answer the questions, school principal Elizabeth Armstrong said: “As this matter is still subject to proceedings it would not be appropriate for the school to make any comment.”try catch  TrendingNew national anthem for Northern Ireland gets the thumbs upMomo contacts N.I. man -

I canrsquot see that there is any way the council can fix this, there just isnrsquot the infrastructure.ldquoItrsquos obvious that it is not going to work, it would be a waste of money to even try it.But another Plassey Street resident, Bat Goddard, said: ldquoTo spend pound, on an experiment, which in  months they could reject, is ludicrous.ldquoWe have the widest street in Penarth here but they want to turn it in to a one-way system.ldquoWe need to stop this folly now.Vale council member Geoff Cox, who is the cabinet member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, has since said a report will be put forward that retains the roundabout and instead looks at enhancing other ideas to solve crossing issues and traffic problems.Cllr Coxsaid: ldquoAs the Cabinet meeting date approached, I became more aware of the strength of local feeling associated with the highway option being proposed, hence my decision to defer the report meaning it was not even considered by Cabinet on January .ldquoI have since reviewed the ious options further, which has included my meeting with local ward members to obtain their detailed views on all options. I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately.

That being the case, this council, like many others in Wales, is unable to continue to provide the level of subsidy to outdoor sports provision that it has in the past.ldquoExploring dferent ways of working, including the transfer of responsibilities in appropriate circumstances to community groups is a key element of the councilrsquos strategy moving forward as it addresses dficult budget priorities.ldquoFollowing the successful transfer of responsibilities for five libraries to community-based organisations and looking at a number of successful sports clubs across the Vale of Glamorgan who operate without any subsidy from the Council, it is hoped that the majority of clubs currently using council facilities will be able to continue to provide opportunities for all to participate in sports activities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But by the time Mr Varthaman crossed at around pm local time, most people had dispersed.The handover came against the backdrop of blistering cross-border attacks across the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir that continued for a fourth straight day, even as the two nuclear-armed neighbours sought to defuse their most serious confrontation in two decades.Tens of thousands of Indian and Pakistani soldiers face off along the Kashmir boundary known as the Line of Control, in one of the worldrsquos most volatile regions.Tensions have been running high since Indian aircraft crossed into Pakistan on Tuesday carrying out what India called a pre-emptive strike against militants blamed for a February  suicide bombing in Indian-controlled Kashmir that killed  Indian troops.Pakistan retaliated, shooting down two Indian aircraft on Wednesday and capturing the pilot.Since the escalation, world leaders have scrambled to head off an all-out war on the Asian subcontinent.President Donald Trump in Hanoi on Thursday said he had been involved in seeking to de-escalate the conflict.Imran Khan, the Pakistani prime minister, told politicians on Thursday, ldquoWe are releasing the Indian pilot as a goodwill gesture tomorrow.As a true statesman, Prime Minister of Pakistan Imran Khan announced that #Pakistan will release Indian Air Force Pilot Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman tomorrow as a peace gesture. pic nIbdszkmdash Govt of PakistanFebruary , But India made it clear that the latest escalation has changed its strategy and that going forward, it will strike, including inside Pakistan,they receive intelligence of an attack in the planning.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier on Thursday warned ldquoIndiarsquos enemies are conspiring to create instability in the country through terror attacks.Also on Friday, Pakistanrsquos civil aviation authority partially re-opened the countryrsquos airspace, allowing travel to four major cities, another sign tensions were de-escalating.The agency issued a statement saying all domestic and international flights will be allowed to and from the cities of Karachi, Islamabad, Peshawar and Quetta.It said other airports, including the one located in the eastern city of Lahore that borders India, will remain closed until March ..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Pakistan hands over captured pilot to India article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Not in the foreseeable future, he said.Later, speaking at a gathering of the Alliance Party in Belfast, Mr Varadkar expressed concern that Brexit has weakened Northern Irelandrsquos Good Friday Agreement.He said: ldquoI am deeply concerned at how Brexit has already weakened the agreement and I am concerned that anything that creates new dferences ndash ergence between Britain and Ireland ndash will undermine it more.ldquoWe cannot allow that to happen..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: UK leaving EU without a deal unlikely, says Irish PM article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Whilst there needs to be a greater emphasis on catching those responsible, we just cannot let the stuff lie there, it must be cleaned up.Praising environmental health staff, Cllr McAlinden explained that while it is the responsibility of Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Council, this advice from the HSE’s advice has caused problems.“The SDLP council group has raised this issue and have met with the Council’s director and senior officials to discuss this very issue. I was astonished to learn that new advice from the Health and Safety Executive is apparently the reason why we cannot get our roads cleaned.“The official advice is to ensure that when staff or contractors are litter picking along roads there must be a set clearance area between operatives and vehicles using the road.“In its most simple terms, we could see our main roads coned off or even closed off completely just to enable litter to be cleared.”Councillor McAlinden added: “Officers across the councils are challenging this guidance and that staff involved in the work think it’s madness.”“The health and safety of our staff and contractors are vital, but this guidance is overkill.”“It could and will see litter stacked up on roadsides and will ramp up the costs of clearing it when the issue is settled. I just hope common sense prevails and that some action can be taken in the interim.”Rail crossing at Lurgan to close all weekend Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT |

As a former pupil of St Patrick’s College in Armagh, Frankie became fully involved with its past pupil society. In his youth, he played for several local teams around Lurgan. He was a member of Clan Na Gael’s  Championship team as a -year-old, later becoming a valued member with Wolf Tones in Derrymacash. Frankie joined the family business, which had become a wholesale wines and spirit company, Terence McKeown  Sons. Indeed he spent the rest of his working le helping to grow this into a highly successful company as Managing Director. It eventually grew into Rehill McKeown, based for a while in premises in Mary St, Lurgan, then to purpose-built premises in Annesborough Industrial Estate. He expanded the business into off licenses and later purchased MrErlains bakery in Belfast. The company was sold to CC in the late ’s. Frankie was highly respected in the business world. He was deemed a gentleman who was wise and generous with his time, helping clients and staff.He was also part of the local Rotary and then Probus Club. Frankie also had a passion for golf and was a member of Lurgan Golf Club since the early ’s. His proudest accolades included becoming a Captain in the early ’s and then President in early ’s.Indeed he was involved in the club until very recently.

His favourite venture was the ownership of a horse that would be called Church Place, as in the location in Lurgan. Frankie would regularly attend Fairyhouse, the Maze and many other Irish venues. In a tribute, Frankie’s brother Donagh said: “When you know someone who has been part of your le for all of your le, you have many memories and good times to recall. “From childhood Frankie was around, and perhaps because of the age dference, could easily and often was seen as my father. Indeed, from the age of  when my father died, he most definitely indirectly inherited the role. He was always caring, sometimes a little stern, though for the best reason, to instill a little discipline in a young boy’s le, only with a word, I should quickly add.“It was his love for sport that we shared a joint passion, that began with a ‘kick around” in Silverwood. Always the competitive type, he occasionally let this young boy win. “When he and Bridie got married, the two would temporarily adopt myself and younger sister Aideen as their own, before having their own children. By then I became a useful babysitter from time to time. “Their door was always open and we were always welcome for family occasions. Boxing Day night was always a special time for wider family get togethers with the extended family.“It’s taken me a couple of days to be able to write my thoughts about Frankie’s passing. It will take me quite a few more to come to terms with it, even though I’ve known for a while that these days were coming. My family and friends will have many stories to tell, all tinged with personal sadness, though all with a common vein of how much fun he could be, how generous he was, how he truly cared for all, not just us, his own family.“A few years ago, I had the chance to make a short video for Frankie’s th birthday. I had a chance to make a few jokes, tell a few stories of his success in business and sport, and tell of his love of sport. Best of all though was to express something that I don’t think I really did over the previous  odd years I had known him. I said “Frankie,I never told you before, I’ll tell you now. I love you”Mr McKeown passed away peacefully at his home at Kiln Lane, Silverwood, Lurgan on February , .he was the beloved husband of Bridie and loving father of Mary , Anne , and Mel, father-in-law to Kevin, Eamonn and Geraldine, a cherished grandfather of Bronagh, Niamh, Fergal, Kate, Orla, and Grainne, dear brother of Maire, Patricia, Terence , Michael, Gerald, Diarmuid, Donagh, Aideen and the late Jim and Jackie.

How did you get started in the industry  When we first opened Asia Supermarket in , it was the family’s ambition to bring a taste of home to Belfast. We brought the Chinese culture to the local community through cuisine and provided authentic and tasty ingredients for the hospitality trade here. We branched out due to demand to also provide Indian, Korean, Philippine, Thai and Middle Eastern food and are always looking for opportunities to extend our range. Typically, who are your clients or customers  Our customers would be both wholesale and retail to include restaurants all over Northern Ireland, as well as consumers who want to create some unique dishes in their home kitchens. Do you enjoy what you do, and what in particular  Yes, and in particular having just completed the new build we have enjoyed being involved in the day-to-day aspects, given the bespoke nature of the project, coupled with the hustle and bustle of the day to day challenges of satisfying our customer needs. What is the most dficult part of your job  One of the most dficult parts of the job is sourcing good quality produce at competitive prices and enhancing the range of products available. However, we’re very proud of our new supermarket and warehouse which provides even more quality and choice for our customers. What are the challenges facing your sector, and the economy in general  One of the biggest challenges facing our sector is the cost of goods from our suppliers, particularly those procured in foreign currencies which in turn has a knock-on effect on what we charge our wholesale and retail customers. To maintain our share of the market we constantly endeavour to get the best prices from our suppliers so that we can pass on competitive prices to our customers to maintain and grow our market share. With Brexit looming it will bring a major impact on imports costs and supplier prices which will present a major challenge for our business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cctv.jpg","title":"from cctv to gdpr the people keeping your business safe","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by John Mulgrew Ulster Business examines an ever-changing approach to business security and what companies are turning to in an increasingly digital age Is Big Brother watching you  For many, the idea of a society peppered with cameras and other forms of security harks back to the view of a dystopian Orwellian society. But with the UK having some of the highest levels of CCTV cameras in the world, businesses in particular are ensuring that both their physical security, along with digital and paper footprints, are protected. Angela Bennett, joint managing director of Belfast-based Diamond Systems says the role of the security system has evolved hugely in the last few years to become something of a capital investment. Offering more than surveillance, the new security systems we are using provide everything from analysis of the way a firm works to conventional protection. And she says an “ever-increasing” demand around health and safety in the workplace is encouraging more investment in reliable security that is as integral to a firm’s operations as its IT network. “Businesses now treat security systems as a capital investment in technology designed to ensure business continuity, monitor workflow processes, and help manage the ever-increasing demands around health and safety in the workplace,” Angela says. “We are seeing more reliance being placed on security systems, particularly CCTV, as an integral part of site safety management systems. Intelligent system design is essential at the outset of any CCTV project, to ensure adequate coverage and image usability, even in low light conditions.” There have been sophisticated advances in video camera technology in the last few years which have offered businesses new capabilities including motion detection that records only the things that matter, ‘heatmapping’ to determine where the most traffic flows in an area to people counting and unusual motion detection. These new abilities sht the former role of the CCTV camera to a new level, allowing it to file more information about the operations and trends in your business, and Angela agrees.  “CCTV is also being used as a value-added tool, where analytics are incorporated into the video management system ,” she says. “Software analytics are currently benefiting the retail sector for example, helping to plan store layouts, the locations for promotion points, and the forecasting of required staffing levels.” Increasingly sophisticated security also demands its own security, Angela says. “Businesses do however need to be aware of the emerging cyber risks associated with CCTV systems, and how to proactively address them. Choosing a specialist such as Diamond, will ensure that cyber risks are addressed at system design stage, and that systems installed are both future-proof and intelligent,” she says. Beyond CCTV other trends prevalent in business security include compliance with GDPR , cloud security, and articial intelligence and among the top trends for  will be a boost in heightened cloud security. Wikibon, the open source technology knowledge sharing community, projects that the cloud’s share of enterprise computing will grow from % currently to % by . “In terms of future trends, articial intelligence, sensor integration and environmental smart tech are all future demands that will shape the security industry’s offering,” Angela says. “Through partnerships with the leading global innovators, Diamond are at the forefront of this new technology and we will see change coming at a rapid pace over the next few years.” Headquartered in Lisburn with locations in Dublin, Limerick and London, Mercury Security  Facilities Management is a security firm and facilities management business. And according to boss Frank Cullen, the service it provides has transformed considerably since the company was formed back in . “In order for security companies to truly provide fit-for-purpose security solutions to clients, it is crucial that they move with the times – embracing advances in technology, adapting to changing legislation and understanding the changing nature of crime itself. “Cyber-security, in particular, has become a massive issue so the importance of a high degree of IT competence within your security company cannot be overstated. By their very nature, most security systems require external connections to the public internet and are therefore potentially vulnerable. So very good firewall protection must be employed and the support of a dedicated and knowledgeable IT department is essential.” Some of the firms specialising in cyber-security here include Sophos – a UK-based business which develops products for communication endpoint, encryption, network security and email security. And for the digital and hard copy, Belfast-based Morgan Document Security works with both the private and public sector around storing, archiving, retrieving documentation, records, legal papers and files. As with others, Mercury’s Frank Cullen says that the introduction of GDPR in May last year has had a “massive impact on security with signicantly increased financial penalties for companies that do not carefully protect the rights of iniduals – and this includes how CCTV images are handled and controlled”. While it is now very easy to provide managers with access to images on their mobile phones and portable devices, doing so could well mean that you would be breaking the lawvery carefully controlled procedures are not in place to protect the image data, how it is to be observed and by whom. “From a hardware point of view, it is important for security providers to have the competence and capability to assess potential manufacturers and their equipment at the most detailed of levels and to have awareness of the regulatory requirements in which they must work.” Elsewhere, there’s been some movement in other elements of the security business in Northern Ireland. Newtownabbey firm Environmental Street Furniturehas announced the acquisition of Co Down based specialist perimeter security company, Sentry Posts. Sentry Posts is a supplier of bollard systems, perimeter security and traffic products in Ireland. Since establishing in , the company has partnered with ATG Access, supplying prestigious projects including Arsenal Football Club’s Emirates Stadium, Wellington Arch in London, as well as the Europa Hotel and Charles Hurst and Trust Ford dealerships in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cleaver_1.jpg","title":"is the future bright for the ni energy market","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by Ulster Business It is clear that there are a number of signicant challenges facing the energy sector in Northern Ireland but where there are challenges, there are also opportunities, according to law firm Cleaver Fulton Rankin.The ExecutiveNorthern Ireland has just completed its second year without a ing local government and in the words of David Sterling, head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, the Civil Service is “… doing everything we can in the prevailing circumstances…but civil servants cannot take the place of ministers when it comes to strategic policy development or in taking transformative decisions”.  This is very much the case with regard to energy policy. The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.
