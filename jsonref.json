In his brief address, Maduro renewed his call for a dialogue with the opposition. As he spoke, members of Venezuela\u0027s militia each held a cardboard box of the type used to distribute government-subsidised food         Maduro applauded and pumped his fist as soldiers marked past, tanks rolled by and fighter jets streaked overhead at a Caracus military base       Grasping a microphone with his shirt sleeves rolled up, Guaido urged the military to join his movement, saying that anyone in Venezuela who continues to support this \u0027dictatorship\u0027 is an accomplice to human rights abuses         A male supporter of Nicolas Maduro\u0027s government holds a painting of Simon Bolivar — who was instrumental in the country\u0027s uprisings against the Spanish EmpireIn his brief address, Maduro renewed his call for a dialogue with the opposition. As he spoke, members of Venezuela\u0027s militia each held a cardboard box of the type used to distribute government-subsidized food.Despite the splashy military parade, Maduro has had some defectors. Colombian authorities say a few hundred soldiers have abandoned Maduro in recent months.Most notably, Maduro\u0027s spy chief Gen. Manuel Cristopher Figuera fled after a failed military uprising staged April 30 with Guaido and another popular opposition leader, Leopoldo Lopez. Now in the United States, Cristopher Figuera says his mission is to \u0027seek help to free my country from disgrace.\u0027In a sign of increasing international repudiation of Maduro, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, issued a scathing report Thursday accusing Venezuela\u0027s security forces of nearly 5,300 killings last year.         As flags were raised tanks rolled through the military base as a show of strength and loyalty to President Maduro on the 208th independence day         A  truck carrying Russian missiles passed spectators at yesterday\u0027s parade. Maduro says the country is asking for peace with its missiles drawn         Pro-Government supporters joined the parade. ⁠The parade served as a demonstration of Maduro\u0027s continuing support from the military amid a political standoff with opposition leader Juan Guaido, who is trying to oust Maduro and has the backing of more than 50 nations ⁠— including the United States         Members of the Bolicarian National Police stand guard at Romulo Gallegos avenue as the parade marches pastVenezuelans interviewed by the human rights workers referred to a particular security unit, FAES, as a \u0027death squad\u0027 or \u0027extermination group.\u0027Maduro\u0027s government has also undermined the rule of law and dismantled democratic institutions, the U.N. reported.\u0027These measures are aimed at neutralising, repressing and criminalising political opponents and people critical of the Government,\u0027 the report said.Deputy Foreign Minister William Castillo blasted the report, saying it failed to reflect \u0027the reality in our country.\u0027 He demanded the report be corrected and said the government would heed \u0027constructive\u0027 and \u0027balanced\u0027 recommendations.Security forces turned out at just 15 percent of 89 anti-Maduro demonstrations nationwide Friday, a dramatic departure from the government\u0027s zero-tolerance stance, according to figures Guaido\u0027s team provided, which could not be independently confirmed.

They marched toward the headquarters of a military intelligence agency in Caracas, where days earlier a navy captain opposed to Maduro was tortured to death, according to his wife and attorney.

No immediate violence was reported. Previous opposition marches erupted in deadly clashes with police.Among the demonstrators backing Guaido was Melquiades Rosales, whose small business selling shower doors is failing. As a symbol of the country\u0027s mourning, Rosales waved a Venezuelan flag made with shades of gray instead of the original vibrant yellow, blue and red.\u0027So many of us are filled with hopelessness,\u0027 Rosales said, adding that he hasn\u0027t given up. \u0027But we\u0027re in this for a long-term fight.

It seemed that the DWP, stung by the avalanche of adverse publicity, had decided to open the taps and let the money flow.Susan learned just how widespread such fraud was in a mass telephone conference – known in the DWP as a \u0027Telekit\u0027. Hundreds of staff listened in as the North of England\u0027s operations director for Universal Credit, Colin Stewart, addressed them about the issue.\u0027At each desk in the open plan office there were three or four of us huddled around a phone on speaker,\u0027 recalled Susan.\u0027When Mr Stewart mentioned the massive rise in fraud levels, everyone looked at each other – not so much in astonishment, but nodding, as if to say, \u0027I thought as much\u0027.         The current Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd lifted a cap on claiming benefits for more than two children and allowed claimants to be given advance payments to ease the transition\u0027I actually felt a bit pleased, because I thought that, at last, something would be done. But then he said it wasn\u0027t a priority to stop the payments going out ,which left everyone staring at each other open-mouthed.\u0027Senior officials claimed that, instead of stopping the money going out in the first place – which might cause hardship for genuine claimants – the strategy would be to pursue fraudsters once they had received the money.However, the DWP has a woeful record in clawing back fake claims and bringing cheats to justice, with just five per cent of fraudsters going to jail in 2012.Susan said that staff were told in the telephone conference that the fraud problem was worst in the North West and North East, but was spreading out across the country as people invented fictitious children and inflated their housing costs.\u0027Susan said she did not think that was an accurate appraisal, explaining: \u0027My theory is that the fraud is actually nationwide but it\u0027s been picked up more quickly in the North because the staff in that area tend to be longer serving, whereas in the South East there\u0027s a huge turnover in DWP staff and not as much experience to draw upon.\u0027Me and my colleagues have been there for decades and we know the signs to look for.\u0027Even more concerning than the inidual fraudsters were the reports aired during the telephone conference about gangs of criminals coercing vulnerable people to make bogus claims.The staff were told that the gangs would approach people in pubs, ascertain they had their own bank account, then persuade them to apply for what they would describe as a \u0027free loan\u0027 from the DWP by claiming that they paid a huge amount in rent or had a large number of fictitious children.Susan said: \u0027If the criminals help them with their claim, the crooks then take a percentage of the money that comes in. For example, some people are making claims for housing costs when in fact they live with their parents so they don\u0027t have any rent to pay.\u0027A number of Susan\u0027s colleagues flagged up their suspicions about claims they believed to be fraudulent and requested an \u0027inhibitor\u0027 – a stop on payments. However, they were stunned to have their request turned down by senior officials.\u0027We asked why and we were just told, \u0027it\u0027s politics,\u0027 \u0027 said Susan.\u0027Basically there had been so many negative stories about people waiting weeks and months for their payments when Universal Credit was first rolled out, that the department has gone completely the other way.\u0027Some of those stories were genuine, some exaggerated, but this was absolute madness. Staff have been becoming increasingly frustrated for quite a while, especially when you bear in mind that people are receiving advances which are more than their monthly wage.\u0027There is nothing to stop someone making more than one claim, believe it or not, and one particular claimant has had multiple advances in a very short time.\u0027The highest I\u0027ve heard of is £1,500 in one go, but if you said you had eight children and very high housing costs, the sky is the limit.\u0027We see these claims coming in but when we flag it up to senior management we are told directly to do nothing about stopping it \u0027because of the politics\u0027 involved.\u0027We do report them to the fraud team, but I\u0027ve no idea what action is subsequently taken.\u0027We could stop an advance on the basis that we suspected a person had money in savings because the benefit is means-tested. However, staff have been directed not to do that in the last month.\u0027Susan explained how ridiculously simple it was to make a bogus claim. \u0027When you go on the website to make your first claim, it calculates what would be due to you and tells you when you will get your first payment, usually in a month\u0027s time. But it also gives you the option to ask for an advance payment which will come to you in just three working days – and before any of the details you submitted online are verified. You can\u0027t even open a bank account these days without presenting several forms of ID and proof of address, and yet people are having advances of up to £1,500 without any verification.\u0027The staff are well aware of it when these claims come through the system.\u0027The shameless nature of the fraud is, in some cases, entirely transparent, with no attempt at all made to come up with a convincing story.She said: \u0027One man claimed his children were called \u0027Fish\u0027, \u0027Chips\u0027 and \u0027Beans\u0027. In other cases the children\u0027s dates of birth were so close together it would be a medical impossibility for them to have the same mother. But the system does not reject such daft claims – the money gets paid into their account nevertheless.\u0027It may well be that these people will be the subject of legal or criminal action further down the line if they don\u0027t progress their claim, but maybe people feel there\u0027s a chance they might get away with it.\u0027The DWP has an abysmal record for clawing back ill-gotten gains and bringing cheats to book that gives little hope that the millions of misspent taxpayers\u0027 money will be recovered, even though staff were told at the teleconference that the number of fraud investigators will rise by 30 per cent. Figures released last year revealed that benefit fraud cost more than £3.8 billion – up £200 million on the year before – with about 5,000 people convicted.Susan fears that because Universal Credit operates online with little of the human element, it leaves it more vulnerable to fraud.She said: \u0027Under the old system, before Universal Credit we had something called a short-term benefit advance, which was at the discretion of an adviser to discuss how much the person needed, and then decide on an amount.\u0027It would usually be for about £50 or so – not the huge sums which are going out now. The figures are higher because Universal Credit replaces six benefits – including housing, which is the biggest.\u0027The trouble is the calculation is virtually instant, but it\u0027s based entirely on the information the claimant is putting in, which only gets verified at a later stage.\u0027A DWP spokesman said last night: \u0027Benefit fraud is a crime that erts money from those who really need it and we are determined to catch the small minority who cheat the system.\u0027We remain vigilant to all forms of fraud and investigate, and prosecute, where appropriate.\u0027We are constantly refining our processes to ensure Universal Credit remains both accessible and secure, with those who need support getting it.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Her heads clouds Duchess Cambridge helps design seat watch world by","story":"Share this article \u0027The idea of creating something from nothing was something the Duchess enjoys with her family.\u0027That includes an activity she used to do as a child – \u0027making little boats out of reeds from the stream, which she now does with her children\u0027, Mr White added: \u0027Andree and I had a go at making them.

The flailing political right, intellectually bankrupt but keenly culturally aware, has unleashed a social and political civil war to save itself. Brexit marks not the end but the beginning of a new politics in which the right is transmuting into the party of English nationalists – the Brexit party engulfing mainstream Toryism. The ugly forces have to be confronted, argued against and beaten. No quarter is possible.By refusing to take up arms, the Labour party has colluded with the Brexit right, created the opening for the Lib Dems and Greens and thus permitted the emergence of a new multi-party system. If Labour continues to temporise, the first past the post electoral system will fell it. The Lib Dems, unapologetic Remainers who are beginning to recognise that their Keynesian tradition offers better policies for the times than soft Thatcherism, have the opportunity to become the new anchor of British progressive politics – strengthened, if they are sufficiently strategic, by working closely with the Greens.The Remain alliance at the Brecon and Radnor byelection, in which both the Greens and Plaid Cymru have stood down to make the Lib Dem the unambiguous Remain candidate, is a potential forerunner of what is to come. The Labour party risks becoming a marginalised rump – pockmarked by antisemitism and hopeless utopianism – squeezed between rightwing English nationalists and a dynamic Remain coalition.Jeremy Corbyn and the powerful coterie around him do not comprehend the new politics, resisting the unacceptable “Blairite” message that Labour has to be a Remain party. The concerns of the up to 30 Labour MPs in Leave-voting constituencies have offered them the pretext for indulging their own time-warped anti-EU prejudices at the same time as being wholly outflanked in a rightwing bidding war to spend, spend and spend – Nigel Farage’s £200 billion “ booster” plan for British regions topping Boris Johnson’s £100 billion infrastructure plan.Who is pro austerity now? Imagining that Labour’s “ground army” knocking on voters’ doors, along with Corbyn’s over-hyped campaigning skills, are going to turn around the party’s fortunes in a general election – now nearly certain within the next 12 months – is to take refuge in fantasy.The Lexit left congratulated itself on besting Labour’s Remainers at the April meeting of the national executive committee, going into the Euro elections with an appeal-to-all-sides, referendum-as-last-resort manifesto pledge. A mere 10 weeks later, the vacuity in terms of values and philosophy – let alone the political black hole – is there for all to see. Labour’s opinion poll rating is dire and its electoral performance awful. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, is right privately to describe Labour’s stance as a slow-motion car crash, wrong only on one count. It is unfolding at speed.The strains at the top have become intense. Seumas Milne, Corbyn’s director of strategy, wants the Tories to be blamed for a Brexit which privately he wants ardently: once it’s done, runs the calculation, voters will look to Labour to address the economic and social consequences with a full-blooded Labour programme. What is required now is to keep kicking the can down the road, triangulating, being ambiguous and avoiding being labelled Remain. Short-run electoral pain for long-run gain. Corbyn, congenitally indecisive and happier to float above the fray in a comfort zone of anti-austerity, colludes.McDonnell profoundly disagrees. He is smart enough to recognise the new landscape and thus sees deputy leader Tom Watson’s core point: the values of Remain – anti-rightwing populism, pro-openness, internationalist – are Labour values. There is no escape. Labour has to be a Remain party to retain both its link to its core values and its core vote. Nor would this change post-Brexit as a demonic rightwing English nationalism takes hold: electoral victory will not fall into Labour’s lap.Publicly, McDonnell has declared himself a convinced Remainer my understanding is that Corbyn has been advised by some confidants to sack both Milne and Karie Murphy, executive director of his office – and set an early July deadline to end the time-wasting “consultation”. Corbyn has ignored this – mindful that much of the post-2015 Labour membership will back him against any challenger. Any challenger? The whisper is that McDonnell, guarantor that any successor will be rooted in a solid radical left economic policy, is in the market for supporting a leadership challenge as long as the left’s control of the party is retained afterwards.Keir Starmer hesitates, knowing that to fail will end his political career. Emily Thornberry, shadow foreign secretary, covets the job but is not trusted by the left. Angela Rayner, shadow education secretary, is, like Starmer, wary of breaking cover too early. On the Corbynite left the frontrunner is Rebecca Long-Bailey, although her sponsors worry whether she can become politically fluent fast enough. A Rayner or Starmer challenge on a Remain and Reform UK platform, backed by McDonnell, would have a better than evens chance of success – and then of doing well electorally.The wider hope is that no bloodletting will be necessary: the Equality and Human Rights Commission will find that the leader’s office was guided by loyalty to Corbyn in the way it treated allegations of antisemitism, making his position untenable. Or more simply he knows his weaknesses, and if the left’s control of the party is sustained, he would step readily aside. Meanwhile, deputy leader Tom Watson musters his forces: for him, removing Corbyn is purposeless unless mainstream Labour regain control of their partyThe manoeuvring is intense.What will break the dam will be the Johnson government, and the possibility that either this parliament will be faced in October with the choice of revoke or no deal – or plunged into a LeaveRemain general election, with the Tories having some kind of electoral pact with the Brexit party.There will be other pitched battles before this civil war is over, but Labour is now facing an existential choice about whether to enter the war at all. What McDonnell, Starmer, Watson and Rayner are contemplating takes raw bravery – but they have only weeks to act. To shrink before the challenge is to betray their party and their country."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59a06b0a196668fba1fd0b32b065f4583611c883/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aeb5f29fd82273c3ece072e08a1ba66c","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of summer","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘summer’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘summer’.Share your photos of what summer means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 10 July at 10am.

Limited-edition versions of her clothes hang all around us, saved for favoured customers who make it into this locked zone.Indeed, it turns out that the rocks have been shipped down from Paul’s farm on the Mull of Kintyre, where mist rolls in from the sea – the mist now rolls into his daughter’s garments, apparently. “I was like, Dad, this is weird…” she explains, “but can I have some rocks?”Stella is bright-eyed and perky, quite frank, open and has the manner of someone not put on this earth to waste time. I ask if we are in a VIP room, but she groans and says that when somebody called it that during the planning stages she responded that they would not be working with her for very long if they used that word again. I think it is politically important to Stella to be seen as egalitarian, which must be hard when you’re selling fluffy jumpers for a grand.Anyway, the award-winning designer, 47, is dressed in layers of matching beige neutrals today, of her own design, of course. We are here to discuss a new collection she has created, called All Together Now, which is inspired by the 1968 Yellow Submarine film based on music by her father and his fellow Beatles. She has always been a proud bearer of her mother Linda’s vegetarian credentials, going to great lengths to avoid any use of leather and fur. But ing right into the Beatles legacy is something new.But first we need to talk about the shop itself, of which Stella is equally proud. She was really specific about the rocks, she says, after her dad agreed to liberate them. “We had to reinforce the floors, to weight-bear them and all that sort of stuff, for my rock passion. And then, you know, they weren’t quite the right colour, so now we spray them.” Stella also wanted moss on them, but the problem with keeping that going, as she explains, sadly, “is that moss doesn’t really want to live on Bond Street. In a store.”“Oh yes the Moss is here, in many ways,” the McCartney agrees. When I put it to her that her friend is now a national treasure, she says Moss would never accept such a role, “because you probably wouldn’t like her so much if she did. You’d be like, ‘Oh, bummer, she’s not as cool as we thought she was.’ But I’ll tell her,” says Stella, clearly proud of her friendship. “I’ll say, Sophie says you’re amazing.” We both know she will do no such thing, but still.The new Beatles-inspired range includes knitwear with ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE embroidered on it in various languages and Savile Row tailored jackets inspired by the marching-band suits in the film. There is a long, psychedelic Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds dress, and plenty of yellow submarine motifs throughout the collection, which is for women, men and children. “Look at that fucking Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band bag for kids, how cool is that?” she says as she shows me her inventions. The idea came to her after the film was remastered last year and her dad held a family screening. “Just a little one, but it was literally like all of the Beatles’ children and grandchildren there.” Influenced by the kids’ enjoyment of the film, she says she saw it through completely fresh eyes. “It just hit me really hard. I went far too deep into all the meanings. Even the line ‘All together now’ – I thought, that is so incredible that these four kids from Liverpool, at such a young age, came up with something so inclusive, which feels very contemporary to everything that we’re talking about today, in the now. I came away feeling really inspired, like I had to do something with it.”I tell her that I recently showed it to my fascinated seven-year-old and it reawakened childhood memories of having my mind blown at a similar age, as if you could almost get drunk on the psychedelic imagery.“I agree completely. It’s a gift. All hand-drawn with inidual gels and, you know, who today in the world of music is going to create an animated film like that? Who on earth has created a body of work like that? I can’t name anyone.”McCartney lives in west London (as well as in the countryside, where she rides horses) and is married to Alasdhair Willis, with whom she has four children. Her unwavering moral commitments have put her in an interesting position as an activist in the fashion business, which she describes as the second most harmful industry to the planet. “It’s my intention to stand shoulder to shoulder with the conventional houses and show that you can actually be respectful in your supply chain and manufacture.”To which end, she’s created alternatives not just to leather and fur, but also to all sorts of other materials, such as PVC, because its chemical production is so harmful, “and they say it’s cancerous to the people who work with it, and then the residue runs into the rivers because the factories are built on rivers”. It has taken her 10 years of innovation to make a clear shoe without using it.Is it satisfying to have to work hard on the invention side of things? “No. It’s not like I go, ‘Oh, I’m not going to use PVC because the challenge will make me more creative.’ It’s like, ‘Well, that fucking sucks, and I’ve also only got three sequins that I can use in two colourways as opposed to 5,000 that everyone else will use.’ If everyone else was sustainable, we could have a level playing field, so it does feel unfair – but it’s my choice and I believe very much in my reasons for working in that way. You know what? It’s not like I’m here for an easy life.”She says recent changes in the industry, with other designers waking up to the planet, are led by people power. “These recent changes are consumer-driven. I don’t think our industry would be doing that if the customers weren’t demanding it.”So it’s simply a capitalist response to the market? “I think so, yeah, and that’s OK, because that’s capitalism, you know, that’s what happens. But now is the time, as a consumer, to really understand. We’re going to have to push the people in power. And how fucking amazing is it that it’s 15, 16-year-olds who are doing that? Thank God for them.”Does this mean that her two daughters and two sons, who are aged between eight and 14, will take over the business one day? “I don’t know. Of course one side of me is like, ‘I want the kids to do this.’ But then it’s like, is that my ego? I don’t want to put that pressure on them. My mum and dad didn’t go, ‘Right, you’re going to be writing all the next albums.’ The kids should just do what they want to do.” Indeed, she recently watched Succession, a TV drama about a media dynasty that battles over who will inherit the family business, and “found it a bit depressing, actually”.Fashion means everything to her, though. She even wants to analyse my outfit. “Psychologically,” she says, “I find it incredibly interesting that you chose a vintage-esque, ethnic, quilted cotton coat to wear today. It’s a very feminine piece, probably women made it. It says you probably celebrate some kind of hand touch, heritage, some kind of travel.” The gold cuffs on my shirt, “also tells a lot about you, that little bit of Lurex peeping out”.She’s not so keen on my leather boots, oops, (“People don’t bring leather into me, generally…”) but, tragically, it’s my face that says most about me, which will teach me not to make such an effort next time.“And then you’ve got your red lip and… you know, you’ve got a lot of makeup on,” Stella McCartney notes, staring at my head. A pettier person than I might respond that she is wearing exactly as much makeup herself, only it’s all in neutral shades just like her outfit – but I’m not, so I won’t.The publicist tells me there is time for me to ask one last question, so I use my precious minute to ask what she thinks of dry cleaning. Do we actually need it in the world today? Stella bursts out laughing, almost barking with amusement that I would use my precious last moments on this topic.“I love you,” she says, “this is such a great, random question. OK, so I went to St Martins when I was a baby and in my free time I studied on Savile Row to be a bespoke tailor. It was a very masculine world, incredible, obsessed.”Were you the only girl in the room? “I was the only girl who had ever been in the room. I was there for three years and I barely learned how to set a sleeve head in a sleeve. It’s like architecture. It’s amazing. And the rule on a bespoke suit is you do not clean it. You do not touch it. You let the dirt dry and you brush it off. Basically, in life, rule of thumb: if you don’t absolutely have to clean anything, don’t clean it. I wouldn’t change my bra every day and I don’t just chuck stuff into a washing machine because it’s been worn. I am incredibly hygienic myself, but I’m not a fan of dry cleaning or any cleaning, really.”And then her assistant whisks me away, urged by Stella to show me around even more of the shop, because building it “killed me. I had no interior designer and no architect, we did it all in-house.” So the assistant leads me into a downstairs lavatory, naturally, because “celebrities have signed their autographs on the wall,” she explains, trying to find some names to show me but finding only that of Keith Lemon, who has written a pee joke. And then I find one myself, a message signed with a name that looks an awful lot like Alasdhair. Is this Stella’s husband, I ask?Oh yes, the assistant says!“I JUST WANT MY WIFE BACK,” it reads.

At first, we think he’s doing it to blot out the spectacle of his beloved aunt Elisabeth (Saskia Rosendahl) being bundled into an ambulance in Nazi Germany. But the truth is more complex. As young Kurt (a wonderfully wide-eyed Cai Cohrs) holds his palm a few inches in front of his face, we see what he sees – the hand coming into close focus, rendering what’s behind it slightly blurry. When his hand drops down, the awful truth beyond remains momentarily fuzzy – creating the impression of seeing at one remove. As the ambulance doors slam shut, Elisabeth makes eye contact with her nephew and repeats an instruction that has become her mantra: “Never look away…”That phrase, which echoes throughout the film’s three-hours-plus running time, became the English-language title. It’s quite different from the German original Werk Ohne Autor (work without author), a phrase once used by critics to describe the works of German artist Gerhard Richter, whose early life inspired the story (though Richter has pointedly distanced himself from the film).Yet the words “never look away” cut right to the heart of the matter this is a story about seeing and not seeing about looking and looking away – often at the same time. Whether it’s the grotesque operations carried out under a veneer of civility by Nazi doctor Carl Seeband (played with chilling detachment by Sebastian Koch), or the monolithic ideologies of fascism and communism against which budding artist Kurt struggles equally (if covertly), the film is centrally concerned with ways of seeing. That it should approach such an esoteric, thorny subject through the crowd-pleasing format of an overcooked melodrama is perhaps surprising, addressing, as it does, lofty aesthetic concerns through old-fashioned conservative film-making techniques. What’s even more remarkable is that it succeeds more often than it fails.The film opens, appropriately, with an out-of-focus image of a Nazi-sanctioned “modern art” exhibition aimed to denounce “decadent” works in which “mental illness is elevated to a defining principle” by “people who see fields as blue, the sky as green, and clouds as sulphur yellow!” “Don’t tell anybody, but I like it,” whispers Elisabeth, as she and Kurt stand transfixed by a condemned Kandinsky. Soon, Elisabeth’s artistic temperament will result in her being sterilised and, worse, damned by a flick of Professor Seeband’s sword-like pencil.Years later, the adult Kurt (Tom Schilling) falls for fellow student Ellie (Paula Beer), which unwittingly draws him into the orbit of Seeband, whose past remains occluded. Having saved the unborn baby of a Russian officer (“Because I can,” he declares pompously, words that Kurt will, significantly, repeat), Seeband has escaped imprisonment and flourished in Soviet East Germany, nimbly swapping one authoritarian order for another – a point the film makes without resort to subtlety. As for Kurt, he progresses from sign writing to mural painting, producing supposedly uplifting portraits of workers wielding approved tools until a defection to the west finally offers him artistic freedom. But at what price? Having thrown off the shackles of the old order, Kurt finds himself becalmed, bereft of inspiration, desperate for direction – a new way of looking.Never Look Away is Henckel von Donnersmarck’s third feature. After making his mark with the Oscar-winning Stasi-drama The Lives of Others, he co-wrote and directed The Tourist, a lavishly empty romp in which Hollywood stars Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie swanned around Venice to no one’s amusement but their own. With Never Look Away, released in Germany last October, the film-maker has regained his mojo, earning him a second foreign language Oscar nomination plus a deserved nomination for cinematographer Caleb Deschanel earlier this year. While the direction may be deceptively unfussy, Deschanel does brilliant work bringing Kurt’s worldview to life, enabling us to understand his progress towards an artistic breakthrough, represented here by paintings conjured by (among others) Richter’s former assistant Andreas Schön.A superbly affecting score by Max Richter (no relation) helps to negotiate the ide between the occasionally clumsy contrivances of the on-the-nose narrative and the aspirations of a populist movie that strives with some sincerity to celebrate the healing power of art. As that early shot suggests, it’s only by looking away that we can actually see the truth, using obfuscation to achieve clarity – albeit with added popcorn."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0320208737e7ed4bf634de0b8b02c7898d8a9ab3/0_0_4781_2868/master/4781.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c43e06f02d54b2ea558656f5be30bf26","title":"jay rayner laksa satay nasi goreng bugis street brasserie review","story":"A London hotel where Singapore Airlines’ crew go for a taste of home is worth checking outBugis Street Brasserie, Millennium Gloucester Hotel, London SW7 4LH (020 7331 6211).

These are not the compressed cysts of tortured animal protein impaled on cocktail sticks and dyed yellow that fester in supermarket chiller cabinets across the land. These are smoky pieces of heavily spice-rubbed thigh, the occasional tassels of skin fired to crisp on the grill. There are singed bits and golden bits and roasted bits. With them is the requisite sauce that hits you first with the sweetness of peanut, but which keeps going with layers of spice and aromatics. At first you try to be refined, dipping the chicken in the sauce daintily. Then you take to dragging it through the bowl enthusiastically. Finally, you’re leaving the pieces of chicken on the plate and spooning the sauce over the top. There are, as there should be, cooling pieces of cucumber to settle everything down.From the list headed “Bugis Signatures” comes the classic nasi goreng, a huge plate of rust-coloured rice, mined with spiced chicken, prawns and a few peas for colour and pop, then topped with a fried egg, the yolk from which is just waiting to be pierced. With it comes a deep red sambal with huge toasted chilli notes with which to lubricate the rice and bring out the odd bead of sweat.And then, of course, there is the laksa. Oh, the laksa. If, like me, you have a mental laksa map, a geographical plotting of the best places for the dish, drop a pin for this one. The thicker rice noodles take me by surprise I’m used to thinner vermicelli, but these have a satisfying slurp. The broth is not overly sweetened. It’s a huge bash of chilli and stock and coconut. It bobs with prawns that have the bite of seafood cooked through only in the hot broth once it hit the bowl. I slurp and sip and dig about very happily.Singapore has long been a culinary crossroads, with ethnic groups being washed ashore in waves and bringing with them their food. So here is a terrifying-looking Malaysian chicken curry made with thigh served on the bone, in a bright red liquor beneath a surface puddle of orange oil perhaps half a centimetre deep. I worry it will be grim and greasy to eat, but it’s nothing of the sort. The pungent gravy seems to emulsify as it gets in your bowl. We have Nyonya pork, in a dark sauce full of cracked black pepper and sweet chilli. From a list of specials awaiting us on the table come chunks of long-braised pork belly, with jelly-like fat, served in a clay pot that’s so hot, the black sauce is still bubbling and spitting at us when it lands. It is a dish for which the words “yes please” were invented.The picture-led dessert menu offers a bunch of slightly worrying things, involving slippery bean curd or sweetened red-bean paste. We retreat to the safety of banana fritters in a palm sugar syrup. It’s unneeded and all the better for that. We drink very little, but there are beers and solid-looking wines for those who want them. Most dishes are priced from around a tenner and into the low teens, alongside set menu options for £12. It’s the sort of place where people come alone at lunchtime for a single plate of good food, and feel very comfortable doing so. If it were relevant, I might tell you it’s packed with people from South East Asia. That happens to be so. But it’s far more useful to know that its true claim on your attention goes far beyond simply being better than the Holiday Inn across the road.The Greyhound Café, the first London branch of a well-known Bangkok group, offers a sprightly, expansive take on the Thai repertoire. The dish names can be a little tiresome – there’s Salmon in Hot Pursuit, Bugs in My Salad, and Angry Pasta – but it’s all worth your time. The German style pork knuckle with a kicking tamarind curry paste is a standout, as is the Tom Yum soup with tiger prawns and prawn-stuffed dumplings.The Stockport Produce Hall, a site for various street food-style stands, has been criticised for not including enough independent traders in its repertoire, in favour of large-scale restaurant brands. Now they’ve announced that the brilliant Cambodian restaurant Angkor Soul from nearby Marple, will, have a presence there from this month.And on a similar subject Market Halls, which already operates ‘multi-vendor’ food courts in London’s Fulham and Victoria has received £20 million of backing from equity firm Bridgepoint Growth, to role the model out across the country. If the street food movement was once to the restaurant business what indie record labels once were to the majors, that moment appears to be passing.

Glistening with date and pomegranate syrup, one sweet, the other sour, they are slowly browning to a mirror glaze. The ribs are on a wire rack resting over a roasting tin that I have lined with foil so that any drips of syrup don’t burn on the tin. It’s a bugger to scrape off.There have been so many ribs in this oven over the years: ribs with molasses, ribs with chilli paste, ribs with aniseed and honey, and ribs with maple syrup and mustard. I steam them first, in the piece to keep them juicy, the whole length of bone, flesh and fat covered with foil and left in a slow oven for a good couple of hours. The meat cooks in its own steam and becomes so tender you can pull the ribs apart with two forks.They get a second shot in the oven, thickly brushed with their sweet-and-sour dressing, the heat turned up high. The sugars caramelise. The edges blacken and blister, and the meat will stay succulent within its polished mahogany crust. I let them sit for 10 minutes before separating into lumps of two or three ribs, then pile them on top of a mound of rust-red, kickass kimchi into which I have tossed some ice-cold cucumber.There’s a cherry tart for pudding: a sort of bakewell but more seasonal, made with the generosity of pistachios and ripe cherries. We will eat in the garden and everyone can throw their bones and stones in the bushes.Bake the tart case first to ensure it is crisp. Place a baking sheet in the oven to get hot before you start baking.Serves 6For the pastry:plain flour 200gbutter 100gegg yolk 1water about 2 tbspFor the frangipane:butter 100gcaster sugar 125gpistachios 60geggs 2flour 60gground almonds 60gFor the filling:cherries 250gmorello cherry jam 250gflaked almonds 3 tbspPut the flour and butter into a food processor and reduce to soft crumbs, then add the egg yolk followed by enough water to make a firm but slightly sticky dough. If you prefer, cut the butter into dice, rub into the flour with fingertips then mix in the egg and water. Transfer to a lightly floured board or work surface, pat into a thick disc, wrap in kitchen paper and refrigerate for 30 minutes.Heat the oven to 200Cgas mark 6. Roll the pastry out and use to line a 23cm loose-bottomed tart tin. Fill with baking parchment or foil and baking beans then bake for 20 minutes. Remove the paper or foil and beans and return to the oven for a few minutes until the pastry is dry.While the pastry is baking, make the frangipane. Cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. (This is easiest done with a food mixer fitted with a beater attachment.) While the mixture is creaming, grind the pistachios to a fine powder in a food processor. Break the eggs into a bowl, beat lightly with a fork, then add to the butter and sugar. If the mixture shows any sign of curdling or becomes grainy, introduce a little flour. Finally, mix in all the flour, all the ground nuts and set aside.Stone the cherries. Remove the pastry case from the oven and turn the oven down to 160Cgas mark 3. Spread the base of the pastry case with the jam. Scatter the stoned cherries over then spoon in the frangipane and smooth the surface.Scatter the flaked almonds over the tart and bake for 40 minutes until the filling feels lightly firm.

Pour freshly boiled water into the tin and place a metal rack for the pork to sit on over the roasting tin.Season the ribs with salt, then place on the rack and cover the tin and pork tightly with tinfoil. Place in the oven and bake for 2½ hours until the meat is tender (it should pull easily from its bones).Mix the date syrup and pomegranate molasses. Remove the roasting tin from the oven, take off the foil, lift off the rack and pour away the water. Turn the oven up to 220Cgas mark 8. Line the roasting tin with foil then replace the rack and pork on the tin and brush the meat generously with the syrup.Return the meat to the oven, uncovered, and bake for about 10 minutes, then brush it with more of the syrup. Return to the oven for a further 10 minutes or until the meat is dark, sticky and glossy. Remove the meat from the tin and leave to rest for 10 minutes before cutting into ribs and serving with the slaw below.For the kimchi slaw, peel the cucumber and cut into slim matchstick-sized pieces. Slice the radishes into thin rounds then add both to the kimchi and set aside for a good hour."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bcb52b9c2a7be240357744e76e2646cde0940220/0_360_3572_2144/master/3572.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ef64bbb11130df35d3120e8fd10b0b2","title":"womens world cup means so much england usa readers","story":"The tournament has not just broken TV records. It has also changed how people see the sportIt’s changed my (male) partner’s view of women’s football. He didn’t know much about it before and assumed the women’s game must be somehow “less exciting” because it’s not as popular, but he’s really enjoyed watching the World Cup with me – even if I get a bit vocal sometimes!He’s also become a big proponent of equality for the Lionesses and thinks women’s football should be put on level standing with the men’s game. He’s even taken to social media to call for more coverage of the women’s leagues, fair pay and more funding for the sport. I’m so proud of him! I’m hoping the success of our amazing Lionesses will mean they are given the respect they deserve. It means a lot to a girl who was told at school in the early 1980s that she couldn’t play football because it was a ‘boys sport’. Jen, South YorkshireWe usually get together in a boozer to watch the England men’s team, but this is the first time we’ve watched a women’s match together. The whole tournament has been an opportunity to be with friends and send mild abuse to my American in-laws! I’ll be over in California with them for the final on Sunday so, against my natural instincts, I’ll be supporting USA. Andy Bartlett, LondonThe tournament has changed my perception of the women’s game completely. Prior to the tournament I’d have struggled to name more than a few of the England squad, but now some of them are among my sporting heroes.We travelled to Nice to watch England’s opener against Scotland and for the last month I have arranged my social life around watching the games. My levels of excitement and nerves have reached a level not far off those experienced during last summer’s World Cup. I’m already making plans to attend some Women’s Super League games next season – something I had never previously considered.Before long, this World Cup will be seen as a significant turning point in women’s sport and the fight for gender equality in football. I’m thrilled to have experienced it so closely along the way. Grant, 29, LondonThe tournament hasn’t been a massive change for me. I’ve been a fan since the 1970s, when I played in a competitive league as a young girl. But I’ve finally gotten a few male friends to take it seriously. They’ve appreciated the lack of theatrics as a whole (some still happen, but not to the degree of the men’s game). I’m hoping USA win so my team can thumb their noses at our ridiculous president! Julie B, MinneapolisWatching the World Cup has without a doubt changed how I see women’s football. The game is better than the men’s game! Although a little slower, accuracy of passing is better, there are fewer fouls and fewer histrionics. This season I’ll definitely attempt to watch more Manchester United women’s games. They’ve only had one season and have been promoted to the same league as Manchester City, so it’ll be interesting to see how they compare with the men. I’m a season ticket holder at Old Trafford and will now make more of an effort to support the women. Harry Bloom, GlossopThis World Cup has changed how I view football, let alone the women’s game! I used to follow Liverpool as a kid, but went off football as I grew up. The games are so stop-start and and the players are spoilt and are paid obscene amounts of money. I started watching the Women’s World Cup to encourage my kids and now I’m hooked.It’s all so easy to watch and so relatable. Most of all I love seeing what bodies like mine can do – it’s amazing to see a female body used for strength and power instead of boring old sexiness. It feels like real, interesting people out there playing the game. And every player has an inspirational story to tell about overcoming difficulties and prejudice. How can I pick one team to support when they’re all so engaging?For the first time, I finally understand the attraction of football. These teams have shown me what a fantastic game it is – the skill, passion, strategy and endurance. It means my daughters can see what their female bodies can do. The World Cup has given them dozens of strong, tough role models who can show them the way forward. Sarah Hames-Clarke, Bolton-by-BowlandI’ve always loved the Women’s World Cup. This year, however, there’s something more in it for me as it feels like the most erse tournament I’ve ever seen. That matters to me because I walked away from football because I didn’t feel like I belonged. Basketball was practically shoved down my throat when I was a kid but when I discovered “soccer” – thanks largely to the Mia Hamm craze of the late 1990s – I was in love and convinced I’d found my sport.But then I enrolled in an elite private high school and was the only black girl on the field. I left tryouts full of shame, convinced I had no business being there. No one made fun of me, but there was an embarrassment and loneliness that was unbearable and I was already anxious about being a black girl from the wrong side of town in the predominantly white, upper-class environment. I never returned to the game and it’s something I’ll regret for the rest of my life.I am thrilled at how many black women and women of colour are at this World Cup. From the powerful story of the Reggae Girlz, to Wendie Renard and, of course, Crystal Dunn. The feeling of joy I get seeing this representation is indescribable.There are very few occasions when women are celebrated at an equal or comparable level as men. As a 29-year-old from US, I’ve seen women fight to be taken as seriously as men in music, business, the culinary field, writing, film and, of course, sports for nearly 30 years. But in that time I’ve also witnessed my country celebrate our women’s national team with genuine fervour and respect.This tournament has given us the chance to see women become national heroes and to be taken seriously not for their appearance, but for their grit and talent. Regardless of who wins, I think it’s been a tremendous success for the women’s game and a great moment in the march towards gender parity.

They share the sacrifice, solidarity – and ice baths – that got them to the World CupEmbarrassingly, there were tears running down my face when I stepped into the roaring stands for England’s first match of the 2019 Women’s World Cup in Nice. Football is just a game, but for women players it is hard to disengage from the sexism and stresses that accompany it. Watching Nikita Parris flowing down the wing, smashing in a penalty at the 14th minute, then Ellen White’s initial offside goal being rewarded by the real deal: I know how hard their predecessors had fought for these moments of unadulterated joy.The frenzy of press and promotion in the lead up to this year’s tournament was unprecedented. But Goal Click, a five-year-old social enterprise that sends disposable cameras to footballers around the world and then publishes the results online (alongside candid interviews), has been well ahead of the strike. Before the tournament, their cameras ended up in the hands of 18 international players, including England right-back Lucy Bronze, Jamaica defender Lauren Silver and USA midfielder Sam Mewis. All have captured the beautiful game in a singularly personal way.From the start, we have tried to represent the full ersity of the game,” says Goal Click co-founder Matthew Barrett. “Our second story was about an Indian girls football team in Mumbai.” Other projects have included the Homeless World Cup and the Single Leg Amputee Sports Association in Sierra Leone. “I have more interest in women’s football stories off the pitch because, quite frankly, they are deeper and more meaningful,” adds Barrett. The women’s game is known for its close friendships, and the photographs highlight these bonds, formed both at club and international level. “In the men’s game, I don’t think there is that same sense of camaraderie,” Barrett says. “You’re not best mates.”The photographs give an intimate view of life beyond the match-day theatrics. Chelsea players pile on to charter planes (the women’s game can’t afford private jets just yet) a Norwegian team play in the snow and Australians warm up on the beach. There are messy boot rooms, selfies and “leg-fies” by stars such as France’s Eugénie Le Sommer. Mewis’s image of USA teammates Rose Lavelle and Alex Morgan staring up at the camera as they kneel in an ice water bath is a particular highlight for Barrett: “It really stood out as a photo that could only have been taken by a teammate.”With Thailand striker Miranda Nild as one of his contributors, her team’s brutal 13-0 loss to the USA was difficult to sit through but surprisingly Barrett says he is glad it happened. “That scoreline is what used to happen in men’s football in the 1960s and 70s, before proper investment went into national sides.”Every player featured on these pages hopes to inspire a new generation, and my favourite shot from Goal Click’s project is of a teenage grassroots player – Sushanti Kumari in India, a football balanced on her nose above a wide smile. These are the girls who will have been watching these past weeks – who will feel the way I did in the stands in Nice, watching England v Scotland, surrounded by women wearing kilts and covered in facepaint: inspired.• To see more photographs from the project, visit goal-click"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/159289cd1267b4ab48c3ed6fabe322e946d20997/0_62_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8979cea6e6a345e5939e68c118192647","title":"manchester united paul pogba summer tour","story":"Manchester United fully expect Paul Pogba to be on the plane when Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s squad fly to Australia on Sunday afternoon to start the summer tour.Pogba’s presence has been in doubt since his agent, Mino Raiola, admitted on Friday that the 26-year-old is trying to force his way out of the club.Asked about Pogba being on the flight to Perth Raiola said: “I cannot tell you anything, I live by day to day.”Yet it is understood that United would be shocked should Pogba not be on board as the Frenchman had confirmed his intention to be there.On the pre-season tour, Solskjær’s first as the club’s manager, United face Perth Glory and Leeds United in Perth, before playing Internazionale in Hong Kong and Tottenham Hotspur in Shanghai.United are then in Oslo on 30 July to take on the manager’s hometown club, Kristiansund, before a trip to Cardiff for a final friendly against Milan on 3 August.Fred and Matteo Darmian are to join the tour later for “family reasons”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ff62f7dab0b5977d8c06a5be87013c97e8fa308/0_147_3339_2004/master/3339.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b87d54448e741d5194cb3a518d761674","title":"womens super league double headers mens premier league fa manchester city united","story":"Women’s Super League matches will be played as double-headers alongside Premier League fixtures next season, according to one of the most senior figures in the English game.The Women’s World Cup has brought a groundswell of interest in women’s football, with 11.7m viewers tuning in to watch Phil Neville’s England side lose to the United States in their semi-final.The aim is to build on that, with the biggest WSL clashes of the 2019-20 season set to take place in stadiums usually reserved for male teams. According to Kelly Simmons, the Football Association director of the women’s professional game, fixtures could also take place on the same day as Premier League matches.“That will be tried as well,” she told BBC Radio 5 Live’s Sportsweek programme when asked whether double-headers could be on the agenda. “But even in the standalone games in the men’s stadiums we have already seen when we have done that before a big uplift and a big crossover of fans, so we will see more of that this season.“We have already announced the fixtures for the first game and you will see coming out of that there will be a series of games in men’s stadiums as part of trying to build an audience.“We know that there is a massive potential audience of fans coming across from the men’s game and the men’s clubs across to their women’s team, we are seeing very much a one-club ethos.“There is a massive chance for the game to pull those across this season with the Women’s Super League and get more people coming to games.”The full WSL fixture list is announced on Wednesday but the opening round of matches was confirmed last week. Manchester City host newly promoted Manchester United, with the Etihad Stadium potentially the venue for that .She added: “You will see over the next week a series of announcements around fixtures, around games in men’s stadiums.“We have really focused on putting top women’s games when there is no men’s football.

Even if we had been allowed to spend our pocket money on something as transient as an arcade game, there was no barging in here. All we could do was watch as the older boys jeered and cheered each other on, making it a little further each week as their skills improved and muscle memory set in.Diversion became ritual and, soon enough, a crowd stopped by to watch their weekly quest. I remember wishing that today – perhaps today! – would be the day they conquered the dragon and made it to the final credits. I remember the elation in the room when it finally happened, the backslaps and lingering grins. Within a pastime outsiders considered to be almost debauchedly flippant, we had witnessed something quietly meaningful, perhaps something like our parents felt the first time they saw Dylan play live, or similar to that our own children would experience years later when they first saw the music video to Single Ladies.198X is a game that seeks to encapsulate and accentuate the experience of those who found their people not in the football stands, or on the dancefloor, but in the smoke and truant dinginess of the amusement arcade. It’s a coming-of-age story about Kid, an androgynous teenager who lives in the town of Suburbia, “stuck between the limitations of innocent youth and the obligations of inevitable adulthood”. Everything changes, Kid says, when they discover the local arcade and find “worlds and new meaning in video games”.The game has a unique structure. It is, essentially, a collection of five arcade games that never were, across a range of genres. There’s a Final Fight-style brawler, a racing game in the mode of Out Run, a R-Type-esque shoot ’em up, and so on. Each game is an exquisite period piece and provides the anchor points around which Kid’s story is told, via sumptuous pixel-art scenes – all pink neon signs reflected in shimmering puddles, Reebok hi-tops and canary-yellow BMXs – and Kid’s melancholy voiceover. To progress the story you must first complete the arcade game, a savvy design trick that strengthens the psychological link between player and protagonist, as you share each other’s victories.During the past few years, there have been numerous books that explore growing up through the lens of video games, from Michael Clune’s Gamelife to Cara Ellison’s Embed With Games. The urge to understand the role video games play in forming our sense of self, even in the way that we parse the world, is strong. When any media has such a major effect, there’s usually an urge to discover why. 198X fits squarely within this tradition. It is a game about a fictional teenager who is an obvious surrogate for the experiences of the game’s Stockholm-based creators. It’s a game that seeks to contextualise its celebration of a bygone era from the vantage point of adulthood: what did that mean? Why do I still care?198X also offers a window into a vanished scene. London’s Trocadero, for years one of the only places where you could play arcade games old and new, evicted its cabinets years ago to make way for apartments. Brooklyn’s Barcade may have reignited interest in the medium with the lure of craft beers, but you’ll have to reach Tokyo if you want to experience the kinds of arcade to which 198X truly pays tribute – Akihabara’s Try Amusement Tower, or Takadanobaba’s Mikado, probably the greatest living arcade left in the world. For everyone else, the game offers a more affordable way to visit a past that, for those of us who were there, has lost none of its captivating allure and psychic mystery.Cadence of Hyrule(Nintendo Switch)It’s an unlikely premise: a Zelda game in which you can only move and attack by tapping the buttons in time with the music. Green-tabard-wearing protagonist Link bobs through Hyrule, squaring up to monsters whose dance moves have been weaponised. Miss a beat and your weapon will flail, uselessly. All of Zelda’s familiar sights and tools are here, but the effect in the hands is singular and thrilling. A puzzle game like no other.Collection of Mana(Square-Enix Switch)Secret of Mana is one of the most fondly remembered RPGs of the Super Nintendo era, a more accessible and immediate proposition to Final Fantasy’s often spiky mysticism. This reissue includes not only the formative adventure game, but also its Game Boy predecessor and, for the first time outside of Japan, sequel, Trials of Mana. It’s a lavish collection, with a price tag to match, but the opportunity to finally experience the third game in the series is worth the entry."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8d47cb661c64b8b6b0d785c7a86bea7e1be2e12/0_1334_3349_2009/master/3349.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7724901843133131b972d7cae1fea9e1","title":"are you really the real you and how can we best become our true selves","story":"What makes some people change their lives entirely, and how can we best become our true selves?Alex was a bouncer when he changed his mind about who he was. Or maybe he wasn’t a bouncer. Maybe he was only pretending.In the year 2000, “reality TV” still sounded to most people like an oxymoron, a bizarre new genre that was half entertainment and half psychological warfare, where neither audience nor participants were quite sure which of them were the combatants.The show Alex appeared on, Faking It, had a simple set-up: each week a participant with an archetypical identity would be tasked with learning a skill that jarred with that identity. The participant had four weeks to perfect that skill before being sent to a real event where they would have to pass undetected by experts asked to spot the imposter. Elbow-patched Alex arrived on the programme as the toffee-nosed eldest son of an upper-class British family. He was 20 years old and as Oxbridge as it’s possible to imagine. If you took Bertrand Russell, bound him in leather and made him smoke a cigar made entirely of armchairs you’d still be several punt rides short. We meet him for the first time at his family’s country home, where he shows us around the grounds and introduces us to Roger, who is a horse.Alex’s task on Faking It was to pass as a bouncer at one of London’s busiest nightclubs in the middle of Euro 2000. He is 5ft 6in and slight, with a body that kept a respectful distance from any image of athleticism. His clipped private-school consonants and eager-to-please eyes are obvious artefacts of a life spent very far from rowdy pubs. Alex is not deterred he packs his clothes, says goodbye to his boyfriend Clinton, bids adieu to Roger, and sets out to fake it.To help him act the part, he is provided with three advisers – kickboxing champion Tony, former police officer and security expert Charlie and voice coach William – and sent to live for a month with Tony on the 15th floor of a council block. Alex has never been to London before and as his taxi drives towards Tony’s flat, he stares out the window with his eyes and mouth open. “My God, look at this place. Laundrette – oh my God, there’s a – I don’t think I’ve ever seen a laundrette… There’s a mattress! There is a mattress, on the pavement… I’m going to get beaten, the absolute shit out of me, in this tie. And this jacket. Oh. My. God.”How do you change your mind about who you really are? Presumably you start with a view about what your “true” self is and then go on to repudiate that view. But even that first step turns out to be remarkably difficult, because you have to work out what a “true” self could be. When Alex arrived on Faking It he thought he knew what his sense of “me-ness” looked like. It was marching him towards a future life in a big country house, going to horse trials, hunting and shooting. But as you’ve probably guessed, that isn’t how it worked out. Something about Faking It changed Alex’s mind about what his “true” self was really like.How is that possible? What rational cogs are turning for people when they change their minds about who they are? Are beliefs about ourselves even the kind of thing we can be rational about, when we’re the ones who make those beliefs true? I had to ask Alex directly.I found him in Australia, where he now lives. It’s been nearly 20 years since the programme first broadcast. His vowels have been hammered flat by years in Australia and he is not as affably eager to please. In some way I think I’d expected to know him, having seen him on TV, but when he says he’s changed he isn’t lying.“Did going on the show really change your understanding of who you were?” I ask.“Yes. Completely,” says Alex. ‘“After the show – or, after that experience, I don’t really look at it as a show any more – four or five weeks after I got back home to Oxford I left the UK and came to Australia. I literally dropped everything. I arrived in Australia with a backpack and not much else.”Before that moment, Alex’s life had followed a predictable pattern. “And then the show was this sort of great chasm that broke that in my mind, and I went, ‘Hang on! I don’t have to do all those things any more. I don’t have to be someone’s son, or brother, or grandson, I can actually be… me.’ I wasn’t going on any mission of self-finding, because I didn’t realise I was lost.”What is going on in this kind of mind-change? Is our sense of who we are a belief just like any other? More pressingly, how do we do it? Is it the kind of thing we can be persuaded into? What does it mean to have a belief about your true self? What even is a true self? It’s no good trying to change your own mind – or, worse, someone else’s – about something you can’t even begin to describe.One possibility involves understanding the “self” as the centre of an autobiographical story – a kind of internal narrator. But how would we debunk the autobiography we have been mentally narrating and replace it with a more accurate one? Here we hit the first problem: unlike any other story, our internal narration about what kind of person we are can become our reason for acting in a particular way. Then we act in that particular way and create more supporting evidence for the story about being that particular way. The story forms a self-justifying loop turning ever around on itself like an evidentiary Möbius strip. Alex, from where he sits now, is especially well-positioned to see how internal narrators can tamper with the evidence. “I was doing what I should have done and I loved what I should have done, because I should have done it, and then I did it, so I thought I should do it some more.”Occasionally Faking It had a contestant who spent the whole month in foot-shuffling self-consciousness. One episode tasked a prim lawyer with becoming a garage MC and he never got over how unlike him it was to rap.Alex wasn’t like that. Things got very real when he went for his first kickboxing lesson. All Tony’s male fighters were so much bigger than Alex that Tony’s girlfriend, Berenice, climbs in the ring with him. When she literally shoved him off the mat he made no effort to hide the fact that he is curled up and wheezing. He was not trying to be anything other than what he was: a young man who’d been hit in the face and who needed to get a lot better, quickly.So he had his head shaved. He started walking with more bounce in his knees. He stayed in character around the clock and filmed his video diaries in an east London accent.“Why did you commit so much?” I ask him, trying to find something that might explain his change of mind. Maybe he was secretly trying to shed his old identity all along.“No, I had never had any of those existential thoughts whatsoever. It just sort of happened.” One big help was that somewhere along the way, Tony, Charlie and William changed their minds about Alex. Something about his commitment seemed to win them over, and they accepted him on to that plane of UK male friendship of laugh- shoving each other in the shoulder. One night they took Alex to a strip club. He did his best not to shrink from the debauchery, but afterwards he looked like a concussed cartoon character, birds circling around his head.“What about your first exposure to the exposure… of naked ladies, exposing themselves?” asked Tony.“It was interesting,” Alex replied. “Because, um, I’m gay.” Alex is the only person who seems to view this as any sort of big deal.“You had your prejudice about us,” Charlie nodded.“Yeah. To be quite honest, I did,” Alex said.It’s a moment of genuine tenderness in a show about faking, but what nobody remarked on was that Alex’s East End accent hadn’t slipped the whole time.If changing your mind about who you really are means getting your internal narrator to tell a story that matches the facts better, presumably we need to find the evidence that will let us access that new story. The problem here is that the only tool we have for doing this investigation is the very thing that stands to be imperilled by the results of that investigation: the so-called “narrator” at the centre of our lives.Who does the displacing? Is our “true” self somehow able to narrate itself into existing? On top of this existential magic, we’d need a way to work out which of the available evidence really matters, and which way it plays. We need to distinguish between the actions and thoughts and habits that reveal something deeply true about ourselves, and those that we can dismiss as the old internal narrative. Sometimes the old story is just the exact opposite of the new story. But as a general principle there’s no guarantee that things will work like this. Evidence against something is not evidence for something else, and falsifying one story doesn’t always make another truthful.There is a very real possibility that the moments that force us to erase our internal narratives will do just that – erase the narrative – and then call it a day. And if having an internal narrative is so important to having a “self”, what’s left when the narrative crumbles? What are we in the space between stories?The night of Alex’s final test arrived. He was to man the door at the Hippodrome, a vast nightclub in London that holds 2,000 people inside a space that was once used for circuses. Crowds of drunken football fans were riotous and slurring, struggling to keep both eyelids raised while insisting they needed to be let in. Alex’s mentors watched him on a feed in the manager’s office. They were laughing but plainly nervous. Four experienced doormen were Alex’s “competitors”. Each of them, including Alex, took a turn manning the door, and then the Hippodrome’s real-life security team was told that one was an imposter.None of them caught him. His mentors roared with joy. “It’s like seeing your kid walk and talk for the first time, innit!” said Tony, genuinely chuffed. It was such a resounding triumph for such an unlikely underdog. Then Alex packed his things and told the camera it had all been marvellous. But as Alex sat on the train back to his country house, it was no longer clear that he had been playing. His whole manner was different from that of the person he had been when he last saw his family. In the post-game wrap-up on the show, drama coach William said something prescient: “I think he stopped acting about a week ago.”Almost as soon as Alex got home, he realised his old life wasn’t going to stick. He boarded a plane to Alice Springs, where the sand is an electric orange and the running water often doesn’t. “I went to work almost straightaway at the Aids Council of Central Australia. I helped run a needle exchange programme. That was purely on the strength of what I’d learned in the show, because I could handle myself. I was so much more confident of myself and my abilities in that world.”A couple of nights a week, he worked as a doorman in a pub. He moved free of backstory. He wasn’t anyone’s son, or anyone’s friend from a fancy school, or anyone’s anything. “I was more able to be me. I was just able to be… more… I was going to say ‘more normal’, but it’s not more normal, it’s just more.” He’s stayed in Australia for the past two decades, letting life go about what he calls its “organic progression”.This is what’s so striking about Alex’s mind-change. The moment he decided he had been wrong about who he was – the moment he let go of his old life in England – doesn’t seem to have been characterised by seeing the evidence of a new internal story so much as simply not telling the old one. He did not deliberate himself into a new sense of self by starting at first principles or being persuaded that in fact the “real” Alex had a certain set of traits. He just stopped believing, and waited to see what would happen. He stayed with Clinton. He moved to Sydney, then Melbourne. He got a suit-and-tie job. For a while he didn’t speak much to his family, but now visits them.“Once a year I go back and just become what I was.” It is his life, not anyone else’s. In the end, I think Alex’s experience shows us just how strange it is to think of changing our minds about ourselves as a rational process.I now think my question about whether we can be persuaded into the “right” belief about our “true selves” rests on the false idea that there is some truth waiting to be discovered. And that we can get at it with enough evidence, as though the Alex of today was waiting, dormant, inside the Alex of 2000, and that the right sort of evidence could have revealed him. Of course it wasn’t.The traits and preferences and perspectives Alex now takes to define himself didn’t exist to be discovered when he was wondering who he really was they were made in and by the decision to walk away. Perhaps the challenge in changing our minds about who we really are is not to rationally persuade ourselves into a new story about who we are, but to learn to live for periods of our life without one.This sounds like a deeply frightening prospect, if you think that selves just are – or depend upon – a coherent narrative. But life without pre-written story can also be enormously fun. That’s part of what was so great about the episodes of Faking It that ended as successfully as Alex’s: you got to watch the childish wonder of people realising they were capable of the things they had declared they could never do. It was hard not to well up when people broke through their rigid views of themselves to find joy and promise in the possibility of life without a script.When I spoke to Alex last, he and Clinton were coming up to their 19th anniversary, which means that this is the year where they have spent more than half their lives together.

I want to be a voice,” says the 32-year-old campaigner.In the first 10 minutes it shows Aja Naomi King, who plays Ahmed as a 15-year-old girl, being violently gang-raped by Somali militants. After that, she makes the dangerous journey from Somalia to Ireland to seek asylum, too scared to question anything her male smugglers want her to do. Upon her arrival, a male gynaecologist examines her and tries to find out what has happened to her, but she has no words to explain it to the male translator, just tears. But then, about halfway through, with the help of other women, she starts to find her voice. By the end of the film, she is shouting about FGM in front of Barack Obama, making speeches at the United Nations and being praised by the president of Somalia.For Ahmed, who has devoted her life to campaigning against FGM and was instrumental in bringing about the 2012 legislation banning the practice in Ireland, the movie was an opportunity to challenge how survivors of FGM are perceived. “I don’t want people to see me as a victim. I want people to see me empowering other women. I want to show people that whatever Somali women have been through, we can be strong and overcome it.”She hopes that others who have suffered FGM will watch the film and feel less alone. “It’s hard for women to speak out about FGM. So when two young Somali women came up to me after watching the movie in Edinburgh and hugged me, and said: ‘Ifra, you are speaking for all of us,’ I felt so happy. I felt so proud.”It took courage for her to open up to the film’s director and scriptwriter, Mary McGuckian. “It’s not easy, sharing your story with the world. But if it helps women to realise that this cutting is something we should talk about it.”What happened when her grandmother held her down to be cut by her uncle in a small hut is told only in hints: a dirty razor covered in blood, the screams of a young child in intense pain. “It may be my story, but it is a story of many young women. Those are the people I am fighting for.”She is now an Irish citizen but spoke to the Observer this weekend from Somalia, where she runs her own foundation lobbying the government to make FGM illegal. Last year she made a short documentary about a 10-year-old girl who bled to death after having her genitals mutilated. It went viral, and suddenly parents started taking daughters they had cut to hospitals, where Ahmed facilitated their medical care. “In the last year we saved 20 girls from bleeding. And we lost seven.”She is determined to break the silence around FGM in Somalia, and runs community programmes to educate families. “When only women are in the room, they all agree FGM is a problem. But if there is even one man there they won’t speak out.” She hopes that by the end of the year, the Somali government will legislate to make it a criminal offence, so that families who practise FGM will face prosecution.Much depends on the outcome of the government’s consultation with influential religious leaders, which is happening at the moment. “My hope is that before the bill goes to parliament, religious leaders will understand the issue and support the legislation.”She knows how powerful her testimony can be in Somalia at such a time. “I can sit on TV, and talk about it. I can debate with the religious leaders and tell them my personal experiences.” She takes heart from the religious scholars who have seen her do this and then called her up to say: “We are behind you, and we will support you.”But she is aware that not everyone in the country feels that way, and she is risking her life by living there. “There is killing and bombing and a lot of problems here. I could escape to Ireland, but every day what keeps me going is that I’m making a difference.”She is not daunted by the scale of the problem she faces. The history of FGM in Somalia dates back over 400 years, and the film offers a little insight into the reasons women continue to cut their daughters. In a moving scene towards the end, Ahmed finally gets an opportunity to ask her beloved grandmother – who raised her from a baby – why she mutilated so many girls in their family.FGM is also viewed as a way of protecting daughters from terrible practices of their future husbands. “To keep her pure when he went away, she would be sewn up, so he would return to find her as if they were on their first night,” Ahmed’s grandmother tells her.“I want this movie to travel the world,” says Ahmed. “I want to reach the decision-makers, the leaders and the young people, who are the future.” She is full of hope. “My hope is to raise awareness. What happened to me cannot be changed. My past is my past. But what I can do is change the future.“Girls are being traumatised by FGM. Children are dying. I hope people will watch this movie and understand that this has to end.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62beaf9c1a5fd8c256ddb59246b9dda8f839f83b/0_297_5472_3285/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19e227d7c5a22d04b73ad854ad3aea73","title":"were you and your partner married by a loved one in an unofficial ceremony","story":"Who did you choose to conduct your ceremony and why?

Well, semi-official: last month, in Geneva, the World Health Organisation announced it was recognising burnout for the first time – yet the next day, it emerged this wasn’t the case. (Let’s be fair to the WHO staff, though they’re probably just very tired.) In a widely shared essay, the Buzzfeed writer Anne Helen Petersen described her own burnout, and the associated “task paralysis”, leaving her unable to complete basic chores. This kind of burnout isn’t a temporary crisis, she argued for millennials, “It’s our base temperature.” And it won’t be solved by self-help: “You don’t fix it with a vacation, or an adult colouring book, or ‘anxiety baking’ – which helps explain why so many millennials increasingly identify with democratic socialism and are embracing unions: we are beginning to understand what ails us, and it’s not something an oxygen facial or a treadmill desk can fix.”I agree, and thus hesitate to mention a self-help technique here. But while we try to overhaul society, we still have to tackle our to-do lists, and there’s one technique I’ve recently found more useful than any other, as well as better suited to this era of exhaustion and overwhelm: limiting work-in-progress, or WIP. It’s a simple notion, originating in the Japanese system of industrial scheduling known as “kanban”, adapted by Jim Benson and Tonianne DeMaria Barry in their book Personal Kanban. You fix a small upper limit to the number of tasks you’ll be working on at any one time – say, three. Then, you add no further tasks to your plate until you’ve finished at least one. When there are only two tasks remaining in your WIP, you can bring in one more. And so on. The kanban system visualises this using Post-its on a whiteboard, arranged in columns: each task moves from the “to do” column to “doing” to “done”. If your WIP limit is three, there should never be more than three notes in “doing”. (You can add a “waiting” column, where you shunt tasks that are waiting on other people.)The effects are extraordinary. By limiting WIP, you feel your finite capacity, so the counterproductive urge to start 15 tasks naturally subsides. Without trying, you find yourself breaking projects down into doable chunks (because if “write book” or “get new job” is one of your tasks, it’ll jam things up for months). Above all, this way of working brings a deeply satisfying sense of having a foothold on things. Benson and Barry write: “Linearly finishing one task before embarking on the next commitment becomes addictive, a pattern, and eventually a habit.”The obvious objection is that you have too many demands on your time to limit WIP to three. But that’s a misunderstanding. You already can’t do more than a handful of things at once. If the world demands you do a hundred, that’s an impossible request. Your only options are to choose, consciously, which ones will have to wait – or choose unconsciously. And to be clear, none of this is a magic solution to burnout. Instead, it’s a repudiation of magic solutions, a liberatingly down-to-earth engagement with how things actually are.Jim Benson outlines the basics of dealing with overload – you’ll need a lot of sticky notes, and a spare wall – in a video series at personalkanban."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e372b443c67047f8bfab73f549c880e83b3a545f/0_0_1748_1049/master/1748.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bbaa07fb5594b3a71d60e2bc4f762642","title":"no coventry is not basically birmingham the unwritten rules of the west midlands","story":"One local explains how to navigate Elephant City with some insider tips and tricksCoventry. A city that is unfortunately so near to Birmingham that it is often forgotten about, but also fortunately just far enough away that we don’t speak with that accent. In fact, “we speak with an accent that’s exceedingly rare!” At least that’s what the Coventry City fans sing every week, whether it’s at the Ricoh Arena or at away games up and down the country – or that season we played our home games in Northampton, but we don’t talk about that.Luckily, due to our location on one of the country’s most central rail lines, it’s incredibly easy for us to get to just about anywhere in the UK, whether it be for football, shopping, boozing, sightseeing, or … what else is there?And if you’re coming to us by rail (TIP: London Northwestern Railway has FREE wifi in every carriage), there are some unspoken things you should know about us lot, located smack bang in the middle of England.No, Coventry is not basically BirminghamThis assertion is lazy geography. We are 20 miles away from Birmingham. Sunderland is barely 15 miles away from Newcastle upon Tyne but you wouldn’t say “Newcastle is basically in Sunderland”, unless you wanted to get banished from the north-east forever. Solihull is a town that is “basically” Birmingham. We are our own city, with enough cathedrals to spare (more on that in a minute).Coventry – and its spirit – is indestructibleDue to our extremely central location – Meriden, the traditional centre of England is just 8 miles away – we’ve often found ourselves in the middle of some heated situations. The most notable of which was the Coventry blitz, which took place on the night of the 14 November 1940. It was the single most concentrated attack on a British city during the second world war. It lasted for 11 hours as the Luftwaffe essentially attempted to knock Coventry off the map, being one of the UK’s major centres for war production. The old cathedral was mostly destroyed during that raid, but its remains now serve as a phenomenal event space.We also have a rich history of cathedralsWhile the old cathedral was destroyed, as mentioned, we had an old, old cathedral that Henry VIII ordered to be destroyed during the dissolution of the monasteries in the early 16th century. What remains of it is still standing and open to the public in the Priory undercrofts, which was dug up by Tony Robinson for a Time Team special in 1999 on Channel 4. Side note: There is a Nando’s right next to the Priory gardens, so you can make a decent afternoon of history and chicken.Enjoy flying abroad? You have us to thank for thatIf we are honest, we aren’t the greatest at making a big deal about the things we’ve done in the past. For a city that was essentially the beating heart of the country’s motor industry, we should at least talk about it as much as Brummies like to talk about how they are the second city.But more impressive than that is Coventry’s very own Sir Frank Whittle. No, it’s not just the name of a school in Walsgrave – Sir Frank Whittle was the genius behind the modern jet engine, which effectively changed the world.When Sir Frank first brought forward his plans to the UK’s Air Ministry in 1929, his blueprints were called “impractical”. Just eight years later, in 1937, his Whittle Unit engine roared into life, and by 1941 jet-powered planes were heading to war.

Putting that extra money into an ISA or an investment portfolio, however, could make a real differencePutting money aside – whether it’s for short-term goals or major life changes – can be difficult. There’s the unappealing prospect of forgoing stuff, toning down your social life, or taking on a side hustle. But with a bit of careful planning, and a clear goal to motivate you, you can pull it off. We spoke to three people who did exactly that.To overcome the daunting prospect of putting away thousands of pounds, she broke her goal down into setting aside a few hundred pounds from her salary per month. When Sarah eventually started The Gluten Free Blogger alongside her day job, she set a new goal: to put away all the money she raised from the website. “It made it easier knowing I didn’t have to sacrifice everything and could still live my life, by funding my savings goal through a side hustle I was passionate about,” she says. Sarah’s savings plan was fairly traditional – using an ISA to build savings and putting away a little each month. Eventually, she shifted to a savings account that gave her better interest rates.Sarah recommends that anyone trying to save for a mortgage should set a monthly goal and stick to it. “I enjoyed being able to save and spend at the same time, but in hindsight it would have been nicer to commit a set amount each month and perhaps reach my goal a little quicker,” she says. Day-to-day she made small sacrifices, such as eating out less and forgoing takeaway coffees. She also decided to put off some overseas holidays until after she had raised her deposit. “As the end came nearer, it felt easier to somehow find the money.” Her next goal? Finding her dream home.She set up an investment portfolio and chose a lower-risk option. “I have always tended to take guidance and invested my money, I got an insurance policy paid out and it was all invested, for example.” Kay says that it was simple enough to amass the capital she needed to invest, by living a little more modestly. “It’s not the fact that I don’t like spending, but I’m just an ordinary, day-to-day person – I don’t yearn for fancy things,” she says. I’m very content. If I can live like I’m living now from today until tomorrow, I’ll be more than happy.”How to save to travel the world as a volunteerDorothy Selleck, 86, has spent 40 years travelling the world, volunteering in schools via the World Organisation for Early Childhood Education (OMEP). While she was still at university, Dorothy, who speaks Welsh as a first language in addition to multiple other languages, was approached by a friend who convinced her to use her skills in charity work. For weeks at a time, Dorothy would take time out from her job as a school’s inspector and visit places around the world, including Japan, India and South America. “We were still at our jobs – you couldn’t leave them for very long, but you could leave them for long enough,” she says.Dorothy paid her own way volunteering. Flights, accommodation, travel expenses and a membership fee to OMEP were funded through a full-time job and living a modest lifestyle. “I didn’t spend a great deal of money on myself,” Dorothy says. As well as setting up four separate savings accounts where she could budget her money for travel and day-to-day living expenses, Dorothy put some of her money into a house and approached HSBC for guidance on setting up an investment portfolio.Dorothy says being afforded the freedom to volunteer has allowed her to see hidden corners of the world and master three languages.

Gilberto, who died on Saturday at age 88, was a famous recluse known both for his magical music-making as well as his stage fright. If you had the chance to watch him perform live, you seized the opportunity because it might never happen again. This is my account of that memorable evening.The man holding the guitar has the nervous look of someone who has just stepped off a subway train and now worries he has picked the wrong stop. The concert promoter is taken aback by his unexpected appearance – she is still in the midst of her introduction (“I would like to thank my boyfriend, I would like to thank the audience for being here …”). She has not yet mentioned the “star of the evening”, João Gilberto. And here he is onstage now, looking very unlike the evening star, this anxious man in a brown suit, who wants to get back on the subway train but is afraid that it has already left the station.As was the case at Carnegie Hall a few nights before, the audience gives a standing ovation merely at a glimpse of the performer. The warm welcome may backfire. Applause seems only to amplify Gilberto’s stage fright. But retreat is impossible, the train has certainly left the station by now. He moves to the small padded bench at centre stage, sits down and stares at his feet.Getting on stage may be the most difficult part of a concert for João Gilberto, legendary inventor of the bossa nova style. Twenty-one years have passed since his last performance in San Francisco. But veterans of the nightclub scene still recall his engagement with Stan Getz at the now-defunct Keystone Korner – where club owner Todd Barkan virtually needed to shove Gilberto out on stage. His reclusion is well known, and few expected him ever to perform again in the United States.Many stories are told of Gilberto’s shyness. Some may well be apocryphal: for instance, the account of Elba Ramahlo, a well-know singer in her own right, reportedly moving into the same apartment building as Gilberto, in an attempt to befriend him. When João phoned her one day to borrow a deck of playing cards, she quickly complied, seeing this as her chance to break through the barriers that kept him out of contact with other human beings. To no avail. When she arrived at the door of his apartment, he refused to let her in, asking her to slip the cards, one at a time, under the door.The same week that Gilberto is scheduled to perform in San Francisco, a number of famous Brazilian singers, including Gilberto Gil and Chico Buarque, are participating in a Brazilian music festival in France. Their visit coincides with the World Cup match taking place there, and is likely motivated by the performers’ desire to root for the Brazil team in person. Yet João has somehow been convinced to come to the US for concerts in New York, Miami and San Francisco while his compatriots are congregating in France. The apparent reason is to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the first bossa nova recordings – which Gilberto made for Brazil’s Odeon label in June 1958.Knowledgeable fans realise how rare a treat this is. At Carnegie Hall, one could spot Tony Bennett, Jon Hendricks, João Bosco, Tommy Mottola, Cornell Dupree and Sonia Braga, among other luminaries. The day before the California concert, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that Gilberto’s appearance was “the hottest ticket in town.”Now firmly seated on his bench, Gilberto begins speaking in a whisper. The applause has yet to die down, but suddenly the audience becomes quiet, strains to hear what he is saying. No, he is not whispering, it just seems that way. He is singing, but very softly. I am in the third row, only a few feet away, yet it takes me some time before I can hear his guitar, which is even quieter than his voice.The confusion is not surprising. Gilberto’s singing style is as shy as his stage demeanour. Miles Davis once said that João’s delivery was so hypnotic that he “would sound good reading a newspaper.” The analogy is apt in many ways. Gilberto is almost as quiet as a man reading the newspaper, almost as introspective, as unaware of what’s happening around him. When Tom Jobim first brought Gilberto to the attention of record company executives four decades ago, they listened in shocked silence to this singer who hardly moved his lips. Finally one remarked: “Tom said he’d bring us a singer, but ended up bringing a ventriloquist.”The release of their first record, Chega de Saudade, would eventually be lauded as the most influential event in modern Brazilian music. But resistance was firm at first. When the sales staff played it for an influential client, he tore it off the turntable and smashed the record against the table. “Why do they record singers who have a cold?” he asked sarcastically.Within a few months, Gilberto had taken Brazil by storm. Five years later, the bossa craze reached America, where Gilberto teamed with Stan Getz for a recording which spawned the hit single Girl from Ipanema, and spent almost two years on the Billboard album charts.Gilberto was a revolutionary, but one who retained strong links to the previous generation of Brazilian musicians. On his US tour he performs the many Jobim compositions that he made famous, but also plays pieces by Ary Barroso and Dorival Caymmi, whose songs were recorded by Camen Miranda before the second world war. And he is equally at home with the later generation of Brazilian “Tropicalist” songwriters, such as Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil. Many in the audience were no doubt surprised when Gilberto sang S’Wonderful in English, but George Gershwin and Cole Porter are equally part of his tradition.Gilberto is anything but derivative in his use of these influences. They become part of his musical vision he never adapts to them. His relationship to the audience is similar. They must come to him, to the artistic space he occupies – it is not in his nature to reach out to them. And this is perhaps the most beautiful aspect of the concert: how the listeners brought themselves to the shy man on stage, adapting to his soft dynamics, his under-stated sensibility, his artistic vision. In a day and age when performers resort to the basest tricks and grandest gestures to reach the audience, Gilberto’s role reversal is endearing.His singing has become even more eccentric with the passing years. His voice on the 1958 recordings may have struck listeners by its soft-spoken ambiance, but today it is even more conversational, even less declamatory. His phrasing of lyrics has always been unusual, but is even more so now. João is skilled at singing behind the beat, like many jazz singers, but his ability to phrase ahead of the beat is even more remarkable. Few singers attempt to push the beat in this manner, because doing so tends to impart a rushed and anxious quality to the music. It remains a mystery to me how Gilberto can propel the lyrics one bar or more ahead of the music, yet continue to sound so extraordinarily relaxed. One is reminded of the jets flying high in the sky, which we are told travel at fantastic speeds, yet from our vantage point appear to be moving at a slow, leisurely pace.Everything about the sound of Gilberto’s music conveys relaxation. Everything about his appearance on stage suggests tension. He never looks at the audience while playing, and in between songs he stares at his feet, apparently checking the list of songs on the floor, and nervously adjusts his glasses. He pushes them up the bridge of his nose, touches the temples, steadies them, moves them again – up to a dozen times. And then, not waiting for the applause to stop completely, he begins playing the next song.Tonight he introduces none of his songs, offers no thanks, acknowledges no applause. Even when his microphone begins to malfunction, he merely ignores it and plays on. He makes only one remark during the entire evening. Midway through the concert, the audience is growing restless at the recurring static and noise coming from the sound system. The sound engineer can be seen at the side of the stage, but seems reluctant to interrupt the proceedings. Finally, a young man climbs on stage in-between songs to fix the microphone. An audience member shouts out a rude comment about the poor quality of the amplification. As the young man fixes the microphone, Gilberto explains proudly in slow, steady English: “This is … my … son.” The audience claps, even Gilberto claps for a moment in response, and for a split second a hint of a smile plays on his face. Then he again retreats into himself, and begins to sing Wave.Gilberto is at his best when playing, as on this occasion, with only his guitar as accompaniment. I prefer his solo recordings even to the famous collaborations with Getz. Indeed, I have had the opportunity to play songs such as Desafinado and Garota de Ipanema with Getz – memorable experiences in my performing career as a jazz pianist – yet I was perhaps even more moved to hear Gilberto play these same numbers in concert. One marvels at his ability to cut to the core of pieces that have lost their freshness over time, played to death by cocktail lounge hacks and anaesthetised by wedding reception singers.Gilberto’s guitar playing is every bit as quirky as his singing. It relies on a few repeated rhythms – employing bass tones played by the thumb conversing with a constantly changing palette of rich harmonies strummed by the other fingers. Early in his career, this distinctive approach became known as “violao gago”, which translates as “stammering guitar.” It sounds deceptively simple. Yet though many emulated it in the years following Gilberto’s rise to fame, few succeeded in capturing its essence. One listens in vain to some of the most technically accomplished Brazilian guitarists – Laurindo Almeida, Baden Powell, Oscar Castro-Neves – and never hears a bossa nova rhythm with a swing as relaxed and carefree as Gilberto’s.Although one notes superficial changes when comparing Gilberto’s playing tonight with his first recordings, the similarities are even more striking. Gilberto has clearly rejected the notion – which one associates with Picasso, but is at the heart of so much twentieth century art – that a creative inidual must go through different “periods”.In fact, I have become so accustomed to my musical icons – Miles Davis, the Beatles, Lou Harrison, Brian Wilson, Glenn Gould – pursuing step-changes in their work, that I have come to appreciate all the more artists such as Gilberto, who stay true to the core values of their artistic vision throughout their entire careers. I was tempted to say that Gilberto’s style has not changed. But the word “style” does an injustice in this context. With its implicit reference to the world of fads and fashions, a “style” has become something superficial, something that we can discard when a new “style” comes out next season. Gilberto’s music defies this attitude. It is one of essences, not superficialities. As such, it is beyond concerns of style. His music has not changed, one feels, because his being has not changed. I am convinced that this is connected to his ambivalence about his audience. On stage he appears to be performing for himself. And anyone whose music-making is for personal enjoyment can obviously have little concern with whatever happens to be stylish at any given moment in time.A little over an hour into the performance, Gilberto closes with Desafinado, then hurries into the wings. He soon returns for an encore set of a half-dozen songs, including Garota de Ipanema and Mas Que Nada. Again he leaves the stage, without thanks or comment. A woman holding a bouquet of flowers for him has to sprint across the platform to reach Gilberto before he disappears into the wings. He stops, seems surprised, takes the flowers from her hand, and then gives her a warm embrace – strikingly at odds with his noli me tangere demeanour during the concert. Then he is gone. The audience claps and shouts for an encore. Yet even before the house lights come on, I know that we will not be seeing any more of João Gilberto in San Francisco – not this evening, not any evening, according to my odds. And I am reasonably sure that the louder the audience claps, the more they frighten our evening star, the faster he retreats back into his private constellation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c94d20f7218cd89c1e62fa1843594ef9376f183/0_180_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4dbb7fc6b346bbfc4f21abdcfd12eb45","title":"the who review london wembley stadium","story":"Wembley Stadium, LondonPete Townshend and Roger Daltrey deploy full orchestra to electrifying effectThe challenge faced by all legacy artists – of recreating their youthful vigour – is particularly acute for the Who, who lost their glorious trainwreck of a drummer, Keith Moon, to an overdose in 1978, while bassist John Entwistle followed in 2002.Surviving members Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey have tried numerous methods to fill this seismic void, fielding a full symphony orchestra for this gig – Daltrey’s idea, apparently, after the release of an orchestral reworking of the band’s epochal opera, Tommy.The strings flesh out an opening run through Tommy’s highlights, and, if a certain primal element is missing – the lean attack of Townshend’s windmill-arm guitar often drowned out by blustering brass – the opera’s dizzying psychodramas still impress. If Tommy’s plot has never rewarded close reading, its themes of confusion and psychological abuse remain vivid.A later suite of material from their other rock-opera, Quadrophenia, similarly triumphs via how perfectly Townshend’s songs channel that adolescent fear of betraying your ideals, and how completely Daltrey commits to the ridiculously overblown, near-operatic and sublime Love Reign O’er Me.Elsewhere, the setlist mostly avoids their 60s anthems in favour of two new songs suggesting their forthcoming album is livelier than 2006’s muted Endless Wire, and a handful of hits and obscurities from their 70s heavy-rock era.An acoustic Won’t Get Fooled Again – which Townshend dedicates to modern-day activists, saying he wrote it about his own generation of “hairy hippies, who achieved fuck-all” – strikes an electrifying if uneasy note, its cynicism suiting the deceitful tenor of post-referendum politics but undone somewhat by Daltrey’s own recent gammon-y pronouncements.A closing Baba O’Reilly is an uncomplicated pleasure, however – all passion, power chords and Townshend’s poetic rendering of those lonely, anguished teenage wastelands. It’s a place he knows well, its landscape of hope, agony and betrayal the location for so many of his songs, their profundity undimmed by the passing of the years and the Who’s lamented genius rhythm section.The enduring value of that songbook is something a visibly moved Daltrey recognises, moments before he and Townshend leave the stage. “Our glamour is gone, our youth is gone,” he grins, “but the music still sounds fucking brilliant.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/250bcac66ab1922e6c79cbcfbc93de97317670f7/0_71_4883_2930/master/4883.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cffdf721a288ca7cbc219e8cdf23c287","title":"home office secret plan charities deport rough sleepers","story":"The Home Office has drawn up a secret programme using homelessness charities to acquire sensitive personal data that could result in the deportation of non-UK rough sleepers, the Observer can reveal.A chain of emails from senior Home Office officials from December 2018 to May 2019 also shows that the clandestine programme ignores European privacy laws by passing rough sleepers’ sensitive personal information directly to the Home Office without their consent.The scheme, which is still in a trial phase, is seen by charities and campaigners as the latest manifestation of the Home Office’s much maligned “hostile environment” policy. A previous plan to deport EU rough sleepers was defeated 18 months ago when the high court deemed it unlawful and discriminatory.But the Home Office, apparently undeterred, has rolled out a remarkably similar new scheme which, according to an internal email, will lead to “enforcement in some cases” – deportation – and targets “non-UK” and non-EEA (European Economic Area) rough sleepers, which after Brexit will include EU nationals.Gracie Bradley, policy and campaigns manager for the human rights charity Liberty, said: “It’s disgraceful that the Home Office, local authorities, and charities are attempting to turn trusted homelessness outreach workers into border guards. Homelessness charities must refuse complicity in the hostile environment.”A spokesman for the Public Interest Law Centre, which won the high court case, said: “It’s now clear the Home Office – with the Greater London Authority, local councils and some homelessness charities – is trying to resurrect this discriminatory policy under a different guise.”The correspondence reveals that some refugee charities have already been asked to forward cases to the programme, called the Rough Sleeper Support Service (RSSS), and at least one has agreed. Emails also reveal that homeless charity St Mungo’s has attended meetings with the Home Office to discuss allowing outreach workers to enter a homeless person’s data into RSSS without their consent.Obtained through freedom of information requests from Liberty, the correspondence says the scheme is spearheaded by the lead officer for previous immigration enforcement operations and will be “utilised to resolve the non-EEA national rough sleepers situations”. The emails also chronicle Home Office frustration that the programme is still in the test phase because of a failure to agree a data-sharing deal with charities and local authorities.The emails show significant opposition from charities with “push back” from several including St Mungo’s and migrants advocacy group Praxis, who warn of “reputational risks” for groups linked to the scheme. According to one email, Praxis raised several concerns, including that the scheme risked “poorly made decisions”, was unnecessary and that it was “unclear if RSSS referral would make detaining and removal of rough sleepers at their reporting appointments more likely”.The charity raises fears that the programme will be primarily geared at removing rough sleepers. “There appear to be no immigration decision-makers in the RSSS, just immigration officers. The culture embedded in the RSSS seems to be one of enforcement,” it said in an email sent on 3 May 2016.Even as the scheme was conceived, fears existed that it would be controversial. One email, sent on 18 December 2018, from a GLA officer to the Home Office, cites a “possibility of bad press surrounding the RSSS and there needs to be a clear line on what this team is and how it can help ensure no one dies on the streets”.Although some emails show that sharing information with the Home Office could help prioritise a person’s case and ensure homelessness charities offered the right support, Bradley said referrals will likely result in immigration enforcement action.She said ministers should be concentrating on combating the root causes of homelessness rather than targeting rough sleepers. “Consent and data protection should also be at the heart of our interactions with public institutions,” she added.The Public Law Interest Centre spokesman added: “Despite its name, the new RSSS offers no ‘support’ to homeless migrants living in the UK. It is an ‘hostile environment’ measure in all but name.”A St Mungo’s spokesperson said the charity had met Home Office staff “to find ways to respond more quickly” to non-UK cases. “In particular, we are seeking to ensure people who may use the service do so based on informed consent and legal advice from a registered immigration adviser,” they added.A Home Office spokesman said the RSSS was set up “to help resolve the immigration status of non-UK nationals sleeping rough, either granting lawful status or providing documentation. This enables iniduals to access support or assists them in leaving the UK where appropriate.” He added: “The service prioritises support work on outstanding cases and helps to resolve status issues.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57e848da65dd6dce6b0ad3e3f8339d0a75c6bd39/7_0_2343_1406/master/2343.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb5b0065fbf9c0863ce537125af7793e","title":"everyones going to the moon again apollo 11 50th aniversary","story":"At 2.51am on Monday 15 July, engineers at India’s national spaceport at Sriharikota will blast their Chandrayaan-2 probe into orbit around the Earth. It will be the most ambitious space mission the nation has attempted. For several days, the four-tonne spacecraft will be manoeuvred above our planet before a final injection burn of its engines will send it hurtling towards its destination: the moon.Exactly 50 years after the astronauts of Apollo 11 made their historic voyage to the Sea of Tranquillity, Chandrayaan-2 will repeat that journey – though on a slightly different trajectory. After the robot craft enters lunar orbit, it will gently drop a lander, named Vikram, on to the moon’s surface near its south pole. A robot rover, Pragyan, will then be dispatched and, for the next two weeks, trundle across the local terrain, analysing the chemical composition of soil and rocks.The Indian spaceship will not be alone on the lunar surface, however. China’s Chang’e-4 has been operating flawlessly since it landed on the far side of the moon in January. Its arrival was later followed by the appearance of Beresheet, a probe built by the Israeli non-profit organisation SpaceIL. It reached the moon in April but crash-landed. SpaceIL has since announced that it intends to have another shot.At the same time, the US has pledged to set up lunar laboratories in the near future, while Europe and Russia have also revealed plans to launch complex missions. Suddenly, everyone’s going to the moon.But why? What has suddenly made Earth’s main satellite so popular? After Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin’s historic mission in July 1969, public and political interest in future human space flight evaporated rapidly. Already bogged down in a vastly expensive war in Vietnam, the US government abandoned its Apollo programme.One reason for this shift is that the moon’s exploitation has simply reached a stage that mirrors past explorations on Earth, says David Parker, director of human and robotic exploration for the European Space Agency. He sees particular parallels with our conquest of the south pole.“The timetable of the exploration of Antarctica mirrors that of the moon in an uncannily close manner,” Parker says. “At the beginning of the century, there was a race to reach the south pole and then no one went back for 50 years – just like the moon in the 60s. Then we started building bases in Antarctica. We are now approaching that stage with our exploitation of the moon.”Antarctica was opened up by technological advances – motorised vehicles, air transport, radio, and other developments – that are mirrored in the new sciences of machine learning, sensor technology and robotics. These promise to transform lunar colonisation in one crucially important way: by reducing the need for the continual presence of humans in hostile environments.And the success of China’s Chang’e-4 probe provides an example of what can be achieved without human involvement. It is the first vehicle ever to alight on the moon’s far side, and has continued to operate without problems, despite having to survive prolonged periods when temperatures have plummeted to below minus 180C during lunar nights. (These last for 14 Earth days. Apollo schedules were planned to make sure astronauts landed only during daytime on the moon.)Exploiting these advances in robotics to aid human activity on the moon will form the backbone of the forthcoming US Lunar Gateway project. Nasa plans to use America’s giant Space Launch System rockets and Orion crew-carrying capsules – both in the final stages of development – to build a smaller version of the International Space Station that would orbit the moon. Partners from Europe, Canada, Japan and other countries have been invited to take part in Gateway, which would be constructed over the next decade.Gateway would be used by astronauts to operate robots working on the lunar surface a few dozen kilometres below them. These automated machines would be used to set up radio telescopes, to harvest minerals, to search for ice and water and to study how lunar rocks could be used as building materials for a lunar colony. Ultimately a craft would one day carry humans down to work on the moon in colonies prepared for them by robots.“And that is good news for Europe,” adds Parker. The European Space Agency is collaborating with Nasa over Gateway’s construction – by providing the propulsion units for the Orion spaceships that will ferry astronauts to the Gateway station in lunar orbit. “We should therefore be in a strong position to have a European astronaut taken to the moon,” he says.Parker is equally enthusiastic about the moon’s potential for study. “It has lain virtually undisturbed for the last 4.5 billion years,” he says. “It is a museum of the history of the solar system.” He argues that the potential rewards from such a lunar outpost mirror those already gained from bases set up in Antarctica. “The hole in Earth’s ozone layer was discovered by polar scientists who are also doing crucial work on the impact of climate change and global warming on our planet. That is the kind of return we could get from setting up Gateway.”There are other reasons to return to the moon, however. For many space enthusiasts, its exploration and exploitation is necessary if we are to make the next giant step in space: sending people to Mars. “That is the real goal for humanity,” says Parker. “However, getting humans there safely is going to be an incredibly difficult undertaking. We will have to learn first how to conquer the moon.”In building and running the International Space Station, humans have learned how to master space close to Earth. It orbits about 400 kilometres above the Earth, says Parker. “By contrast, the moon orbits 400,000 kilometres distant from the Earth, a thousand times farther away. Mastering a hostile environment that distant will require us overcoming all sorts of technological hurdles. Then we will be better armed when we start looking at Mars, which is 400 million kilometres away – a million times farther from Earth than the space station. This is going to be a long process.”Rees sounds a note of caution. “There is a tendency to see Mars as the solution to all our problems on Earth. We will just move on to a new planet and save our species. But that is a dangerous delusion. We have to solve Earth’s problems here and now. Coping with climate change may seem daunting but it will be a doddle compared with surviving on Mars.”However, there is another, more poignant reason for returning to the moon and it is one that focuses on the iniduals who visited 50 years ago. Only six Apollo missions made it to the lunar surface, each crewed by two men. Thus only 12 humans have ever walked on the moon. They all were male were born in the 20s and 30s in midwest America were either only children or the eldest in their families – and, with the exception of Apollo 15’s James Irwin, all had been Boy Scouts. On their way to and from the moon, each earned $8 a day, minus a fee for a bed on their Apollo spacecraft.The crucial point is that these are the only humans who have ever had first-hand experience of standing on another world and only four of them are still alive: Apollo 11’s Buzz Aldrin (now aged 89), Apollo 15’s David Scott (87), Apollo 16’s Charles Duke (83) and Apollo 17’s Harrison Schmitt (84).“Given their age I think we could soon find ourselves in a time when there are no humans left with first-hand memory of another world,” added Rees. “Like millions of other people, I will find that sad.”The question facing space scientists is therefore straightforward: is there a chance another human might walk on the surface of the moon before the last Apollo moonwalkers die? Until recently, the answer would have been “probably not”. The timetable for Gateway’s construction was modest and slow, and astronauts would probably not have used it to reach the lunar surface for at least a decade.But that timetable was recently thrown into confusion when the US vice-president, Mike Pence, announced in March that the White House was directing Nasa to accelerate the human component of the Gateway project so that astronauts could fly down to the moon’s surface by 2024. Many doubt that this will be possible. No lander craft to make this descent has yet been designed, for example.Nevertheless there is the prospect that this change of timetable will allow a US astronaut in the near future to step on to the lunar surface so that a surviving Apollo astronaut will witness another human following in their footsteps.The crucial point is that when the Apollo astronauts were flying to the moon, it seemed science fiction had come true, says Rees. “It would be good if we can bring back that sense of wonder, if nothing else.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68274ed9dbeb16b322c3d1b343339c85d391dbac/0_141_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53dbe5abc9c110ae927045a78ab17fd7","title":"england v australia womens ashes third odi live","story":"Breakthrough! Sciver finding a way against the grain again. Back of a length, Lanning tries to turn it to the leg side but mistimes it. Gets a leading edge that pops up to point for a simple catch. Huge wicket the way she was batting.26th over: Australia 151-2 (Lanning 69, Perry 3) Heather Knight will have a bowl. Off-breaks, just like Marsh who she’s replacing. Knight hasn’t bowled yet in the series, but with seamer Katherine Brunt out for keeper-bat Sarah Taylor today, Sciver becomes the fifth bowler and Knight the sixth. It doesn’t work out so well, as Lanning squeezes a couple to third man, then trades singles, before Perry drives behind square and beats Wyatt on the rope for four. Another over worth 10 runs. England have been very poor in the outfield today. Half a dozen boundaries conceded that should have been singles. They’re not playing like a team that knows how to e. They get close to the ball and then sort of fall over in its general direction and hope that works. 25th over: Australia 140-1 (Lanning 60, Perry 2) Things will settle down a bit with Perry at the crease, I think. Healy’s specialty the last couple of years has been breezing along at a run a ball even when no one else can get close. She attacks judiciously and is good enough to get away with it more often than not, and in doing so she rattles fielding sides and creates more opportunities for herself, whether with bad bowling or opening space in the field. Three singles from the Sciver over.24th over: Australia 138-1 (Lanning 58, Perry 1) Not quite sure about the strategy of bowling an off-spinner without much turn around the wicket against a right-hander. Marsh leaves one outside leg stumps and Lanning sweeps it comfortably for four backward of square. 23rd over: Australia 131-1 (Lanning 52, Perry 0) Ten runs and a wicket from the over. You get rid of Healy, and Perry walks out. Would you like to know how many century stands she has with Meg Lanning? No? I’ll keep it to myself. Somehow, Sciver finds a way to stem the bleeding. She’s clobbered for four behind square by Healy, then bowls five wides down the leg side. But when she dishes up a rank half-tracker for Healy to put anywhere she likes, the shot finds Wyatt in the deep at midwicket, who takes a good catch. England collapse on the floor heaving sighs of relief.22nd over: Australia 121-1 (Healy 64, Lanning 51) Imposing when two players out there rack up fifty at a run a ball each. Lanning taps Marsh into the covers and darts the quick run. Healy returns the favour, then again. Healy mows to deep midwicket on the bounce but this time Jones can get around to field. A hundred partnership.21st over: Australia 117-1 (Healy 62, Lanning 49) Ecclestone is the one they’re being careful against. Just the three singles, and she’s bowled six overs for 27.20th over: Australia 114-1 (Healy 61, Lanning 47) Tee-off time is back. Lanning skips to Marsh again and drives over cover. It wasn’t completely clean, there was that kind of clunky tinny sound off the bat that suggests it was the outside half of the bat, but the field is up. A few singles follow, then Healy gets a short one and absolutely crushes it through square leg along the ground. Flat and bouncing into the boards.19th over: Australia 102-1 (Healy 55, Lanning 41) Ecclestone bowling tight on the stumps to Healy in this over, trying not to give any room. Just a single from the fifth ball. There’s nearly a late Lanning edge for runs again but this time it’s saved.For anyone following the men’s Ashes as well, here’s an update on Jimmy Anderson’s recent injury issue.18th over: Australia 101-1 (Healy 54, Lanning 41) Spin from both ends now, with Laura Marsh’s off-breaks to partner Ecclestone’s left-arm orthos. Thing start well for her with three singles and a couple of dots, but Lanning closes the over by slashing a wide flighted ball off the top edge of her angled bat and fine of short third for four. The ton is up.17th over: Australia 94-1 (Healy 52, Lanning 36) Sophie Ecclestone does the tough job of keeping Healy quiet for an over, as the Australians ease back into things after the break. Two singles. Such a good early run rate that there’s no need to rush.16th over: Australia 92-1 (Healy 51, Lanning 35) Shot for shot now! Lanning is suddenly starting to look herself again. Width from Sciver so Lanning drives it square to perfection, the full Lara flourish of the bat through the line of the ball and then the follow-through. As so often happens Sciver goes a bit shorter and straighter, so Lanning pounds the pull shot behind square and once again beats a despairing e. They’ve been able to find the fence relentlessly this morning. The last four overs have gone for 9, 10, 11 and 9. That’s drinks.15th over: Australia 83-1 (Healy 51, Lanning 26) This is looking ominous, after England asked Australia to bat. Lanning punches Ecclestone through point for four, then skips down to drive a single to deep cover. Jones coming around finally gets one that gives her a better chance of saving it, and does so. But with one ball to come Ecclestone drags down badly, and Healy punishes it with a pull shot that splits the leg-side sweepers square of the wicket. That’s her fifty. 14th over: Australia 73-1 (Healy 46, Lanning 21) “She’s super straight, super straight, yeah, she’s super straight.” Healy drives yet another dead straight boundary, this time from Sciver. Music by Regurgitator, Brisbane’s finest.Not to be outdone, Lanning stands up to drive on the up, into the cover gap, and with enough power to beat the outfielder for four. What a shot. In terms of technical difficulty, that’s the best we’ve seen today. 13th over: Australia 62-1 (Healy 41, Lanning 16) Now it’s Lanning’s turn. She has the left-arm spinner bowling around the wicket with a deep cover point but the rest of the off-side field up. So Lanning skips down to a flighted ball and lofts it over cover for four! Easy done. Next ball is fuller, a smaller shuffle and this time it goes along the carpet the same way for the same result. Jones makes a hash of it again, leaning back and going legs first as she slides, guaranteeing she won’t reach the ball, rather than ing hands first to save it. I suppose wicketkeepers don’t do a lot of boundary riding. Bit unreasonable to ask her to do the gig, then?12th over: Australia 53-1 (Healy 41, Lanning 7) Oh, stop it. Nat Sciver comes on for Cross but she doesn’t get treated any more kindly. First ball she bowls, Healy plays a gorgeous on-drive through midwicket, which gives you a sense of how well it was timed. Beat the sweeper along the ground into the fence. Healy, as she often has in the last couple of years, is batting on a different pitch.11th over: Australia 47-1 (Healy 36, Lanning 6) Sophie Ecclestone on with left-arm spin as the fielding restrictions are relaxed. Lanning dobs to cover and rushes a single. Healy carves another. Two from the over.10th over: Australia 45-1 (Healy 35, Lanning 5) Cross pitches up to Healy and is drive straight for four! Lovely shot, high elbow, right by the stumps and splitting the mid-off and mid-on fielders down to the sightscreen. Cross tries again, a foot shorter, same result, more of a whip-drive from Healy bringing her hands through the ball rather than her elbow, but dead straight again for four! Done yet? Not quite. Anticipating a shorter length in response, Healy goes back on her stumps and whips, lofted, across the line to deep midwicket. Jones is out there, but her one-handed parry at the bouncing ball doesn’t slap it back into play, but over the line for four. Get her back into slip, stat. Healy finishes off with a steer behind point for two more. Big over, she’s 35 from 31 now.9th over: Australia 31-1 (Healy 21, Lanning 5) Another shout from Shrubsole from a ball angling down leg, but the right-handed Lanning gets more lenience from the umpire. A couple of balls later she has another chance at the whip off the pads and this time nails it for four. 8th over: Australia 27-1 (Healy 21, Lanning 1) Healy loves going square on the off side, and she does so again against Cross for four with a drive. Cross gets some serious swing against Lanning and takes her edge, but it reaches slip on the bounce. Amy Jones is standing there, not wicketkeeping today with Taylor back. Lanning plays a classic Lanning shot next, opening the face and striking with a nice clean sound off the bat down through backward point, where she has scored so, so many of her international runs. 7th over: Australia 21-1 (Healy 16, Lanning 0) A wicket maiden for Shrubsole as Lanning arrives and carefully negotiates a couple of swinging deliveries. No big scores for Lanning for a while, and averaging 30 since she came back from her long layoff with a shoulder injury. Has the chance today to bat long. The HawkEye replay, which is not available to the umpires because there is still absurdly almost never DRS in women’s cricket, says that Bolton’s delivery was missing leg stump. Not by much, so I wouldn’t class the call as a shocker, but it looked marginally not out live.First one for England! Bolton doesn’t like that. She’s struck on the pad and is wandering away to square leg casually, then hears the cheer from England and whips her head around to stare at the umpire in disbelief. That was going down leg, wasn’t it? On first glance. Bolton is walking off, but the replay tends to confirm that suspicion. Maybe it could have grazed leg stump? But there was a fair bit of angle from around the wicket, to the left-hander, and I don’t think it was straightening or swinging in.6th over: Australia 21-0 (Healy 16, Bolton 4) Healy is playing more shots than Bolton but not getting many more runs for them. A couple of cuts, one mistimed, one saved by Wilson. A couple of runs skewed through cover, and eventually a single when Healy gets the cut shot angled back through short third rather than square to the field. Bolton takes off for a leg bye to close the over.5th over: Australia 17-0 (Healy 13, Bolton 4) Thanks Mike! What a gent, holding the controls while I made the long trip from Manchester, where I was reporting on Australia-South Africa in the World Cup last night, to Canterbury this morning. Just the five and a half hours with the M1 closed, if you’re wondering. Bliss. Glad to be here at the end of it, as Nicole Bolton drives Shrubsole for four through mid-on, then plays out the rest of the over quite carefully, blocking on off stump as Shrubbers comes around the wicket and tries to angle the ball in. 4th over: Australia 13-0 (Healy 13, Bolton 0) Healy finds the boundary again with a chip over mid-wicket for four runs. A big shout comes at the end of the over as she gets a bit tucked up but the ball’s going down leg again. And with that, I’ll leave you in the capable hands of Geoff Lemon, who has got himself into the hot seat in Canterbury and will be here to guide you through the remainder of the Australia innings. Toodle pip. 3rd over: Australia 9-0 (Healy 9, Bolton 0) Shrubsole is getting some decent movement in the air Nicole Bolton watches the ball well but can’t get it away for any runs. An excellent over, the first maiden of the game.2nd over: Australia 9-0 (Healy 9, Bolton 0) Kate Cross opens from the other end. Healy is tempted by the first delivery, outside off, but doesn’t connect. But she does before too long as she finds the boundary with nothing more than a little flick off the legs that races away. Sciver gets to it, but can’t save the four runs. 1st over: Australia 5-0 (Healy 5, Bolton 0) Shrubsole opens the bowling and it takes just one sighter for Healy before she opens up and flashes a wide one away to the boundary to get Australia up and running. A ball later Shrubsle produces some huge swing to rap Healy on the pads, but it’s going down leg and despite the big shout, there’s nothing doing. Healy races through for a single and that’s the first over done. England players run onto the pitch, and we’re nearly ready to go.“Its a shame,” writes Tim from Bramhall, “that this series is so low profile, not helped by scheduling alongside the CWC. But I can’t help feeling that the location of these matches does not help, staged in mainly Southern or East Midlands small county grounds. Why does the ECB not take these matches to the cities, and why does the North not get a look in?”Geoff Lemon touched on these very issues in the immediate aftermath of the first ODI in Leicester. This will be the first of two meetings between these two great cricketing nations in the space of five days – they will clash again on Thursday in the men’s World Cup, after Australia failed to beat South Africa in their final round-robin game at Old Trafford 24 hours ago and as a result were leapfrogged by India into first place. Tanya Aldred’s match report from Old Trafford is pretty tremendous: South Africa left the World Cup with a defiant raspberry, defeating Australia by 10 runs in another Old Trafford last-over thriller to set up a semi-final between England and Australia on Thursday. Tension had mounted after the result zipped across from Headingley, which meant Australia had to beat South Africa to finish top of the table – fail, and India would tuck into the freshly prepared New Zealand fattened calf, tender and soft, and send the reigning champions instead to Birmingham.Geoff Lemon’s piece on the contest between two old mates is also not too shabby.Confirmation of the lineups. England: Jones, Beaumont, Taylor (wicketkeeper), Sciver, Knight (captain), Wilson, Wyatt, Shrubsole, Cross, Marsh, Ecclestone. Australia: Bolton, Healy (wicketkeeper), Lanning (captain), Perry, Haynes, Mooney, Gardner, Kimmince, Wareham, Jonassen, Schutt.Team news. England are forced into making one change: Katherine Brunt is indeed out with that ankle knock, so Sarah Taylor comes in. Australia are unchanged. Captain Lanning says she “wasn’t too bothered” about losing the toss. “It’s a good batting wicket and it won’t change too much throughout the day.” Ominously she says there’s still room for Australian improvement. “It’s a massive game,” she adds.Meg Lanning calls heads... it’s tails and England captain Heather Knight says the hosts will put Australia into bat. Weather update. Geoff will be able to give you a more accurate view from his position on the ground at Canterbury later on, but a quick internet search tells me it’s currently 17C and cloudy with a light breeze and a small chance of rain between 11am and 1pm local. And this appears to confirm the cloud cover:Still, there have been words of caution after the opening game from Australia bowler and  guest columnist, Megan Schutt: Remember, they made it to the World T20 final last year missing two of their best players. They are scrappers, which is what makes these amazing games. It’s why I love this series more than any other: there’s no hiding. Winning against them is so satisfying because you have to earn it.Injuries. Not helping the host nation’s cause has been the couple of concerns casting a shadow over today’s game Sarah Taylor missed the second ODI after picking up an ankle knock while Katherine Brunt also injured her ankle – while celebrating the key dismissal of Lanning during that game. Both will undergo late fitness tests before play starts today.How close are Australia to wrapping up the series? Another win in Kent today and Meg Lanning’s side will move onto six points, having picked up two for each preceding win. With just eight needed to retain the title, they’re close – a win (four points) or even a draw (two) in the Test at Taunton would be enough, or failing that, just one win from the three T20s (two each) would seal the deal. In short, England badly need to win today if they are going to retain any realistic hopes alive of winning the series.So, from back-to-back 50-over games in Leicester to a final one in this format at the historic St Lawrence Ground in Canterbury, before the travelling roadshow heads to a one-off Test later this month, followed by three final Twenty20s. Competitive interest in the series may well be gone by the time it comes to the last part of this multi-format series though, with Australia already well positioned to retain the Ashes having won the opening two fixtures of this points-based series.

Other witnesses in the bar have described their behaviour as disruptive.The small group, who arrived with placards, included Anne Ruzylo, a political activist and former member of the Bexhill and Battle Labour party, who on Friday night was one of those who complained on Twitter.Ruzylo, who was wearing a T-shirt bearing the slogan “Lesbian: a woman who loves other women”, tweeted that staff at the Green Room had “called the police to have women and lesbians removed because they don’t like the T-shirts we are wearing”.Last night, Lisa Burger, the joint chief executive of the National Theatre, said in a longer statement that the women had provoked “a series of disturbances” which “culminated in abusive behaviour towards our staff”.“While investigations into the incident are ongoing, multiple witnesses corroborate that a group who attended the Green Room restaurant on Friday 5 July were ultimately asked to leave the premises as a result of a series of disturbances,” she said.“These began with their refusal to put placards out of sight that featured messages which upset other customers and contravened our visiting policy, and culminated in abusive behaviour towards our staff. The clothing, gender or sexuality of the group was not a factor in the decision, which was reluctantly taken on the basis of the group’s behaviour and what was said.“The National Theatre must be an inclusive place for everyone, and that means asking visitors to conduct themselves in a way that respects that principle.”Ruzylo has been approached by the Observer for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a01f9dfd703e2db8f0248b35d7843462354d3a9f/0_1117_2917_1749/master/2917.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5972012bc10bcc1aeb048b2d9548e53a","title":"how eye gaze technology brought creativity back into an artists life","story":"Sarah Ezekiel explains how accessible technology helped her paint and recover after a motor neurone disease diagnosis Sarah Ezekiel loves colour. Her living room is filled with bright and joyful prints created by herself and others. “I like so many artists and they have influenced my work. I particularly like Modigliani, Kandinsky and Picasso,” she says.Ezekiel lives with motor neurone disease (MND), and is unable to move from the neck down. Her own art – which can take months to make – is created using eye-gaze technology. An infrared bar picks up her eye movements, and this operates an on-screen mouse and keyboard. “Eye-gaze has allowed me to create again,” she says.She uses this technology not just to make her art, but in many parts of her life – from operating the TV controls to paging her carer, to using social media and writing emails. It has also enabled her to campaign on disability issues and volunteer for the MND Association, and Lifelites (which provides specialist technology for children in hospices), as well as other charities. She has won many awards, including Third Sector volunteer of the year 2016.Ezekiel’s feelings are mirrored by Microsoft, whose mission is to empower every person. This is achieved through integrating accessibility tech, such as the operating system to support eye-gaze technology, seamlessly alongside its Windows 10 and Office 365 suite.Ezekiel, who lives in Hendon, north-west London, was diagnosed with MND in 2000. At the time she was 34, and seven months pregnant with her second child. She was referred to a neurologist during an antenatal appointment the doctor immediately realised that her arm weakness and slurred speech were not due to pregnancy. Ezekiel was diagnosed with MND two months later and within a year was unable to use her hands. “I think I’ve become stronger since my diagnosis, because I’ve been through some very difficult times,” she explains.Although Ezekiel had always loved painting and drawing, and had been on a foundation course after she left school, earning a living had taken precedence over art. She worked as a personal assistant in publishing, with her ambition to become a fine artist overtaken by marriage and children then, later, by MND.In 2010, she began to use eye-gaze technology. Although she had tried different sorts of assistive technology in the years following her diagnosis, this had often proved frustrating and uncomfortable. But using her eyes to operate the computer was a huge improvement, and in 2012 she began using this tech to create art with a software program called Revelation Natural Art.As for her art practice: “I feel like it’s still developing. I’m still learning about the art software I use.” Her colourful paintings can take months to complete, but, she says: “I’ve always been very determined, my mum calls it stubborn!”Ezekiel is also glad to support other artists using this technology. “I know a few eye-gaze artists, but art is a very inidual practice and we all do our own thing. I’m often asked about the software I use and for advice, which I’m always happy to give.”The technology is also becoming more accessible to other users. Microsoft is now on hand to offer guidance and support to potential eye-gaze artists, or anyone who wants to use assistive technology with their products. The company has worked on bringing eye-gaze technology to more users and, as a result, Windows 10 includes built-in tracking support and an experience called Eye Control. This enables people with disabilities to use a compatible eye tracker, like the Tobii 4C version Ezekiel uses, which unlocks the Windows operating system. Users will then be able to operate an on-screen mouse and keyboard using just their eyes. This tech also enables text-to-speech, so when someone has typed a phrase or sentence using their eye tracker, this text can then be “spoken” by the computer.Ezekiel is very keen to improve access to technology for other people who are no longer able to speak or express themselves. And for herself, she stresses that there is always more to find out and more ways to develop as an artist. “Eye-gaze painting is very different to using hands and it’s still a learning curve for me.”Sarah Ezekiel’s art is available via her website sarahezekielWhether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

The facility, which at more than 1.1m acres is larger than the state of Rhode Island, reported no injuries, Reuters said. The station said in a Facebook post normal operations were halted until further notice. It was not clear when they would resume.Experts warned that southern California could expect more significant shakes in the near future.There is about a one in 10 chance that another 7.0 quake could hit within the next week and the chance of a 5.0-magnitude quake “is approaching certainty”, Lucy Jones, a seismologist at the California Institute of Technology and a former science adviser at the US Geological Survey, told reporters.She added that the new quake probably ruptured along about 25 miles of fault line and was part of a continuing sequence.Jones told the  Los Angeles Times the fault that caused the quakes appears to be growing.“This happened at the end of the zone that moved previously,” she said, adding that the fault is now 25 to 30 miles long and “growing”.In the hours after the 7.1 tremor, seismologists recorded more than 600 aftershocks.The quakes were not expected to trigger larger faults including the San Andreas but Jones told the  southern California should expect more quakes.“This is the first magnitude 6 quake in 20 years. It’s the longest interval we’ve ever had,” Jones said. “We know that the last 20 years was abnormal ... we should expect more earthquakes than we’ve been having recently.”She added: “Chances are, we’re going to have more earthquakes in the next five years than we’ve had in the last five years.”In a state where a major earthquake disaster is always a possibility, the quakes put many on edge.The two quakes were the most powerful in the region since 1994, when the 6.7 magnitude Northridge quake hit the heavily populated San Fernando valley, causing 57 deaths and billions in dollars of damages.“Don’t be paralyzed by fear,” Josh Rubenstein, spokesman for the Los Angeles police department (LAPD), wrote on Twitter. “Arm yourself with knowledge and a plan. Talk about what you would do when a big one hits. I myself just did that with my daughter and my wife.”In Ridgecrest most damage from Thursday’s quake came from ruptured gas lines. About 3,000 people were without power. Many said they would sleep outside than risk staying in their homes. The first quake also opened three cracks across a short stretch of state route 178 near the tiny town of Trona.On Saturday Mark Ghilarducci, director of the California office of emergency services, said Ridgecrest and Trona suffered structure fires, gas leaks, power outages, road damage and rockslides but the damage was not as extensive as expected. He said nearly 200 people were in shelters as cleanup work was under way in San Bernardino and Kern counties.The mayor of Ridgecrest, Peggy Breeden, said there were two reports of burglaries following the quake. Some “bad people” came into the community and tried to steal from businesses, Breeden said.In Los Angeles, 150 miles away, the quake was felt in offices in skyscrapers rocked for at least 30 seconds. At Dodger Stadium, the press box lurched.As far away as Las Vegas, players and staff left the court after the earthquake was felt during an NBA summer league game between the New York Knicks and the New Orleans Pelicans. The US Geological Survey said it was felt in Mexico, too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5eaabb2ca53b3bcaaf6be40df03ed13f6072f15e/0_92_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01d6b5ad83cbfe76ee4686be9eca3a31","title":"florida explosion plantation shopping mall","story":"A vacant pizza restaurant exploded on Saturday in a thundering roar at a south Florida shopping plaza, injuring more than 20 people as large chunks of concrete flew through the air.The blast flung debris widely along a busy road in Plantation, west of Fort Lauderdale. The restaurant was destroyed, and nearby businesses and cars were damaged.Though firefighters found ruptured gas lines afterward, authorities said it was too early to determine a cause.“We thought it was thunder at first, and then we felt the building shake and things started falling. I looked outside and it was almost like the world was ending,” said Alex Carver, a worker at a deli across the street from the explosion. “It was nuts, man. It was crazy.”The explosion scattered large pieces of concrete as far as 50 yards and sent pieces of metal as far as 100 yards across the street. Carver said two of his co-workers’ cars were destroyed.At least 21 people were injured though none of the injuries was life-threatening, police sergeant Jesica Ryan said.The explosion demolished the building, leaving behind only part of its metal frame. The restaurant, called Pizzafire, had been out of business for several months. The blast also blew out the windows of a fitness club next door at the shopping plaza in Broward county.Jesse Walaschek had just left the fitness club with his wife and three children, aged four, six and eight. They had parked near the restaurant and had driven about 50 yards away when they heard the blast.“It was a massive explosion like I have never experienced,” he said, saying dust and debris filled the air.“Everything just stopped. You didn’t see anybody. I just wanted to get these guys safe,” he said, pointing to his children. “If this had happened a minute before when we were getting the kids in the car, it would have been really bad.”Dozens of firefighters responded and could be seen picking through the rubble with dogs sniffing through the debris to make sure people weren’t trapped underneath. There were no known fatalities immediately after the explosion.Fire chief Joel Gordon said there were ruptured gas lines when firefighters arrived, but he couldn’t say for certain that it was a gas explosion.“At this point, nobody was killed. Thank goodness for that.

European governments had failed to fulfil their obligations under the pact, he said.Iran revealed its first breach of the deal last week, announcing that it had begun stockpiling low-enriched uranium beyond the 300kg limit allowed, a year after the US president Donald Trump withdrew from the deal and reimposed sanctions.French president Emmanuel Macron told his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani of his “strong concern over the risk of weakening the nuclear agreement” and of the consequences that would follow, his office announced.In a telephone conversation, Macron said he would consult with the Iranian authorities and international partners concerned with a view to resuming talks involving all concerned parties to bring about the “necessary de-escalation” of the situation, the Élysée palace added.Iran has tried to put pressure on the European signatories to the deal to combat US sanctions, which it says are a form of “economic warfare”. Britain, France and Germany have been trying to persuade Iran for months to keep to its commitments to the deal, but Tehran has complained they are not doing enough.Sanctions are having a serious effect on the Iranian economy and Iran’s chief demand is that the country be permitted to export crude oil at the same levels as before the US reimposed sanctions. Exports have fallen to about 300,000 barrels per day, compared with the 2.5 million barrels Iran was selling in April 2018.Ali Akbar Velayati, who is the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s adviser on international affairs, said Iranian officials were unanimous in their decision to raise the level of uranium enrichment.The US has been building up its military presence in the Middle East, sending an aircraft carrier, thousands of troops and B-52 bombers. Last month a Japanese oil tanker was attacked near the strait of Hormuz, and Iran shot down a US military drone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09728cdda857a3ba8315a27ce0cf328816750a20/0_111_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43b2fae4df91879eff343b19abda5f65","title":"london pride 2019 biggest yet say march organisers","story":"Estimated 1.5 million people attended London parade“I’m trying to be a walking piece of political art,” said actor Billy Porter ahead of headlining London Pride. “Just as a human being, as an out black gay Christian man, my very existence is political.”The star of Kinky Boots and TV series Pose performed to thousands in Trafalgar Square on Saturday at what organisers claimed was the biggest, most inclusive Pride yet. About 30,000 people from more than 600 groups took part in the official parade through central London, which was attended by an estimated 1.5 million people.Porter suggested that concerns from Peter Tatchell and others that the event was being “pinkwashed” and hijacked by commercial interests had been overblown. “The commercial aspect of it is a result of how successful it’s been,” he told the BBC. “And when there’s a version of commercial that’s good … we always have to find the balance in these things.”Rainbow flags and banners lined the streets in celebration of what began as a protest march in London in 1972 and which this year marked 50 years since the Stonewall riots in New York that gave birth to the modern Pride movement.The parade was opened by the mayor of London Sadiq Khan, who attacked Boris Johnson for using homophobic language in a 1998 column in which the Tory leadership frontrunner wrote that gay men were “tank-topped bumboys”.“You’ve got the next prime minister using homophobic language,” Khan said. “When you speak to members of the LGBTQ+ community, they will tell you that some of the homophobia they suffered, the attackers used this language, the same sort of language he’s used.”No 10 Downing Street was given a rainbow makeover by London Flower School which erected a floral arch over the door flanked by two signs reading “Love is Love”. MPs including shadow education minister Angela Rayner and defence secretary Penny Mordaunt were among the marchers.In response to demands made by Extinction Rebellion, Pride in London joined the movement in declaring a climate emergency and pledged to make the event carbon neutral by 2020. Activists put up “alternative ads” along the route questioning why the Home Office, the politan police and corporations were able to participate in Pride, while “marginalised groups are left watching on the sidelines because they are unable to afford spaces on the march”.Following controversy last year, which prompted Pride in London to apologise after anti-transgender campaigners forced their way to the front of the parade, organisers were keen to stress that inclusivity and representation were a priority this year. A World Area stage to “celebrate ersity … and increase the visibility of black, Asian and ethnic minority LGBT+ people” was erected in Soho. Having boycotted the event last year, LGBTQ equality charity Stonewall were also back at the parade partnering with UK Black Pride and trans rights charity Mermaids."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f4ef1b0ba575b769c5fc1b12f635e58000932f2/0_161_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=150d35f63304b16397f374c097558792","title":"alexis tsipras greece election reject radical dream","story":"In Syntagma Square, all the way from the grubby marble stairs opposite the Greek parliament down to the bottom of the plaza, people have gathered. Some are holding flags – the red, white and purple flags of Syriza, the once-radical leftist party whose leader they have come to hear.Hip-hop thunders from giant speakers. The air is heavy and hot. An expectant crowd has been kept waiting for over an hour in temperatures turbocharged by massive spotlights. By the time Alexis Tsipras appears, many are sweating profusely. Still they roar their approval. The countdown has begun.This is the embattled prime minister’s main pre-election address in what has been an unusually low-key campaign for the snap poll taking place in Greece on Sunday.It’s showtime, and Tsipras doesn’t disappoint. He gives it his all. “They think they’ve got rid of Syriza, they think they’ve got rid of the left,” he bellows from a podium that is also encircled by gay supporters waving rainbow flags. “Well, the battle is only beginning. We can do it! We can pull off the greatest reversal in history.”Four years on and the charismatic insurgent – formerly the hope of progressives and scourge of establishment parties Europe-wide – has a battle, as never before, on his hands.Syriza is on the ropes. The drubbing it received in European parliamentary elections in May – emerging 9.5 points behind the centre-right opposition in its first contest at the ballot box since 2015 – is being seen as a precursor for a defeat likely to be comparable, if not bigger.“It’s been unexpected,” conceded Aristides Baltas, a philosopher and former culture minister who helped write the leftists’ manifesto as a founding member of the Coalition of the Radical Left, or Syriza. “Everyone’s shocked. We are hoping the undecided will change their mind.”But if polls have been consistent about anything in Greece, it is Syriza’s tanking popularity. The party that rode a populist anti-austerity wave to storm to power at the height of the country’s financial crisis is now a shadow of its former self. Surveys show its rival, New Democracy, is between eight and 13 points ahead.On Monday the keys to Maximos Mansion, the ornate neoclassical building housing the prime minister’s office and official residence, will almost certainly be handed over to Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the no-nonsense former banker who heads New Democracy. The Harvard-educated son of a past prime minister, whose family has been likened to the Kennedys – his sister Dora was foreign minister, his nephew Kostas is Athens’s mayor-elect – the 51-year-old could not be more different to his leftist opponent.But even if Tsipras knows this is his last hurrah – payback time for the failure to take on Europe and deliver on the promise to eradicate austerity – he is not going down without a fight. The cliffhanger threat of euro exit may have caused him to U-turn, embracing the neoliberal reforms he had once so dramatically denounced, but he is still in the ring, throwing punches and lunging left hooks.On Friday, in Syntagma Square, it was time to get down and dirty. Returning to the rhetoric of confrontation, Tsipras derided Mitsotakis and his ilk as “princes”, saying they belonged to a class that personified the old guard and had brought the debt-burdened nation to the edge of bankruptcy. If elected, the conservatives would roll back the labour and pension rights Syriza had struggled to reinstate, impose yet more harsh measures, privatise public utilities and bring an axe to the public health and education systems, he warned.“They will treat you not as citizens but clients. They are trying to be something they aren’t, so that people will open the door,” he said, accusing New Democracy of hiding its real programme. “Will you entrust your dreams to people who stole from you? Don’t let them take your dreams.”But a week later, the firebrand leader had turned his big no into a big yes, signing up to a €100bn EU-funded bailout programme demanding some of the deepest cuts any government had been asked to apply since the scale of Athens’s insolvency first became apparent in late 2009. Appalled by the about-turn, Varoufakis resigned. His MeRA25 party is contesting Sunday’s elections.Explaining the compromise in parliament, Tsipras likened negotiations with Brussels to war. It was either concession or leaving the eurozone, a catastrophic prospect for a small country on the periphery of Europe surrounded by unpredictable neighbours.“It was the first time in my life I had ever voted. It wasn’t a good experience,” mused Vangelis Flotsiotis, a sociology student at Panteion University in Athens, who had rushed to cast a “no” ballot. “Why vote for someone who lies?”Syriza MPs are the first to say politics these days is rarely about true feelings, even if it is emotion that prevails at the ballot box. After all, it was they who not only endorsed policies that ran counter to their conscience – in contrast to predecessors the leftist party suffered no defections when controversial measures were put to vote – but often did so with alacrity and zeal. For a band of leftist radicals, Greens, feminists, Trotkyists and Maoists, who never thought they would come to power, governance has been a rollercoaster ride. Most say they can understand the disappointment that has replaced the optimism engendered by Syriza’s original slogan “hope is coming”.In the highly choreographed setting of mass rallies and campaign speeches, the whys and wherefores of how a populist revolt could have lost such steam was not addressed by Tsipras. Instead, on Friday, he underscored his intention to move to the centre, appealing to supporters who had once belonged to the socialist Pasok to come on board.Among former Syriza ministers there is soul-searching. While many are dismayed that voters seem so bent on punishing Greece’s first leftist government – one they insist went out of its way to help the vulnerable and poor – questions are also being asked. “Yes, mistakes were made,” said Baltas, “but I think there are a lot of little things, little streams, that lead to this point.”Privately, cadres say Syriza’s bungled handling of the deadly wildfire in the coastal resort of Mati last summer significantly helped accelerate the government’s fall from grace. When the inferno engulfed the town, 103 people died and scores were left badly burned. But there is also distaste over the way the leftists behaved while in power. Tsipras took to smoking cigars and in one embarrassing instance was spotted holidaying with his family on a shipowner’s yacht.The whiff of opportunism – highlighted by the cynical decision to join forces with the far-right Independent Greeks party – and a perception of high-handedness spurred charges that, in power, Syriza was not much better than the old regime.Taking in the view of Syntagma from his office, Nikos Filis, a former education minister who is widely seen as Syriza’s conscience, laments what he describes as “a style issue”.“There are issues, certainly, about the way governance was conducted,” he sighs. “More humility would have been good. But we also forgot to look after the middle class who were so affected by taxes. We focused on the poor, but in the process overlooked the backbone of any society.”But, at 44, Tsipras is still young, he says. “Whether we are in power, or not, we are here to stay,” he smiles.• This article was amended on Sunday 7 July to correct the name of Yanis Varoufakis’s political party."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c58ef5cc956bde4ed6b3598245336f903cdb9aad/0_76_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90e99468e2be959e36d0ac155e0113e3","title":"pride in london parade in pictures","story":"Huge crowds gather on the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Demonstrators held placards outside Enniskillen courthouse and PSNI stationCampaigners march through Dublin with banners stating \u0026lsquoabortion steals hope\u0026rsquoEvent organised over concerns about delays for trans people to access treatmentHundreds mourn Kevin Sheehy (20) killed in Limerick hit-and-run last weekendSearch at an address in Co Antrim uncovers \u0026lsquorange of suspected munitions\u0026rsquoVictims\u0026rsquo campaign Bea Worton \u0026lsquohad a powerful determination\u0026rsquo, says FosterFears for safety of local fishery and wildlife species on the riverDarragh Hyde (3) with cystic fybrosis had been deemed a burden on taxpayersGarda\u0026iacute issue fresh appeal for information following death of child on FridayActor James Nesbitt is ambitious for change for the home place he loves.

Photograph: EPAIranian presidency officeIran says it is raising its enrichment of uranium beyond the limit set in the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.A week after it exceeded a cap on its stockpile of low-grade uranium, Iran will resume purifying uranium beyond the 3.67 per cent allowed under the 2015 agreement, the government’s spokesman, Ali Rabiee, said in Tehran on Sunday.In a news conference, it was announced that Tehran would keep reducing its commitments every 60 days unless signatories of the pact moved to protect it from US sanctions, but they left the door open to diplomacy.The moves have created a challenge for European nations who helped negotiate the deal but are struggling to deliver the economic relief from American curbs that Iran had demanded by July 7th. European leaders have signalled they will not rush to impose penalties on Iran, but they will find it increasingly hard to resist pressure from the Trump administration if the country abandons multiple commitments.The US withdrew from the deal last year and reimposed sanctions on Iran’s economy and leaders, prompting Tehran to scale back compliance and fuelling concerns that the region was sliding toward war.Some of the recent American sanctions on Iran have been designed to prevent it from fully complying with the terms of the nuclear deal and end uranium enrichment altogether. In May, the US ended waivers allowing Iran to export excess levels of heavy water and exchange extra amounts of enriched uranium for raw uranium or yellow cake – actions required of Iran by the terms of the accord.–PABloomberg"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/06/11/TELEMMGLPICT000197062411_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqWZZ9520Qrn8RyVs0byqFfxdYxsWUQUCtgJX18DpO5X4.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"making final call publish mps expenses","story":"Former editor of The Daily , William LewisIts publication led to the biggest parliamentary scandal in a generation, but two national newspapers had already turned the story down.The decision to pay for the full expense claims of every MP in Westminster was laced with risk: the leaked information could have been deemed stolen, or worse - it could have been a hoax.

of expression”Universities must not allow students to block pro-life or Christian societies due to “hypersensitivity”, the equalities chief has said.  David Isaac, chair of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, said universities should be “bastions of debate and defenders of expression”.  Speaking at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in London on Thursday night, he criticised student unions which have attempted to bar Christian and pro-life societies from having stalls at Freshers’ Fairs or hiring rooms for events.  “This is not consistent with ensuring freedom of speech on campus, and the EHRC guidance makes clear that it should not happen,” he said. Mr Isaac was speaking at the launch of a report by the think-tank Theos about faith on campus.“We are living in an age of hypersensitivity where it is increasingly easier for people to feel offended - or others to be worried about protecting minority groups,” he said.  Last year, a pro-life student group was refused permission to set up stalls at three different university freshers’ fairs.The charity, called Life, wrote to the independent regulator of higher education in England to express concern about discriminatory behaviour and freedom of expression violations… by a number of university student unions. In 2017, an Oxford College banned the Christian Union from its freshers’ fair on the grounds that it would be “alienating” for students of other religions, and constitute a “micro-aggression”.The organiser of Balliol’s fair argued Christianity’s historic use as “an excuse for homophobia and certain forms of neo-colonialism” meant that students might feel “unwelcome” in their new college if the Christian Union had a stall.At the time,  the vice-president of Balliol’s Junior Common Room (JCR) committee, said that if a representative from the Christian Union attended the fair, it could cause potential harm to freshers.  Three people gored while running with the bulls at PamplonaDisney star Cameron Boyce dies at 20Jeffrey Epstein, billionaire and former friend of Duke of York,  \u0026#39charged with sex trafficking\u0026#39Labour threatens ex-staff with legal action amid row over anti-Semitism and whistleblowingHow China pushed a new generation of disenfranchised youth to the very edge in Hong KongHomeowners\u0026#39 gardens invaded by badgers forced out of their natural habitatBoris Johnson vs Jeremy Hunt: The final two Tory leadership candidates\u0026#39 policy pledges in fullJudges rule that Romanian criminal cannot be deported under EU lawComment: All the Nike flag row shows is that America has lost interest in the ideal of freedomHenley Regatta row as locals oppose extending event by extra day to allow for women\u0026#39s racesComment: Farewell to Christopher Booker, a man whose Sunday  column was THE one to readComment: If the Tories really want to provide more homes, here\u0026#39s what they need to do Tired Greeks set to clobber progressive Left government and return to old-style political dynastyRHS chief admits that she doesn’t know all the Latin names for plantsComment: There\u0026#39s only one way for fashion to be sustainable, and that\u0026#39s for us all to stop buying new clothes Enfield stabbing: Girl, 11, fighting for life as three others injured Jeremy Hunt pledges he would lock up returning UK jihadists for life with updated treason lawsTrial of Jihadi \u0026#39Beatles\u0026#39 faces delay as US prosecutors gather evidenceWho\u0026#39s who in Archie\u0026#39s social circle, from palace play-dates to school with the Clooney twinsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"geeks become new jocks british universities now have gaming","story":"E-sports have now overtaken football as the sport with the highest number of teams at British universitiesGetting a place on a university sports team used to be a ticket to social prestige. But it appears that geeks have become the new jocks, as British universities now have more competitive gaming teams than any other sport.For the first time there are more students taking part in “e-sports” than football, according to figures compiled and British Universities and College Sport (BUCS) and  National Student E-sports (NSE).E-sports have now overtaken football as the sport with the highest number of teams at British universities. There are 685 e-sports teams spread across 73 universities in the UK, compared to 662 football teams.The next most popular sport is hockey with 546 teams, followed by netball with 432 teams and then Rugby Union with 425 teams.Jon Tilbury, director at NSE which organises inter-university gaming tournaments, said that while university gaming societies have been around for 15 to 20 years, it is only in the past five years or so that they rapidly increased in popularity.Some societies now have hundreds of members, he said, and certain universities have separate societies for particular games.For the first time there are more students taking part in “e-sports” than footballMr Tilbury said that the surge in interest from university students echoes the growth in the gaming industry more generally. “Interest in e-sports has been there for a long time,” Mr Tilbury said. “The wider e-sports community has grown massively, with professional teams paid big salaries and flown around the world to be in tournaments . “What we see is a lot of university students with technical skills getting involved, we have students who have developed their own custom software.”Some universities, which have a particular enthusiasm for gaming, have different societies for particular types of games, for example, Warwick University has a Nintendo Society as well as an E-sports Society. The average university e-sports team consists of 6.5 players, according to data from NSE. Around 90 per cent of players are male, 70 per cent of them are studying courses in STEM subjects.Mr Tilbury explained that inter-university games can be played by students from the comfort of their own bedrooms, but players would meet up in person for the final of a tournament.The NSE co-ordinates with BUCS, the umbrella organisation that organises sports matches, to ensure that gaming matches to do deter students from playing other sports, he added.   The most popular reason students cited for competing in gaming championships was making and maintaining friendships, and improving and becoming a better player, according to a survey by the NSE.Three people gored while running with the bulls at PamplonaDisney star Cameron Boyce dies at 20Jeffrey Epstein, billionaire and former friend of Duke of York,  \u0026#39charged with sex trafficking\u0026#39Labour threatens ex-staff with legal action amid row over anti-Semitism and whistleblowingHow China pushed a new generation of disenfranchised youth to the very edge in Hong KongHomeowners\u0026#39 gardens invaded by badgers forced out of their natural habitatBoris Johnson vs Jeremy Hunt: The final two Tory leadership candidates\u0026#39 policy pledges in fullJudges rule that Romanian criminal cannot be deported under EU lawComment: All the Nike flag row shows is that America has lost interest in the ideal of freedomHenley Regatta row as locals oppose extending event by extra day to allow for women\u0026#39s racesComment: Farewell to Christopher Booker, a man whose Sunday  column was THE one to readComment: If the Tories really want to provide more homes, here\u0026#39s what they need to do Tired Greeks set to clobber progressive Left government and return to old-style political dynastyRHS chief admits that she doesn’t know all the Latin names for plantsComment: There\u0026#39s only one way for fashion to be sustainable, and that\u0026#39s for us all to stop buying new clothes Enfield stabbing: Girl, 11, fighting for life as three others injured Jeremy Hunt pledges he would lock up returning UK jihadists for life with updated treason lawsTrial of Jihadi \u0026#39Beatles\u0026#39 faces delay as US prosecutors gather evidenceWho\u0026#39s who in Archie\u0026#39s social circle, from palace play-dates to school with the Clooney twinsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"hope prix pictet 2019 photographic competition shortlist selection","story":"The Prix Pictet competition carries a prize of 100,000 Swiss Francs (about £80,700).

There is absolutely a perception among students, echoed by teachers, that getting top grades in languages is difficult and is more difficult than other subjects.”Mike Buchanan, executive director of the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference, says the status quo is \u0026#34unacceptable\u0026#34He said this is not an unreasonable calculation to make, adding that parents also advise their children against languages on this basis. They are making the same sort of calculation: What is going to enable my child to as successful as possible?What will be the best passport to the next stage?Entries for GCSEs in both French and German have dropped by 30 per cent over the past five years, while Spanish has dropped by a more modest two per cent, according to figures compiled by the British Council for its annual language trends report. The report, published earlier this week, showed that in 2014, there were 166,167 entries for French GCSE and 60,362 for German but by 2018, this had dropped to 117,046 and 42,296 respectively.Mr Buchanan said that the status quo is “unacceptable”, adding: “Whether its Ofqual or someone else - unless we do something, languages will die. There won’t be students who want to take them, and over time there won’t be enough teachers to teach them”.This summer is the second year that students have taken revamped GCSE exams in modern foreign languages (MFL).The new courses were part of a package of reforms by Michael Gove, the former education secretary, designed to toughen up syllabuses, make courses more linear, and cut down on the number of students getting A*s.Ofqual, the exam regulator, is currently undertaking a review of the reformed GCSE MFL subjects, which is due to conclude this autumn.It said it is “aware of statistical evidence” that suggests that GCSE MFL subjects may be “more severely graded than many others”.However, the watchdog said that this alone is not necessarily enough to “justify a change to grading standards”.An Ofqual spokesperson said that their research so far suggests that the new GCSEs are “functioning well”, but added that it takes concerns about the perceived difficulty of MFL subjects “seriously” and it “continues to look at this issue in detail”.They added: “We are currently conducting a comprehensive review of grading standards in GCSE French, German and Spanish, looking at statistical evidence, contextual data including trends in the numbers taking these subjects and the quality of students’ work, to see if there is compelling case for an adjustment to grading standards in these subjects.”Three people gored while running with the bulls at PamplonaDisney star Cameron Boyce dies at 20Jeffrey Epstein, billionaire and former friend of Duke of York,  \u0026#39charged with

So feel free, you help the nursery trade by killing plants.Sue Biggs with Sir Nicholas Bacon, President of the RHS and the Duchess of Cambridge Biggs also encouraged listeners to get outside as much as possible because “sitting in doors on a screen or a tablet” is not “connecting with nature”. “I would really encourage everyone to get outside every day, even if it’s only you manage five minutes, take your socks and shoes off, go and walk on the grass and just reconnect with nature because it doesn’t half make you feel better.” Biggs said that her garden also got her through her fifties, a time in which she lost her mother, went through two rounds of chemotherapy treatment and her husband “decided after 30 years that he’d rather be somewhere else”. She said: “My fifties were my not happy decade. It was a tough time and really those friends and family really got me through all of that but so too did my garden. “I think they’re tremendously healing, gardens.” Biggs also recollected the discrimination she endured during her early career, when she was the youngest and first female appointed to the board of Kuoni Travel. “I remember going over for my first meeting there and they’d very nicely got me a present and a card so I opened the card first. “I looked at it and thought oh this is a bit strange, so opened it and inside was the ‘congratulations at last we’ve got somebody to iron our shirts’.” She said today such a card “wouldn’t be acceptable” but that “if you laugh about them it’s really the best way to handle it.” Desert Island Discs is on BBC Sounds and BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15amThree people gored while running with the bulls at PamplonaDisney star Cameron Boyce dies at 20Jeffrey Epstein, billionaire and former friend of Duke of York,  \u0026#39charged with sex trafficking\u0026#39Labour threatens ex-staff with legal action amid row over anti-Semitism and whistleblowingHow China pushed a new generation of disenfranchised youth to the very edge in Hong KongHomeowners\u0026#39 gardens invaded by badgers forced out of their natural habitatBoris Johnson vs Jeremy Hunt: The final two Tory leadership candidates\u0026#39 policy pledges in fullJudges rule that Romanian criminal cannot be deported under EU lawComment: All the Nike flag row shows is that America has lost interest in the ideal of freedomHenley Regatta row as locals oppose extending event by extra day to allow for women\u0026#39s racesComment: Farewell to Christopher Booker, a man whose Sunday  column was THE one to readComment: If the Tories really want to provide more homes, here\u0026#39s what they need to do Tired Greeks set to clobber progressive Left government and return to old-style political dynastyComment: There\u0026#39s only one way for fashion to be sustainable, and that\u0026#39s for us all to stop buying new clothes Enfield stabbing: Girl, 11, fighting for life as three others injured Jeremy Hunt pledges he would lock up returning UK jihadists for life with updated treason lawsTrial of Jihadi \u0026#39Beatles\u0026#39 faces delay as US prosecutors gather evidenceWho\u0026#39s who in Archie\u0026#39s social circle, from palace play-dates to school with the Clooney twinsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/07/05/TELEMMGLPICT000202839241_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"tired greeks set clobber progressive left government return","story":"Kyriakos Mitsotakis, Greece\u0026#39s likely next prime minister, waves to supporters during a rally in AthensThey were the upstart rebels, the firebrand crusaders against austerity and cuts, borne to power on a wave of anger and desperation.But four years after their election to government, Greece’s ruling Syriza party faces a thumping defeat at a general election on Sunday - paving the way for the return of one of the country’s most well-established political dynasties.Exhausted by austerity and disappointed by the government’s broken promises, Greeks are expected to elect as their new prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the scion of a powerful political family and the son of a former prime minister.The far-Left Syriza is trailing 8.5 percentage points behind its rivals, the conservative New Democracy...To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Blame it on the fact I’ve just spent the last hour on a bloody exercise bike, trying to shed the burgeoning pounds around my gut.But it’s true, nonetheless — or partly true, at least. One third of Britons are obese. You may have noticed them waddling up the high street, gasping with exertion, curtains of lard hanging down from their arms.Worse still, obesity is now officially a bigger killer than smoking. Being overweight is now the chief cause of four really horrible cancers — oian, bowel, liver and kidney. The full English.We’ve known about this obesity epidemic for a long time now. But we’ve gone about dealing with it in entirely the wrong way.First, the ious charities have told us it’s terribly wrong to fat shame people. It might hurt their self-esteem. Well, good.Shaming works. It was when my son called me a “lard-faced tw*t” during an argument that I decided I needed to do some serious weight-loss stuff. Hence the exercise bike.But we’ve also concentrated — quite wrongly — on diet. And when we do that we end up penalising the very poorest in society. Every week there are calls to raise the price of cheap alcohol, sugary drinks, fast food, any stuff with sugar in it. This is called a “sin tax” and it always hurts the working class. They won’t be putting a tax on Chablis, will they Boris Johnson has just announced that he wants to do away with these sin taxes. It’s the first thing he’s said in ages that I agree with.Start with cigarettes, Boris. But also stop persecuting people who occasionally eat a cheeseburger from McDonald’s.That’s not the real cause of obesity. The real cause is lack of exercise. We live increasingly sedentary lives. We don’t walk enough, we don’t play sport. We sit at desks and fester. This is bad enough for the adult population. But it’s even worse for the kids.Our schoolchildren get less exercise than ever before. When they are at school, the PE lessons are fewer than was once the case. And competitiveness is frowned upon by the leftie teachers.Further, over the years, thousands of acres of school playing fields have been sold off for housing developments. So the kids have nowhere to play competitive games, eventhey were allowed to.And out of school, of course, they are not kicking a ball around, or going on walks. They are instead glued to their bloody electronic devices. Sat on their fat ar*es hammering away at some internet game. Living their lives vicariously instead of in the real world.And they are ferried everywhere by their mums and dads — instead of doing what we did as kids and walk everywhere.That’s the problem, almost the only problem. We don’t have worse diets than I had when I was a kid. Crispy pancakes filled with salty gloop and frozen pizzas that tasted like your sofa Today’s diet is no worse than that stuff. And very few of us were fat then.Somehow we need to convince kids that it’s important to get out and exercise a bit. And parents need to let their kids off the leash a little more. Get them to walk to places.Take their devices off them and kick them out of the house. Impress upon them that legs are useful things and might be funthey employed them once in a while.And for the rest of us: Walk, run, cycle. , paces per day minimum, or you’ll end up like Jabba The Hutt. And then drop dead at .APRIL HAWES was caught on CCTV flinging a cat across a road and at a front door.

And I’m going to swing by and take a dump in your garden and decapitate a thrush.There are few more selfish people than cat owners. If you can’t keep your cat confined on your own property, don’t have a cat.And isn’t it about time we started fining cat owners when they fail to pick up after their pet has defecated AS you probably gathered, I don’t have too much time for Jeremy Corbyn.He’s a dimbo who buys all the adolescent, far-left stupidity. Policies which were dated decades ago.But I am totally on his side when it comes to his battle with the civil service. Someone within that smug organisation leaked an official “worry” that Corbyn was “too frail” to carry outThat was cruel, spiteful and politically motivated.The civil service is against Corbyn because they don’t agree with his policies. Well, me neither. But the civil service is there to carry out the bidding of WHOEVER we elect, even Magic Grandpa.The problem is that the civil service is heavily biased, just like the BBC. Not so much to the left as towards the liberal viewpoint on all things.We saw this during the Brexit negotiations, when one civil servant broke cover and told The Sunday Times that the entire civil service was against Brexit and did its best to undermine it.We need a clear out of these time servers, cocooned in their middle-class bubble.HERE’S Alex Morgan, scorer of the goal which knocked our Lionesses out of the World Cup.She annoyed people by miming the act of drinking tea. Because that’s what Brits do, of course.When the much better Ellen White scored for England she should have mimed shooting people in a school.Anyway Morgan, we now all hope you get stuffed in the final.ANOTHER startling revelation about our next Prime Minister, Boris Johnson.Apparently he had a row with a woman  years ago. He got quite cross and shouted stuff. So that’s TWO arguments with women in  years.I have two arguments with women every bloody day that God sends. I think there must be something wrong with Boris that he gets on with them so well.The next revelation from Boris’s nosy neighbours or ex-girlfriends  “Boris Johnson sings Dire Straits songs while he’s having a shower.”And “Boris would sometimes use the butter kne to spread marmalade on his toast, leaving a small residue of butter in the marmalade jar.”WHO the hell is Jason Mohammad  That’s the question most of the country was asking this week.

I did once come across a good one on  the Channel Island of Sark but that’s about as far afield as the genre works.Spaniards, for a communal knees-up, will hold an evening fiesta with castanet-clacking, flamenco dancers and lots of shouts of: “Ole!”Scandinavians, in their few moments of fervour, will dance around apple trees, drink aquavit and jump into the nearest lake wearing their birthday suits.Germans obey the summons of an oompah band and will sit in orderly rows at long tables to eat cake and take the pils. The French play boules in dusty town squares. Icelandics bubble in boiling mud baths. Swiss yodel. Italians sing. And Russians sunbathe standing up, like armies of penguins.Yet we British attend local fêtes or school fairs, to delight ourselves with cheesy games. Do you like whack-a-mole or are you more of an apple bobber, plunging your head into a barrel of cold water to try to bite an elusive Granny Smith Bouncy castles, face-painting, white-elephant stalls, the suggestive-carrots display, guess-the--of-the-sausage-dog or the dreaded bric-a-brac stall: These are the daft indulgences of the British summer. Sophisticated  No. But that’s the whole point. Fêtes are exuberantly shambolic and unsnobby.You’ll find them in country and urban districts alike, from the Isle of Wight to Inverness. They never wheedle for public money. You won’t ever hear them bragging about their Bame quotas. They just get on with le and are cheerfully self-sufficient and unaffectedly erse.The other weekend a  friend worked the BBQ  at his children’s school in London and reported a joyous snapshot of modern Britain.Lots of women in hijabs played hook-a-duck, spending their cash on halal burgers and cans of pop. It’s not a bad definition of Britishness: Have you ever been to a fête Certain rules apply.RULE ONE: At least one lady on the organising committee shall be called Peggy or Alison.RULE TWO: The trestle tables at the tea stall shall wobble alarmingly, but never quite collapse.RULE THREE: The home-made chocolate eclairs shall start to melt in the cakes tent.RULE FOUR: The PA system operated by the master of ceremoniesshall be prey to random bursts of deafening feedback.RULE FIVE: Evenit rains, everyone will totter home happy.Foreigners often find us hard to understand. At present they are baffled that our Government may soon be led by crumpled, grunting Boris Johnson, and that his opponent will be rambling revolutionary Jeremy Corbyn, an OAP who likes shell-suits and municipal manhole covers.Global diplomats and analysts pore over the socio-economic data, the pollsters’ pie charts, the tax statistics and more, and they puzzle.Likewise, they behold the weekly argy-bargy of Prime Minister’s Questions, or the sight of Nigel Farage and his merry MEPs turning their backs on the EU anthem at the opening of the European Parliament, and they are flummoxed. Brexit bamboozles them — “But why do you wish to leave our European Union ” They really don’t get it.My advice to our foreign friends is this: Follow the bunting and get yourself to a neighbourhood summer beano.Visit a fête and you will soon understand the British character. Bloody-minded,  quirky, unassuming, unfazed about politically-correct crazes.Fêtes are a telling combination of romantic tradition and anarchy. No one wants them to be slickly modern.We want our fêtes to be small-c conservative: The canvas marquee to smell as it did  years ago, the skittles lane to be surrounded by no more health and safety paraphernalia than a few straw bales, and at least one of the domestic-produce judges to become squfy after sampling the home-made sloe gins.At our village in Herefordshire it is always my job to supervise the dog show. In the parade ring things iniably unravel. We have had fights and attempted matings .One year a lad aged  about six entered the ring with a Great Dane twice his size. The dog, naturally, was called Tiny.Another year, in the musical mats competition, a great-gran in her s was so determined to win that she used her walking stick to trip up a teenage rival. We Brits may have an amateurish bent but we are competitive, too. The EU should not overlook that truth.Politicians and quangocrats and the BBC are convinced that the country is in decline and that everyone has some problem or is oppressed by an -ism.A trip to a fête would put them right. Fêtes are optimistic, classless, unpretentious, fun. No race quotas. No safety announcements. No risk assessments. No race or gender angst.They may often look like something from a Richard Curtis film but fêtes are a better reflection of st-century Britain than any state-subsidised art show or any right-on TV soap.See you at the tombola stand. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Perhaps they feel aggrieved by the bad publicity and have decided to pull up the drawbridge to keep us all out today.It doesn’t work like that.Diana, who knew all about public perception and how to deal with the media, would have advised them to counteract the criticism by making sure that Archie’s christening was an event the whole country could enjoy.There would have been no question of the names of godparents being kept secret, or photos of such a big occasion only being released on Harry and Meghan’s carefully controlled Instagram account.Diana would have known that images of a cute baby and his doting parents, with guests all done up to the nines, would take the heat off the negative stories surrounding the Frogmore building work.I’m sure Meghan has been bruised by some of the, frankly, racist and utterly vile comments on social media, as well as the upsetting and ongoing feud with her family — apart from her mum, Doria.Not even Diana would have been able to silence those hideous trolls, but her wise counsel would have stopped the Markle clan from being a thorn in Meghan’s side.Even before the engagement announcement, Diana would have flown over to the USA and entranced Thomas Markle.I have no doubt Diana would have given him a masterclass in dealing with the media.There would have been no clumsy staged paparazzi shots and Thomas Markle would have proudly walked his daughter down the aisle.Diana, would have been on hand with advice about the announcement of baby Archie’s arrival, which was all a bit messy.She would have been a staunch ally to Meghan and helped her navigate the choppy waters of royal protocol, and been a terric sounding board for any worries the new mum might encounter.Diana would have been a cheerleader for Harry and Meghan’s plans to make a dference both here and in Africa and supported their plans to spend half the year in Botswana with baby Archie, albeit with assurances that “Granny Di” could pop over for regular visits.I understand Harry and Meghan want to protect their little boy and allow him to grow up leading as “normal” a le as possible, but they really can’t have it both ways.Either they are private citizens and pay for their own loft extension, or they are royals and have to share the big events in their lives with the rest of the world. Diana would have helped them achieve that balance.It’s a crying shame she isn’t here, but I truly hope Harry and Meghan have a joyful time today and maybe even change their minds and give us all a peek at the celebrations.FIFTY years ago, Neil Armstrong landed on the Moon and the world was in awe.As a ten-year-old watching this “giant leap for mankind” I genuinely believed that we had taken the first small step into the unknown and were boldly going “where no one had gone before”.I did a primary school project on the first manned voyage to Mars, which we reckoned would take place in  –  nothing seemed impossible.In the years before the Moon landing, we watched Star Trek and thought we’d be living that TV series for real.There was to have been a lunar base, and from there we would explore the solar system and eventually the rest of the universe.Of course none of this came to pass, except in our imaginations and sci-fi films.Scientists had the curiosity and the imagination but, sadly, the general public lost interest.After the space shuttle disasters in  and  that killed  crew members, politicians got cold feet and the manned missions were shelved.This loss of le was tragic but, ever since we started exploring space, astronauts have always paid the ultimate price.Even the Apollo  Moon landing came close to disaster.This week sees the release of Armstrong, an astonishing documentary about the first man on the Moon.Watching the footage, you will gain a new-found respect for this rare breed of human beings.Hopefully it will ignite a new passion among this current generation to once again travel into space.If we don’t seek out “new le and new civilisations”, then what are we actually here for THE biggest kid of all in the le of Coleen Rooney would appear to be her husband.She’s ed home with her four boys and left Wayne in the US with a list of strict instructions most mums would leave for their stroppy teenage sons.Wayne has been warned that there is to be no boozing, no wild parties and he has to phone Coleen every day to check in with her so she can be reassured he really is behaving himself.No wonder the poor lass has to have so many holidays.Looking after FIVE boisterous boys must be utterly exhausting.I AM more than a little bit in love with Suranne Jones as “Gentleman Jack”.This cracking drama based on the real-le th century lesbian Anne Lister is witty, wicked and, at times, impossibly sad.Anne was a bold pioneer trying to find her place in le.At a time when women were kept firmly in their place and either treated like imbeciles or fragile pieces of bone china, she was a sharp businesswoman who owned her own land and took no s**t.When it came to matters of the heart, however, Anne was achingly vulnerable and badly let down by the women she loved.It’s the last episode tomorrow but,you have missed out, you can catch up on BBC iPlayer and a second series has already been commissioned.CAROL Vorderman has the sort of figure that would make Jessica Rabbit turn pea green with envy – proper gorgeous, voluptuous curves.She told me it’s all down to doing thousands of squats, walking for miles in the countryside and the side-effects of the menopause.Under that regime, most of us would end up with rock-hard flat buttocks, sore feet and horric night sweats.GAIL Porter famously once had her derrière beamed on to the Houses of Parliament.It actually made a refreshing change to see a backside on the outside of the building, instead of the usual arses who inhabit the interior.Back then, Gail was at the height of her fame as a TV presenter and lads’ mag favourite.It looked as though she was living the dream, but the poor girl was suffering horribly inside.She’s had well documented mental health issues including being diagnosed as bipolar, and suffering with anorexia and anxiety.At one point, in deep despair, she even tried to take her own le.Possibly due to all the stress, Gail’s hair fell out and never grew back.It’s not been an easy road, but I am delighted this irrepressible and beautul woman has bounced back.She’s now in a good place and keen to help others who have been through similar experiences.Gail has teamed up with The Samaritans, an organisation that has helped her in the past, to ask us all to take part in a marathon.The good news is you can take the whole of July to reach  miles.That’s under a mile a day and you can run, jog or walk.Build up your miles in your nearest park, going to work on foot or just out for a stroll.For more information on the Samarathon, see Samaritans.org. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He wants Archie to be a private citizen in every way possible.”Amy Heckathorn said: “He’s leaning more towards Meghan, but he’s still in the potato phase. It’s hard to tell.”Another suggested Archie has a head like Meg and Harry’s eyes. The Queen and Prince Philip were absent from the ceremony, having already made plans to spend the week together at Sandringham after Her Majestys annual Holyrood Week in Scotland.The couple have given the public just a few glimpses of little Archie since he was born in May.Meghan and Harry gushed over their amazing son as they presented him to the world just days after his birth.And they released a sweet photograph of the little boy on Fathers Day, as well as a stylised pic of Meghan holding his foot for Mothers Day.A statement, released by Buckingham Palace, confirmed they will not give any further details about Archies christening.It said: The godparents, in keeping with their wishes, will remain private.The Church of England said: “Under the Parochial Registers and Records Measure  all baptisms must be registered and the record made is normally publicly available.“However the register to be used in this case is held privately by the royal household . . . and we understand that it has never complied with the usual requirement.”"},{"url":null,"title":"i wouldnt trust new eurocrats whelk stall","story":"Behind closed doors, the EU has just doled out its top jobs to Brussels’ next generation of unelected, unaccountable Ayatollahs.And the prestige posts are all going to fanatical federalists who believe that Brexit is the devil’s spawn.Ursula von der Leyen, replacing Jean-Claude Juncker as EU Commission president in November, talks with a straight face about a European Union army defending a United States of Europe. No, really.Christine Lagarde, replacing Mario Draghi as European Central Bank president, was a proud cheerleader for Project Fear in her role as head of the International Monetary Fund, predicting the UK’s collapsewe dared vote for Brexit.And Charles Michel, the lame duck Belgium Prime Minister replacing Donald Tusk as EU Council President, has consistently dismissed Brexit as a contemptible little “soap opera”.Come back, Jean-Claude Drunker — all is forgiven!I have seen these appointments described as a “huge headache” for the next British Prime Minister.On the contrary, having an elite of Brexit-bashing, Brit-loathing Eurocrats spitting their federalist poison at us makes leaving the EU inevitable.Nothing is more likely to finally get us out of the European Union than having a sneering, bossy rabble of democracy-denying nonentities wagging their fingers in our faces.I wouldn’t trust the EU Ayatollahs to run a whelk stall.Charles Michel’s major claim to fame is that he became Belgium’s youngest ever PM in , despite his party coming third in the elections.Christine Lagarde was convicted of criminal negligence in  over a financial scandal in France but spared jail time and allowed to keep her job.She is the first female head of the European Central Bank and also the first who has no background in economics.Despite her eight years as head of the IMF, Lagarde is a lawyer and a politician. So best of luck saving the Euro, Christine.Ursula von der Leyen’s nomination as EU Commission President has provoked outrage in her native Germany, where it is perceived as an undeserved reward for miserable failure.Frau von der Leyen’s six years as defence minister earned her the reputation as “the worst minister in Germany” and being promoted to President of the EU Commission is seen as getting “kicked upstairs” by her friend, Chancellor Angela Merkel.Certainly there is nothing on Ursula’s CV to warrant such a promotion.As defence minister, Frau von der Leyen prioritised creches and flexible working hours for Germany’s armed forces.Funding shortages became so dire on her watch that on a Nato training exercise in Norway, German troops were obliged to use broomsticks painted black instead of guns.I don’t fancy her EU army’s chances against the Russians.But I would bet they have childcare facilities to die for.Unelected by the people, unaccountable to the people and contemptuous of the people, this next generation of Eurocrats remind us why the British have no future inside this arrogant empire.Yes, Brexit has been an agony.But the appointment of the EU’s new Ayatollahs prove that remaining is unthinkable.BRIAN JONES, the original Rolling Stone, died  years ago this week.“No Jones, no Stones,” said Bill Wyman. “He formed the band.

Linda Calvey, who counts mobster Reggie Kray among her suitors, lived it up for years as an armed robber who learned the ropes from her first husband. She is said to have netted £million from crime – a conservative estimate, maybe, given her own boast that she netted £, a raid. Linda started out as a getaway driver, then became a gun-toting robber herself. Now , the woman who served  years for murdering one of her fellas is telling all in new book Black Widow.    Talking about her past as a robber, Linda told the Sunday Mirror: “The first time I was a driver. But then I would go in with a gun. “I was the silent one. I never used to speak during the robberies as I didn’t want them to know I was a woman, so I would just stand back and hold it. I was disguised with a balaclava and was meant to be the menacing one.” Linda, who served time with killers Rose West and Myra Hindley, added: “Planning would take months and the robbery would take minutes. “The police would say it’s ‘Black Widow’s gang’ and they were my gang. “They called me ‘lady boss’.” The Black Widow tag comes from her string of relationships. Most of the men who have fallen for her charms have wound up in prison or dead. Linda says: “I was a seductress. I lured men in with my web. And I always knew when I got one.” She was even proposed to by fellow killer Kray while in jail. They had met in a club before he was nicked in .    Years later, when Linda was also in jail, Kray got in touch. She explains: “He wrote to me and told me to be strong. Through my brother, who was locked up with him, we became pen pals. “He then started phoning me twice a week and I used to get bouquets from him. He sent me trainers once. “And then he asked me to marry him over the phone. I said it wasn’t good for either of us – really thinking it wouldn’t be good for me as I’d still be sitting there nowI was Mrs Kray. “I even made him a house in pottery class as his dream was to get home before he died. He was a romantic soul, and very quietly spoken.” Kray died in  aged , five years after mob twin Ronnie passed away. Linda’s lust for crime was fuelled when first husband Mickey Calvey was shot dead by the Flying Squad during an armed raid on a supermarket in .    He was nicknamed The Fonz after the character in TV’s Happy Days. Calvey’s gang plotted their raids in Linda’s kitchen as she made tea and sarnies. She maintains that she only got involved in the hard stuff after the death of Mickey, father of her children Melanie, , and Neil, . Linda says: “He was shot in the back and I became so bitter. I just wanted revenge. “When he was in his coffin I spoke to him and said, ‘I will do what you died doing and I will provide for our children’. And I decided I would become what I did become that day. “My love for him made me go crazy. On the outside I was me but on the inside I was a demon. I wanted to avenge my husband and in my mind that was doing armed robberies as he got killed doing one, however strange that sounds.    I was always attracted to money. The first time I robbed a bank I got addicted. My feet felt like they weren’t on the floor, it was a rush.” Linda – who told her kids not to follow her into a le of crime – says she committed around  robberies, adding: “I got around  grand a robbery – and we did loads. “It was very glamorous. I had a whole wardrobe of fur coats.” Linda hails from Stepney and became queen of the underworld in London’s East End. She hooked up with fellow crook Ronnie Cook. “Ron came and took my le over, I was in a bubble,” she recalls. But in  he was jailed for  years for robbery. Linda promised to wait for him and got a tattoo on her leg which read: “True Love Ron Cook.”    However, she started an affair with her partner-in-crime Brian Thorogood – who is also now dead – and ended up serving a three-year stint for involvement in a robbery herself. Linda says: “We got caught because Brian’s we had him followed by a private detective. They saw us on a robbery and reported it to the police. “The cops said I was so good they’d never have caught me and I thought, ‘Well, at least that’s something!’” It was only then, Linda says, that the gravity of her actions hit her. She adds: “First time I thought about anyone  was when I got arrested at my brother’s flat. “A policeman had a gun to my face and it was horric. It made me think, ‘Oh my God, that must be how people felt when we did it to them’.” By the end of the s, Cook was due for release and Linda was worried he might discover her infidelity. A jury later heard how Linda offered hitman Danny Reece £, to kill Cook. Reece was also in jail but on day release on the day of the murder.    Linda picked Cook up from Maidstone prison in  and drove him to her home in East London. Reece was lying in wait. As Cook walked in with the milk, Reece shot him – in the elbow. He was allegedly unable to finish the job. Linda grabbed the shotgun, shouted “kneel”, then blasted Cook in the head, the court was told. Linda was convicted of murder. Yet she maintains her innocence to this day. “I never killed him,” she says. “I was notorious and the police wanted me locked up. Brian hired Reece. “I think he wanted me back. Everyone said he was besotted with me.” Linda and Reece – both convicted of Cook’s murder in  – later married at Durham Prison, though the relationship eventually failed.    After Myra Hindley died, Linda briefly became England’s longest-serving female lag. Now she hopes her book will encourage someone to come forward to back her version of events. She says: “Why would I lie  I served my time and have nothing to prove. “I’m dferent from the woman I was  years ago. “I look back and sometimes think I don’t equate me with that person. “I regret everything after Mickey, but I’ve never felt sorry for myself.” One of Linda’s great sorrows is not being at the  wedding of daughter Melanie. “What should have been the happiest day of my le was awful. I was gutted. I couldn’t stop crying,” she says.    After a rollercoaster of crime and passion, Linda was freed in  and found love again with retired businessman George Ceaser, . But four years ago he was diagnosed with  tumours and died within a month. Despite her Black Widow nickname, Linda does not believe that she – or the many men in her le – were cursed. She says: “All the other men I met, other than George, were criminals. If Mickey hadn’t been an armed robber he wouldn’t have got shot. And then I wouldn’t have met Ron and he wouldn’t have died. Maybe bad judgment but certainly not a curse.” And of the future  “I’d never say never when it comes to love,” she says. “But is anyone brave enough  With my past I can hardly join a dating website. What would I put in the bio ” aposI cut Myra Hindleyaposs hair in jail - and she was bitter until her dying dayapos    Jailed Linda served alongside Moors Murderer Myra Hindley three times – and even did her hair. In her book, ex-gangster Linda says Hindley – convicted with Ian Brady over the deaths of five Lancashire children in the s – remained bitter and twisted until her dying day. Bleating Hindley blamed her actions on Brady and even insulted the mother of victim Lesley Anne Downey, . Linda says: “She was very bitter and believed she shouldn’t be in prison. She was especially bitter towards Lesley Anne Downey’s mum and called her ‘that bloody woman’. “She had a locked briefcase under her bed and told me it was her personal papers. I found it when a spider crawled from under her bed and I asked her to kill it. But she wouldn’t. She told me to kill it as I’m the Black Widow.” Linda and Hindley, who died in  aged , rubbed shoulders at Cookham Wood jail, Kent, at Durham Prison and finally at Highpoint, Suffolk – where she became her hairdresser. Trained crimper Linda goes on: “She was fussy about her hair as that was the only control she had left. She’d send me Christmas cards and phoned her mother to say she had a lovely friend. “I would think ‘I’m not your friend’ but I would talk to her mum as I felt sorry for her having a daughter like that.” Black Widow, £. from Mirror Books is out Thursday "},{"url":null,"title":"grief stricken mum hasnt seen","story":"NewsGrief-stricken mum hasnt seen her daughter since she was abducted seven years agoMalgorzata Symanowiczs husband Maher Belaid took their baby daughter Talia to Libya hours after a family shopping trip in CardfShareCommentsByRuth MosalskiBradley JollyOnline journalist:,  JUL NewsMalgorzata Szymanowicz, , has spoken about how her baby daughter was kidnapped by her estranged husband \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A mum has spoken of her grief at not seeing her daughter in the flesh in seven years - ever since she was abducted by her then-husband and taken to Libya.Malgorzata Symanowicz, known as Gosia by pals, yearns to be reunited with little Talia.

The clue may help shed some light on what was largely a private day for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex with their families and friends. Just  people made the invite for the ceremony which was performed by the Archbishop of Canterbury at Windsor Castle. Two photographs were released afterwards, late on Saturday afternoon - including a family photo featuring the sisters of Harryaposs mother Diana, Princess of Wales, who died when he was  years old. But eagle-eyed royal fans noticed something more telling.    If you look closely at the Mantel Clock, you can see the time that the photo was taken is almost .am, which could suggest that Archie was christened at roughly am on Saturday. The clock itself dates back to the early th century and has been in Windsor since . It was created by Benjamin Lewis Vulliamy and first acquired by George IV. The couple have not revealed the names of Archieaposs godparents, but the presence of Lady Jane Fellowes and Lady Sarah McCorquodale may fuel speculation that they have been chosen for the role. A statement accompanying the photographs said: The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are so happy to share the joy of this day with members of the public who have been incredibly supportive since the birth of their son. They thank you for your kindness in welcoming their first born and celebrating this special moment. Their Royal Highnesses feel fortunate to have enjoyed this day with family and the godparents of Archie.    The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby baptised the two-month-old using water from the River Jordan out of the silver Lily Font, in accordance with royal tradition. The Queen was not present at the christening because of a prior engagement. She also missed Prince Louisaposs christening last year. Two images were released following the ceremony at the Private Chapel. A family photo inside the castleaposs Green Drawing Room shows Harry and Meghan sitting with their child, alongside the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duchess of Cambridge, who wore a salmon pink Stella McCartney outfit.  Standing behind them are the Prince of Wales, Meghanaposs mother Doria Ragland, the Duke of Cambridge, Lady Jane and Lady Sarah. A second shot, in black-and-white, shows Meghan, dressed in a white Dior dress, gazing into Harryaposs eyes as she cradles baby Archie - with the castleaposs Rose Garden in the background. Some well-wishers who flocked to Windsor were disappointed the ceremony was private. Anne Daley, , a keen supporter of the royals, travelled from Wales and arrived with a specially baked cake and her dog Camilla - who she had dressed in christening attire - at am on Saturday. Ms Daley said she loves everything about the royals but she was very hurt, adding: I pay a lot of tax for their civil duties.  She went on: One minute they want to be royals, the next they donapost. That baby is Princess Dianaaposs grandson. We should be able to see the christening. Harry wants it both ways. Theyaposve been ill-advised. The general public canapost work this out. Jon Loughrey, , also expressed disappointment. He said: I accept that itaposs a private ceremony in a private chapel, but the late Princess Diana would have wanted Prince Harry to be more with the people.Fashion photographer Chris Allerton, who shot the wedding photographs of Harry and Meghan, said he was honoured to take the official photographs at the christening and to once again, be part of such a special and joyous occasion. Archie wore a handmade replica of the royal christening robe created by Angela Kelly, dressmaker to the Queen. The silver baptismal Lily Font was commissioned by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in  and has been a feature of royal christenings since its use in the baptism of their first child Victoria, princess royal.A post on the Sussex Royal Instagram account said the replica robe has been worn by royal babies for the last  years."},{"url":null,"title":"how meghan markle paid tribute","story":"NewsHow Meghan Markle paid tribute to Princess Diana in Archies christening photosPrince Harry and Meghan Markle made sure Princess Dianas memory was included in their gorgeous family photo from Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsors christeningShareCommentsByZoe ForseyLestyle Editor:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video duke-duchess-sussex-released-first-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMeghan Markle and Prince Harry have paid a sweet tribute to Princess Diana with the photos from their son Archieaposs christening .

So for the playboys of the Middle East a jaunt to Britain is the perfect way to fully enjoy the trappings of their money without restriction. Princes and Sheikhs are flocking here in record numbers, a Sunday People investigation has found. And it’s not just that they can flaunt their flash motors – from £million Bugatti Veyrons to modest £, Lamborghini Aventadors.    They are attracted by our fine restaurants, top hotels, luxury shops – and high class sex workers. We entered the world of Arab playboys after the death of Prince Sheikh Khalid bin Sultan Al Qasimi – found by staff in his penthouse in London’s Knightsbridge on Monday. The -year-old fashion designer son of the ruler of Sharjah, in the United Arab Emirates, died of a suspected heart attack amid claims of a drug-fuelled orgy. Police are said to have found Class A drugs in the flat and are investigating his death – which began three days of state mourning back at home.  Our enquiries revealed a boom in bookings for sordid, secret sex parties by mega-rich Middle Eastern men – fuelled by drugs, drink and Viagra. Kat Lee – an experienced madam and escort of Arabian descent – said: “More and more rich Arab guys are coming here and booking girls. “I’ve been booked by them to a lot of really expensive apartments and penthouses in London, including parties where I’ve arrived and there have been four or five other girls there too. “The Arab men are usually quite young, in their early s to s, and they always have lots of cash in their pockets, which they just keep pulling out all night. “I always think it’s crazy how much money they have. They live better lives than footballers. “There’s usually lots of bottles of very expensive champagne and spirits, as well as ecstasy and bags and bags of cocaine. “And they always have a lot of Viagra to keep them going.”    Here, the millionaires are less likely to fall foul of strict Islamic laws. In many Arab countries, women are forced to cover themselves from head to toe and should only leave the house with a male relative or . Prostitution, alcohol and drugs are illegal and sharing a bedroom outside marriage or even holding hands in public is forbidden. And homosexuality carries the death penalty. But Kat has also travelled to Dubai for bookings with wealthy Arabs. “My usual rate when I’m in London is £-an-hour,” she revealed, “and I’ve had bookings with Arab guys go on for eight to ten hours at a time.    “Sometimes they book you for two to three days at a time. “They pay you well but don’t treat you very nice and can be really rough.” The death of Sheikh Al Qasimi this week is far from the first example of an Arab prince seemingly drawn into debauchery here. Prince Saud bin Abdulaziz bin Nasser, , was jailed in  for murdering his manservant at a London hotel after a “sadistic” campaign of violence and sexual abuse. The grandson of King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia – where homosexuality is illegal – beat and strangled Bandar Abdulaziz, after a champagne and cocktail-filled Valentine’s night out, his trial heard. He had previously ordered male escorts and combed websites for gay massage parlours and escort agencies.    He flew home in  to serve at least  years of his le sentence.That year another member of the Saudi Royal family Prince Abdulaziz Al Saud – nephew of King Salman – lost teeth and suffered bruising after being attacked by eight men following an argument at exclusive Soho club Cirque Le Soir.He had left with two women when the men – including millionaire’s son Saad Alfoudari, who had a £,-a-year tax-free job working for the Prime Minister of Kuwait – struck. Alfoudari, who was living in swanky Marylebone, central London, spent time in custody before his father paid £million to secure his bail. He later admitted affray and was fined £.    In  Kuwaiti playboy Sultan Aldabbous, , was found dead in his suite at the Dorchester after a drug binge. Coke, cannabis and date-rape drug Rohypnol were found in the married businessman’s blood and anti-depressant medication was also found beside him. Westminster’s Coroner ruled he died from a combination of cocaine and underlying heart disease. London’s luxurious Knightsbridge – dubbed Little Arabia – has always been a magnet for oil-rich visitors. Now much of it is now owned by the princes and sheikhs themselves. It’s a place where they can shop in Harrods, relax in shisha bars around Hyde Park, drink tea in friends’ five-star hotels, party with our Royals at Mahiki nightclub and tear around in supercars they’ve flown over. A place where the playboys’ partying never stops... until it’s too late for some.

But, as far as school goes, my kids are not prize-worthy, they’re pretty average, middle of the road. And there are no prizes for that. The poor things take after me. End-of-term Prize-giving Day brings back memories of never being good enough at anything. I dreaded it. I watched kids going up, being clapped and cheered – and hoped they might call my name out. But they never did. But,there is one thing le has taught me, it is that what happens to you at school does not define you for the rest of your years.    Many award winners don’t go on to become rocket scientists or signicant movers and shakers. And, for an average kid, I’d say I’ve done pretty well. But knowing all this still can’t prepare you for the pangs of injustice when your kid’s name does not get called out. I thought I was going to be one of those parents who could handle their kids not winning. But, just like my parents used to, all I can do is look over at them with a smile during the ceremony to boost their morale. But they stare back in horror with a look that says: “It’s not working, Mum, it’s making us feel worse.” And then I get disappointed that they are disappointed. I did feel the whole prize-giving thing was a bit unfair. I noticed a consistent pattern. Year on year it was the same kids who won. The ones whose parents could afford tutors after school. My mum and dad, immigrants to this country, couldn’t speak English, so could not help me much.    How was I ever going to compete with a kid whose parents not only spoke the language, but helped them with homework every night, read to them and could afford after-care clubs  So I put things right this year by surprising Zac and Amara with our own special day. I told them: “I don’t really careyou don’t get a prize this year, evenyou go through your whole school le not winning. “Mummy and Daddy never got any prizes.” Anyway, spare me the violins and I’ll spare you the rest of the speech... Afterwards, when we gave Zac a football and Amara glitter tattoos, the smile on our prize guys’ faces said it all. So for all parents with kids who never win – shower them with words of encouragement and praise. That is what will give them the confidence and self-esteem to win at le.

In October , two brothers from India sneaked onto a British Airways plane and attempted to enter the UK as stowaways. Pardeep Saini, then , and his brother Vijay, , braved temperatures of -C and as they flew at over ,ft with virtually no oxygen while hidden inside the wheel bay of the massive Boeing . The elder brother survived the treacherous flight from New Dehli to Heathrow, but sadly Vijay did not. Just hours after touchdown, astonished airport staff found Pareep Saini staggering on the runway in a state of total confusion.  He was taken to hospital where he was treated for severe hypothermia. My next memory is of being in a detention centre in Britain, where I was told my brother was dead, Pardeep later said. Vijay had quickly succumbed to the extreme conditions and died probably before the first drinks were served. His body fell ,ft to the ground as the gears of the airliner opened in preparation for landing. It was eventually recovered five days later at a disused gasworks in Richmond, Surrey. Pardeep himself had passed out just minutes after take-off as passengers and crew remained completely oblivious in the cabin above.Do you know the man involved in this story  Email webnews@trinitymirror   Mr Saini says he fled India after being accused of having links to a Sikh militant group fighting for the independence of their homeland. In desperation, the men were introduced to a people smuggler who offered to help them get into Britain. After paying £ pounds, they were then incorrectly told they could get into the luggage compartment from the wheel bay. That lie meant that they has very little to protect them for the extreme cold and wind. Once in the air, the brothers had little chance to say goodbye to each other due to deafening jet engine while the cold sent their heart-rates plummeting. The noise was terrible, said Pardeep told the Mirror just  months after his ordeal.    As the wheels came up they were glowing hot. They were burning us. The wheel house was shaking. It was like an earthquake. My whole body started feeling numb.Mr Sainiaposs story has hit the headlines again after a stowawayaposs body  plunged ,ft from a Kenya Airways jet  as it landed at  Heathrow  Airport last Tuesday.Speaking to the Mail on Sunday, he said the recent tragedy triggered memories of his own trauma and the loss of his brother. I was in a depression for six years. If the two of us died, then itaposs one thing, orboth of us lived, itaposs another story, he said. But I lost my younger brother, he was like a friend to me. We grew up playing together. He was initially threatened with deportation but after a y legal battle he was allowed to remain in the UK. Mr Sani has since married and had two sons, aged four and one. He lives in Wembley, north London and works as a driver for a catering company at Heathrow airport.  Mr Sani is one of only two people known to have survived after hiding in a planeaposs undercarriage. Experts at the time claimed that the lack of oxygen should have caused signicant brain damage. Only the very fit could hope to withstand such extremes, they claimed. But Pardeepaposs incredible story of survival came at a serious physical and mental cost. He later reported having hearing issues, joint pain as well as depression following the trauma of the event. Pardeep also said he suffered violent nightmares where he called out his dead brotheraposs name.

After the fortnight-long search yielded nothing, Detective Chief Superintendent Richard Wood, said “the case would remain open.” “She is presumed dead, and is believed to have been murdered,” Det Chief Supt Wood said. “Her body has never been found, and no-one has ever been charged as part of the investigation.    “I would like to pay tribute to Suzy’s family for their support during the Metaposs investigation into her disappearance, as well as for their courage and strength through decades of sorrow. “This latest line of enquiry must have been traumatic for them, as well as bringing them some hope that they might find out more about what happened to Suzy, but they have always been supportive of our efforts to make progress in the investigation.” Miss Lamplugh was declared dead, presumed murdered, after going missing at the age of , having left her west London offices to meet a mystery client known only as Mr Kipper. Cannan was named by police as their prime suspect in  and Miss Lamplughaposs death has remained one of the UKaposs most notorious cold cases.    Three days before her disappearance, Cannan had been released from a hostel at Wormwood Scrubs Prison, where he served a six-year sentence for rape. He was also connected to the case due to his strong resemblance to an e-fit of her abductor and, according to reports, he was nicknamed Kipper while serving his earlier sentence. Cannan is currently serving three le sentences for the  kidnap and murder of Shirley Banks, the kidnap of another woman and rape of a third. In December , it was reported that he had claimed more than £, in legal aid while in prison.

Morning frost is expected in Scotland as the mercury struggles to make its way to double figures, but most part of the UK will remain warm throughout the day. Forecasters have warned light showers developing across central, northern and eastern parts whilst the highs will drop to C last this week.

Sam, from Grimsby, north east Lincolnshire, was first introduced to the drug by her mother when she was just -years-old. That first sample of cocaine has defined her le ever since, GrimsbyLive reported. The -year-old admits she now has a £ a day habit that she funds through selling her body, theft and robbing. Her crack cocaine addiction costs her an astonishing £, a year - just over £, shy of the Prime Ministeraposs salary.    Sam said: From the age of about  or , I have always been around drugs. It started out with just weed and things, before I was introduced to crack at  by my mum who offered me a pipe one day when I was feeling down. From then on I quickly became hooked on the drug and had to find ways to make money for it. At the beginning I would steal things from shops that I would be able to sell, usually things like steaks, coffee and cheese, as well as clothesI was able to get them. Then about a year ago I started working as a prostitute, although I do still shoplt and steal. When I do steal though, I never do it in Grimsby, and will always go out of town to places like Meadow Hall where it is easier and nobody will recognise me. Because of the drug, I almost feel numb to the work that I have to do now, you are always just thinking about your next hit and how you are going to afford it.    Even though you are only high for a couple of minutes, afterwards you feel a bit dazed and separated from the world, before withdrawing into yourself. Every day I need to make about £, with the majority of that coming from working on the streets, and the rest from robbing customers or stealing. It is not something that I want to do, but when you are desperate you just do it, you donapost really even think about it. Sam speaks matter of factly about her customers. They are of all ages and backgrounds. Most are nice, some are dangerous, like the men who have thrown her out of moving cars. Thataposs the way it is, she explains. There are also those who take pity, give her money and tell her to go home. The youngest customer that I have had was just , she says. The oldest I think was , who was a lovely man. It is usually the young ones and the older ones who are the nicest, as there are some out there who can be very violent.    I have been attacked a few times, but I will always attack them back. I have been thrown out of moving cars before by men who were just bullies, and I had to slash the shoulder of one man who wouldnapost stop to let me out of the car. There are even times where men have come up to me, handed me £ and told me to go home and try and get help, because they felt that I didnapost deserve to be out here doing what I am doing. It is things like that that make me want to try and find some sort of help so that I can stop oing this, because I have my whole le ahead of me still and there is still time to do something positive, it is just very hard. Sam says the drugs which drove her to the streets are now freely available in North East Lincolnshire. Some is linked to County Lines gangs from Liverpool and more from aposlocalapos dealers.

Christine Noddings and Shirley-Anne Gray had both booked rooms at Central House, Cheltenham, to attend the funeral of a friend. However the pair of -year-olds were both shocked when they were told on the night they arrived from Essex they had to go where.Upon arrival they were told the upgrade was a three-bedroom house just aposten minutes down the roadapos, reports Gloucestershire Live.   Mrs Noddings said: We went inside and found that it was not the kind of place we wanted to stay, particularly since it only had one bathroom. Ms Gray and Mrs Noddings have to have their own bathrooms for ious reasons. God knows what the rooms at the Central Hotel were likewe had been ‘upgraded’, added Ms Gray. After the pair complained they said they were sent to another address - which turned out to be a house with people in. Ms Gray added: At this point we felt that we had been conned - not a good feeling I can tell you at  o’clock at night.      Mrs Noddings said: By this time, we were crying.  It was very dark, very wet and we had been on the road a long time and just wanted to go to bed. We were tired, we were worried and we were fed up. They ed to Central Hotel to demand their actual rooms, a refund and an explanation.    The hotel staff admitted to getting the address wrong. The women were reportedly told again that they had received an aposupgradeapos and that there was nothing that could be done. So, the pair set off again, now to another house in Gloucester Road. When they finally got to the accommodation it was pm, a full two hours after arriving at the hotel and six-and-a-half hours after setting off from home. The two women discovered that the apartment was up three flights of stairs and that they would have to heave all their luggage up there.    The next day, the exhausted women were late to the funeral by  minutes. The two women had worked together with their late friend  years ago in admin, so this was an emotional time for them, they said Central Hotel were dismissive of the womenaposs complaints by email, said the pair.  A manager emailed them: I am sorry to hear you were unhappy with your upgrade however we had upgraded you as a good will gesture and the reason behind this is because usually when we upgrade our guests we have outstanding reviews because of this. Unfortunately in these circumstances, I would like to apologise that you were unsatisfied with your upgrade. The manager added thatthe women had rung the -hour help line their query would have been answered and they would have found the correct address. Their request of a refund was refused. Booking initially offered the pair £ in compensation but later changed its stance. Mrs Noddings said: The £ was an insult to be honest.

The next day the small townaposs local paper reported that a Flying Saucer had been captured by the Roswell Army Airfield and one of the worldaposs most enduring conspiracy theories was born. The rumour that an alien craft had crash landed in Roswell even seemed to be backed up by the authorities. The official Air Force press release reported that a flying disc had been recovered. And ever since, the most famous aposalienapos landing has captured the imaginations of conspiacy theorists across the globe.  Despite the US military insisting the object was nothing more than a normal weather balloon that had crash landed, the rumours wouldnapost die down. The Roswell incident has inspired a countless stream of films, TV shows, blogs, fake videos and theories. And the US government did very little to pour water on these theories until the late s. Only then did the military publish two reports containing the apostruthapos about what landed at Roswell. It was a nuclear test surveillance balloon from Project Mogul, a top secret operation to detect sound waves from Soviet atomic bomb tests. But there are many who donapost believe the official explanation and claim what really landed at Roswell on July   years ago was much more sinister.  Alien autopsy Almost  years after the incident a video of a supposed alien autopsy emerged. The grainy black and white footage seemed to show an extraterrestrial being. The film was released by London-based businessman, Ray Santilli, who claimed it had been given to him by a retired military cameraman. It was a bombshell and spawned countless documentaries and theories. However,  years later Santilli admitted the whole thing had been a fake. UFOs and Hitler It has been claimed that the object was in fact part of a project to test Nazi flying machine technology. People who believe this theory say a craft called The Bell, which was propelled with electric particles was being taken out for test flights at the site.  It has been claimed the technology behind the air craft had been the peak of Hitleraposs plans for world domination and it was still so sensitive it had to be kept secret - even today. German engineer, George Klein, said: I donapost consider myself a crackpot or eccentric or someone given to fantasties. This is what I saw with my own eyes - a Nazi UFO. Nuclear cover up The first mainstream conspiracy book to be published about the events at Roswell hit the shelves in . The Roswell Incident claimed an alien aircraft had been flying over the desert, observing US nuclear weapons activity. But while it was carrying out this covert mission, it was hit by lightning and crashed, killed the unknown creatures on board. Authors Charles Berlitz and William Moore insisted they had interviewed more than  witnesses and the event had remained secret because of a government cover up.  Two crash sites and aliens in custody The book Crash At Corona claims there was not one crash at Roswell but two - with a second flying saucer also hitting the earth. Authors Stanton Friedman and Don Berliner also claimed in the book that two aliens had been found alive and were now in the custody of the US government. Corporate aliens One of the wilder claims, which has been largely discredited, claims the materials pulled from the crash site were given to private industryu. Written by US Army Colonel Philip J Corso, the book claimed he had been conscripted into a top secret government programme involved in retrieving the debris from the crash. Corso also claimed the world was at war with alients but that earth was winning the battle.  Underground alien battle Witnesses have even come forward to claim that there was a huge battle between US special forces and extraterrestrials. Theorists say the aliens had set up a massive underground camp and that as many as  troops and locals were killed in the huge firefighter. Civil engineer Phil Schneider made the claims after he says he was himself confronted by the Alien Greys and managed to shoot two of them to death. Egg-shaped aircraft Retired Special Agent Richard Doty has not only claimed alients DID land at Roswell but also claims he knows exactly what was found. In the Netflix documentary Unacknowledge, Richard says the craft the ETaposs landed in was egg-shaped and that aliens were found inside. He said they were around feet tall and, while several were badly injured, there were survivors.

I know what I have here and I work well with the staff.“I know how big a club this is and I am really happy to be here.“And what is important for me is I want to be one of those players who go in the history books of this club and say he was one who got promotion for the team.“I want to improve and learn every week. As a team I think we got better last season as the games continued and I think I got better as a goalkeeper.“We want to keep doing that this year and,we do, we will get back to where we want to be.“Everybody knows where this club belongs and everybody wants to be part of achieving that ultimate goal of getting promoted.“That’s a big point of incentive and motivation for all the players.”Siegrist admits a bonus for him as he ed to work last week was teaming up again in training with fellow-goalie Deniz Mehmet.He was at United until January and has ed with a view to signing up again.“We crossed paths before when we were younger, at international tournaments with Switzerland and Turkey.“Coming from clubs down south we also faced each other. We are competing for the same place but there is always the goalkeepers’ union that means we stick together and it is nice to be working every day with someone you like.”Very much one for looking forward, Siegrist refuses to dwell too long on the disappointing end to last term that saw United again miss out on promotion in the play-offs.And when he does look back, he takes the positives.“I think what happened last year is part of our motivation for this year but I don’t want to speak too much about it because we start from zero again for a new season.“You do every year. In terms of experience it is good that we have had big games, big occasions together and that will help us.“It is like money in the bank but this season is about doing it consistently and picking up points over the whole of the year.”Tonight sees the start of a busy weekend when the entire squad will be involved in a friendly at Brechin before heading for Dumbarton tomorrow to do it all again.Two games in less than  hours may seem unusual but, for Siegrist, it will be the perfect way to prepare for the start of the competitive action in the Betfred Cup at Hearts next week.“So far as fitness goes we are good and game time is the most valuable time you have as a player,” he added.“You can train all week butyou don’t have a game at the end of it you are not bringing everything you’ve worked on together.“It is good to have as many games as we can so we are looking forward to these two games.“There is a lot more to football than passing and running, so game time is the most valuable part of pre-season.”"},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-do-you-recognise-any-of-these-old-photographs-of-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-do-you-recognise-any-of-these-old-photographs-of-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-how-many-of-these-old-photos-of-glasgow-do-you-remember","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"watch-moment-angus-woman-zoe-archibald-gets-stuck-in-toy-car","story":"THIS is the hilarious moment a Scotswoman got stuck in a childrens toy car -

The lane floods, so between trying to dodge puddles, you land in dog dirt.I wish they would fix the path because a lot of people use it, some of them pensioners with or parents with prams.Celia MacFarlane, Lochgilphead.Sir,Seven out of ten people with diabetes feel overwhelmed by the demands of their condition and this signicantly affects their mental and physical health.That is why we are calling for new national standards for diabetes emotional and mental health support and to increase support available in Argyll to people living with diabetes.As part of Diabetes UK’s Diabetes Weekwe are urging people in Argyll to #SeeDiabetesDferently and back our campaign for national standards for diabetes mental health support and services.Our recently published research revealed the relentless nature of diabetes can impact people’s emotional well-being and mental health, ranging from day-to-day frustration and low mood, to specic psychological and mental health dficulties including clinical depression and anxiety.The findings, published in the report #Too often missing: Making emotional and psychological support routine in diabetes care#, show that diabetes is much more than a physical condition – and that emotional and psychological demands of living with diabetes should be recognised and support provided.Diabetes Scotland is urgently calling on the NHS to create national standards for diabetes emotional and mental health services. These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"monsters and magic come to lochgilphead booksigning","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead#s Argyll Book Centre is holding a book signing with Lari Don.The Secret of the Kelpie author will be in the indie book shop on Saturday June  to read her new book to eager ears and talk to readers about their favourite folk tales and inventing monsters.After a quick break, Lari willto read excerpts from her spellbinding Spellchasers trilogy to inspire you to imagine magical adventures of your own and tell one of your favourite myths.Born in Chile, Lari Don was brought up in Scotland where she has worked in politics and for the BBC.

Training up more drone pilots means the Mountain Rescue service now has greater capacity to assist in rescues all over Scotland.Drones are increasingly used in searches for people missing in the mountains but the service is also looking at innovations, such as using them as communication hubs in areas where therersquos poor or no signals.Dave Wright, Team Leader at Tweed Valley Mountain Rescue, said: ldquoAs a volunteer service the Tweed Valley Mountain Rescue team are totally reliant on the support of both the iniduals who give up their time but also to companies like Openreach who support volunteering.ldquoWithout the dedication of our volunteers and the backing of their employers we would not be able to provide this vital emergency service in our community.Openreach is one of the UKrsquos biggest employers of veterans and reservists, with around , in total and more than , ex-service personnel recruited since .It has nearly  active reservists, around  of whom are also part of the British Armyrsquos  Signal Squadron."},{"url":null,"title":"wake-me-up-before-you-go-go-to-hawick","story":"FANS of George Michael and Wham! are in for a treat next week.The George Michael Story is coming to Hawick Town Hall.With a live band and video screens supporting the show, including video footage of George and interviews with the man himself, The George Michael Story starts with George in the Wham! days in the early s and moves onto the Grammy Award-winning Faith -

It will be an eyesore.Philip Neaves, from Edinburgh-based Felsham Planning and Development, spoke on behalf of Rural Renaissance.He said: ldquoThe Croft is an allocated development site that was allocated in .ldquoThe reporter who allocated the site would have been well aware of the sensitivity of the site but has still allocated it.ldquoWhat we have is proposals for  houses for private sale and seven affordable housing units.ldquoThe site, when viewed from Melrose, appears as part of the settlement, not the countryside, and views of the site from the Eildons are limited.ldquoThere are signicant economic benefits to the development, not just for employment during the construction phase but for nearby residents as well.Nearly all of the councillors expressed reservations about the development, but only one, Galashiels councillor Sandy Aitchison, voted against the proposals.He told the committee: ldquoThe fact is the reporter has made a big mistake here and the land should never have been allocated for housing in the first place.ldquoFurthermore, I donrsquot like the fact wersquove got affordable housing as a token gesture, itrsquos not spread out in the site and there are no family homes.\"Do people who need affordable homes not have families ldquoThere are so many objections. Many are from where and they are asking us to step in and protect this site which we as a local authority are charged with protecting.ldquoI really object to this application for a number of reasons.Melrose and Leaderdale councillor Tom Miers, who chairs the committee, also criticised the proposals but said he believes it can be acceptedthe council imposes certain planning conditions: ldquoI have real problems with the design and concept. I think the houses at the back are much too high and they stick out too much.ldquoThe middle three in particular, which will be at the back of the site, should be reduced in height.He suggested that the houses be reduced, by way of a planning condition, from three storey houses down to two storey.All councillors except councillor Aitchison were in agreement, and as he failed to find a seconder for his motion to reject the application, the proposals were granted planning permission without the need for a vote.Speaking after the meeting, Ms Henderson said: ldquoOver  people objected to this development and yet in the end it felt like their opinion counted for nothing. Todayrsquos decision is obviously a huge disappointment for them.ldquoUnfortunately, the planning committee couldnrsquot, or wouldnrsquot, see past the fact that this site is in the local plan.ldquoThe arguments we put forward that the proposal for the Croft is sub-standard and would irrevocably scar the view of the Eildons fell on completely deaf ears and the committee happily waved it through.ldquoFuture generations will look back and wonder how it was possible that a housing estate was ever allowed to be built on the beautul Eildons. But by then, of course, it will be too late.ldquoThe members of the planning committee, bar the one councillor who objected, should be ashamed of themselves for the decision they made today."},{"url":null,"title":"homophobic-selkirk-man-ordered-to-pay-compensation-to-couple","story":"A LABOURER from Selkirk has admitted hurling homophobic abuse towards two men.Then a month later Andrew Gillie approached both and told themthey didnt drop charges he would kill them.The -year-old of Buccleuch Road, pleaded guilty at the towns sherf court to behaving in a threatening or abusive manner and making abusive and homophobic comments in Yarrow Terrace, Selkirk, on August .He also admitted a charge of threatening the two men in Bridge Street, Selkirk, on September .Procurator fiscal Graham Fraser said the first incident happened at .pm when the two men, who are in a relationship with each other, became aware of Gillie and a female standing on a pavement.Gillie made a homophobic comment about one of the men.Mr Fraser said: \"He is fed up being targeted about his sexuality and was alarmed at what had taken place.\"The fiscal said Gillie had been cautioned and charged over that but came across the two men at about .pm on September  when they were walking their dog.Mr Fraser said: \"He said you better drop the charges or I will kill you.

Five minutes in a car can cover a distance which would represent a fairly long walk.Itrsquos kind of a simple principle, I know, but one I sometimes forget, as I did a couple of weekends ago. We set off from an event at Amisfield Walled Garden for a walk. My idea was to walk along the River Tyne to Hailes Castle and thenndash by car a -minute round trip.We had some supplies in the form of fruit in my bag and a little water. It was a sunny and warm day and so we set off on our adventure.We began the walk at the old Abbey Bridge which spans the Tyne close to Amisfield. As you walk under its ancient ribbed arches of this late medieval bridge, you get a real sense of its age and the beauty of its construction.The path beyond follows the river and it is almost impossible now to imagine that a great abbey once stood here, with connections to the infant Mary Queen of Scots. A ruined old mill of later centuries still stands here. I reflected on the stories of this location: a courageous nun who defied a flood in the th century and a gruesome murder in the th century and just visible in the near distance the old graveyard, now ringed with trees and almost unrecognisable as a resting place for the dead.A labourer once thought he saw a ghost at the graveyard, but it proved to be something , and I had a wry smile at that tale of a drunken evening over  years ago. These are all tales I have already told here, but they entered my head as we wandered to the gate that led along the northern bank of the river.Hailes Castle is on the southern bank of the river and I knew that there was a bridge that would takes us over. So we set off to find the bridge.But it took us over four hours.It was a stunning walk, with wild flowers and trees decorating the riverbank almost all the way. A grey heron seemed to follow us perhaps he was warning us that the walk was longer than Irsquod anticipated.It is a walk decorated with history too, of course. A stone in the corner of the field by the first gate caught my eye. Deeply ingrained groove marks on it intrigued me. I was later told that it could be the marks of a plough, as the tips of the plough have scraped over the stone a ploughman unwittingly leaving evidence of his unrecorded toil.Halfway along the walk we arrived at the small hamlet of Sandyrsquos Mill. The cottages and mill itself have been beautully restored. The th-century mill still has its waterwheel, although itrsquos now embedded in silt. The mill ceased working  years ago and was transformed into a residential property, but with much of the old machinery inside still intact. It appears to be a very sympathetic and sensitive restoration.It was beyond Sandyrsquos Mill that the distance began to take its toll. The young kids were tired and desperately looking for the bridge. I spotted Traprain Law some distance away and realised that I had badly misjudged the distance and time it would take with wee ones. We had to sit and have a rest and story, with that grey heron listening, to gather the energy to continue.The kids didnrsquot complain much as we wandered along the still-beautul path, now desperately looking for the bridge. As we had rested wersquod phoned for friends to come and lsquorescuersquo us at Hailes Castle with chocolate and water, and we knew they were there waiting for us.Irsquove never been quite so pleased to see Hailes Castle. It loomed suddenly from across the river. I had never approached it from this direction and it certainly did its best to impress. The bridge was just a wee way further and we finally crossed it with a sense of relief.When we arrived at the castle, the kids devoured the chocolate and water, in a way that reminded me of a scene in the movie Ice Cold in Alex. Thank goodness for good friends.Wersquod made it and what a sense of adventure ndash and an achievement!I sat with the kids and told stories as my we went with the friends to retrieve our car. Hailes Castle drips with history but they wanted tales about giants.The day was a lesson for me: to think more carefully about distance when setting on a walk! I thoroughly recommend the path, especially on a lovely summerrsquos day. But itrsquos going to take half a dayyou have kids. So prepare for that!Unbelievably, the kids later wanted to go to a playpark. ldquoWhere do they get the energy  my we asked.ldquoFrom us! I replied!"},{"url":null,"title":"hopes-of-seeing-railway-station-return-to-haddington","story":"RAGESmet with Peter Brett Associates ndash a leading consultancy of engineers and planners ndash to outline the case for improved transports links to and from East Lothian.One of the more ambitious plans was to see theof a railway station to Haddington.Residents of the town have not been served by a railway station since , with the station closing to freight nearly  years later.However, RAGES feels there could still be a possibility of a station ing to the town ndash though the group acknowledged that work needed to be done.A spokesman for the group said: ldquoRAGES expressed its preference for re-opening of the Haddington branch, ideally to the previous terminus on Station Road.ldquoMinimal compulsory purchase relocation of existing industrial units would be required the biggest physical obstacle would be the reconstruction of the A overbridge which was unwisely built without preserving the railway alignment and loading gauge.ldquoA level crossing would be required at Gateside, failing which an alternative road access could be provided for the new houses on the north side of the line onto the A.There was also a suggestion of creating car parking and even a park and ride facility in the town to serve the new service, which would link the town with Edinburgh.The spokesman added: ldquoAs insufficient parking exists at Station Road , a park and ride station at Oak Tree would be essential, which could also serve the substantial Letham Mains and Gateside developments.ldquoJust east of where the A crosses the railway formation, there is a large rectangular piece of ground, occupied only by scrub, which would be suitable as a car park.ldquoAs only single track would suffice between Longniddry and Haddington, it would be possible to retain a footpath cycleway as the line was originally provided with double track throughout.ldquoAn electric train service from Haddington to Edinburgh would provide the speed and capacity which road transport ndash car or bus ndash cannot match.

It is better than some human beings are treated ndash that is the sad truth.Mr Farnsworth was presenting an annual report on the racecoursersquos performance over the last financial year.The Beast from the East snow storm, an outbreak of equine influenza, and a long spell of dry weather all contributed to what he described as one of the worst years the course had been through in his memory.A number of key fixtures were cancelled and profits fell.In December, four horses died during one day of racing at the course but a subsequent review by the British Horseracing Authority ruled that the course and race organisers were not at fault.Councillor Gordon Mackett asked Mr Farnsworththe racecourse had been affected by animal welfare concerns.The course manager said: ldquoWe did have a horrible day when there were four fatalities however, these were all completely separate incidents.ldquoIn a sport like this you will get injuries and fatalities from time to time. It is horric for the people involved.Mr Farnsworth said that the public were becoming more aware of incidents like these through social media which, he said, ldquofuelled the debate around animal welfare.However, he said there had been no indication that it had had an impact on events at Musselburgh, which saw record crowds at its Easter Day racing this year and another sell-out Ladies Day.His report to the committee revealed that the racecourse had reported a loss over the last financial year after it paid over pound, of legal costs relating to the ongoing process by East Lothian Council to find new third-party operators to run the course.Councillor Kenny McLeod questioned why the costs were being met by the course and not the council itself.However, depute chief executive of the council Alex McCrorie told the councillor that the costs were charged to the racecourse because when the new operator was procured it would be the racecourse that benefitted.He conceded to Mr McLeod that, without the legal costs being taken from the coursersquos funds, it would have been in profit last year.East Lothian Council replaced the previous governance committee which oversaw the running of the course with a new committee last year after relations between members of the old committee badly deteriorated and the British Horseracing Authoritythreatening to suspend its racing licence.The new Musselburgh Racing Associated Committeendash which is made up of four elected councillors and two representatives of the racing industry, currently members of Lothians Racing Syndicate ndash has been overseeing the hunt for a new operator.However, the BHA has only granted temporary licences and extensions under the new committee as it continues to monitor its performance.Mr Farnsworth said that the introduction of the new interim committee had caused some problems too.

Here is my version of the story, which I have titled lsquoThe Riddle Rulersquo:IT WAS to be the final race of the tournament. The two knights had been equally matched, and now they would race each other for the prize of a gold cup filled with gold coins.There was an air of excitement as the crowds gathered for this race. Sir John and Sir Harry arrived together, each mounted on their stallions. Sir Johnrsquos horse was called Lightning, while Sir Harryrsquos horse was named Spear.They were equally matched, both knights had won an equal amount of races, and both had won against each other. There was no favourite, everyone knew this race would be very close.The atmosphere was electric with anticipation.Then the kingrsquos storyteller leaned over to whisper in the kingrsquos ear: ldquoYour majesty, this race is the last of the tournament. I feel it should be a race with an extra challenge, so that the crowd are better pleased.The king agreed, but asked the storyteller what he thought the extra challenge should be.ldquoThe race should be a test of the knightsrsquo wits as well as their riding ability, replied the storyteller. ldquoSet them a riddle rule and see how they solve it.ldquoAnd what is the riddle rule to be  asked the king.The storyteller smiled: ldquoDeclare the rules of this race to be thus: the horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and coins for its owner.And so the king declared the riddle rule just before the beginning of the race: ldquoThe horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and gold for its owner.There was a murmuring amongst the spectators. The knights looked at each other, thinking.When the starter flag was lowered and the king cried ldquogo, both knights stayed at the starting line. ldquoYou go first, said Sir John to Sir Harry. ldquoNo, after you, said Sir Harry to Sir John. But neither knight was willing to leave the start line lest they be deemed to be first.Soon there were boos and clapping from the crowd, but the prize was too great for either knight to risk going first.ldquoThis race is no fun, said the king to the storyteller, annoyed now that hersquod agreed to the change in rules.ldquoGive them until this afternoon to find a way to race, replied the storyteller, ldquothere is a way but they must discover it. It will challenge their wits and also their riding skills.And so the king stood: ldquoThe race is postponed until pm this afternoon. The knights must find a way to race to the riddle rule, otherwise the prize will be forfeited.For the rest of the day there was an excited buzz as people began to discuss possible solutions to the riddle rule with the knights.ldquoWhy donrsquot you agree to cross the finish line together  was one suggestionldquoBut then they would be equal first and the prize would be lost, commented another.ldquoBesides, said Sir John, ldquoI do not trust Sir Harry not to pull his horse back at the last moment. ldquoI do not trust you either, said Sir Harry.The deadline was fast approaching and no solution to the riddle rule had been found.ldquoPerhaps being first is more important than winning the gold, said an old woman.The knights looked at each other, thinking about this. Then they both said ldquonaw and shook their heads.It was  minutes before the race and a child came up to the knights and said: ldquoI have an idea. Everyone looked down at the child and laughed. How could a poor child know the answer when the knights themselves and all the spectators were scunnered But the storyteller was walking by and overheard the laughter. ldquoChildrenrsquos wisdom is not to be laughed at, he scolded them.And so the knights asked the child for the solution.The child said two words to the knights.In a flash, the knights got mounted and prepared to race. When the starter flag was lowered and the king shouted ldquogo, both Sir John and Sir Harry raced as fast as they could, each being desperate to be first across the finish line. Their riding skills were well challenged by this race.Who won does not matter in this story. What matters are the two words that were said by the child.

I certainly do not underestimate the scale of the challenge it faces. But I am optimistic about its future.Mrs May was speaking to party activists in Stirling about strengthening the Union after  years of devolution, announcing a review of how UK Government departments could do so led by former Scotland Office minister Lord Andrew Dunlop.She said: ldquoToday, the only threat to devolution comes from those parties who want to end it by breaking up the United Kingdom.ldquoFor those of us who believe in the Union, devolution is the accepted and permanent constitutional expression of the unique multinational character of our Union.ldquoIt was ironic that the UK Governmentrsquos sincere efforts to ensure that Brexit had no unintended consequences for the UKrsquos internal market was dismissed as a lsquopower-grabrsquo by the SNP.ldquoA UK Government which had enthusiastically launched and implemented the Smith and Silk Commissions ndash transferring sweeping powers over tax and welfare - stood accused of using Brexit as the cloak behind which to claw-back powers over food labelling and fertiliser regulations. On one level the allegation is simply absurd.ldquoOn another, it highlights a challenge which faces the UK Government as it seeks to act in the best interests of the whole UK. Whereas the UK Government is invested in the success of devolution, it would suit the political aspirations of the present Scottish Government for devolution to fail, or to be seen to fail.She repeatedly cited the pledge by Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon that the  independence referendum would be a once in a generation or once in a letime decision.She said: ldquoIf a majority had supported independence, the UK Government would have accepted that result ndash no question. But the people of Scotland did not vote for independence.ldquoA clear and decisive majority of ten percentage points gave the Union their backing and their decision should be respected.ldquoSo when Nicola Sturgeon requested of the UK Government in  the power to legislate for a second independence referendum, just three years after that historic vote, I had no hesitation in firmly saying lsquonorsquo.

I refer to Keith Howell .There is never anything substantive or consequential about his approach. For example, it can come as no surprise that the SNP regards devolution as a stepping stone towards independence ndash that is the target, not, as Mr Howell claims, the break-up of the UK. Goodness me, currently there are plenty of iniduals within the Unionist cause who are streaks ahead of the SNP on that front. Regarding alleged SNP failures, these are replicated in spades in the public sector south of the Border ndash and we are thirled to what happens there.Mr Howell repeats endlessly the flaws the SNP has, but never promotes any other cause, or any alternative party as an improvement. He does not realise that in criticising the SNP in the way he does, he demeans the integrity of the majority of Scots who troop out in election after election, to vote SNP in numbers unachievable by any other party. For example, at Westminster, the Scottish Conservatives have a desultory  MPs out of , while the SNP have  ndash nearly three times that number. The Tories are going nowheretheir sole purpose is to obsess about ldquoindependence or ldquoseparation ndash  times in a single electoral leaflet ndash as they did, with no reference whatsoever to what their vision is for Scotland under a Conservative regime. Perhaps Mr Howell could help them out with his own solutions to their dilemma. The problem he, and they, have is that this parish council of Holyroodrequires full independence ndash in the same way that factions in England are now claiming that Brexit delivers its independence.

Women are in line for an average payment of pound,.However, the disputed pay structure is still in place and the GMB, which represents many of the staff, is helping female workers put in a new wave of claims.Smithrsquos GMB union was criticised in previous years for not doing enough to help the female workers, but his appointment in  led to a rethink and his colleagues have since vigorously represented the women.Speaking to the Herald on Sunday, Smith said the poundm may only be the beginning for the council:ldquoThe women are still being discriminated against in Glasgow because there is not a new pay and grading structure in place. For every second these women are at work they are losing out.ldquoAs new people are employed by the council, as soon as they start, many of them are going to have claims against the council as well. The council is paying out pound-plus million, and it is immediately racking up the credit card bill again.He put a figure on what the new bill may come to: ldquoBy  the city council will need to find at least another pound million to fully settle its historic sex discrimination against its employees and it will need to implement a new job evaluation system to address that discrimination once and for all.Smith is worried that Glasgow may fail to pay its bills: ldquoI donrsquot know, in real terms,cities can go bankrupt in the UK, but to all intents and purposes Glasgow is going to run out of money. If you want to call that bankruptcy, fine.\"At some point, the Scottish Government is going to have to step in. You cannot keep remortgaging all the buildings in Glasgow. You canrsquot keep cutting services.\"ldquoThere is a precedent for cities going bust where in the world. I donrsquot think you can let Scotlandrsquos biggest city go bankrupt, but something has got to be done to reverse the decline of Glasgow and, once and for all, sort out the debts.The SNP currently runs the council, but Smith says the political blame predates Nationalist control: ldquoYou have got an administration now that is dealing with generations of mismanagement. You cannot heap all the blame on the current political administration, but there is no easy way out of this.However, he is angry that council officials who he regards as responsible for past mistakes are still in post.ldquoOn the face of it, it feels like the people who were there when we got into this mess are still there now.

This will join other international treaties protecting our planet. But the Doomsday Clock, set by a group of eminent scientists, now stands closer than ever at two minutes to apocalypse. The combined threats of nuclear Armageddon and climate change are the reasons given for this alarming warning.So what can be done : The nine nuclear powers must renounce their weapons. The entire Southern Hemisphere, except for Australia which prioritises trade with the US, backed the framing of the TPNW. South Africa gave up its nuclear arms and, as far as I know, none of the nuclear free south is living in fear of ldquothe bomb.We are a sitting target in Scotland for whoever panics first. We must either become independent from Westminster or convince them of the danger and outdated concept of these weapons and get them to raty this vital new TPNW.: When the nuclear-armed countries renounce their weapons they can stop bankrupting themselves and instead spend these billions on combatting climate change. A win-win policy.The advanced scientic and engineering talents of those designing atomic weapons could be turned to methods of storing and developing renewable energy, with no loss of jobs. In the UK, just imagine how our lives could be transformed by the pound billion being spent to renew our nuclear arsenal, and the fortunes spent annually to store nuclear submarines until a method can found to dispose of them safely.Our regular armed forces could use their skills to give emergency assistance for areas affected by fire, flood, tsunamis, war etc. Humanitarian actions could keep the UK as an important player in the world rather than harking back to old and not very pleasant days of glory.: Everyone can do something, however small, to stop the destruction of our environment.

Whoever these colleagues may be, they are in a very small minority.Hard evidence abounds for global warming ndash what Dr Cameron presumably doubts is that it is due to human activity. Herersquos a hard fact: the UK Met Office has stated that the recent heatwave was made  times more likely due to human-induced climate change.Your readers may also be interested to know that our weather forecasts will soon contain information as to whether or not weather events can be put down to human-made climate change.

Yes, and there are fairies at the bottom of my garden.Wait a minute ndash it takes over five years for a doctor to qualy and the NHS crisis is now. All students living in Scotland and those from the EU get free tuition whereas those from the rest of the UK have to pay. Free education for EU students alone has cost more than pound billion.If they want doctors and others to stay, including EU students, then politicians should state that since Scottish taxpayers are funding them they must legally agree to work in Scotland for five years. No agreement, no free tuition. NHS and skilled workforce ndash problem solved.Clark CrossLinlithgowReform EU, donrsquot reject itWhen they surveyed the devastated landscape of Europe after the Second World War, visionaries were resolved on one thing: never again. No more war. So the European Union was formed. Its primarywas to prevent war, and in this it has succeeded. War as a means of solving inter-state disputes has been abolished over a signicant part of the world. A huge achievement for humankind.Thus, historically, it was not a capitalist cabal created to oppress the working class, as claimed by doctrinaire Marxists. On the contrary, it has enacted rafts of legislation to enshrined workersrsquo rights in law. Admittedly, the rebarbative neoliberalism of Thatcherhas lately seeped into its thinking. The treatment of Greece was appalling, as was its silence during Spanish brutality in Catalonia.It urgently needs renewal and reformation ndash not rejection.Brian QuailGlasgowWhere does the responsibility lie Reader Allan Sutherland highlights problems in Scottish Government ITThe problems he highlights are, in fact, widespread across the UK public sector and, in my opinion, outsourcing is a major factor in this.Outsourcing IT can be justiable, but whereas activity can be outsourced, responsibility cannot. Whenever an IT system development or IT infrastructure maintenance is outsourced, the ldquocustomer organisation needs to manage the contract. This requires having staff who understand the technical and contractual issues. Unfortunately, in the UK, most such staff now work for the contractor organisations ndash which can ldquorun rings around the customer. Sadly, most public-sector organisations are out of their depth when it comes to managing IT and the contractors take full advantage.It could make an interesting articleThe Herald on Sunday contacted every public-sector organisation, local and national, asked who was responsible for IT, and ascertained what real IT experience existed within the organisation. I suspect you would find them ldquoevasive.Incidentally, although Mr Sutherlandrsquos letter is written from a Scottish Government IT perspective, he mentions ldquoundelivered broadband promises. The rollout of broadband is a UK Government responsibility. Their policy is to leave it to commercial companies to make the required investment. However, where there may be no prospect of aon any investment, eg in rural areas, they may consider government funding. They have no objection to the Scottish Government, local government or community groups funding the rollout, but responsibility remains at Westminster.Douglas MortonLanarkDystopia in tartan The First Minister claims, loftily, that Theresa Mayrsquos legacy will be the destruction of the UK.Her and her own partyrsquos legacy will be much worse, whatever the future constitutional situation may be.She will have presided over the descent of Scotland into a nationalist-run, paranoia-ridden, country, with the people split asunder, where flag-waving zealots parading the streets of our major cities are now a regular feature and where those daring to disagree with the ruling party are pilloried by the lsquorsquobelievers\".Nineteen Eighty-Four in tartan.Alexander McKayEdinburghI am sure Boris Johnson will be chortling with glee at the praise from Martin Redfern,he ever reads it SNP, The Herald on Sunday, June .Judging from Mr Redfernrsquos comments, he regards Brexit as a good thing and betrays a ldquoLondon knows best attitude as the UK, as it is at present, ignores the dire warnings of economic chaos for Britain, including Scotland, with the idea ldquoit will be all right on the night.He reserves his venom for Nicola Sturgeon, saying she is making hay while the sun shines, when in fact she is looking for a solution in a crowded sector of incompetence the performance of Theresa Mayrsquos Cabinet was dire ndash pound million for a company with no ships in a port with no facilities, was just one example.Mr Redfern is further mocked by Johnsonrsquos declaration that Westminster is Englandrsquos Parliament, a fact I noted when I joined the SNP over  years ago.Jim LynchEdinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"science-fiction-become-science-fact","story":"Itrsquos the th anniversary of George Orwellrsquos Nineteen Eighty-Four ndash a book which predicted so much of the darker side of modern le. Here Writer at Large Neil Mackay looks at how science fiction has often become science factBIG Brother, thoughtcrime, Newspeak, the two minutes hate. When George Orwellrsquos Nineteen Eighty-Four was published  years ago this summer his terrying fictional vision of a totalitarian future was just that ndash fiction. Today, though, the book, which Orwell wrote in the last months of his le on the Isle of Jura, has become frighteningly true.Orwell was able to predict with chilling prescience the future in which we now live ndash just as so many writers and film-makers have, from EM Forster foretelling the internet to Star Trek envisioning mobile phones. Once a writer imagines the future, itrsquos not long before scientists, politicians or society at large turns it into a reality.Big Brother and ... the telescreenOrwellrsquos most chillingly accurate prophesy was the telescreen ndash a combined TV, security camera and listening device in the home of every citizen. From CCTV and facial recognition technology to the Alexa Amazon device and big data, modern society has accepted almost unquestioningly the right of the state to observe us and companies to harvest information about us. Itrsquos hardly surprising that one of the most popular reality TV shows called itself Big Brother ndash and pandered to our voyeuristic desire to watch and control others.Big Brother was, of course, the dictator who ran the Britain of Nineteen Eighty-Four ndash where poster warned ldquoBig Brother is Watching You.The two minutes hate and thoughtcrimeEvery day, citizens in the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four gather to unleash two minutes of hate against perceived enemies of the state who have committed the offence of thoughtcrime ndash of thinking ideas they should not have been thinking. Offenders are rounded up by the thought police.It sounds very like a social media storm where unlucky victims are pilloried for daring to say something deemed offensive. Think of the actor Matt Damon who said this during the height of the MeToo movement: ldquoTherersquos a dference between patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation. Both of those behaviours need to be confronted and eradicated without question, but they shouldnrsquot be conflated. His words, though true, were subject to outrage.NewspeakIn , language is twisted and manipulated by the state to control the people. So a concentration camp becomes a ldquojoycamp, the Ministry of Truth is really the Ministry of Propaganda. Politicians today use their own form of Newspeak to befuddle the people and twist reality ndash think of phrases like ldquocollateral damage to describe civilian casualties of war.The Machine Stops and ... the internetThe Machine Stops was written by EM Forster in . In the tale, obese humans live underground dependent on ldquothe machine ndash which provides for all needs and entertainment. Humans speak to each other via a kind of text messaging and internet service within the machine.Humans barely move or interact ndash no-one cares about the natural world. In the end, the machine stops and what passes for ldquocivilisation stops with it.Minority Report and ... personalised advertsYou know how creepy it is when yoursquove browsed some book online and then adverts for the same product pop up everywhere you look on the web  Welcome to Minority Report.In the  film, inspired by a Philip K Dick story, technology has advanced so far that it can predict crimes yet to be committed. Businesses can scan a personrsquos mind and display bespoke adverts on billboards just for them. Today, General Motors has already created billboards that change according to the car you are driving.Minority Report also saw Tom Cruise using touch screens ndash pinching, pulling and swiping ndash long before such technology was a reality.Star Trek and ... pretty much everythingldquoEnterprise, this is Captain Kirk, come in Enterprise.On Star Trek, crew members have a communicator ndash a clever little gizmo that fits snuggly in your hand and lets you talk to anyone, anywhere. Itrsquos also a GPS device. Pretty much your prototype mobile phone in the s. Star Trek also had a ldquoreplicator ndash technology that could build anything you wanted. In effect, creator Gene Roddenberry was predicting the D printer.If thatrsquos not enough future predictions, Star Trek also imagined the iPad. Programme-makers even called it a PADD or personal access display device. Creepily prescient. Other predictions in Star Trek include Bluetooth ndash remember Uhurursquos big earpiece  ndash Google Glasses and virtual medical diagnoses.Blade Runner and ... the rise of ChinaThe Los Angeles of the future seen in Ridley Scottrsquos  movie looks like a Chinese supercity of today ndash ironically, the film was set in the year . In the movie, Chinese and Asian culture is on the rise. Adverts feature Chinese goods and celebrities . LA residents speak a mix of English and Asian languages. Today, Mandarin is predicted by many linguists to overtake English as the international language one day.Blade Runner, like a number of other movies including Total Recall, also envisions a future where space has been privatised. Companies like Elon Muskrsquos SpaceX are currently trying to carve up the cosmos for corporations ndash something which would have horried Philip K Dick, who wrote the short story Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep  which inspired the movie.AI and ... robotsSteven Spielbergrsquos  futuristic fairytale AI delves into a world populated by androids, almost indistinguishable from humans. In AI, robots are used to serve humanityrsquos baser instincts. They are killed for sport, and exploited for sex. Current inventions such as the sex robot took Spielbergrsquos dark fictional vision and turned it into fact.Robots first appeared in the acclaimed Czech play Rossumrsquos Universal Robots by Karel Capek. The play captures all the concerns we still have today about robotics and AI. At first, Capekrsquos robots are happy slaves, but they rebel and destroy the human race. Today, scientists debate the threat of the ldquosingularity ndash when robot intelligence surpasses human intelligence and humanity risks being sidelined or even eliminated, as Stephen Hawking warned. Think Arnold Schwarzenegger and Terminator and you get the picture.The Handmaidrsquos Tale and ... womenrsquos rightsWe once thought of Margaret Atwoodrsquos acclaimed  dystopian novel as a warning of a future that may come to pass, not a prophesy of a future that would come to pass. However, the assaults on womenrsquos rights around the world feel more like The Handmaidrsquos Tale every day.Just a week ago, an Alabama woman faced criminal charges after being shot and losing her baby. Ohio wants to effectively ban nearly all abortions. In The Handmaidrsquos Tale, religious extremists run rampant across America, calling the shots. Today, fundamentalists in the USA have never before had so much clout.Brave New World and ... medicineIn Aldous Huxleyrsquos  novel Brave New World, the drug Soma is used to keep the population calm and happy. Today, some four million people in the UK are long-term users of anti-depressants.Huxley also imagined a future where embryos are cloned and genetically modied ndash a prophecy of our ethical concerns today, including the danger of ldquodesigner babies following the decoding of the human genome. When the clone Dolly the Sheep was ldquoinvented in Scotland many spoke of the coming of a ldquoBrave New World.The book also envisions a world where movies have become ldquofeelies ndash with the audience physically immersed in the film. With the coming of virtual reality, ldquogoing to the feelies may soon be a common phrase.The Running Man and ... reality TVBased on a Stephen King story, the film The Running Man sees Arnie forced to compete in a reality TV show where he is hunted and faced with being killed for the entertainment of viewers. We havenrsquot quite got there yet, but the excesses of reality TV where unimaginable back in .Today, wersquove got reality shows such as Naked and Afraid which sees contestants stranded stark naked in the rainforest, surrounded by predators, and left to survive with nothing but a kne and a fire-starter. The extreme emotional and mental humiliation heaped on contestants in other shows like Big Brother is also, self-evidently, a cruel sport meant to entertain us.The Six Million Dollar Man and ... bionicsldquoSteve Austin, astronaut. A man barely alive. Gentlemen, we can rebuild him. We have the technology. We have the capability to build the worldrsquos first bionic man. Steve Austin will be that man. Better than he was before.

Austin was horribly injured and given a robotic eye and arm, and bionic legs.Today, prosthetic, robotised limbs are no longer the stuff of science fiction and have changed the lives of those who have suffered le-altering injuries.Snow Crash and ... Second LeNovelist Neal Stephenson imagined what he called a ldquometaverse in his  novel Snow Crash ndash where people lived inside a computer-simulated world as ldquoavatars of themselves. In , there were more than one million people living in the world of Second Le ndash an online universe where player-citizens could buy imaginary clothes, rent imaginary land and build imaginary homes.

From the movie The Martian to the docu-drama series Mars, it seems the human imagination has never been so fixated on the idea of stepping foot on to the Red Planet.There are plans for a US mission to Mars sometime around  ndash so within  years we could see yet another idea which first began with a prediction on the page or on the screen becoming a reality.Star Wars and ... the hologramldquoHelp me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

It also explains the success of the eponymous TV series, which scores by tackling \"subjects that really interest kids ndash death, sh**, blood and piss\", in the words of celebrated comedy writer Jesse Armstrong.Horrible Histories: The Movie premieres in London tonight and it looks asthere will be plenty of bodily s on show. The official trailer opens with the rotten Roman Army invading Britain to a chorus of jeers and loud burps from the unimpressed natives. When an even ruder sound erupts from the crowd, a bossy looking centurion demands: \"Who was that \" only for one revolting Briton after another to pipe up: \"Im Fartacus!\" \"No, Im Fartacus.\" And so on.Gleeful toilet humour has been a hallmark of the Horrible Histories franchise from the outset. Running to more than  titles including Groovy Greeks, Cut-throat Celts and Vile Victorians, the books were written by Terry Deary, a Sunderland-born former actor who was working as a childrens novelist in  when he was asked to write a \"history joke book\" for kids.ldquoI dont know anything about history, said Deary, who hates schoolsand despises historians .\"Dont worry, well give you the facts, said his publisher. ldquoAll you have to do is write the jokes that go with them. Despite his initial reluctance, Deary discovered that the facts were extremely interesting and on completing his first Horrible History, The Terrible Tudors, he realised hed written not a \"joke book with facts\" but \"a fact book with jokes\" ndash and a new genre was born.History with the boring bits left out and the gory bits left in is the books unique selling point and parents snapped them up in the faint hope of turning their children on to something scholarly.To their delight, their offspring devoured the books, relishing all those gruesome anecdotes about William the Conqueror , Greek medic Hippocratesand King Henry II .Deary ndash a butchers son who hates the establishment as much he loathes schools and historians ndash believes part of his books appeal lies in the way they poke fun at the rich and powerful. And although he considers childrens television to be an arena for \"shouty, patronising voices\", he accepted CBBCs invitation to work on a kids TV series, helpfully upping the \"poo quotient\" at the broadcasters request. Crucially, the series employed adult sketch show writers rather than childrens ones and was an immediate hit when it screened in .Two years later it became the first childrens programme ever to win best sketch show at the British Comedy Awards and many of the shows skits and songs have become YouTube sensations, most notably the deeply anti-monarchist Four Georgesand one featuring the Grim Reaper as a receptionist at the ldquodeath check-in, where he greets historical figures whove met with ignominious ends such as being hit on the head by a tortoise or tripping over their own beard. The latter sketch even has its own theme song ... \"Stupid Deaths, Stupid Deaths! Theyre funny cause theyre true!Stupid Deaths, Stupid Deaths! Hope next time, its not you \".\"The point, from the outset, was to stress that this was a comedy show based on history, not a history show with a bit of humour grafted on,\" said series co-writer, Steve Punt, in . \"Its a fact of comedy writing that the tighter the brief, the better the result.\"Plucking comedy out of the air is what leads to clicheacutes and well-worn themes. But knowing that you have to stick to the facts of what the Celts wore, or how the Tudors treated illness, concentrates the mind. It leads you into strange areas that you would never have thought of, and thats always creatively a good thing.\"Executive producer Richard Bradley has described the series as bottling \"the spirit of Blackadder, Monty Python and Carry On\", so its perhaps not surprising that its almost as popular with adults as children. Two years into its run the show was repackaged for the main BBC One channel with Stephen Fryas presenter.\"It uses history brilliantly,\" he added. \"They had a sketch once about how Henry VIII only found out about Catherine Howards adultery from his jester, since everyone  was too frightened to tell him, which was both poignant and funny ndash and, of course, told me something I didnt know about the Tudors.\"However, Northumbria University historian Tom Lawson took issue with that censorious view, praising the series for deviating from the usual ldquoreverential, ldquoGreat Men approach to the past. ldquoHorrible Histories is entirely contemptuous of power and invites children to be the same ndash by poking fun at the foibles and failings of leaders, he wrote in The Conversation. ldquoThe message is clear: authority has to be earned, it is not a right. And who could argue against the idea of educating our children to critically appraise those in positions of power \"Lawson welcomed the books focus on the social history of ordinary peoples lives, and even their preoccupation with bodily fluids. \"The regular inclusion on the role of excrement and sewage is not simply toilet humour, he insisted. ldquoIt teaches childrenabout topics like our relationship with the environment and the role of disease.\"At least one Cambridge academic seems to agree with him. Last month, the universitys history students were set an exam question which name-checked the popular franchise: \"Im a knight  And my only aim in le is to fight [Horrible Histories, Im A Knight song]. How accurately does this describe the role of the knightly class in English society \" students were asked.Unfortunately, their answers have not been revealed, but Terry Dearys creation seems certain to keep on growing at the rate of a pus-filled boil in a Black Death sufferers armpit. To date, there have been eight TV series totalling  episodes as well as a hit stage show and a slew of merchandise, including a Horrible Histories Monopoly set.Horrible Histories: The Movie ndash Rotten Romans premieres tonight in Leicester Square and goes on general release from July .

The stellar cast includes Nick Frost, Kim Cattrall, Sanjeev Bhaskar and even Derek Jacobi as Claudius ndash the role he played memorably in the  adaptation Robert Gravess I, Claudius.Deary has promised ldquothe most horrible movie yoursquoll see in \" and no doubt it will be packed full of blood, guts and puerile lavatorial gags.

The primary focus was on the impacts on staffing and the specic impacts depending on timing.The secret codename was first mentioned in the Parliamentrsquos online papers in  when LG agreed to set up a ldquoresilience board for ldquodisruptive incidents.Parliament proposed that the ldquosignicant incidents should include Holyroods role in London Bridge and Unicorn, without specying what the latter meant.It is understood thatthe Queen dies in Scotland - she spends around three months a year at Balmoral - the Parliament, the neighbouring Palace of Holyroodhouse, and St Gilesrsquo Cathedral will be the main focal points.If the Monarch dies when the Parliament is sitting, chamber and committee business will be suspended and the funeral will take place around ten days after her death.It is believed that up to six parliamentary days could be lost, but there will be thirty six hours to prepare for a motion of condolence in the chamber.One of the major challenges facing the Parliament is coping with the huge number of people who are expected to want to sign a condolence book at Holyrood.If the Queen passes away in Scotland, her body will rest at Holyroodhouse, following which her coffin will be carried to the cathedral on the Royal Mile.At this point, her body will be placed on the Royal Train at Waverley station for a journey down the east coast mainline.Passing references have been made to Operation Unicorn in NHS board papers, but with no explanation for what it is.Transport for Edinburgh , which manages the Capitalrsquos bus and tram network, is expected to have an important role in the days after the Queenrsquos death.According to a TfL report, the transport body was last year given delegated authority for the coordination of the Edinburgh council side of Unicorn and other sensitive operations.It noted that TfL had secured ldquolong term resources for these tasks, including police and army personnel, as well as ldquopro bono support from a firm called Inverroy Crisis Management.A newspaper reported last year that civic leaders in Scotland had taken part in a summit on Operation London Bridge.ldquoIt was a provostrsquos association meeting, one participant was quoted saying. ldquoWe were getting briefed on a very sensitive issue that we canrsquot say anything about.

From Loch Lomond in the south to the far north, hotels, golf courses, fish farms, energy schemes and other developments have been planned in some of our most sensitive land and seascapes.Every time, the businesses behind the schemes say they will bring jobs and money to areas stripped of people because of the lack of opportunities, and promise to restore the wild places they impact on.And every time, defenders of nature say the very beauty people visit these areas for, and the environment we all treasure, is being trashed.The cynicism of the environmental lobby would seem to have a point: last week saw Scottish Natural Heritage recommend that Donald Trumprsquos Menie Estate golf course should lose its status as a site of special scientic interestbecause the golf development had done so much damage to the arearsquos famous dune system. Many of the developmentrsquos promised economic benefits have yet to materialise.So is Bruce Wilson of the Scottish Wildle Trust right when he says the proper priorities are being ldquoturned on their heads when it comes to developments Or should we instead heed Kate Forbes, MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch, when she warns that outsiders trying to block development risk treating the Highlands ldquolike a museum The proposed Coul Links golf development near Embo in Sutherland has many parallels to Trumprsquos effort in Aberdeenshire.Apart from being backed by a wealthy American ndash Chicagoan Mike Keiser ndash the Coul dune system is also an SSSI. It has two other levels of protection, through the Ramsar international treaty on wetland habitats, and as a European Natura -protected habitat.It is the very nature of the wild dunes at Menie and now Coul that attracts big-money developers such as Trump and Keiser: the SWT and other groups proposed an alternative version of both golf courses, outside the SSSIs, but developers rejected them. ldquoThe whole point is that golfers want to play on the dunes, Wilson says.What baffles Wilson is why developers want to move in to Coul Links at all despite their protected status. The area is a fragile network of undisturbed dunes noted for protected birds including terns, geese and waders, and a rich iety of plants.ldquoItrsquos the most highly-designated kind of site you could have, he says. ldquoIt should just be that a developer sees that, and just says: lsquoItrsquos not worth our while doing thatrsquo.ldquoBut we repeatedly see this, with very special sites being opened up to potential development.Not everyone shares his view. The golf firm behind the Coul plan promised to boost the local economy, with  new jobs and ldquomore than pound million gross value-added in its first  years. It will only use part of the protected area and says it will manage the site to help local wildle and combat invasive species.The Dornoch Area Community Interest Company, set up by local people to promote the area, says its board ldquounanimously, fully and enthusiastically supports the Coul Links project.ldquoWe believe the environmental issues can be constructively addressed and the project will materially strengthen the Dornoch and East Sutherland communities, it declares.With such support the plan won approval from Highland Council, and Scottish ministers are expected to make a final decision on it in the next few months.Wilson says the way such development decisions are swayed by economic arguments is wrong: ldquoThe focus on the short-term economic gain really misses out on the long-term economics ndash the reason that people would go to these areas is being eroded by these short-term economics. Priorities are being turned on their heads.ldquoAnd therersquos a burden on us to prove the environmental argument while economics are always taken at face value. They say a development will create so many new jobs and bring so many millions to the local economy and those figures are just accepted.It is not just tourist developments that impact on our finest natural places.Glen Etive is in a national scenic area, with much of it officially ldquowild land. The narrow road that threads the glen for  miles to the sea gives less active tourists the chance to see untamed land up close.The same easy access and steep tumbling burns that are a tourist draw are what attracted hydro-electricity developer William Dickins.Campaigners including wild-land charity the John Muir Trust fought hard against Dickinsrsquo plans for seven ldquomicro-hydro schemes on the major burns flowing into the River Etive.Eventually the development won approval from Highland Council. There will be a grant to the local community from profits, and there will, of course, be more ldquogreen power going into the national grid.Davie Black, access and conservation officer at climbersrsquo and walkersrsquo organisation Mountaineering Scotland, says under the present planning system developments such as the Etive hydro schemes will go on happening despite opposition: ldquoThe protections are there butyou look at the planning policy there is always a caveat that it doesnrsquot prohibit development entirely ... thatrsquos how the system works and you have to argue otherwise.With Scottish Government backing for economic development, and no right of appeal by objectors to planning decisions, the odds, he says, are stacked against opponents.But Kate Forbes forcibly makes the point that, while the environment is important, the wellbeing of local people should take precedence when it comes to development: ldquoThe most pressing issue in the Highlands is depopulation and the deficit of young people.ldquoRecent statistics ... show that deficit is due to grow, which could be disastrous for public services, local schools and rural communities in the Highlands. My focus is on retaining and attracting people.She says environmental quality is vital to the Highland economy, boosting tourism and food exports: ldquoThe environment can take years to recoverit is wrecked in the pursuit of quick economic gain.However, she adds: ldquoToday, there is a danger that the Highlands are treated like a museum ndash to be enjoyed at a distance without thought to the needs of the local population, who live here and need jobs, infrastructure and economic opportunities.ldquoOften itrsquos those living furthest from the Highlands that have the strongest opinions about what should happen here. That is not local democracy. Those who live here know how important balancing economic opportunities with environmental protections is.Coul and Glen Etive ndash the latter in Forbesrsquo constituency ndash are probably the most extreme examples of development allowed in highly protected areas.But can developments in what seem to be inviolable areas do what they set out to ndash leave the area undamaged and boost the local economy The Kingshouse Hotel sits not far from Dickinsrsquo hydro schemes at the junction of Glen Etive and Glen Coe. It has one of the most photographed views in Scotland, of the huge sentinel of Buachaille Etive Mor and down into Glen Coe itself.The old hotel was tatty and needed a major upgrade, but the owners demolished almost all of it and replaced it with a three-storey steel-framed structure that brought howls of objection from, among others, the National Trust for Scotland.The Trust said it was an eyesore but the argument was that it would create jobs, and the hotel company brought in to run said it could only be sustained at a much bigger scale than the original hotel.The Glencoe and Glen Etive Community Council backed it and the developers where at pains to say they would make the building fit in with the local scenery.Whether they have succeeded is another matter, but the hotel opened in February and instead of a charming but damp, mouldy and battered building that would have had to close, there is now a modern hotel and bunkhouse in a remote place employing  people, and serving walkers and climbers as well as bus tourists.Environmental groups themselves agree development is necessarythe Highlands is to thrive. So how do they say it should it be done The nature of the proposals is key, says Davie Black: ldquoItrsquos a question of how the development goes ahead. Is it an intensive extractive process or is it some light harvesting or harnessing of resources As well as fighting the Glen Etive plan, the John Muir Trust has opposed several large wind-farm developments. It accepts the argument for renewable energy to cut carbon emissions but Andrew Bachell, its chief executive, says the trust backs ldquolocal power for local people such as schemes on Eigg and in Knoydart, which have their own micro-generation for local consumption.ldquoWhen our energy strategy is largely dictated by corporations whose first and foremost priority is to distant shareholders, and by landowners determined to squeeze every penny of profit out of the land they own, it starts to get more complicated, he says.His thinking chimes with Wilsonrsquos: locally-run developments, with all the profits ing to the area, are his ideal. SWT itself agreed after much thought to a single wind turbine on land it owns in a national scenic area at Achiltibuie. The turbine is managed by a local community company and profits go to the local community.ldquoWersquore not against development, and that development can take place in such areas where jobs and attractions can boost the economy, as long as it does so without causing damage, Wilson says.William Dickins, the developer of Coul Links, and the agent for the owners of the Kingshouse were all approached for this article, but did not provide any comment."},{"url":null,"title":"david-pratt-sinister-repression-china-s-uighur-minority-ethnic-group-intensified-urumqi-riots","story":"IT began in the most unlikely of places. It was  years ago this weekend in a toy factory in Shaoguan, in Chinarsquos Guangdong province, that a disgruntled worker posted an incendiary rumour online that would reverberate to this day.According to the rumour, a Han Chinese woman had allegedly been raped by Uighur migrants in the factory, even though a government investigation later concluded there was no evidence such an assault had taken place.In an ensuing brawl in the wake of the rumour, Han workers killed at least two Uighur migrants. Footage of the attacks rapidly spread online enraging many Uighurs long upset with the Han-dominated government that took control of their region following the Communist revolution in .What began as organised peaceful protest by Uighurs demanding a government investigation into the factory incident quickly spiralled out of control. For many Uighurs the death of the factory workers epitomised everything that was wrong about Beijingrsquos policies and the belittling racism they felt the Han Chinese subjected them to.Quickly the situation deteriorated, pitting Uighur Muslims against Han Chinese on the streets, especially in Urumqi, the regional capital of Xinjiang province, home to many within the Turkic Uighur ethnic minority.In the days that followed hundreds were killed, stabbed and beaten in the ensuing clashes and brutal police crackdown. The exact number of dead and wounded remains a contentious issue. Some insist that the official figure of  or so killed is wildly inaccurate and has simply been airbrushed by the authorities to hide a far bigger toll. What is certain, however, about the \"Urumqi riots\" of July , , is that it was some of the worst ethnic violence modern China has witnessed.According to Joanne Smith Finley, an expert on Uighur-Han relations at Newcastle University, the riots revealed ldquovery ugly scenes of distrust, with reports of Han Chinese doctors refusing to treat Uighur patients and vice versa.This, however, was just the start, for the Urumqi riots were to prove a pivotal moment, one with profound long-lasting consequences that ultimately led to what human-rights groups today describe as the largest mass incarceration of the st century.In all, it is estimated that about one million Uighurs, possibly more, are being held against their will in what the Chinese authorities call ldquore-education camps. Such numbers would account for roughly % of the whole Uighur population in the region. For those still at liberty, Xinjiang province has, meanwhile, effectively been transformed into a surveillance state.But before examining the extent of these human-rights violations itrsquos worth pausing to consider the origins of the Uighursand the historic tensions that have existed between their community and Beijing.Most Uighursare Muslims and speak a Turkic language thatrsquos completely dferent from Mandarin Chinese. Culturally and ethnically they regard themselves as closer to central Asian nations like Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan and Mongolia, which constitute Chinarsquos northern and western neighbours on the Eurasian Steppe, than with the rest of China itself.Indeed, it has sometimes been pointed out that Urumqi, in Xinjiang province where the  riots centred, is geographically closer to the capital of the Afghanistan capital, Kabul, than the Chinese capital Beijing.For centuries, Xinjiangrsquos economy has revolved around agriculture and trade, with towns such as Kashgar thriving as hubs along the famous Silk Road. In the early part of the th century, however, the Uighurs briefly declared independence, before the region was brought under the complete control of communist China in .Today Xinjiang is officially designated an ldquoautonomous region within China, just like Tibet to its south.But despite Chinarsquos claims that Xinjiang is ldquoautonomous, it falls entirely under Beijingrsquos rule. For its part, Chinarsquos central government insists that Uighur militants are waging a violent campaign for an independent state by plotting bombings, sabotage and civic unrest. In other words, they are Muslim ldquoterrorists.Beijingrsquos interests in the region, however, might have more to do with the fact that Xinjiang is also home to a substantial portion of the countryrsquos most valuable natural resources.According to the Chinese governmentrsquos own figures, in addition to sizeable mineral reserves of iron ore and gold, the region claims about % of the countryrsquos coal reserves and % of its petroleum and natural gas.The region is also home to some of the most important elements of the Belt and Road Initiative , Chinarsquos flagship trade project. The BRI, which came into effect in , aims to link Beijing with some  countries around the world via railroads, gas pipelines, shipping lanes, and other infrastructure projects. It is considered Chinese president Xi Jinpingrsquos pet project, and an important part of his political legacy.China is estimated to have invested between  trillion and  trillion into the project, according to the Centre for Strategic and International Studies . It is perhaps for this reason that ever since , when Xinjiang became an ldquoautonomous region, the Chinese government has encouraged ethnic Hans to migrate west providing incentives like ldquohukou, a coveted status that facilitates access to essential social services like housing, pensions, healthcare and education.ldquoThe hukou reforms are about trying to encourage Han migration to southern Xinjiang, even though itrsquos not phrased in that way, says James Leibold, an expert on ethnic relations in China at Australiarsquos La Trobe University. The Chinese governmentrsquos strategy billed as a ldquomodernisation scheme has had a profound impact on the demographic and ethnic composition of Xinjiang.In , Xinjiangrsquos Han population comprised just % of the total. As of the last census in , Han Chinese constituted at least % of the population more recent reports put that figure as high as %.But there are other far more sinister methods by which the Beijing government is shting the ethnic balance in the region.In recent years, Xinjiang authorities have clamped down on public displays of religion and rounded up an estimated one million mostly Uighurs and other minorities into internment camps in the name of ldquocounter-terrorism.Ever since the Urumqi riots of  the region has seen periodic bouts of unrest, including a series of deadly kne and bomb attacks in  and . But observers say these are few and far between and the Chinese authorities police state response and treatment of the Uighur and Muslim population cannot simply be explained away by such factors.A steady increase in the number of testimonies by ex-detainees and researchers, as well as evidence gleaned by human-rights groups from satellite imagery and media investigations, points to the widespread existence of detention camps. Political prisoners in those camps are both physically and mentally tortured, two eyewitnesses of the camps told BBCrsquos Newsnight in a documentary that aired late last year. One of the eyewitnesses, named Azat, had been in a detention centre to visit a detainee, while the other, Omir, had been imprisoned in one of the camps. Both are Uighurs and have since fled Xinjiang.Omir, who was detained in Karamay, in north Xinjiang, described being shackled to a chair, deprived of sleep, and beaten by police in his camp.ldquoThey have a chair called the lsquotiger.rsquo My ankles were shackled, my hands locked to the chair. I couldnrsquot move. They wouldnrsquot let me sleep. They also hung me up for hours, and they beat me, Omir told the broadcaster.ldquoThey had thick wooden and rubber batons, whips made from twisted wire, needles to pierce the skin, pliers for pulling out your nails.ldquoAll these tools were displayed on the table in front of me, ready for use at any time. You could hear other people screaming as well, Omir added.Omirrsquos account tallies with previous reporting on the camps, including one by the Washington Post also published last year. In that account by Kayrat Samarkand, another Uighur who had been imprisoned, he too describes being strapped in the ldquotiger chair.Former inmates of these secretive facilities also give accounts of being kept in overcrowded cells, and forced to undergo political indoctrination for days, months, and even over a year. In that time they are made to chant slogans, watch propaganda videos, denounce their religion and pledge loyalty to the Communist Party.One Kazakh businessman, who spent nearly two months in a camp, said in an interview with Agence France -Pressethe facilities only had one goal: to strip detainees of their religious belief. The Chinese authorities have also been accused of separating Muslim children from their families, religion and language, and are reportedly engaged in a rapid, large-scale campaign to send them to state-run care centres or boarding schools where they have with no contact with their parents.In one township alone, more than  children have lost one or more parents to either the camps or prison, a new BBC report found.According to research findings by Human Rights Watch , it is not uncommon to find Uighurs, particularly from Hotan and Kashgar in southern Xinjiang, reporting that half or more of their immediate family members are in a mix of political education camps, pre-trial detention, and prison.Such areas are perceived by the Chinese authorities as anti-government hotspots and one interviewee contacted there by HRW said her husband, his four brothers, and their  nephews, all the males in the family, have been detained in political education camps since .ldquoThe stepped-up repression is being carried out through a series of military, political, economic and surveillance programmes that constitute the most comprehensive system of population control and oppression anywhere in the world today, observed Carl Gershman, president of the National Endowment for Democracy in a Washington Post editorial last week.ldquoIt has not just subjugated the Uighur people but also now threatens their very survival, Gershman warned.He, like other observers, is concerned over the growing crackdown, and points to what the Chinese authorities have dubbed the \"Strike Hard Campaign Against Violent Terrorism\" which was introduced as early as .Since then, the number of people formally arrested has jumped threefold compared to the previous five-year period, according to official figures and estimates by the non-governmental organisation Chinese Human Rights Defenders.This draconian campaign made any peaceful expression of Muslim identity, such as having a long beard or wearing a veil, grounds for arrest on suspicion of disloyalty.The campaignrsquos ability to identy ldquountrustworthy Uighurs was vastly expanded by what is also known as the \"Integrated Joint Operations Platform\", a system of digital surveillance that involves the compulsory mass collection of biometric data such as voice samples, iris scans and other personal information.It also uses articial intelligence and big data to track all Uighurs and flag anyone who might be problematic. The reach of the authorities even extends beyond China with reports and mounting evidence indicating that enforced disappearances are being used against the families of Uighurs residing abroad.All of this, rights activists say, has eerie historical precedents and parallels. ldquoThere are obviously important dferences between what the Chinese regime is doing today to the Uighurs and the murder of six million Jews in the Nazi Holocaust. The regimersquos programme is not extermination, but there is no question that it is determined to destroy the Uighur religion and identity, observes Carl Gershman. ldquoIn place of bullets and gas, it is using comprehensive digital surveillance and asphyxiating physical and social controls, and its plan has a longer time frame.But post-modern genocide is genocide nonetheless. The goal is the same, added Gershman.Faced with such evidence the response of the international community to the plight of the Uighurs has been muted, no doubt in part as a result of global trade with China and the western worldrsquos own ldquowar on terror.Looking back a decade on from the Urumqi riots or ldquoQi Wu as that July day in  is more commonly know by its acronym, therersquos no doubt it was a defining moment for the Uighur people. Incarcerated in their millions and under terrible repression, now marks another defining moment for the Uighur. Itrsquos one the world urgently needs to wake up to before itrsquos too late."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-mp-joanna-cherry-qc-made-citizens-assembly-39-ten-times-harder-39-says-adviser","story":"Dr Oliver Escobar said thecomment by Joanna Cherry QC last week wasso unhelpful it had made the forumswork ldquoten times harder.He told the Herald the Edinburgh South West MPhad made it harder becauseunderstanding of the Assembly was still in its infancy and it had yet to gain public trust.That meant people might not distinguish between Ms Cherry speaking as a politician with onepoint of view, and the entirely separate, independentorganisers ofthe Assembly.Announced by Nicola Sturgeon in April as a way of thrashing out the long-term challenges facing Scotland, the Assembly has been dogged by claims it is a Nationalist front.Based on the Irish models which led to referendums legalising same-sex marriage and abortion, the Assembly will recruit its first  members and  substitutes over the summer, then deliberate over six weekends from later October to late April.In Ireland, cross-party buy-in and independence were vital factors in the exercisersquos success.However the Scottish Tories and Scottish LibDems have already said they will have nothing to do with the Scottish version, with Unionist campaigners urging a boycott.Last week its first co-convener David Martin, the former Scottish Labour MEP, appealed for cooperation and insisted the forum would be independent from the SNP Government.However a day later Ms Cherry, the SNPrsquos justice spokeswoman at Westminster, fuelled Unionist suspicions by saying the Assembly was part of a wider independence effort.In an online video, she described it as ldquothe perfect way to move Scotland on from the current state of Brexit paralysis created by westminster and to move us towards independence.:SNP MP Joanna Cherry QC says Citizens Assembly is perfect way to advance independenceHer Twitter post was advertising an Electoral Reform Society event at Edinburgh University tomorrow about the Assembly in which she and Dr Escobar will participate.Dr Escobar, an expert in public policy at the Edinburgh, has advised SNP Brexit Secretary Michael Russell on the importance of ldquobuilding cross-party support for the Assembly.Also expected to be the lead researcher on the body, he told Scotland and Sunday that Ms Cherryrsquos comment was ldquocompletely against the ethos of such assembles.ldquoIm kind of fuming around that, adding an open-minded and unbiased approach was the \"fundamental underpinning of the legitimacy of this body.He said: \"I wouldnt be involved in advising, and hopefully soon to be confirmed in doing research around this,I believed that this was an already forgone conclusion.\"So earlier this week, when comments were made by a very prominent member of the SNP, it was perhaps the most unhelpful contribution that has been made so far to this process.ldquoI understand why this happens - it happens because theyre talking to their own supporters, they frame it in a way that is appealing to them. But it completely goes against the ethos.\"The person who made these comments has actually nothing to do with the Citizens Assembly. Shes not involved in organising it, shes not involved in any of the advisory boards. Shes just someone who has advocated for Citizens Assemblies because shes been inspired by the Irish example.\"Professor David Farrell of University College Dublin, research director on the first Irish assembly, also told the paper that perceived bias was ldquoa serious risk to the new project.He said: ldquoI think theres a serious riskthere isnt some buy-in from most of the parties that it could undermine it. Thats a serious risk.\"In both of the Irish processes, pretty much all of the parties were able to buy in - and in some cases quite reluctantly in the beginning. But I think that was so important.ldquoYou can see it with social media commentary already that there are people who are seeing this as a stitchup which is what you get early on. The best way to reduce that criticism is to say Look, we have some buy-in from all parties.\"We had much the same when we were talking about abortion because that would have been similarly an extremely controversial topic.\"So whats really important is that its seen to be independent, objective, fully transparent.\":Citizens Assembly hit by recruitment delay amid Unionist calls for boycottIn a series of tweets this morning, Ms Cherry said she stood by her comment, and said it was part of the ldquojoy of democracy that others might disagree.However she also called for people to approach the Assembly with an ldquoopen mind.A short positive thread on #CitizensAssemblies #She wrote: ldquoIrsquove put a lot of effort into arguing the case for aCitizens Assembly in Scotland  Irsquom totally committed to having a gold standard process\"I stand by my comments that the Citizens Assembly is a good way forward for Scotland in the Brexit crisis.

And like many people in senior positions, particularly women, I have had moments of self-doubt but I believe it’s important to be open about that and to be a role model to young people. But more than anything, I am grateful to have the opportunity to help make Scotland a better place to live.What is the Parliament’s biggest achievement in the last  years  Twenty years on there are so many achievements that we can be proud of, and that have made Scotland a better place to live, work, study and grow up in. From free personal care to the abolition of tuition fees, the ban on smoking in public places, a minimum pricing for alcohol and the introduction of equal marriage. There’s a long, long list of these inidual policies that wouldn’t have happenedwe hadn’t had a Scottish Parliament.Across the world there are other countries now looking to Scotland to learn from the globally ground-breaking things we’ve done on public health, on tackling climate change, and on the work we’re doing around renewable energy.But above any inidual policy, there is a much more fundamental achievement, and that is that,  years on, the parliament has reinvigorated Scottish democracy and become an accepted, established part of Scottish le. We should all take great pride in that.What has been the most dficult challenge the Parliament has faced and you personally The sad and unexpected death in  of Donald Dewar – the man who had driven through the Scotland Act and then become the first First Minister – was no doubt a moment of great uncertainty for all MSPs in the early days of the Parliament.On a personal level, I’d have to say assuming the office of First Minister was my biggest challenge. Despite having spent  years in frontline politics, and seven as Deputy First Minister, nothing can prepare you for the moment where suddenly you are the last word, where there is no longer anyone above you to seek a second opinion on somethingyou want it – everyone is looking to you.What is your most memorable moment There have been many memorable moments. The passage of the Equal Marriage Act and the Minimum Pricing legislation are two key ones for me. I also think the referendum campaign has to be one of them. It not only saw Parliament at its best – with robust debates and intense scrutiny – but also sparked an enormous outpouring of democratic engagement across the country. Although the result didn’t go the way I wanted, the legacy of a more politically involved country is one we should all cherish.I have a lot of memorable moments. It’s not the famous names or the big events, but the stories I hear from iniduals around the country that inspire me. I’ve spent a lot of time lately listening to the le experiences of Scotland’s care experienced young people. Their stories will stay with me forever and drive me to improve their lives and opportunities.In  years’ time, how do you hope the Parliament will have evolved It should evolve in line with the way people in Scotland want it to. The Parliament was established in large part because of the democratic deficit that opened up during  years of a Tory government which became more and more unpopular in Scotland. Despite devolution, Brexit in particular has demonstrated that Westminster is willing to ignore the views of people in Scotland and disregard votes of the Parliament. I have absolutely no doubt that by  we will have completed the powers of the Parliament and become an independent country. That means we will have established a genuine partnership of equals with the rest of the UK and will have ensured that people in Scotland always get the governments they vote for.Are there any people you would like to thank We should never ever forget those who campaigned for decades to see a Scottish Parliament – many of whom never lived to see it become a reality.Then there are those who have worked tirelessly behind the scenes. We couldn’t do our job without the work of the parliament staff, led by the Parliament’s chief executive, Sir Paul Grice, who recently announced he was moving on to a new job after  years. He might not be well-known by the wider public but, as someone who was there from the very beginning, all MSPs and staff owe him an enormous debt of gratitude.For me personally, I certainly would not be where I am today without the support of my mum and dad and my husband Peter.Everyone is invited to join the partySaturday, June ,  is gearing up to be a great day.From am to noon, the Queen will address Parliament and each of the party leaders will speak in response. The audience will include those young people who were born in  as well as finalists from a competition for student film-makers who produced a short film on the impact the Scottish Parliament has had in their area. There will also be a number of performances celebrating the best of Scotland’s culture and music and the Makar will perform a new piece of work.In the afternoon, the Parliament will open its doors for a day of celebration – a party everyone is invited to join from pm to pm.There will be a chance to sit in the Presiding Officer’s seat and see how it feels to take charge, as well as retro games like giant Jenga, Kerplunk and space hoppers. There will also be live music, dancers, face painting and caricaturists.And of course, there will be birthday cake and food too. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: “It will be a great day, full of colour and energy. Parliament always does these events well and brings in so many people from across Scotland. “I hope we spend the day not just looking back on what has been achieved, but focused on the work the parliament still has to do.“The public are often sceptical of politicians, but I hope people across the country will reflect on how far we’ve come with the parliament and the dference it has already made to so many people’s lives.”"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon the scottish parliament s greatest achievements","story":"The Scottish Parliament will celebrate its th anniversary today .Her Majesty the Queen will take part in the th anniversary celebrations today, with the iconic Parliament building in Edinburgh being open from pm to pm for visitors to join in the birthday celebrations.And in an exclusive QA, Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told us what she believes the Parliament’s top  greatest achievements are.The country’s top politician also shared her thoughts on Brexit and the future, sounding a note of caution for the UK’s next Prime Minister.Here, in her own words, Nicola walks us through the Parliament’s success story...Right from its earliest years, the Scottish Parliament showed that it was ready to take policy decisions substantially dferent to those at Westminster to help build a better country.A clear early example of this was the introduction of free personal care for the elderly. This was a substantial commitment but was vital for Scotland’s long term interests, preparing ourselves for the challenges of an ageing population. We’ve recently extended free personal care to cover all those who are assessed as needing it, no matter their age.MSPs also charted a dferent course when, following a change of administration in , parliament voted to scrap tuition fees in Scotland, restoring Scotland’s long and proud tradition of free education.Similarly, the decision to abolish prescription charges brought to an end what was little more than a tax on ill health. The NHS of course is the greatest, and most valued, example of a universal service where care is provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay. Our health service, like others across the world, faces challenges. But it is a real achievement of the Scottish Parliament that we have resisted the marketization moves south of the border while ensuring that under the current government Scotland’s AE departments are the best performing in theUK.On other occasions, the Parliament has led the UK in making bold policy choices, such as the ban on smoking in public places. Our Climate Change Act includedthe most ambitious emissions reduction targets of any legislature in the world and, as Health Secretary, I was heavily involved in the campaign to introduce a minimum unit price for alcohol, which we knew would play a key role in tackling Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with drink – another world leading measure.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.glasgowsouthandeastwoodextra webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"As the Scottish Parliament prepares to celebrate its th anniversary, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on both its journey and her own.\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on  years of the Scottish Parliament viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"GLAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"GLAS | Article Teaser\"It took a decade of hard work to make this policy a reality and I am personally very proud of the campaign, working with stakeholders, to persuade MSPs to back minimum pricing, as well as overcoming a legal challenge that went all the way to the Supreme Court.I am personally committed to making sure every child and young person in Scotland gets the best possible start in le. We have already delivered an increase in free, high quality childcare for all three and four year olds and extending entitlement to eligible two year olds and will increase it further before the end of this parliament.Scotland has also become a much safer society under devolution. Recorded crime has fallen to some of the lowest levels seen since the s. In particular, non-sexual violent crime has fallen substantially, thanks in no small part to the excellent work of the Violence Reduction Unit, which was established over a decade ago with cross-party support and is now being copied across the UK.In recent years, new powers have come to the Scottish Parliament and with those powers come increased responsibilities for MSPs to deliver for the people ofScotland.Income tax policy is now a key feature of the annual Scottish budget. We’ve used these new powers to introduce a fairer income tax policy, with most people paying less tax than they would south of the border – while continuing to raise revenue to support investment in the economy and public services.Last year Parliament passed the wide-ranging Social Security Act, paving the way for devolution of a number of benefits, as well as creating a number of newbenefits such as increased carers’ support allowance and best start grants for families with young children – and a new social security agency to deliver them. This new agency has a culture of dignity and respect at its heart and early feedback from service users has been overwhelmingly positive.I also appointed the first gender balanced Scottish cabinet and we are encouraging more women to stand for parliament, and bring a better balance to ourpublic le.Over the course of the Scottish Parliament consistent action has been taken to ensure communities have the opportunity to own the land they live and work on.Many communities have benefited from the right to buy that now covers rural and urban communities.Of course, the foundation of our country is a strong and resilient economy. That’s why we have slashed or abolished business rates for , premises –saving almost £. billion for our small businesses.We have invested in our infrastructure with all governments building new schools and hospitals and, of course, the iconic Queensferry Crossing.And, to help make sure we have the workforce we need for years to come, we have delivered just over a quarter of a million Modern Apprenticeships in the lastdecade.In April this year, new legislation to tackle controlling and coercive behaviour came into effect, giving Scotland some of the most robust domesticabuse legislation in the world.I’m also proud of the many steps we’ve taken to make Scotland a fairer society, including the introduction of equal marriage rights – attending one of the first same-sex weddings in Scotland is a memory that will stay with me for a long time.And we all worked together over many years to help Glasgow successfully host the  Commonwealth Games. This helped to inspire Scots to get more active,delivered new facilities and put Scotland on the world stage. It was a sight to behold.My final achievement is perhaps harder to quanty. There is no doubt that the re-establishment of Scotland’s parliament has profoundly changed our political culture for the better, with our nation’s lawmakers much more accessible to those they represent. It has also enabled us to have conversations we wouldn’t have had and to debate our own future, with the  independence referendum generating an increase in democratic engagement.Looking ahead, we now face the signicant challenges posed by Brexit which, of course, Scotland’s people and parliament overwhelmingly oppose. Given the long-term damage that Brexit will cause to Scotland, and the material change in circumstances this represents, I believe it is only fair that people are given the choice of whether to become an independent country. Indeed, the current SNP Government was elected on a clear manesto commitment that people should be offered that choice should Scotland be taken out of the EU against its will. Polls consistently show that people living here believe the decision on whether to hold a referendum should be a matter for Holyrood and not Westminster. Twenty years after it came into being, that is an important measure of the way people in Scotland view the Parliament and one that the new UK Prime Minister would do well to heed."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : pmOrkney MSP Liam McArthur has challenged mobile phone operators to engage with the Scottish Government’s G infill programme to ensure remaining gaps in the service are closed.

The free, half-day workshop will take place from .am until pm at the Kirkwall Town Hall.With idea and knowledge sharing, specialist funding advice on meeting the criteria and a QA session, the workshop aims to help charities apply for funding, ranging from £ up to £,. The workshop will look at three charitable, grant-giving trusts funded by players of People’s Postcode Lottery — People’s Postcode Trust, Postcode Community Trust and Postcode Local Trust.Together these trusts fund a range of projects which promote human rights, combat discrimination and poverty, improve community health and well-being, tackle isolation, support arts and physical recreation and increase access to outdoor and green space and much more. Last year, over £ million was awarded through the three community programme trusts, benefitting thousands of local charities and good causes in every part of the UK.Good causes to have been awarded funding in Orkney include £, for the Papay Development Trust’s kelp store crafts and heritage centre and £, for Orkney Blide Trust to help support those living with mental health problems.Speaking ahead of the event, Mr Carmichael said: “I am very much looking forward to hosting this event for local organisations supported by the People’s Postcode Lottery in Orkney.#Many local projects have been made possible thanks to funds raised by their players, and I am keen to see many more successful applications in future.”Calum Munro, senior community programmes officer at People’s Postcode Lottery added: “We want to do all we can to help local charities and good causes successfully apply for funding from three community programmes trusts.#It is fantastic that funds raised by players of People’s Postcode Lottery are making a huge dference in their own communities.

At the time, the Dexy’s Midnight Runners’ cover version was riding high in the charts and when the song came on, one of my colleagues yelped “Oh I love Dexy’s”. But when I pointed out it was Van the Man himself, she instantly snapped “That’s sh**e”, even though the remake was a faithful tribute to the original. It wasn’t played by the band she liked so, by definition, it was garbage.Last year’s Dexy’s Conundrum was the SNP’s contentment for powers to reside in Brussels but not for those same controls to be held in London, and this week it was the reaction to soon to be ex-Prime Minister Theresa May’s new review of how the UK Government responds to devolution.: Ian Blackford and Theresa May clash over ‘desperate’ devolution review: Theresa May to warn no-deal Brexit risks breaking up UK during final visit to Scotland as PMBroken by The Scotsman on Tuesday and confirmed in a speech in Stirling on Thursday as part of her farewell tour policy frenzy, she has asked ex-Scotland Office minister Lord Andrew Dunlop, a former special adviser to both John Major and David Cameron, to examine how Whitehall works with the devolved administrations. At issue is whether the devolved nations should continue to have separate ministerial departments or, as Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson has proposed, there should be a “Union Delivery Unit”.Ms Davidson knows Lord Dunlop very well, first working closely with him in the independence referendum campaign. He recently led her Scottish Future Growth Council, and he has a clear steer from a recentarticle explaining why the unit was needed to ensure “UK legislation is devolution-compatible, that businesses from across the home nations are involved in helping draw up trade policy ... and that civil servants and ministers have a genuine understanding of how power is shared and policy delivered”. Nothing unreasonable, and although Mrs May will be gone in a fortnight, both candidates vying to replace her have clearly expressed their ambition to strengthen the union and the winner would create unnecessary dficultyhe ignored Ruth Davidson or the Dunlop Review.It would be asking too much for the SNP to welcome the review, but the instant reaction was splenetic denouncement as “desperate” and “meaningless”,even though only a fortnight ago First Minister Nicola Sturgeon argued the UK Government had to change the way it interacted with the devolved nations.“Formal frameworks such as the Joint Ministerial Committee are not ing effectively ... meetings only happen when the UK Government chooses. And the committee’s decisions are not binding anyway,” she told the Law Society of Scotland. “There is no sign – none whatsoever – that the UK Government recognises the need for fundamental change,” she added. But having recognised just such a need for change, the First Minister could not have been more dismissive: “It’s for the Scottish people – not a Tory PM – to consider and decide what future we want for our Parliament and country.”Condemned either for action or inaction, the UK Government can’t win, but the clue is in that Law Society speech, when she said that the Scottish Government had commissioned its own assessment which would “draw heavily on academic expertise”.Like the supposedly independent Citizen’s Assembly, now postponed as hastily as it was launched, the SNP will make sure the conclusion is devolution isn’t working. And whatever the Dunlop Review produces, the SNP reaction will be similar to that of a barmaid discovering her favourite Dexy’s tune is being sung by a wee Ulsterman.General Melchett looks set to lead Tories over the top...I was in Perth last night for the Scottish leg of the Hunt v Johnson World Series, eagerly awaited by both Scottish camps but sadly too late for the Perspective section deadlines. It’s been a job to keep up with the flurry of pledges from both candidates, but Mr Hunt laid the groundwork for the Scottish event yesterday with an article aimed at the Scottish business community.On Thursday all members were posted short candidate statements and again the Johnson contribution was al, rounded off with a Boris flourish, sounding rather like General Melchett from Blackadder Goes Forth: “This is it folks. No second chances. Choose me and I will deliver Brexit, unite our country and beat Corbyn.”Mr Hunt included links to a campaign video, his -point Brexit plan and his recent Policy Exchange speech, and dismiss him as a try-hardyou like, but at least he comes across as someone who knows the keys to Number  must be fought for.The ballot papers start landingtoday and whatever happens both sides will have to work together, but with a Conservative Home survey putting Mr Johnson’ on  per cent, no wonder his people think it’s in the bag.... As Monty defends position in FranceOut leafleting down Mountcastle way near where new Brexit MEP Brian Monteith used to live, a craggy old builder shouted, “Whit are ye sellin’ ” When I replied politics, he fired back “Brexit Party  Send them all hame...” “No, sorry, Conservative,” I said, to which he immediately rasped, “Ach, they’re a waste ay f***in’ space” and got on with his digging. I’ll put you down as a maybe, sir. Not every Scot is being dragged out the EU against their will...Meanwhile Monty was in a typically bullish mood on Newsnight when quizzed by Emily Maitlis about his party’s back-turning stunt at the European Parliament opening, swatting off questions about his French residence as “Remoaner ersion tactics”. Whatever his current address and his new party’s politics may be, thousands of Geordies put their cross next to his box.In the same show, Lib Dem MEP Martin Horwood claimed “Nobody wants a super state”, despite new EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen once saying she didn’t “see a loose association controlled by the national interests of a few states”.As I wrote here recently, there are plenty Eurocrats who see Britain as a drag on “ever closer union” and the Lib Dems in Bollocks to Brexit tee-shirts are deluding themselves as much as Brian and the Bring on Brexit brigade who argue only milk and honey awaits us.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"euan mccolm when jeremy corbyn goes so must his loony left lieutenants","story":"Even the blindly faithful are beginning to see the light. Four years after Labour Party members made the decision to install Jeremy Corbyn as their leader, they can no longer deny the evidence of their catastrophic foolishness. Labour can now depend upon the votes of just  per cent of the electorate. As the Conservative Party tears itself to shreds over the issue of Brexit, the official opposition is at its most unpopular since polling began.Many of those who once endorsed the Corbyn project are now desperately trying to find the reverse gear. Former cheerleaders now argue in sorrowful newspaper columns and in disingenuous social media posts that the Labour leader’s position on the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Unionmust change. Meanwhile, once close allies in the Labour group in the House of Commons discuss how Corbyn might be replaced and by whom.For those of us who enjoy the guilty pleasure of an appropriately delivered “I told you so”, these really are the best of times.The Corbyn project was always doomed and not, as many of his supporters would like to think, because he faced a hostile media. It was doomed because the man at its head is a crank. And a thoroughly unpleasant one, at that.Under Corbyn’s leadership, the Labour Party has become a safe space for anti-Semites it is now the natural political home for conspiracy theorists, misogynists, and supporters of terrorism.Yet some in the party think the project might yet succeed,only a suitably hard left leader can be found.Shadow chancellor John McDonnellwas once the leader of the opposition’s closest ally. They were politically inseparable. Now, McDonnell is said to have been cut off by Corbyn and the cabal of Stalinist half-wits who continue to indulge fantasies of revolution that surrounds him.McDonnell, say sources, is prepared to see his “comrade” replaced so long as he remains shadow chancellor and favoured acolytes such as shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey and justice spokesman Richard Burgon are protected.That’s quite the list of demands. McDonnell is every bit as culpable as Corbyn for the parlous position in which the Labour Party finds itself Long-Bailey and Burgon would both make excellent answersthe quiz show Pointless ever demanded of contestants that they name a stupid MP. While Corbyn – a career-long Eurosceptic – has preicated on the issue of Brexit , the Liberal Democrats have won increasing support for their absolute clarity on the issue. The Lib Dems have bounced back from the damage inflicted upon them for their  coalition deal with the Conservative by asserting themselves, credibly, as the party for those who believe Brexit represents an act of national self-harm.Squirming Corbynistas may have argued that Labour had no choice but to tailor its message to include those who voted, in , to leave the EU, but this ignored the reality that Eurosceptics are already catered for by Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party and the Tory right wing.Corbyn’s fence-sitting didn’t enable the Labour Party to reach out to Leavers and Remainers alike, it merely earned him the contempt of both.There are many excellent reasons why Corbyn should be replaced as leader of the opposition. The issue of his handling of Brexit aside, these reasons existed long before he was put in charge of the Labour Party by fools who believed a nonsensical narrative of him being the champion of a “kinder politics”. Corbyn’s impressively consistent record of associating with racists and anti-Semites, of giving succour to terrorists, and of promoting a hard-left ideology that should have died with the Soviet Union all screamed out his complete unsuitability for the job.And this, surely, is why any attempt by Corbyn’s fellow travellers to continue their project is doomed. Merely getting rid of the leader will not change the culture of the modern Labour Party. If Corbyn is nudged out but McDonnell is allowed to remain, dictating terms, those who indulge this strategy will be rats repainting a sinking ship.Corbyn and those who remain loyal to him have spent much of the past week sounding off about a newspaper article which reported the view of anonymous civil servants that he is not physically or intellectually equipped to become prime minister. I’ve no doubt this was deeply distressing for members of the cult to read but that serious people hold these opinions should hardly surprise them.Corbyn is frequently absent when he should be leading. As the Tory Party contorts and fractures, Corbyn should be front and centre, making the case for a trustworthy alternative. Instead, he’s nowhere to be seen.And when the leader of the opposition does offer himself up for interview, we can be sure it won’t be long before he reminds us of his inadequacies. Short-tempered and condescending, Corbyn chips away at the myth of greatness – promoted by his supporters – every time he opens his mouth.Throughout the Corbyn fiasco, the deputy leader of the Labour Party, Tom Watson, has tried to limit the damage. Watson, now openly contemptuous of his boss, has shown leadership on both Brexit and the anti-Semitism crisis. Wherever Corbyn has failed, Watson has done right.For his troubles, Watson is a target of the Labour left who see his efforts to save his party as a direct challenge to their chosen one.If Labour is to survive as a viable political force, Corbyn must be deposed, sooner rather than later, and any MP who has helped sustain him over the past four years should be exiled to the back-benches.Many on the Labour left now realise Jeremy Corbyn is damaging their party. But until they realise that they, too, are part of the problem, Labour will remain unelectable. ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"joe nicchi is global hero for taking on corrupt influencers stephen jardine","story":"Beware social media #influencers# who trade good reviews for free stuff, writes Stephen Jardine as he welcomes the global backlash sparked by an ice cream seller in Los Angeles, who has sworn neer to give free ice cream in exchange for publicity.All good food reviewers live by one simple rule. They always pay their way. The best book a table anonymously and do everything possible to make their visit a fair representation of the experience offered by that restaurant. That is why we trust what they tell us.At the other end of the scale are the new breed of Instagram influencers. Some take the same approach as traditional reviewers, posting their visit in an open, fair and honest way. Others are less scrupulous but they are now being served their just deserts.This week Joe Nicchi went viral in a way Instagram influncers can only dream about. However Joe isn’t a millennial with a shiny new laptop. Instead he runs a popular retro ice cream truck in Los Angeles. Sickened by endless approaches from so-called influencers eager to endorse his brand online in exchange for free ice cream, Joe decided to settle the matter for once and for all with his own instagram post. “I will never give you a free ice cream in exchange for a post,” he vowed. Instead, from now on, “influencers pay double”. It was a bold move in a city obsessed with image but as Joe pointed out, online likes don’t pay the bills.: Why NHS fears celebrity ‘influencers’ are damaging children’s health – Stephen Jardine: As a GP, I’m shocked by dreadful health advice from ‘influencers’ – Dr Punam KrishanHis tactic paid off big time with messages of support from other business owners around the world. His social media following has shot up to the point where, ironically, he now has more followers than many of the Instagram effluencers who pestered him for freebies. For some big brands, a relationship with someone on Instagram who has a large following in their target market can be a useful marketing tool. Unfortunately small brands without the budget or need are also now being targetted by hucksters who buy fake followers from China and Russia and spend their days trawling the internet dangling meaningless exposure in exchange for free things.Thankfully the world of Instagram influence is already starting to eat itself. Earlier this year a vegan raw food blogger with two million followers was branded a fake after a video caught her happily sitting down to eat a plate of fish. Last month we had the influencer who shared her apparently surprise engagement which was then shown to have been part of an elaborate marketing campaign to have her wedding paid for. On Instasham, much is not quite what it seems.Ice cream Joe has been one of the first to break the culture of silence around all this but he won’t be the last. This week two UK wedding photographers shared online a remarkable exchange they’d had with an influencer seeking £, worth of photography and video in exchange for endorsement. When they declined the opportunity, they were branded unprofessional and a lot worse.At the end of the day, a few online narcissists seeking free ice cream or wedding photos should generate more pity than resentment. However there is something more worrying about all this. In a world where fake news is a growing problem, who we can trust and why we can trust them is more important than ever before.

Children should not be pushed into anything, including consumption.The reason the older generation are skeptical, they#ve seen it all before.You#ve been reading the Mail again, Ali!For goodness sake, Brian, learn some basic simple science and stop the socialist dogma. Daily Mail!! grow up. Ask yourself the following question, how does today#s GlobalWarming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age  Anyone who cannot answer that question is too ignorant to hold an informed opinion on today#s climate change.Stops PC Plod and the band of merry men, from going in with batons to quell the grown-ups waffling on about, why their leader Comrade Corbyn inspires them with his words.How about giving them a half decent education concentrating on sciencesubjects. Then they would have an informed and considered opinion, not just the usual Greenwash so popular with the ignorant. If gted they may even go on to contribute with useful research and technological ideas so unlike are present green, ignorant and wholly ill-informed flock in thecouncil chamberAn area of industry which has not been looked into with any proper statistical information is thisof Agriculture. This industry produces more green house gases than the all of transportation. In fact, it is several times greater than transportation. The catch  scenario is this industry has had no regulation or legislation is regard to reducing greenhouse gases, infact, due to population growth, the pollution created by agriculture is vastly on the increase. Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form. One of mine wanted to go, the other didn#t. One asked a question at the Town Hall and I am very proud # not that she had to protest # but that she had the courage to do so, and silence many there.Well done young folk # out of the mouths of babes as they say.It hardly takes any courage to join a protest, especially one being encouraged and congratulated onby so many folk! The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view. Jumping headlong onto the bandwagon is easy, understanding the science and striving to do something about it the hard bit. Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid.Especially a meaningless strike from school, what child would not love a day off among mates  No doubt the pig ignorant and stupid will be so impressed. A bit like supergluing yourself tp a bus or train, outstanding!!!I didnt say it took courage to join a protest, I said it takes courage to speak at the Town Hall. Andit was about time off school, they all would have gone. Please have more respect for our bairns and young folk.And these bairns are, for your information, studying the stem subjects at school.It is not a case of having respect for the bairns, Johan Adamson. It is just a case of having absolutely no respect whatsoever for those who politicise them and drive them like sheep. Primary children used in a political strike!! Repulsive behaviour, you should be ashamed, so socialist, child exploitation is the words that come to mind.They had to complete a form, primary children! What next, form a political Union and become militant  Little Orwellian sheep bleating for the Pigs.These were AHS pupils Ian, not primary pupils, and no one has politicised them.Educated them yes, but then I forgot you have the monopoly on climate change education and stem subjects.The organisers were I think over , so young adults.The fact is I will always criticise revolting behaviourand ignorance and I am not referring to the children.Yes I do believe sixth year pupils are capable of organising thisWhy do you assume Ian that these bairns are not studying stem subjects and that only you know about climate change then Ian Infantile comments  Pot kettle springs to mind.Now just who printed these forms the children had to fill in  Which teachers OKed the strike and arrange for Brae and Aith schools also took part, as well as bairns from the Sound Primary School and organised and paid for transport  I do not believe that was AHS sixteen-year-olds for one second.Whether by accident or design this provides a very convenient fig leaf for the council#s lamentable performance on child poverty.Much was made of the #children#s march# at the SIC#s education committee meeting today however in a news report about the part of the same meeting that dealt with the council#s child poverty action report, it was clear that the council have done next to nothing since the Shetland Inequalities Commission reported in March .know. All these admirable young citizens are guilty of is taking a stand based on commonly accepted information. I could ask what special knowledge does Ian think he has that allows him to lord it over them# but nerves fail me.On Ian’s earlier point, it is self-evident thatwe need some people with a high level of competence in STEM subjects who can take critical stand on matters scientic. Gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included! Learners on this path can also become alert to common logical fallacies. Even those who like Ian, with a preference for physical sciences, can benefit. Happily don’t need to be much of a scholar to spot an ad hominem attack. With all due respect for Ian’s past achievements in the physical sciences, it would be nicehe could make his points without belittling others #kids included. That’s a normal standard “of decency and tolerance” btw.I so agree with these word #gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included!#. You do so hold yourself in such regard high Peter, now go glue yourself to a train or bus to prove your point!But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of- #Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!# It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse ”.And what are you doing Ian to save the planet And what would you suggest the AHS and the SIC do Ad Hominem attacks # playing the man not the ball # are often used by those who don’t have much of an argument to begin with. Instead of dealing with whether the young people have a point or not, generous-spirited Ian opted to have a go instead.Logical fallacies show lazy thinking, masking an absence of creativity and independent thought. Ian’s trollswipe above looks Ad Hominem in approach st first, but he is also using the Tu Quoque Fallacy. This is where you accuse the opponent of hypocrisy to avoid answering their charge. Self-effacing Ian thus avoids addressing the possibility of his own hubris or lack of self-knowledge.Should I have made things easier for him and asked what his actual beef with the climate protestors was  He says “Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid”and demands that everyone should be able to answer “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ” before taking a view. Perhaps he will educate us by answering his own question # sticking to terms that demonstrate tolerance and decency of course. Nuclear Free Council, Declair Climate emergency,climate justice what a load of utter bunkum. Especially stop allowing political activists to exploit our children.I put forward the question : Is nuclear power the only solution to stop greenhouse gas emissions and the only way to stop climate change progressing further  It may be the worse case scenario in terms of our power demand solution, but what are the alternatives to our demand for energy without causing further environmental and ecological damage to the planet by in using fossil fuels or cleaner alternatives like wind or solar   It has been suggested the Sahara Desert could be used for solar energy to power Europe, but how much land would be required and could this be expanded  The alternatives to fossil fuels may be cleaner, but how would this affect global weather patterns or the depletion of species due to the destruction of natural habitats being replaced for energy production Very sadly the SG SNP has committed to wind energy with its catastrophic environmental damage and only intermittent supply, but that is the policy of the scientically ignorant and utterly stupid.Thank you for your comments, Ian. I fear humanity will have no choice but to go nuclear for its energy production in the future.Alternative resources, like wind or solar, may be the short term answer, but as mentioned, the downside to this is the large amount of land which will be required with the ability to vastly expand as demand increases. What would be the environmental damage and the destabilization of le on the planet have in the long term with such technologies  There is also the issue of economics dictating progress on future energy production, and would this be counter-productive due profits taking priority over progress and the reduction of the pollution into the environment  I agree with your comments Ian, in regard to nuclear based energy production. However, like many issues to do with progress, something catastrophic will have to take place before we realize we should have acted sooner.There it is again, the abusive and arguably ignorant use of that word “stupid”. Having reread all contributions above it seems Ali denies there’s a problem by saying there are dangerously low CO levels, John distracts by arguing the council should care more for child poverty, and Ian disparages, disparages and disparages again. Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet Ian’s singular approach is getting between him and his key message. I’ve long been puzzling as to what makes the good doctorso determined to overuse petty insult so freely, but it would be helpful to know just whathis specic problem with climate change protests is. If he could but answer his own Ice Age question to Brian , his motive might become a little clearer. And apologies in advance to Ianhe has already made his point and I’ve missed it, but it wasn’t me who thought it smart to surround it with invective. Wouldn’t it be just lovelyIan could contribute tolerantly without using putdowns  It’s almost as though he needs them to build himself up# Oh. Hold on# Eureka!#Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet # What a plonker, Peter, just cannot resist going political. Is thisLabour or SNP talking, he often points in both directions or is he now Green Maybe the characters on here who hate the idea of young people protesting about climate change should head down to the school and start shouting some of this stuff over the wall.But, then again, that might make them see . . . well . . . insane.Folk writing to the paper to have a go at the protesters is one of the most depressing contributions to local public debate imaginable.Hopefully, though, the usual naysayerswill only encourage them to do it more.There#s nothing wrong with anyone, of any age, having an opinion on whatever they like, and expressing it. But in their own time, only.The problem with this is that participation in this protest was permitted and facilitated,not encouraged by the education authority, which by default is an endorsement of the opinion being expressed in the protest and the timing method by which the protest was made, by the education authority.Education authorities and schools are supposed to be impartial, by granting #authorised absence# status to a politically motivated protest, that impartiality is now seriously called in to question and a dangerous precedent has been set.There was no reason other than a cynical publicity stunt for this protest to take place during the school day. If those still at school feel strongly enough to organise a protest like adults do, that#s fine, let them, but also like adults, it#ll have to happen in their own time, or they suffer the consequences of #unauthorised absence#, for it to be taken seriously.If they want to play in the big bad world, they play by the big bad world#s rules, not by special favours like this was.Only a few nutters are #impartial# about climate change these days.Do you mean that civil disobedience would have been better Well said Mark! The evident concern trollingis intended to deligitimise the voice of young people who, lets remember, are meant by right to have a say in matters that concern them. Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens. Therefore no one involved in supporting the reported protest has done any wrong, other than in the eyes of seemingly knee-jerk reactionaries who may well be hiding their true motives. Artfully comparing these identiable young people to Orwell’s unthinking farm animals, in order to subvert their point# well it more than lacks sensitivity and compassion. It is desperate, pitul and contemptible in equal measure. It may well also fall foul of observing normal standards of decency and tolerance that contributors to these pagesare meant to adhere to. Those joining the protest were not “stupid”, as has been claimed above. The overuse of that intolerant word may be though. I note you mention #Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens.# now could you explain how taking time off school and striking for the declaration of aclimate emergency makes the child an active and responsible global citizen  I rather feel they are being played by our Greeny ignoramuses and SNP political propagandists!

Calum McAuley, an apprentice with Braid Electrical Services, won ‘Apprentice of the Year’.And Jordan Haggan, apprentice electrician with Alexander Bonar  Co, was highly commended in the same category. They were nominated for the accolade alongside another three of their College colleagues. The Northern Ireland Electrical Awards, which represent the pinnacle achievement for the electrical industry in Northern Ireland, recognise and reward the achievements of those working in the province’s erse electrical sector. Organised by the Electrical Magazine and judged by an independent  of respected industry experts, the awards collectively recognise the achievements of both companies and iniduals. Sean McAleese, Training Manager at Northern Regional College, said they are thrilled that the hard work and talent of so many of their apprentices are being recognised at these awards.“We have worked closely with local employers over many years to ensure we are equipping our students with industry-level skills, and these invaluable relationships help us to ensure our students receive training at the very highest level,” he said.Apprentice of the Year Calum, who is currently enrolled on a Level  electrical installation programme, said he always wanted to be an electrician.“I’ve always tried, both in College and on-site, to achieve the very highest standards, in everything I do,” said Calum. “It’s great to have all that hard work and effort recognised with an award like this one.”Jordan Haggan, , said from the outset of his career he spent a lot of time working alongside electricians.“But it took me a while to make the leap of faith and pursue it as a career myself. I thought it was too late to start but the apprenticeship has opened new doors for me, and I really enjoy the work I do and am proud of the new skills I’ve developed,” he said.“This award is really just the icing on the cake for me and it means a lot to be recognised for my hard work.”The  Electrical Awards took place recently at the Crowne Plaza Hotel, in Belfast.

Like many people in our society, it has been irrevocably marked by our recent conflict, during which he suffered several personal tragedies, including the death of his eldest sibling, Patsy Quinn – a -year-old IRA volunteer who was killed in action in .Around two years after his brother’s death, Frankie managed to join the IRA, aged , by lying about his age. Many of his subsequent years were spent between being on the run and terms of imprisonment in Portlaoise Gaol, Mountjoy Gaol, Crumlin Road Gaol and the barbarity of Long Kesh. It is these stark experiences, as well as the beautully normal experiences of love, nature, and joy that shape his incredible new book of poetry, ‘Open Gates’.“I found that poetry was a way of expressing some grief,” Frankie said.“It’s a way for me to write down some of my feelings. It was a bit of escapism as well because you can be anonymous in a poem too.“A lot of my poetry would consist of things I was going through personally and things I have watched other people go through. There is a lot of political writing in it – I like to write about Bobby Sands, the hunger strikers, about imprisonment and Irish freedom. There is also a lot of romantic stuff, and some nature poetry.”Despite his current poetic talents, Frankie had little academic success at school, and was barely able to read or write in early adulthood. It was during his time in Portlaoise Prison in the s that he began reading again and studying for his O-Levels. Later while in Long Kesh, he began studying at the Open University and began studying poetry with visiting poetry lecturer, Medbh McGuckian.“Medhb was an influence who came into the jail’s education system and taught some of us and helped some of us create better poems and structure them properly,” Frankie explained.“I had very little education in school. I actually went to school in Belfast, St. Anne’s in Finaghy and then I was a first year in De La Salle, and then we were burnt out of our home in Finaghy. When we were put out by loyalists mobs we went back to Tyrone where my family were from. You’ll find some of that in my writing too.”During his time in prison he read a lot of poems and writings of fellow Irish writers. Some would have a profound impact on him, while others, where deemed modern greats, elicited his criticism.“I’ve read Pearse, and even Yeats, who lived through part of our conflict but never wrote anything about it,” he said.“I see something similar in Seamus Heaney’s poems, which I’ve read a lot of. I haven’t seen a poem about Francie Hughes, who was his next-door neighbour. I think Danny Morrison confronted him about that on a train and I think Heaney said ‘ I was ever going to write about him, I won’t do it now’. People like Danny, and Tim Brannigan and all of those people with a disposition for writing encouraged me a bit. Turlough Connolly would be another person, who was educated in Oxford – he was a very intelligent man who was inside with us as well. Pat Sheehan is another one who would have encouraged our writing.”From his first personal poetry collections – pages glued to the glossy covers of old Open University covers bearing the Long Kesh stamp – to his new book of poems, Frankie’s personal and literary journey is a fascinating one. His works have seen him give talks in and Paris, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dublin, and Cork, with further success undoubtedly on the horizon. However, for Frankie his poetry is all about further understanding, creativity and emotional expression.“Poetry, from a revolutionary perspective, is very important as well. It has an awful lot to add to people’s understanding and struggle. Each poem that is written has a certain message, hidden or otherwise, about certain events. It’s good for people to be able to draw them out. One of my poems is called ‘Hunger’ where I talk about the crystallising of sands, but it’s actually about Bobby Sands and the Palestinian hunger strikers – it’s a play on words. It links the whole lot together and gives a political perspective.”He continued: “It doesn’t matter to meI don’t make a penny out my poetry – it’s all about understanding. There’s a lot of deep emotional stuff there about mental struggle from when I was in solitary confinement. I was in solitary confinement for around four years.“There is certain post traumatic stress that I would deal with, and there is a lot of people in West Belfast and others places here that would have that and they don’t even know it. I like people like that to sit down and be able to read something that they can grasp.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"balmoral master chef provides boost for guide dogs ni","story":"WITH entries for the Balmoral Hotel’s Master*Chef compet-ition drawing to a close on Friday, the competition to find Ireland’s next top chef could also have a positive lasting impact on the work of its charity partner, Guide Dogs NI.Through their efforts, Guide Dogs NI help change the way sight loss affects people’s lives by ensuring that they can get out and about on their own terms. This involves tireless campaigning, fundraising, and, of course, as Guide Dogs NI Engagement Officer, Hannah Lyons explains, the support of iniduals and businesses such as the Balmoral Hotel on the Blacks Road.“It’s wonderful that the Balmoral Hotel have chosen us as their charity partners,” she says.“We are really excited for the upcoming Master*Chef. Fundraising is integral to all of the work that we do. It costs around £, to support a guide dog from birth to retirement. We cover their whole working le as a guide dog including the cost of their food and ongoing training. “Guide dogs are le changing, but there is a lot of work involved in it, so it is essential to have the support from iniduals or organisations like the Balmoral.”As well as raising funds, the Master*Chef competition will also help raise awareness of the work Guide Dogs NI do and inform people of some of struggles faced by the visually impaired.“Our ambition is for a future where everybody with sight loss has the confidence and support to live their lives to the full,” Hannah explains. “A big part of it is access to and experience of services such as shops, bars, hotels and restaurants. We talk about the ‘purple pound’, which is the spending power of anybody living with a disability. We always say that it shouldn’t be underestimated. If someone living with sight loss has a positive experience when they are out and about with any service provider then they are going towith their loyalty and spending power.“We’re quite fortunate here in Northern Irelandthat businesses are supportive on the whole, but we just need to keep that message current and keep it at the forefront of people’s mind. Businesses need to be actively welcoming visitors with disabilities because it isn’t just the right thing to do, it also makes business sense.”While there is still plenty of work to be done in making the North of Ireland disability friendly, Guide Dogs NI have helped drive through some vital changes. “We’re somewhat dferent to our counterparts across the water because they’re still campaigning on some of the things that we already have such as audiovisual on buses and disability awareness training for taxi drivers here,” Hannah says.“We have those things in place, so we are lucky in that respect. One of the big things we’re working on at the minute is our pavement parking campaign. Parking is a problem throughout the country but because of rising congestion levels it’s getting worse. It can really negatively impact on somebody’s day when someone un-thoughtfully abandons their car and that visually impaired person then has to turn back or make the decisionthey should walk into the road to complete their journey. That’s a level of stress and anxiety that nobody should have to deal with.”Training guide dogs is, of course, a key part of the charity’s work, but they are now asking for volunteers to become sighted guides for people with visual impairment. “A guide dog sometimes isn’t for everyone and that’s why My Guide is our free service that enables people with a vision impairment to get out of their homes and into the community,” Hannah explains.“With a volunteer as their sighted guide, they can overcome challenges presented by unfamiliar places or crowded areas, enjoy exploring and becoming involved in their local communities and ultimately become more independent. “We provide all the volunteer trainingand ask for a commitment of a few hours once a week to help someone with a visual impairment to get out and about. There are people located across the whole of Northern Ireland currently waiting for a volunteer and it is truly such a rewarding role to take on.”If anyone is interested becoming a sited guide or wants to find out more, they can get in touch with the Guide Dogs NI team at Belfast@guidedogs.org.ukThe Master*Chef grand finale will take place as part of Féile an Phobail at the Balmoral Hotel on Wednesday th of August .For more information, see: balmoralhotelbelfast pro-masterchef"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screenshot-2019-07-02-at-11.22.45.png","title":"meet aaron flanagan","story":"In , Aaron Flanagan and his brother quit their ‘proper jobs’ to open Comic Book Guys, Northern Ireland#s largest independent comic book store and the first-ever authorised CGC dealer.The one-stop shop located on Great VIctoria Street has been serving Belfast’s thriving comic book scene through golden, silver age, bronze to modern comics, movie memorabilia, toys, collectables and even comics made by local creators .In this week’s conversation, we chat all about serving a small market, the impact superhero movies have had on the industry, what it’s like to set up your own business and why a vintage medium like comic books are still thriving today.Check it out.

It’s asthe politics has almost been taken out of Northern Ireland a wee bit,\" the Coleraine actor said. data-dfpadtargetingJames Nesbitt and Jim Dornan\"Now it’s coming back of course, as we approach the flags and all that, but I think people are much more in a place now where they are united by their despair at the fact that the government’s sat empty for  and a half years.”Nesbitt told thethat he believed the current governance structures were \"not working\" and that the promises of the Good Friday Agreement had not been delivered upon.He called for Northern Irelands future to be decided by civic society, rather than politicians.Nesbitt expressed a belief that a border poll \"is going to happen at some point\" and said that there was a need to commission research from independent experts on what changes to Northern Ireland could mean in practice.“I think we have to accept that this is where Northern Ireland is and people need to be informed, rather than just having two sides saying it’s this or it’s that. People need fact-based evidence to look at,” he said.The Bloody Sunday actor said there was a need to move away from terms like united Ireland. data-dfpadtargetingJames Nesbitt in Bloody Sunday“I think one of the great challenges and actually one of the great opportunities is to start getting away from language that is incendiary,\" Nesbitt said.He said that a \"new union of Ireland\" could appeal to Protestants.\"People from the North, of my tradition, would feel that they have their identity, that it is in no way threatened, that they have an equal voice, that they are part of a society that is progressive, inclusive, erse,\" Nesbitt said.\"That they have prosperity, that they’re not marginalised, and that they can be proud to be from the north of Ireland in a new union of Ireland.”“Among my friends, who are all boys who are Protestants, well, men, we’re all , they would really consider now what the notion of a new union of Ireland might look like, and I think there’s a lot of people that think that.”Nesbitt stated that while he felt Northern Ireland was not necessarily a sectarian place \"the politics here are sectarian\".“I think that’s what most people are now beginning to challenge and I think that is the key. I think it’s moved on hugely from being a sectarian place, but I don’t think the politics has moved on from being sectarian,” he said.While the actor accepts that is plan is ambitious, he remains optimistic about its prospects.“This isn’t born out of politics, or indeed politicians.

I’m sorry to have to say it and maybe he will prove me wrong but I think the dficulty is that so much depends on trust when you have a leader.“Sometimes a leader has to encourage people to take on trust that he is saying one thing – and I’m afraid this is the art of politics – but might do another.“But the dficulty with Boris Johnson is that, amiable and enjoyable company though he can often be, he is, in my mind, entirely untrustworthy.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38230335.ece/32d42/BINARY/M2_crash.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest updates","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It’s not the Labour way and I deplore it. https:t.co bomggQJp— Tom WatsonJuly , A letter is reported to warn that the party “cannot be expected to and will not tolerate its former employees wantonly disregarding their obligations by selectively leaking information to the media”.Another former aide also received warnings last year from a dferent law firm representing Labour, the paper said.Mr Watson said: “Using expensive media lawyers in attempt to silence staff members is as futile as it is stupid.“It’s not the Labour way and I deplore it.”In a further sign of unrest, the Sunday Times reported that two of Mr Corbyn’s closet allies in the shadow cabinet, John McDonnell and Diane Abbott, have called on Mr Corbyn to sack key members of his inner circle – chief of staff Karie Murphy and communications and strategy chief Seumas Milne.Mr McDonnell rejected the claims, insisting he had not called for anyone to be sacked.He told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: “I have confidence in them, of course I do. I have not told anyone to be sacked or anything like that.”\"Im sick of it\" - Barry Gardiner heatedly dodges questions about ides in the Labour Party. #RidgeFollow Sunday politics live here: https:t.co yWVccVGmx pic VjnJCvFfPx— Ridge on SundayJuly , In an effort to play down the row, shadow cabinet minister Barry Gardiner said: “The idea that they put forward that there’s a civil war in the Labour Party – let’s look at the real ide in this country.“The real ide in this country is not within the Labour Party, the real ide in this country is between what the Conservatives are trying to do with our country and the rest.”He also defended the party’s use of gagging clauses, insisting they were not being used to cover up wrongdoing.The shadow international trade secretary said: “We absolutely do not use gagging orders to hide anything that is illegal or improper.“We use gagging orders only to stop former members of staff from leaking confidential information where we have an obligation to protect iniduals and for doing that in a party political or partisan way for political purposes.”He said he would welcome “any objective, impartial investigation that’s going to help us to get rid of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party” but “my understanding of this programme is that has not been balanced and impartial in that way”.It involved talking to former party staff members who had a “political axe to grind”, he claimed.The BBC documentary, entitled Is Labour Anti-Semitic , will see reporter John Ware explore the ongoing anti-Semitism row, and will feature interviews from “key insiders”, according to the programme synopsis.A spokesman for the show said: “The Labour Party is criticising a programme they have not seen.“We are confident the programme will adhere to the BBC’s editorial guidelines. In line with those, the Labour Party has been given the opportunity to respond to the allegations.”The party is also struggling to reach a united policy on Brexit, with Mr Corbyn expected to have further consultations with trade union bosses about Labour’s stance on another referendum.“I would vote Remain, I would want to campaign for Remain”Shadow Chancellor @johnmcdonnellMP tells #marr that Labour Brexit policy is still developing as Jeremy Corbyn wants “to build consensus” pic GRWOTMCL— BBC PoliticsJuly , In March, Mr Gardiner had said that Labour is “not a Remain party now”, but he told Sky News: “We have always been a remain and reform party. We tried to reconcile ourselves with what the democratic will of the people was at that referendum and we tried to do that sincerely.“But we have always said we would not accept a no deal.“We now have two Conservative putative prime ministers who are saying they are happy to take us out on a no deal.”Mr McDonell said Labour had to decide on its Brexit policy “sooner rather than later” because the new prime minister could call a snap election.Mr McDonnell said he would vote to stay in the EU in another referendum and “would want to campaign for Remain”.He told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show that Jeremy Corbyn was consulting trade unions and there would be further shadow cabinet discussions to decide the party’s stance.“I actually think he is doing the right thing. Everything about Jeremy is about building consensus and I think on this issue you need to bring people with you.”"},{"url":null,"title":"wreaths laid on 14th anniversary of 77","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The leaders of EU institutions are supposed to impartially represent the interests of all member nations globally and in Brussels.Some leaders discussed the roster of upcoming vacancies, which also include the EU’s top diplomat, the president of the European Parliament and the chief of the European Central Bank , on the sidelines of the Group of  summit in Japan that concluded on Saturday.Mr Tusk wants nominations to be wrapped up soon, seeking to prevent further erosion of public confidence in the EU amid Brexit uncertainty and intra-bloc isions over managing migration.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  European Council president Donald Tusk, left, with Renew Europe party member Guy Verhofstadt There was hope at the previous summit on June - that more time would clary who should replace Mr Juncker.

The parliament must endorse that choice. But the assembly has insisted that only the lead candidates from parties that ran in last month’s elections should be eligible for the post.“The lead candidates is not the only criteria,” said Mr Conte.The commission proposes and enforces EU laws on policies ranging from the massive single market to agriculture spending, and from competition issues to immigration.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker The job responsibilities are huge: Mr Tusk and Mr Juncker negotiate with the likes of US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, while the head of the ECB can set monetary policy for the  nations that use the shared euro currency.The outgoing group of EU officials was lopsidedly Italian, with Antonio Tajani holding the parliament top post, Mario Draghi head of the ECB and Federica Mogherini the EU foreign policy chief.Top candidates include current prime ministers Stefan Lofven of Sweden and Andrej Plenkovic of Croatia.

Others recruited and trained the teams of young people or provided legal, financial and insurance support for the project.On the afternoon of June , , , young people mdash aged between  and  mdash assembled at Delamont to finally pull the largest megalith in the United Kingdom and Ireland into place.Over the preceding months, the volunteers, recruited from schools and youth groups from all over Northern Ireland, had attended numerous training sessions in preparation for the event..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch student has a royal date with duchess  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH teenager who battled mental health issues celebrated his th birthday with the ultimate party mdash a date with the Duchess of Cambridge at Kensington Palace.Cathal McCann, who attends St Malachyrsquos High School in Castlewellan, was invited to the palace after he was helped through a mental health crisis by Action for Children Northern Irelandrsquos Blues Programme.His mum, Mandy, said: ldquoHe wouldnrsquot even be here todayit wasnrsquot for Action for Children so to celebrate by meeting Duchess Kate is the icing on the cake.ldquoHe was very low and even self-harming.

It was particularly hot in qualying, so I was delighted to have strung a lap together to get pole position by quite a good margin.Harper knew that a good start was important and thatrsquos what he got.ldquoI knew that getting to the first corner in the lead was crucial in race one and fortunately I achieved it.ldquoFrom there, I got a two second gap quite quickly and then focused on maintaining that to the finish, he said..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Devoted couple celebrate 67th wedding anniversary  ","story":"AFTER  years of wedded bliss, Downpatrick couple Aidan and Frances Vaughan still hold hands when they watch television together.The devoted pair celebrated their latest matrimonial milestone last week with a special dinner at the Burrendale Hotel in Newcastle with their seven adult sons and daughters.Aidan, now aged  and Frances at , want to make each passing year count and ensure that their anniversary was marked.Their marriage has created an ever-growing lineage of  grandchildren and  great-grandchildren.ldquoI would do it all again tomorrow as Aidan has been a great husband and good father, said Frances.ldquoHe was always very respectful and gentlemanly and never raised his voice to me or the children.And as for Aidan, when asked what attracted him to Frances, he answered: ldquoWell, she was a very good looking girl and still is.

He also pointed out that gold was more common in Ireland during the Bronze Age than in most other parts of Europe.The jury concluded that the fastener had been intentionally hidden or concealed and therefore declared it treasure trove.Although young Elizabeth is likely to receive compensation for discovering the fastener, the coroner ruled that it becomes the property of the Queen and will be handed over to the Treasury.ARDGLASS mdash A verdict of death by misadventure was recorded on a  year-old man whose body was found washed up at Ardglass in February this year after the boat on which he was fishing sank.An inquest jury at Downpatrick on Thursday heard how James Edward Greer, of Elmfield Park, Donaghadee, had been held up in the water for about  minutes by his skipper, who eventually had to let go of him.The badly decomposed body of Mr Greer, who could not swim, was washed up at Sheepland Begg on February .The skipper of the boat said he held the deceased for about five minutes after their vessel was hit by a big wave off Peel in the Isle of Man.He tried to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, but Mr Greer was unconscious and after another ten minutes he had to get him go because he himself was in danger.

The scheme was originally due to complete at the end of March.Signicant problems which delayed the scheme which the government department described as ldquounforeseen works issues included the discovery of asbestos piping by BT Openreach along both sides of Irish Street, delaying progress by eight weeks.Contractors also encountered problems with the foundations of the old blast wall at the former PSNI station and part of the Irish Street sewerage network.While traders were fully supportive of the regeneration scheme, they expressed anger that the project took more than twice as long to complete than originally planned and that they were not better informed by the government department.In addition, many have expressed surprise at the design of the scheme which has resulted in the narrowing of one of the townrsquos main streets at its junction with John Street and a loss of parking spaces.A number of traders have also questioned why a second footpath has been provided on one side of Irish Street given one was already in place.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said traders, shoppers and residents will be pleased that Irish Streetrsquos two-way traffic flow has been reinstated and hoped that ldquovaluable lessons will have been learned by all those involved with the public realm scheme.Ahead of work on a planned upgrade of the Collinsrsquo Corner junction in Downpatrick, which is due to start shortly, he also hopes businesses and residents affected by the work will be provided with regular updates.Five roads converge at the busy junction where roads officials plan to upgrade traffic signals and introduce a new one-way system in Lower Stream Street.The Killough Road merges with Pound Lane, Stream Street, Irish Street and St Patrickrsquos Avenue with Cllr Curran hoping disruption will be kept to a minimum.ldquoGiven the nature of this particular junction and the huge volume of traffic it handles on a daily basis, disruption is inevitable, he said.ldquoWhile it is important that road users remain patient and obey any temporary traffic flows which may be in place, roads officials must keep people informed.Cllr Curran added: ldquoWhat happened in Irish Street must not and cannot be repeated.

If Fascism hadnrsquot been beaten we would be living in a very dferent world today. ldquoWe would be living in fear of a regime which would not tolerate any descent. We are very lucky and should be thankful to those veterans who risked all and gave their tomorrow for our today.Cllr Hanna said the districtrsquos surviving veterans were small in number and well into their nineties, and that society owed a debt to them for their part in the battle to secure the freedom people enjoy today.He said he included the Merchant Navy in his proposal because many risked their lives on merchant ships to ferry supplies which helped win the war.ldquoThis was a cruel war where many lost their lives and I really hope we never have to face anything like this again. Those from Northern Ireland who fought and served during World War Two came from all sections of the community.ldquoBefore it is too late, I believe this council should acknowledge what these brave people did for us all by presenting surviving veterans with a silver poppy at a cross community service in November, said Cllr Hanna.He added: ldquoI hope that the council will support this motion as a mark of respect for the generation which has given us freedoms we take for granted.The SDLPrsquos Declan McAteer said he was ldquosomewhat dubious about the suggestion for the council ldquoto go out on a limb and procure silver poppy medals.ldquoI fully respect the sentiment of those wishing to identy with what is essentially a British symbol which wonrsquot by endorsed by all Irish men or women. The poppy, for better or worse, is associated with all conflicts that Britain was involved in from the First World War right through.ldquoI would say that perhaps thatwe do anything around this we take a lead from the British Legion in Ireland which decided on a shamrock poppy which has been worn by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.Cllr McAteer proposed that the issue be referred to the local authorityrsquos Good Relations Forum, with Sinn Feinrsquos Mickey Ruane in agreement.Cllr Ruane said he was respectful of the motion Cllr Hanna and his party had tabled, suggesting the Good Relations Forum was the ldquoideal committee to send the issue to.He added: We need to look at this issue and decide what event we are going to have and come to a respectful decision.At the debate conclusion, Cllr Hanna reaffirmed he had no issue referring his proposal for further debate, highlighting the need for the matter to be dealt with quickly.He also said he had no dficulty with awarding veterans a shamrock, suggesting that they could perhaps be offered the chance of being awarded this or a poppy..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New civic amenity centre set to open in Downpatrick  ","story":"DOWNPATRICKrsquoS new civic amenity centre is scheduled to open later this month.The new site at the Flying Horse Road on the outskirts of the town will replace the nearby Cloonagh Road facility which has been struggling for some time to keep pace with increasing demand.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is building the new centre which is larger than the current facility and will be able to handle considerably more waste. By , the local authority must recycle % of all its waste.Confirmation that the new centre is due to open in July came at last weekrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee when it was also revealed that new restrictions are to be introduced governing how much waste people can dump daily.Over recent years, modern civic amenity sites have been developed in Ballynahinch and in Castlewellan and councillors have been told that the new facility in Downpatrick will be one of the most up-to-date of its kind.Increasing numbers of people use the existing Cloonagh Road facility which council officials have been keen to replace for a number of years, but had dficulty securing an appropriate site.Last week, councillors agreed new rules and regulations governing how much waste can not only bd taken to civic amenity sites in Downpatrick, Newcastle and Ballynahinch, but how often.Council officials are keen to have the same rules applying across all amenity sites which is not currently the case, but this is set to change when the new facility at the Flying Horse Road opens shortly.One of the key changes will be the drive to reduce the amount of non-recyclable waste taken to the facilities which officials are confident will have a positive impact on budgets as less waste will need to be processed.A communications plan is also being devised ahead of the opening of the new Downpatrick facility and a period of grace will initially be in place until people become accustomed to the new rules governing their use.Commercial waste will be accepted at the new Flying Horse Road facility, but there will be no access for horse boxes and high sided trailers, with a restriction on the size of vehicles entering the facility.Ratepayers will not be permitted to take wheeled bins to the recycling centre with people also urged to sort their waste before arrival. In addition, new daily limits are to be imposed.They are no more than eight bags of non-recyclable and recyclable waste, five bulky items,  kilograms of rubble, one trailer of grass and two mattresses. Vans heavier than . tonnes will be permitted entry daily.Only hazardous waste will be accepted in Downpatrick to facilitate home and garage clear-outs with a pound. charge per tyre that is dumped. No more than four tyres can be dumped on the one day. Commercial vehicle tyres will not be accepted with a  litre limit on old paint tins per visit.Restrictions also apply to the amount of plasterboard and doors with people permitted to dump old kitchens only once every six months. Bathroom waste is restricted to ceramics, taps and shower glass with tiles classed as rubble waste.Oil tanks and drums are not permitted at any of the districtrsquos household recycling centres, alongside fluorescent tubes and liquid waste.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran welcomed the opening of the new facility.ldquoThere has been a need for this new centre for some considerable time and hopefully this investment will ensure people do not have to queue up to use it, he said.ldquoA large facility with increased skip capacity is exactly what is needed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Noel helps Saray join record books with Everest expedition  ","story":"DROMARA adventurer Noel Hanna has been stopped in his intrepid tracks mdash by an international incident between Iran and the US.He had planned to scale the highest volcano in Asia this month but the Iranian air strike against an US drone last month meant that diplomatic relations would be volatile in the coming weeks and months.The  year-old had planned to led a team of climbers up Mount Damavand in Iran, which stands at ,m.ldquoAfter the Iran drone strike and the US threatening to retaliate we were advised not even to think about it, said Noel.Noel spoke to the Recorder about his latest venture up Mount Everest when he led the first successful ascent of the worldrsquos highest mountain by a black woman.He and South African businesswoman Saray Khumalo made global headlines when they reached the top of the ,-metre high summit on May .It was Ms Khumalorsquos fourth attempt and Noelrsquos ninth successful ascent of Everest.Noel explained that he was asked to take Saray at the last moment when she became aware that another black African woman was also planning to climb Everest.ldquoSeveral months before the expedition started she came to me about doing Everest in . I knew she had been on the mountain three times before. ldquoBut then a week before we left, there were reports that another black woman mdash from Malawi, I think mdash was going to Everest and as Saray wanted to be the first African black woman, she asked me to take her on the May expedition.However, the achievement was marred by the loss of fellow Irish climber, Seamus Lawless, who fell to his death in a freak incident on the teamrsquos descent.Mr Lawless from Bray, Co Wicklow, was the first team member that Noel had lost on any expedition.Noel, Saray, Seamus and his climbing partner, Jenny Copeland, all reached the summit at .am, staying barely  minutes before making their descent.ldquoTo this day we donrsquot know what happened to Seamus and why it happened, said Noel.ldquoWe all had a near perfect climb but things started off badly on this expedition when we had just arrived in Nepal when a plane crashed and we had to help out.ldquoI hadnrsquot climbed with Seamus and Jenny before but I knew them from training with them. They had approached me about two years earlier to ask me to lead them up Everest in .ldquoFor me itrsquos a matter of getting every inidual up and back down again. We still had a dangerous part to get through the following day to camp two and then through the ice fault to base camp.ldquoSeamus pushed on ahead with the lead sherpa while I stayed behind with the two women climbers as they were going slower and had problems with their eye masks. We got into base camp about an hour later.

vow to support St Mary’s school  ","story":"PARENTS and teachers at St Maryrsquos Primary School in Saintfield have voiced their opposition to any plans to close or merge their school.Question marks over the future of the school have been raised in a recent report which highlighted its low admissions.However, a well attended meeting last week heard that the school has a vibrant future.Over  people filled the schoolrsquos assembly hall last Thursday and pledged to fight any closure or merger moves.St Maryrsquos is deemed to have sustainability issues according to the report drawn up by the Education Authority, which says the Catholic Council for Maintained Schools needs to carry out consultations over the next two years.Last weekrsquos meeting was attended by the school principal, Catherine Downey, teaching staff, classroom assistants and parents.Also present were the local parish priest, Fr Anthony McHugh, and the chairman of the board of governors, Mr Garry Hanna.Mr Hanna said he was reassured by the ldquounstinting support of parents for ldquothe outstanding Catholic provision currently in place at the school.Mr Hanna said St Maryrsquos, which opened its doors at the current site on the Old Grand Jury Road over  years ago, was a ldquowelcoming, all-inclusive and vibrant school in the heart of its community.He said pupils enjoyed a rich curriculum and benefited from strong links with the wider community.ldquoIn addition, they have a shared education partnership with Saintfield High School allowing pupils to avail of the wide range of facilities on offer at a post-primary level.Mr Hanna described the academic achievements of the pupils as outstanding and all children who sat transfer tests this year were successful in securing places at their chosen secondary schools.He said the small class sizes enhanced special educational provision and pastoral care, as well as the sense of community which existed in the school.ldquoParents have agreed the composite classes allowed their children to develop skills well beyond that expected of their age and older children are afforded meaningful leadership opportunities.Mr Hanna said parents at the meeting were keen to point out the ldquosuperb provision of extra-curricular provision activities, including ious musical and sporting opportunities.Mr Hanna said the school would work closely with the Education Authority and CCMS to seek a solution which would ldquoallow the long tradition of Catholic provision to continue in the school.Fr McHugh praised the loyalty and support of the ldquohard-working and dedicated staff and assured parents of his backing throughout the two-year consultation period which lies ahead.He said: ldquoIt is important the whole parish pull together in support of the continued Catholic education provided by St Maryrsquos.ldquoWe must quash rumours on impending closure and continue to allow our children to enjoy the rich educational experience offered in this very special school.Fr McHugh added: ldquoIt was reassuring to hear the voice of parents from neighbouring villages of Darragh Cross, Drumaness and Downpatrick who have chosen St Maryrsquos as the school to provide education to their children in the formative years.Two other local Catholic primary schools, St Josephrsquos Ballycruttle, and St Josephrsquos, Killough, have also been identied by the Education Authority as having sustainability issues.Annsborough Controlled Integrated Primary School, Blackwater Integrated College in Downpatrick and The High School,

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that. Under my leadership, thatrsquos exactly what would happen and whilst I do accept that there are dficult decisions to be taken, we have to take the public with us - not ignore their legitimate concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

People should be able to disagree with each other without resorting to abuse.Devolution is a journey not a destination. I am proud of what we have achieved over the last  years, making a real dference to peoplersquos lives.

People should be able to disagree with each other without resorting to abuse.Devolution is a journey not a destination. I am proud of what we have achieved over the last  years, making a real dference to peoplersquos lives.

My own view on moving forward is that a final say Peoplersquos Vote on any Brexit deal is the best option.It was a really positive event, and thank you to all constituents who attended. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people.

Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/bbobb.jpg","title":"coffee chain bob and berts creating  new jobs","story":"Posted on Monday  June  by John Mulgrew A Northern Ireland coffee shop chain is creating  new jobs as its expands it reach across the UK with eight new stores, it has emerged.
