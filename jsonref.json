These are: Circle, District, Metropolitan and the Hammersmith \u0026amp City lines.The London Overground, while not air conditioned, is air-cooled, while the new Crossrail Elizabeth Line will have air conditioned trains.There are several reasons for why only four Tube lines have air conditioning features. The main one is because they are sub-surface lines, rather than deep-level. Being closer to the surface allows exhausted hot air to be dispersed easily and safely.          London Underground commuters are struggling in the heat during this year\u0027s heatwaveThere is also an issue with spacing. The four sub-surface lines have larger tunnels that have space for air con units to be installed on the trains. However, the deep-level lines are older and too narrow.This means that there is not only no space for air conditioning units, but also for hot air to escape properly. Another issue is the fact that there is a lot of clay surrounding the deep-level line tunnels, which traps hot air extremely well and results in the high temperatures recorded on the likes of Central and Bakerloo lines.However, in the early 2020s Piccadilly, Central, Bakerloo and Waterloo \u0026amp City lines will have 250 new trains with air-cooling. National Lottery results: Lotto numbers for Wednesday 25th JulyBachelorette Men Tell All spoilers: This is why Lincoln Adim won\u0027t be thereAlex Rodriguez net worth: A-Rod\u0027s wealth revealed ahead of 43rd birthdayKendrick Lamar to guest star on 50 Cent\u0026#8217s PowerLunar Eclipse 2018: How will the blood moon affect your zodiac sign?House Rules Grand Final 2018: Everything you need to knowRobbie Williams thinks Oasis should get back togetherFortnite birthday cake locations revealed as Epic Games celebrate one-year milestoneNew on Netflix in August 2018: The TV shows and movies coming soonWorld Friendship Day 2018: Everything you need to know Ivanka Trump\u0027s fashion brand closure gets roasted on Twitter Who is America?

His first job in LA was at a gas station on Hollywood Boulevard, which soon became a hive of sexual activity          Scotty, now 95, with his wife, Lois they\u0027ve been married since 1984, and she says she had no idea about the extent of his social and sexual activities among the Hollywood elite when they got together. ‘I didn’t know him then,’ she says in the film. ‘I don’t know him as that person and not sure I want to – and I’m not interested in Hollywood shenanigans. I’m just not.’Scotty, now 95, eagerly recounts memories from his heyday as a ‘trick’ and facilitator for decades in Hollywood, showing off old pictures as well as reminiscing with some of the men he recruited or socialized with. He waited until all of the most famous players had passed away, however, before sharing their stories and publishing a tell-all book in 2012, Full Service.‘I often think back of how nice things were I can’t think back of any bad scenes or any bad things at all,’ Scotty says in the film. ‘So many people have said the nicest and best time of their whole life was that gas station. That’s why I felt good – that I made so many people happy.’He says: ‘When everyone was living, I would never even think, under any circumstances … no matter what anyone offered me, I wouldn’t write a book then.‘A lot of people at the time knew who these people were and what they were so, so it’s not a secret really,’ he tells one fan at a book signing. ‘It may be a secret for some square that lives in Illinois, but people who live in Hollywood? They knew these people.’When asked about his own sexuality, he answers: ‘I’m everything.’‘Scotty was pre-gay,’ Stephen Fry says in the film. ‘He himself doesn’t conform very particularly Scotty just breezes across all the fences that we erect to separate ourselves from others.’Director Tyrnauer had heard tales for years about the dual-function gas station before he actually met Scotty, he tells DailyMail.com. It was Tyrnauer\u0027s good friend Gore Vidal - to whom the documentary is dedicated - who eventually proved the crucial link.  \u0027One day he brought up the gas station, and he brought up the man behind it, Scotty Bowers,\u0027 he says. \u0027And I was astonished that Scotty was still around and that I had a personal connection to him. So at that moment, I decided this was my next film, almost sight unseen.\u0027Through Gore Vidal, I met Scotty I found out that he had finished the manuscript, which became his book ... And Scotty agreed to take part in the film, and we were off to the races.\u0027He adds: \u0027When I went to start filming Scotty, I discovered that there was a wife – and this astonishes a lot of people, that the leading male prostitute of his generation in Hollywood is married to a woman. And this just speaks to Scotty’s pansexuality.\u0027  Shocking moment driver appears to knock officer to the groundChris Froome gets up after being forced off bike by officerFroome says \u0027F*** you\u0027 to officer who forces him off bikeMillionaire installs gates to block residents parking on trackFormer Aston Hall resident talks to BBC about treatmentAlarming video shows just how easily scammers can scan cardsEmmanuel Macron comments on Alexandre Benalla scandalMoment teenager pops huge spot on his chin firing puss onto mirrorMoment Greek father spots who he says are missing daughters on a boatHorrific scenes as wildfires blaze by Greek motorwayHelicopter footage shows devastation caused by Greek wildfires    Hunks in trunks: Scotty rang in his 90th birthday with a rather unusual cake delivered by scantily clad young men          Birthday boy: Scotty, now 95, celebrated his 90th birthday at LA\u0027s famous Chateau Marmont during the filming of the documentary           Bowers was raised in rural Illinois and served in the US Marines during World War II he says in the new documentary about his life: \u0027Many guys, when they got out of the service, they went back home again to the little town, to the farm I upgraded myself and went to Hollywood\u0027          Actor Walter Pidgeon met Scotty at the gas station and invited him home the encounter proved to be Scotty\u0027s entry into the sexual world of Hollywood starsWithin a matter of days after meeting Pidgeon, he says, word of mouth took off and his gas station became a hive of sexual activity.‘You couldn’t believe how busy I was I needed help,’ he says – so he recruited other men, even straight ones, telling them just to pretend they were having sexual liaisons with women if it helped them through it. Patrons of the station were charged $20 for each rendezvous.‘I was fixing every bit of 20 people a night, seven nights a week,’ he says in the film. He began to branch out from the gas station bathroom, letting other clients meet in a trailer that was kept on the property by one of his friends. When those were both busy, he could also arrange for discounted rooms at a nearby hotel where he knew the manager.He curried favour with George Cukor, the epicentre of the gay scene at the time who hosted debauched brunches each weekend with around a dozen of the most attractive men in Hollywood – where Scotty became indispensable.‘Scotty Bowers would always provide new talent,’ photographer Michael Childers says in the film, adding that ‘he wasn’t just this madame Cukor called for events he was also a friend.’Scotty segued into bartending, which helped with his ‘introduction’ service for the stars he had a common-law wife, Betty, and they eventually had a daughter, but Scotty was never home – speculating in the film that he might have taken Betty for a birthday dinner ‘once’ before the relationship broke down (which he fully blames on himself).Instead, he was out all days and at all hours, feeding the sexual demands of Hollywood at a time when stars were constrained by ‘morals’ clauses in their contracts. They couldn’t openly be gay or act on any non-mainstream proclivities, so Scotty arranged it all away from prying eyes.The list of A-list names in the film seems endless. Take, for instance, Randolph Scott and Cary Grant.‘I’d been with them inidually and both of them – what you call a three-way – and also I brought another buddy,’ Scotty says.‘Cole Porter would say, “Can you bring 15 guys?” … People have often said, you couldn’t have done that many things in a given week, fixing up that many people.’J. Edgar Hoover, May Davis, Laurence Olivier, Rock Hudson – he either hooked them up or participated himself, Scotty proudly claims. George Cukor’s estate factored into his dealings not just because of the director’s thriving gay social life but also because Hepburn and Spencer Tracy lived on the grounds – in separate cottages. For all appearances, the two performers were having an affair in reality, Scotty and other insiders insist, both were gay and they never actually lived together.‘She was a designer of her own legend, and she had several fervid relationships with talented other women,’ columnist Liz Smith says in the film. ‘She was very guarded about what she did.’‘George kind of told Katharine Hepburn early in the game what I did, in a way, and I could see running through her head: Well, if he fixes up guys, he should be able to fix up girls, too,’ Scotty says in the film. ‘I could see that. I fixed her up with every bit of 150 girls … over a period of 39 years. That’s almost 50 years that’s not unusual at all.’          Scotty, second from the far right, recruited other men for \u0027tricks\u0027 he hooked up with both genders and says, when asked about his sexual orientation: \u0027I\u0027m everything\u0027  Scotty claims to have had a three-some with Cary Grant, left, and Randolph Scott, right          Scotty says in the film that Katharine Hepburn\u0027s relationship with Spencer Tracy was for show and the actors never lived together he says that, when Hepburn was first informed about Scotty\u0027s activities, \u0027I could see running through her head: Well, if he fixes up guys, he should be able to fix up girls, too ... I fixed her up with every bit of 150 girls … over a period of 39 years\u0027He talks about his own relationship with Tracy, who would often drink until he was quite inebriated when the two were together.‘He’d get up and almost fall and put his arm around me and we’d go into bed,’ says Scotty, adding that, in the morning, the actor would ‘pretend nothing ever happened.’‘He really didn’t want to be gay or admit to himself he might possibly be, so the best way is not to admit it, right?’ Scotty says.And another couple he helped, he says, were actual royalty, not Hollywood royalty: Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson.‘When I took people to see Wally and Edward, I never told one person, even though they were close buddies,’ he says. ‘They were seen as Duke and Duchess.’He was recommended to them as a resource, he says, by photographer and designer Cecil Beaton – and the couple told him he came ‘highly recommended.’ He says Edward VII ‘liked to see guys and girls together and then sort of work his way in. If a guy wants to see a guy and a girl together, they’re usually gay or have a tendency to be gay – because if they were straight, why would they want the guy?’Wallis, he says, was ‘the one who’d do the talking … she was a real ballsy chick. But they thought what I did was the nicest thing that ever happened to them.’And when it comes to his own sexual proclivities and history, Scotty brags that he was a particularly interesting study for Dr Alfred Kinsey, the sexual research pioneer.‘When Dr Kinsey met me, he’d already heard about me that’s why he interviewed me about four, five, six times,’ he says, adding: ‘We became friends, and he liked to interview me. I was one of the only people that completed the interview from one end to the other, meaning you’ve done everything.’(That list of ‘everything’ included men, women and animals.)‘I got him not only the best interviews he had I took him to gang bang parties and things like that and put him in the f*****g bedroom and everybody f******, mainly guys,’ he says. ‘He’d be over there, and I’d crawl over to see if he had a hard-on, and he’d say: “Scotty, I’m just observing.”’‘Scotty did play an academic role in the sexual revolution, because he was the connective tissue between the academic, Kinsey, and the people who were doing it,’ says Peter Bart, former studio chief and former editor of Variety. ‘Scotty was a revelation to Kinsey.’Harry Styles struggling to sell opulent West Hollywood...From a Hollywood A-Lister, an eighties movie icon and a...Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio were among actors who TURNED...Share this articleMuch of the liberated and pleasurable antics that anchored Scotty’s world, however, took place against a backdrop of disapproval not just from studios but also from a legal and societal standpoint. Vice squads were out in force post World War II, and it wasn’t unusual for an effeminate inidual to get attacked on the street.One magazine, Confidential, was particularly aggressive about outing celebrities and spreading salacious stories – and it paid. Scotty says he was approached multiple times but always declined to confirm any stories, even true ones, that were floating around publication of such tales could easily end a star’s career.One of those stories, he said, happened at Frank Sinatra’s home in Palm Springs – ‘when I had a three-way with Ava Gardner and Lana Turner.’‘They were buddy-buddy, in those days,’ he says. ‘You know, they were a little stoned, and they were in the pool in the nude – and pretty soon, we’re in bed together. The word got around. ‘Confidential came to me with the story first I wouldn’t sign it.’Two others, however, ‘signed and went for the money.’  And when the advent of HIV and AIDS came about, everything changed – prompting Scotty to get out of the game. All of Hollywood was shocked and terrified, and Scotty talks in the film about how the survivors were simply winners in a game of luck.‘When AIDS came along, I thought, I’m going to pass on fixing people up, because I don’t want to be involved in that,’ he says in the film. ‘It’s a case where you just hope you don’t catch it.’It’s a topic he discussed frankly in his 2012 memoir, as well, writing: \u0027AIDS had launched itself in a vicious war against humanity. \u0027It brought an end to the sexual freedoms that had defined much of life in Tinseltown ever since the birth of the movies. I, too, underwent a major change. Tricking – whether for others or doing it myself – gradually slowed to a snail\u0027s pace. Sex used to be about having fun and a good time. The advent of AIDS didn\u0027t change that per se, but now sex could come at the cost of your very life. So, things changed. A lot.\u0027The wild and woolly days were over. The drag parties and gang bangs and swingers\u0027 evenings and orgies became a thing of the past. But life went on.\u0027Bowers’ own life, however, had seen its fair share of tragedy – which he acknowledges closer to the end of the documentary. His daughter, Donna, died at 23 after a botched abortion he points to her graduation photo and other pictures, her phone remains in one of his houses with the same number attached, and her clothes are still in her closet.He speaks of her sadly and fondly – though he admits that, as soon as he received news of her death, he continued working as the party facilitator that he was.‘Within an hour after I learned she died, I’m on the way to Malibu to a party with a carload of guys,’ he says. ‘I was 100 percent dependable, reliable … regardless of what it was.‘If I told someone I was going to be there, I’d be there. I never said anything to anyone about what had happened.’He was also, it turns out, carrying the tragic wartime death of his brother, Donald – who, though two years older, joined the Marines after Scotty. He was killed in 1945, one of nearly 7,000 American deaths at Iwo Jima.           Over the years, critics have questioned the veracity of some of Scotty\u0027s claims, arguing that most people involved are dead so cannot refute the stories. Documentary director Matt Tyrnauer says: \u0027I believe all of his stories. I checked them out they all check out, even some of the more outlandish ones, even some of the most outlandish ones check out very well. And I checked them with multiple sources and corroborating materials.\u0027          Scotty wrote a 2012 memoir, Full Service, detailing his sexual escapades and introductions he made for others he says he waited until the stars were dead to share their stories          Scotty says he secretly arranged trysts for Wallis Simpson and abdicated British king Edward VIII, claiming that \u0027they thought what I did was the nicest thing that ever happened to them\u0027          Director Matt Tyrnauer had heard tales of a dual-purpose gas station for years before he actually met Scotty Gore Vidal was a mutual friend who proved the crucial link, and the documentary is dedicated to himRecalling his brother’s death – more than 70 years later – Scotty sobs in the film.‘It runs through your mind quite often,’ he says. ‘You don’t forget things. Some people forget things, but I don’t.‘The bad things that happened were my brother, my daughter, Betty … I created happy things and making people happy to kind of compensate for the unhappy things. Do you think that’s possible?’Tyrnauer calls Scotty \u0027the most natural, unaffected person I’ve ever met.\u0027In terms of human relations … you know, they call it emotional quotient, emotional IQ? EQ. I mean, he’s just off the charts. He’s not only street smart, but his kind of sensitivity, his antennae for the way to deal with people and to create happy, soothing situations – no matter what the situation – is like nothing I’ve ever seen before.\u0027Having said that, these tragedies that have marked his life have a deep and lasting effect on him. And I think there’s that kind of rawness and emotion to his character that makes a really fascinating and poignant person to spend time with in the course of a 90-minute film.\u0027 By Scotty\u0027s side for the last nearly 35 years has been Lois, a singer he met in a bar in 1981 and married three years later. She hasn’t read his book, and she was a bit blindsided by a lot of his past he’d never really given her the full story before they married and, it seems, even for years afterward.‘I didn’t know him then,’ she says in the film. ‘I don’t know him as that person and not sure I want to – and I’m not interested in Hollywood shenanigans. I’m just not.’She directs her attention to her husband: ‘I guess I feel some regret that he didn’t say something before, when I first knew you, about your life, prior to my meeting you.’Lois, Tyrnauer says, \u0027was not on board\u0027 with the documentary.\u0027That took a lot of convincing,\u0027 he tells DailyMail.com. \u0027She really was uncomfortable with the camera. It came to light almost immediately that Lois didn’t really know about Scotty’s past, at least in full detail, even though the book had been published. She made it very clear that she had not read the book and never would read the book, as you can see clearly in the film. We had to really work our way in with Lois.\u0027And over time, I think we got her on board - and I think she saw that we were taking a sensitive approach. And Im very grateful that she participated she\u0027s a huge part of the film ... from what I\u0027ve heard from the few people who\u0027ve seen the film at festivals so far, she\u0027s one of the favorites of the characters in the film.\u0027 She’s clearly worried (and seemingly a bit long-suffering) in the documentary, complaining about his hoarding and his continued attempts to do housework like roofing despite the fact that he’s over the age of 90. In one of the stranger bits of footage, Scotty takes out the ashes of his friend, actor and director Beech Dickerson, who left him three houses the ashes had been sitting for years in the trunk of a car, and Dickerson had requested they be scattered off the porch of Scotty’s hillside home.Scotty opted to dump them through a hole in the rotting wooden deck, which he then hosed down.‘They’ve asked me, why do I stay? Because I love him,’ Lois says in the film. ‘And somebody asked me, why? And I say, I don’t know … you just do – mainly because of the way he is: his sense of humor, his warmth, his caring.‘He likes to make people happy … it must be a chore to have to want everybody to be happy.’Over the years, critics have questioned the veracity of some of Scotty\u0027s claims, arguing that most people involved are dead so cannot refute the stories.  \u0027I did encounter some people who were in a tribe that I call The Doubters, and a lot of them became less doubtful after I presented t hem with all of the corroboration I had discovered,\u0027 Tyrnauer says. \u0027I think the movie provides a great deal of corroborating … and I’ll be curious to see how people, what people think after they see the movie if they were doubtful going in.\u0027I believe all of his stories. I checked them out they all check out, even some of the more outlandish ones, even some of the most outlandish ones check out very well. And I checked them with multiple sources and corroborating materials. I just wanted to also point out that no one has refuted the book, either, which came out in 2012.\u0027Most people he approached for interviews, he says, were only too happy to go on camera and talk about Scotty and his heyday.\u0027The reactions of everyone that I met through Scotty or around Scotty … I would say 98 percent were people who believed Scotty and were very believable themselves – and in many cases were corroborating,\u0027 he tells DailyMail.com. \u0027And also, what really surprised me was that almost everyone approached to speak on camera had no hesitation to do so. \u0027And among these chiefly were men who were present at the beginning of Scotty’s story, which goes back to the 1940s, early 1950s – so these were gentlemen in their late 80s, early 90s, who were of a different generation, where perhaps they weren’t as comfortable to talk about things such as their own sexuality and the specter of prostitution. \u0027Many of these people identified as straight, not as gay, but they were willing to speak very openly, candidly, and in many cases, movingly, about this experience and this part of their lives – which basically revealed themselves to be either bisexual or homosexual, or whatever you want to call it. But it was really very moving to me, the lack of hesitation of people to participate.\u0027           Though he claims he set up celebrities over the course of at least 50 years, Bowers never said a word about any of the meetings until he wrote his memoir, Full Service: My Adventures in Hollywood and the Secret Sex Lives of the Stars in 2012Scotty Bowers knew the Golden Age of Hollywood more intimately than anyone else. He says he set up Katharine Hepburn with up to 150 women over the course of 50 years was part of a three-way with Cary Grant and Randolph Scott, who he claims were lovers. Bowers\u0027 list goes on and on and many of his stories are recounted in a new documentaryAnd one thing that can’t be denied – regardless of the truth of his stories and claims – is the fact that Scotty, over the years, has become a legendary Hollywood institution in his own right. And there are many, many supporters and friends who are overjoyed that he has finally begun to share his stories, albeit so late in life.‘People get very angry at the idea of these beloved Hollywood icons being revealed to have secrets – but actually, all it is that Scotty’s doing is revealing that these people were real,’ Stephen Fry says in the film. ‘They were actual people, flesh and blood – like us.’ Tyrnauer didn\u0027t show Scotty the film until it was finished he teared up \u0027a few times and had the most elegant and forbearing comment about it, which was: The music\u0027s peppy and the words are peppy, too,\u0027 the director says.\u0027He\u0027s certainly  enjoying the victory lap of having a feature film about him in his 96th year in theaters.\u0027  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/25/17/0D56977900000578-5991661-image-a-83_1532536140558.jpg","title":"World Friendship Day 2018 need know","story":"The Declaration and Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace, which was adopted in 1999 set eight areas of action for nations, organisations and iniduals to undertake in order for a culture of peace to prevail:foster peace through educationpromote economic and social developmentpromote respect for all humansensure equality between women and menfoster democratic participationadvance understanding, tolerance and solidaritysupport communication and the free flow of informationpromote international peace and securitySince then, the holiday has seen an uptake of interest and some exchange friendship bands in parts of Asia and South America.

Indeed, he loved it so much that in Who’s Who, where others might boast a membership of White’s or the Garrick, he listed Tramp as his club.Privately, he called it his ‘living room’, but perhaps ‘hunting ground’ would be more apposite.It was there that, in 1986, he met heiress Sita White, daughter of Gordon (later Lord) White, who was co-founder of Hanson plc.Almost a decade later, after being introduced to another heiress, Jemima Goldsmith, at a dinner party, he took her dancing at Tramp afterwards.It is hard to reconcile the swaggering playboy image of London society’s premier ladykiller with the politician that Khan, 65, has become.On the brink last night of being elected as Pakistan’s new prime minister, he recently married his third wife, a burka-wearing Islamic mystic whose face he had never seen before their wedding.Imran Khan’s personal and political journey began when he, the only son of a wealthy civil engineer, arrived from Pakistan as a teenager and talented cricketer who attended Royal Grammar School Worcester.He went on to study Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Keble College, Oxford, gaining a third-class degree, and making his Test cricket debut.By the early Eighties, he was playing for Sussex and captaining Pakistan and had fallen in love with London’s raffish party culture. Home was a Knightsbridge flat that boasted a mirrored dining room and canopied bedroom with a painted tiger on the wall.One visitor called it: ‘A bedroom of great expectations.’ Certainly, young women found his intense hooded gaze and shaggy, rock star locks irresistible.Khan’s female friends included girls-about-town such as Susannah Constantine (who had dated Princess Margaret’s son Viscount Linley), Lady Liza Campbell and society artist Emma Sergeant.‘I never thought I was good- looking, ever,’ he once said. Half of London would have disagreed.As his friend, the model Marie Helvin sighed: ‘Everyone falls for Imran. He has a scent that is very attractive to women.’A regular in gossip columns, always linked to some new beauty, Khan was defiant about his lifestyle, telling a 1984 interviewer: ‘In Pakistan you just don’t meet single girls. There are no discos, no bars, no meeting places.’Meeting women was among ‘the very decadent pleasures in life which I enjoy,’ he added.

It means these youngsters were guaranteed a place on a course regardless of how they did in their A-levels in the summer - incentivising them to slack offIn total, 7.1 per cent of all offers made to students this year were unconditional, the data shows.Some 67,915 unconditional offers have been made to this group of would-be university students, up 32 per cent on last year, when there were 51,615.The figure includes multiple offers which may have been made to the same iniduals.In 2013, there were 2,985 unconditional offers made to 18-year-olds in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.The Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) urged universities to stop the practice, arguing that such offers can lead to students making less effort in their A-levels, which could damage their job prospects later on.An unconditional offer means a student has a place on a degree course secured, regardless of the grades they achieve in their A-levels or other qualifications.Unconditional offers have traditionally been made in certain circumstances, such as to mature students who already have the qualifications needed for their university place or for those applying for creative arts courses who may have submitted portfolios or auditioned for places.Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, said: \u0027While there has been a steady growth in the number of unconditional offers made, they still account for a small proportion of all offers made by universities.\u0027He added: \u0027Unconditional offers, when used appropriately, can help students and ensure that universities are able to respond flexibly to the range of applicants seeking places.\u0027Universities UK will continue to work with UCAS to monitor trends and any impact unconditional offer-making might have on student attainment. \u0027It is simply not in the interests of universities to take students without the potential to succeed.\u0027          An unconditional offer means a student has a place on a degree course secured, regardless of the grades they achieve in their A-levels or other qualifications.

The footage we showed was of the cricketer Wasim Akram not Imran Khan.\u0027Don\u0027t know how that happened, sincere apologies for that.\u0027It sparked huge outrage on social media, with Twitter users hitting out at the programme\u0027s producers for the blunder.            Media in Pakistan are predicting victory for Khan, pictured voting in Islamabad, but his opposition have made accusations of \u0027rigging\u0027          Viewers reacted furiously on social media, calling for Newsnight staff to be sacked and slamming the show for calling it a \u0027bit of an error\u0027          Critics included Justice Secretary David Gauke who posted a picture of the clip on Twitter and said: \u0027#Newsnight seem to have got Wasim Akram and Imran Khan muddled up.\u0027Radio One newsreader Tina Dehaley added: \u0027Is Imran Khan, the British-educated former cricket player about to become Prime Minister of Pakistan?\u0027 - probably, but the man in this clip is WASIM AKRAM.\u0027And journalist Anisa Subedar said: \u0027A bit of an error is when: You leave your Oyster card on the train You drop your phone down the loo You forget your grandma\u0027s birthday Using footage of Wasim Akram as Imran Khan in the intro is insulting and shoddy. Do better.\u0027Many more people were shocked and offended by the gaffe, with some calling for staff to lose their jobs.One Twitter user wrote: \u0027You know the bbc (sic) should be sacking those who put that together.\u0027Another added: \u0027How bloody shambolic and embarrassing #Newsnight.\u0027          Both Khan and Akram are Pakistan cricketing legends. Khan - who retired from the sport in 1992 - led Pakistan to victory at the 1992 Cricket World Cup, the country\u0027s first and only victory in that competition.He is currently locked in an election battle to become Pakistan\u0027s newest PM following his career that saw him make 3,807 runs and take 362 wickets in Test cricket. Khan is on track to be the country\u0027s new prime minister, but will have to wait for delayed results.Election Commission of Pakistan secretary Babar Yaqoob said counting was delayed by technical failures in an electronic reporting system.Counting was now being conducted manually and would likely take until late on Thursday afternoon - well past the initial 2am deadline.Meanwhile the ruling party denouncing \u0027blatant rigging\u0027 in the pivotal general election and rejecting unofficial, partial results suggesting victory for Khan.Results were still being tallied Thursday, hours after Khan\u0027s supporters took to the streets to celebrate victory in an election opponents have said the powerful military rigged in his favour.Local media said roughly half the votes had been counted more than 17 hours after polls closed, an unprecedented delay that has fuelled widespread fears over the legitimacy of the exercise.But newspapers and television channels were predicting victory for Khan\u0027s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, with the partial results giving him at least 100 seats so far in the National Assembly, the lower house.A majority of 137 seats is needed to form a government.           Viewers were not pleased with the error and flocked to social media to call out the BBC. Doctor Foster actor Prasanna Puwanarajah posted: \u0027Wow. Did Newsnight just use a clip of Wasim Akram to illustrate a story about Imran Khan? (Yes. They did.)\u0027A BBC spokesperson later stated: \u0027We\u0027d like to reiterate the sincere apology we made on air last night for an error that occurred during the programme.

His first job in LA was at a gas station on Hollywood Boulevard, which soon became a hive of sexual activity          Scotty, now 95, with his wife, Lois they\u0027ve been married since 1984, and she says she had no idea about the extent of his social and sexual activities among the Hollywood elite when they got together. ‘I didn’t know him then,’ she says in the film. ‘I don’t know him as that person and not sure I want to – and I’m not interested in Hollywood shenanigans. I’m just not.’Scotty, now 95, eagerly recounts memories from his heyday as a ‘trick’ and facilitator for decades in Hollywood, showing off old pictures as well as reminiscing with some of the men he recruited or socialized with. He waited until all of the most famous players had passed away, however, before sharing their stories and publishing a tell-all book in 2012, Full Service.‘I often think back of how nice things were I can’t think back of any bad scenes or any bad things at all,’ Scotty says in the film. ‘So many people have said the nicest and best time of their whole life was that gas station. That’s why I felt good – that I made so many people happy.’He says: ‘When everyone was living, I would never even think, under any circumstances … no matter what anyone offered me, I wouldn’t write a book then.‘A lot of people at the time knew who these people were and what they were so, so it’s not a secret really,’ he tells one fan at a book signing. ‘It may be a secret for some square that lives in Illinois, but people who live in Hollywood? They knew these people.’When asked about his own sexuality, he answers: ‘I’m everything.’‘Scotty was pre-gay,’ Stephen Fry says in the film. ‘He himself doesn’t conform very particularly Scotty just breezes across all the fences that we erect to separate ourselves from others.’Director Tyrnauer had heard tales for years about the dual-function gas station before he actually met Scotty, he tells DailyMail.com. It was Tyrnauer\u0027s good friend Gore Vidal - to whom the documentary is dedicated - who eventually proved the crucial link.  \u0027One day he brought up the gas station, and he brought up the man behind it, Scotty Bowers,\u0027 he says. \u0027And I was astonished that Scotty was still around and that I had a personal connection to him. So at that moment, I decided this was my next film, almost sight unseen.\u0027Through Gore Vidal, I met Scotty I found out that he had finished the manuscript, which became his book ... And Scotty agreed to take part in the film, and we were off to the races.\u0027He adds: \u0027When I went to start filming Scotty, I discovered that there was a wife – and this astonishes a lot of people, that the leading male prostitute of his generation in Hollywood is married to a woman. And this just speaks to Scotty’s pansexuality.\u0027  Shocking moment driver appears to knock officer to the groundChris Froome gets up after being forced off bike by officerFroome says \u0027F*** you\u0027 to officer who forces him off bikeMillionaire installs gates to block residents parking on trackFormer Aston Hall resident talks to BBC about treatmentAlarming video shows just how easily scammers can scan cardsEmmanuel Macron comments on Alexandre Benalla scandalMoment teenager pops huge spot on his chin firing puss onto mirrorMoment Greek father spots who he says are missing daughters on a boatHorrific scenes as wildfires blaze by Greek motorwayHelicopter footage shows devastation caused by Greek wildfires    Hunks in trunks: Scotty rang in his 90th birthday with a rather unusual cake delivered by scantily clad young men          Birthday boy: Scotty, now 95, celebrated his 90th birthday at LA\u0027s famous Chateau Marmont during the filming of the documentary           Bowers was raised in rural Illinois and served in the US Marines during World War II he says in the new documentary about his life: \u0027Many guys, when they got out of the service, they went back home again to the little town, to the farm I upgraded myself and went to Hollywood\u0027          Actor Walter Pidgeon met Scotty at the gas station and invited him home the encounter proved to be Scotty\u0027s entry into the sexual world of Hollywood starsWithin a matter of days after meeting Pidgeon, he says, word of mouth took off and his gas station became a hive of sexual activity.‘You couldn’t believe how busy I was I needed help,’ he says – so he recruited other men, even straight ones, telling them just to pretend they were having sexual liaisons with women if it helped them through it. Patrons of the station were charged $20 for each rendezvous.‘I was fixing every bit of 20 people a night, seven nights a week,’ he says in the film. He began to branch out from the gas station bathroom, letting other clients meet in a trailer that was kept on the property by one of his friends. When those were both busy, he could also arrange for discounted rooms at a nearby hotel where he knew the manager.He curried favour with George Cukor, the epicentre of the gay scene at the time who hosted debauched brunches each weekend with around a dozen of the most attractive men in Hollywood – where Scotty became indispensable.‘Scotty Bowers would always provide new talent,’ photographer Michael Childers says in the film, adding that ‘he wasn’t just this madame Cukor called for events he was also a friend.’Scotty segued into bartending, which helped with his ‘introduction’ service for the stars he had a common-law wife, Betty, and they eventually had a daughter, but Scotty was never home – speculating in the film that he might have taken Betty for a birthday dinner ‘once’ before the relationship broke down (which he fully blames on himself).Instead, he was out all days and at all hours, feeding the sexual demands of Hollywood at a time when stars were constrained by ‘morals’ clauses in their contracts. They couldn’t openly be gay or act on any non-mainstream proclivities, so Scotty arranged it all away from prying eyes.The list of A-list names in the film seems endless. Take, for instance, Randolph Scott and Cary Grant.‘I’d been with them inidually and both of them – what you call a three-way – and also I brought another buddy,’ Scotty says.‘Cole Porter would say, “Can you bring 15 guys?” … People have often said, you couldn’t have done that many things in a given week, fixing up that many people.’J. Edgar Hoover, May Davis, Laurence Olivier, Rock Hudson – he either hooked them up or participated himself, Scotty proudly claims. George Cukor’s estate factored into his dealings not just because of the director’s thriving gay social life but also because Hepburn and Spencer Tracy lived on the grounds – in separate cottages. For all appearances, the two performers were having an affair in reality, Scotty and other insiders insist, both were gay and they never actually lived together.‘She was a designer of her own legend, and she had several fervid relationships with talented other women,’ columnist Liz Smith says in the film. ‘She was very guarded about what she did.’‘George kind of told Katharine Hepburn early in the game what I did, in a way, and I could see running through her head: Well, if he fixes up guys, he should be able to fix up girls, too,’ Scotty says in the film. ‘I could see that. I fixed her up with every bit of 150 girls … over a period of 39 years. That’s almost 50 years that’s not unusual at all.’          Scotty, second from the far right, recruited other men for \u0027tricks\u0027 he hooked up with both genders and says, when asked about his sexual orientation: \u0027I\u0027m everything\u0027  Scotty claims to have had a three-some with Cary Grant, left, and Randolph Scott, right          Scotty says in the film that Katharine Hepburn\u0027s relationship with Spencer Tracy was for show and the actors never lived together he says that, when Hepburn was first informed about Scotty\u0027s activities, \u0027I could see running through her head: Well, if he fixes up guys, he should be able to fix up girls, too ... I fixed her up with every bit of 150 girls … over a period of 39 years\u0027He talks about his own relationship with Tracy, who would often drink until he was quite inebriated when the two were together.‘He’d get up and almost fall and put his arm around me and we’d go into bed,’ says Scotty, adding that, in the morning, the actor would ‘pretend nothing ever happened.’‘He really didn’t want to be gay or admit to himself he might possibly be, so the best way is not to admit it, right?’ Scotty says.And another couple he helped, he says, were actual royalty, not Hollywood royalty: Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson.‘When I took people to see Wally and Edward, I never told one person, even though they were close buddies,’ he says. ‘They were seen as Duke and Duchess.’He was recommended to them as a resource, he says, by photographer and designer Cecil Beaton – and the couple told him he came ‘highly recommended.’ He says Edward VII ‘liked to see guys and girls together and then sort of work his way in. If a guy wants to see a guy and a girl together, they’re usually gay or have a tendency to be gay – because if they were straight, why would they want the guy?’Wallis, he says, was ‘the one who’d do the talking … she was a real ballsy chick. But they thought what I did was the nicest thing that ever happened to them.’And when it comes to his own sexual proclivities and history, Scotty brags that he was a particularly interesting study for Dr Alfred Kinsey, the sexual research pioneer.‘When Dr Kinsey met me, he’d already heard about me that’s why he interviewed me about four, five, six times,’ he says, adding: ‘We became friends, and he liked to interview me. I was one of the only people that completed the interview from one end to the other, meaning you’ve done everything.’(That list of ‘everything’ included men, women and animals.)‘I got him not only the best interviews he had I took him to gang bang parties and things like that and put him in the f*****g bedroom and everybody f******, mainly guys,’ he says. ‘He’d be over there, and I’d crawl over to see if he had a hard-on, and he’d say: “Scotty, I’m just observing.”’‘Scotty did play an academic role in the sexual revolution, because he was the connective tissue between the academic, Kinsey, and the people who were doing it,’ says Peter Bart, former studio chief and former editor of Variety. ‘Scotty was a revelation to Kinsey.’Harry Styles struggling to sell opulent West Hollywood...From a Hollywood A-Lister, an eighties movie icon and a...Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio were among actors who TURNED...Share this articleMuch of the liberated and pleasurable antics that anchored Scotty’s world, however, took place against a backdrop of disapproval not just from studios but also from a legal and societal standpoint. Vice squads were out in force post World War II, and it wasn’t unusual for an effeminate inidual to get attacked on the street.One magazine, Confidential, was particularly aggressive about outing celebrities and spreading salacious stories – and it paid. Scotty says he was approached multiple times but always declined to confirm any stories, even true ones, that were floating around publication of such tales could easily end a star’s career.One of those stories, he said, happened at Frank Sinatra’s home in Palm Springs – ‘when I had a three-way with Ava Gardner and Lana Turner.’‘They were buddy-buddy, in those days,’ he says. ‘You know, they were a little stoned, and they were in the pool in the nude – and pretty soon, we’re in bed together. The word got around. ‘Confidential came to me with the story first I wouldn’t sign it.’Two others, however, ‘signed and went for the money.’  And when the advent of HIV and AIDS came about, everything changed – prompting Scotty to get out of the game. All of Hollywood was shocked and terrified, and Scotty talks in the film about how the survivors were simply winners in a game of luck.‘When AIDS came along, I thought, I’m going to pass on fixing people up, because I don’t want to be involved in that,’ he says in the film. ‘It’s a case where you just hope you don’t catch it.’It’s a topic he discussed frankly in his 2012 memoir, as well, writing: \u0027AIDS had launched itself in a vicious war against humanity. \u0027It brought an end to the sexual freedoms that had defined much of life in Tinseltown ever since the birth of the movies. I, too, underwent a major change. Tricking – whether for others or doing it myself – gradually slowed to a snail\u0027s pace. Sex used to be about having fun and a good time. The advent of AIDS didn\u0027t change that per se, but now sex could come at the cost of your very life. So, things changed. A lot.\u0027The wild and woolly days were over. The drag parties and gang bangs and swingers\u0027 evenings and orgies became a thing of the past. But life went on.\u0027Bowers’ own life, however, had seen its fair share of tragedy – which he acknowledges closer to the end of the documentary. His daughter, Donna, died at 23 after a botched abortion he points to her graduation photo and other pictures, her phone remains in one of his houses with the same number attached, and her clothes are still in her closet.He speaks of her sadly and fondly – though he admits that, as soon as he received news of her death, he continued working as the party facilitator that he was.‘Within an hour after I learned she died, I’m on the way to Malibu to a party with a carload of guys,’ he says. ‘I was 100 percent dependable, reliable … regardless of what it was.‘If I told someone I was going to be there, I’d be there. I never said anything to anyone about what had happened.’He was also, it turns out, carrying the tragic wartime death of his brother, Donald – who, though two years older, joined the Marines after Scotty. He was killed in 1945, one of nearly 7,000 American deaths at Iwo Jima.           Over the years, critics have questioned the veracity of some of Scotty\u0027s claims, arguing that most people involved are dead so cannot refute the stories. Documentary director Matt Tyrnauer says: \u0027I believe all of his stories. I checked them out they all check out, even some of the more outlandish ones, even some of the most outlandish ones check out very well. And I checked them with multiple sources and corroborating materials.\u0027          Scotty wrote a 2012 memoir, Full Service, detailing his sexual escapades and introductions he made for others he says he waited until the stars were dead to share their stories          Scotty says he secretly arranged trysts for Wallis Simpson and abdicated British king Edward VIII, claiming that \u0027they thought what I did was the nicest thing that ever happened to them\u0027          Director Matt Tyrnauer had heard tales of a dual-purpose gas station for years before he actually met Scotty Gore Vidal was a mutual friend who proved the crucial link, and the documentary is dedicated to himRecalling his brother’s death – more than 70 years later – Scotty sobs in the film.‘It runs through your mind quite often,’ he says. ‘You don’t forget things. Some people forget things, but I don’t.‘The bad things that happened were my brother, my daughter, Betty … I created happy things and making people happy to kind of compensate for the unhappy things. Do you think that’s possible?’Tyrnauer calls Scotty \u0027the most natural, unaffected person I’ve ever met.\u0027In terms of human relations … you know, they call it emotional quotient, emotional IQ? EQ. I mean, he’s just off the charts. He’s not only street smart, but his kind of sensitivity, his antennae for the way to deal with people and to create happy, soothing situations – no matter what the situation – is like nothing I’ve ever seen before.\u0027Having said that, these tragedies that have marked his life have a deep and lasting effect on him. And I think there’s that kind of rawness and emotion to his character that makes a really fascinating and poignant person to spend time with in the course of a 90-minute film.\u0027 By Scotty\u0027s side for the last nearly 35 years has been Lois, a singer he met in a bar in 1981 and married three years later. She hasn’t read his book, and she was a bit blindsided by a lot of his past he’d never really given her the full story before they married and, it seems, even for years afterward.‘I didn’t know him then,’ she says in the film. ‘I don’t know him as that person and not sure I want to – and I’m not interested in Hollywood shenanigans. I’m just not.’She directs her attention to her husband: ‘I guess I feel some regret that he didn’t say something before, when I first knew you, about your life, prior to my meeting you.’Lois, Tyrnauer says, \u0027was not on board\u0027 with the documentary.\u0027That took a lot of convincing,\u0027 he tells DailyMail.com. \u0027She really was uncomfortable with the camera. It came to light almost immediately that Lois didn’t really know about Scotty’s past, at least in full detail, even though the book had been published. She made it very clear that she had not read the book and never would read the book, as you can see clearly in the film. We had to really work our way in with Lois.\u0027And over time, I think we got her on board - and I think she saw that we were taking a sensitive approach. And Im very grateful that she participated she\u0027s a huge part of the film ... from what I\u0027ve heard from the few people who\u0027ve seen the film at festivals so far, she\u0027s one of the favorites of the characters in the film.\u0027 She’s clearly worried (and seemingly a bit long-suffering) in the documentary, complaining about his hoarding and his continued attempts to do housework like roofing despite the fact that he’s over the age of 90. In one of the stranger bits of footage, Scotty takes out the ashes of his friend, actor and director Beech Dickerson, who left him three houses the ashes had been sitting for years in the trunk of a car, and Dickerson had requested they be scattered off the porch of Scotty’s hillside home.Scotty opted to dump them through a hole in the rotting wooden deck, which he then hosed down.‘They’ve asked me, why do I stay? Because I love him,’ Lois says in the film. ‘And somebody asked me, why? And I say, I don’t know … you just do – mainly because of the way he is: his sense of humor, his warmth, his caring.‘He likes to make people happy … it must be a chore to have to want everybody to be happy.’Over the years, critics have questioned the veracity of some of Scotty\u0027s claims, arguing that most people involved are dead so cannot refute the stories.  \u0027I did encounter some people who were in a tribe that I call The Doubters, and a lot of them became less doubtful after I presented t hem with all of the corroboration I had discovered,\u0027 Tyrnauer says. \u0027I think the movie provides a great deal of corroborating … and I’ll be curious to see how people, what people think after they see the movie if they were doubtful going in.\u0027I believe all of his stories. I checked them out they all check out, even some of the more outlandish ones, even some of the most outlandish ones check out very well. And I checked them with multiple sources and corroborating materials. I just wanted to also point out that no one has refuted the book, either, which came out in 2012.\u0027Most people he approached for interviews, he says, were only too happy to go on camera and talk about Scotty and his heyday.\u0027The reactions of everyone that I met through Scotty or around Scotty … I would say 98 percent were people who believed Scotty and were very believable themselves – and in many cases were corroborating,\u0027 he tells DailyMail.com. \u0027And also, what really surprised me was that almost everyone approached to speak on camera had no hesitation to do so. \u0027And among these chiefly were men who were present at the beginning of Scotty’s story, which goes back to the 1940s, early 1950s – so these were gentlemen in their late 80s, early 90s, who were of a different generation, where perhaps they weren’t as comfortable to talk about things such as their own sexuality and the specter of prostitution. \u0027Many of these people identified as straight, not as gay, but they were willing to speak very openly, candidly, and in many cases, movingly, about this experience and this part of their lives – which basically revealed themselves to be either bisexual or homosexual, or whatever you want to call it. But it was really very moving to me, the lack of hesitation of people to participate.\u0027           Though he claims he set up celebrities over the course of at least 50 years, Bowers never said a word about any of the meetings until he wrote his memoir, Full Service: My Adventures in Hollywood and the Secret Sex Lives of the Stars in 2012Scotty Bowers knew the Golden Age of Hollywood more intimately than anyone else. He says he set up Katharine Hepburn with up to 150 women over the course of 50 years was part of a three-way with Cary Grant and Randolph Scott, who he claims were lovers. Bowers\u0027 list goes on and on and many of his stories are recounted in a new documentaryAnd one thing that can’t be denied – regardless of the truth of his stories and claims – is the fact that Scotty, over the years, has become a legendary Hollywood institution in his own right. And there are many, many supporters and friends who are overjoyed that he has finally begun to share his stories, albeit so late in life.‘People get very angry at the idea of these beloved Hollywood icons being revealed to have secrets – but actually, all it is that Scotty’s doing is revealing that these people were real,’ Stephen Fry says in the film. ‘They were actual people, flesh and blood – like us.’ Tyrnauer didn\u0027t show Scotty the film until it was finished he teared up \u0027a few times and had the most elegant and forbearing comment about it, which was: The music\u0027s peppy and the words are peppy, too,\u0027 the director says.\u0027He\u0027s certainly  enjoying the victory lap of having a feature film about him in his 96th year in theaters.\u0027  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/25/19/4E909BD500000578-5992087-image-a-4_1532542104370.jpg","title":"Scorching pavements heat stressed owners mean dogs fat","story":"    Parched pups could pack on the pounds this summer as scorching temperatures across Britain keep them from exercisingBeing stuck indoors and unable to burn off their excess energy meant dogs\u0027 weight could balloon over the course of the increasingly hot summer.Caroline Reay, from animal charity Blue Cross, said there were concerns around dogs being cooped up at home.\u0027It\u0027s too early to tell, but exercise for dogs is the same as exercise for humans, it takes a lot of work to lose weight,\u0027 she told MailOnline.Ms Reay suggested dogs should instead be kept active with low-intensity indoor games that also tired them out mentally.\u0027You don\u0027t want them being too active at home either because you don\u0027t want them to get heatstroke so the best option are non-vigorous games like hiding food for them,\u0027 she said.

On the brink last night of being elected as Pakistan’s new prime minister, he recently married his third wife, a burka-wearing Islamic mystic whose face he had never seen before their weddingYet probably its greatest fan was the brooding Pakistani playboycricketer Imran Khan, whose noble profile was often seen on the dance floor, where he would be charming one upmarket blonde or another. Indeed, he loved it so much that in Who’s Who, where others might boast a membership of White’s or the Garrick, he listed Tramp as his club.Privately, he called it his ‘living room’, but perhaps ‘hunting ground’ would be more apposite.It was there that, in 1986, he met heiress Sita White, daughter of Gordon (later Lord) White, who was co-founder of Hanson plc.Almost a decade later, after being introduced to another heiress, Jemima Goldsmith, at a dinner party, he took her dancing at Tramp afterwards.It is hard to reconcile the swaggering playboy image of London society’s premier ladykiller with the politician that Khan, 65, has become.On the brink last night of being elected as Pakistan’s new prime minister, he recently married his third wife, a burka-wearing Islamic mystic whose face he had never seen before their wedding.Imran Khan’s personal and political journey began when he, the only son of a wealthy civil engineer, arrived from Pakistan as a teenager and talented cricketer who attended Royal Grammar School Worcester.He went on to study Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Keble College, Oxford, gaining a third-class degree, and making his Test cricket debut.By the early Eighties, he was playing for Sussex and captaining Pakistan and had fallen in love with London’s raffish party culture. Home was a Knightsbridge flat that boasted a mirrored dining room and canopied bedroom with a painted tiger on the wall.One visitor called it: ‘A bedroom of great expectations.’ Certainly, young women found his intense hooded gaze and shaggy, rock star locks irresistible.Khan’s female friends included girls-about-town such as Susannah Constantine (who had dated Princess Margaret’s son Viscount Linley), Lady Liza Campbell and society artist Emma Sergeant.‘I never thought I was good- looking, ever,’ he once said. Half of London would have disagreed.As his friend, the model Marie Helvin sighed: ‘Everyone falls for Imran.

It means these youngsters were guaranteed a place on a course regardless of how they did in their A-levels in the summer - incentivising them to slack offIn total, 7.1 per cent of all offers made to students this year were unconditional, the data shows.Some 67,915 unconditional offers have been made to this group of would-be university students, up 32 per cent on last year, when there were 51,615.The figure includes multiple offers which may have been made to the same iniduals.In 2013, there were 2,985 unconditional offers made to 18-year-olds in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.The Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) urged universities to stop the practice, arguing that such offers can lead to students making less effort in their A-levels, which could damage their job prospects later on.An unconditional offer means a student has a place on a degree course secured, regardless of the grades they achieve in their A-levels or other qualifications.Unconditional offers have traditionally been made in certain circumstances, such as to mature students who already have the qualifications needed for their university place or for those applying for creative arts courses who may have submitted portfolios or auditioned for places.Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, said: \u0027While there has been a steady growth in the number of unconditional offers made, they still account for a small proportion of all offers made by universities.\u0027He added: \u0027Unconditional offers, when used appropriately, can help students and ensure that universities are able to respond flexibly to the range of applicants seeking places.\u0027Universities UK will continue to work with UCAS to monitor trends and any impact unconditional offer-making might have on student attainment. \u0027It is simply not in the interests of universities to take students without the potential to succeed.\u0027          An unconditional offer means a student has a place on a degree course secured, regardless of the grades they achieve in their A-levels or other qualifications.

These two are making ham and cheese sandwiches for the road’Murga is Argentinian street theatre that combines dance with percussion. The first time I heard the hypnotic drumbeat of a performance was in a park in Buenos Aires. I walked towards it and watched the dancers as they moved from the first simple steps to the intense high kicks the performances culminate in. I was hooked. I wanted to know everything about it.For ordinary, working class people, murga plays an important role. Austerity means it’s becoming much harder to live in Argentina. Murga gives them something to look forward to, an escape.Each area of Buenos Aires has its own murga group, with their own colours. In February, throughout carnival season, they travel from neighbourhood to neighbourhood on weekends, performing well into the night. They travel around in these knackered old school buses to makeshift stages on streets shut down for the evening. In some places, the audience is on fire, it’s exciting. There is a real buzz when the drums start. The sound is addictive the audience gets lost in it and even though it’s so hot and so late, the performers give it their all.I shot this in 2013, while trailing a local troupe I’d befriended a few years earlier. It was about 6.45 in the evening, and it was very hot, very humid. Everyone was moving a little slowly, which I think this picture captures. The troupe – about 150 dancers and drummers – had gathered at the director’s house, which transforms into a community centre of sorts.I came across this private moment in the kitchen. Someone had made stew for dinner, in that big pot, and two dancers were making ham and cheese sandwiches for the road. The boy had put the knife down to concentrate on talking to the girl. They were having an intense conversation. I liked how they were mirroring each other’s body language, unconsciously, beautifully. The composition reminded me of Dutch paintings.In the room next door, people were doing their makeup and making last-minute adjustments to their costumes – men with their coat-tails and smart hats, girls with short skirts. Elsewhere, others were loading drums into buses. I liked how this quiet, fleeting moment, stood in direct contrast to the flurry of activity all around. I went back the following year with printed copies of the image to give the boy and the girl, but they were no longer members.

He also said the government was working to clean the waterway by employing aerators and “nano bubble” technology to help break down organic material.Water from a dam in Bogor in west Java is being pumped in to help flush the river out, and the city government said it planned to build more wastewater treatment plants.Wastewater from houses and a nearby tofu factory have contributed to the heavily polluted condition of the Sentiong, one of many rivers in that run through Jakarta.The Asian Games begin on 18 August, with 11,000 athletes from 45 countries expected to attend the largest multi-sporting event after the Olympics.Events will be hosted in Jakarta and Palembang in south Sumatra.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2268c9b229da392933384190102c6370313b30a/0_29_3504_2102/master/3504.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f436f3320845306445d769b550f9a69e","title":"communists capitalism stalinism economic model","story":"Rightwingers point out the horrors of Stalinism, yet forget the human misery their favoured economic model was built onA spectre is haunting the British media: the spectre of negative takes on capitalism. Ever since the academic and writer Ash Sarkar uttered the words “I’m a communist, you idiot” on national television, the right has recoiled in horror. The alacrity with which commentators jumped on Sarkar’s off-the-cuff comment to relitigate the cold war is deeply revealing.The right has been terrified that it is losing the war of ideas to the left ever since Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour deprived the Tories of a majority a year ago. Sarkar’s unintentional rescue of Marx’s vision of communism – as a stateless, classless society in which humanity is liberated from wage labour – from the Stalinist totalitarianism that followed led the magazine Elle to declare she was “literally a communist and literally our hero”. The  reflected: “Communism sent millions to their deaths – so why is it cool to wear it on your T-shirt?” As far as Douglas Murray of the Spectator is concerned, meanwhile, Sarkar is no better than a fascist.Don’t get me wrong: regimes that took the name “communist” – from Stalin’s to Pol Pot’s – committed unspeakable, monstrous crimes. But for the right, a revival of interest in Marx’s pre-Stalinist vision of communism is the most striking and chilling example of its own collapsing ideological supremacy: “communism” is synonymous with tens of millions of deaths and nothing else. Capitalism, by contrast, is presented as a largely bloodless, blameless engine of human prosperity.The story of capitalism is more complicated than that. If you want to read effusive praise of capitalism, you’ll find it in Marx and Engels’ Communist Manifesto: the revolutionary dynamism of the capitalists, they wrote, had created “wonders far surpassing Egyptian pyramids, Roman aqueducts, and Gothic cathedrals”. But capitalism is an economic system drenched in the blood of countless millions.That is, of course, not to excuse the horrors of Stalinism: the totalitarian model pioneered and exported by Stalin’s regime deprived millions of their liberty and, in so many cases, their lives similarly, the millions of lives lost to murder and famine in Maoist China can never be forgotten. Yet the charge sheet against communism does not aid the champions of capitalism quite as much as they would like. According to The Black Book of Communism, a disreputable key reference point for the right, almost a hundred million humans perished at the hands of self-described “communist” regimes, mostly victims of Mao Zedong’s regime in China. The Nobel prize-winning economist Amartya Sen notes that between 23 and 30 million people did indeed die as a consequence of Mao’s catastrophic Great Leap Forward policies in the late 1950s and early 1960s.But he also noted in a 2006 paper that in the middle of the 20th century, China and India had the same life expectancy – around 40 years. After the Chinese revolution, a massive ergence took place. By 1979, Maoist China had a life expectancy of 68 years, more than 14 years longer than that of capitalist India. The excess in mortality of capitalist India over communist China was estimated to be a horrifying 4 million human lives a year. So why isn’t India held up as a case study for the murderousness of capitalism?Capitalism was built on the bodies of millions from the very start. From the late 17th century onwards, the transatlantic slave trade became a pillar of emergent capitalism. Much of the wealth of London, Bristol and Liverpool – once the largest slave trading port in Europe – was made from the enslaved labour of Africans. The capital accumulated from slavery – from tobacco, cotton and sugar – drove the industrial revolution in Manchester and Lancashire and several banks today can trace their origins to profits made from slavery.Even when the international slave trade began to crumble, the blood money of colonialism enriched western capitalism. India was long ruled by Britain, the world’s pre-eminent capitalist power: as Mike Davis’s Late Victorian Holocausts explores, up to 35 million Indians perished in needless famines as millions of tonnes of wheat was exported to Britain in times of starvation. Here was a cash cow for British capitalism, becoming the country’s main source of revenue by the end of the 19th century. The west is built on wealth stolen from the subjugated, at immense human cost.It was the 20th century when capitalist Europe began to import the mass horrors it had previously inflicted on others. The Great Depression – still the most severe crisis of capitalism – helped to create the conditions of popular discontent that led to the rise of the Nazis. In the early period of Hitler’s regime, big business, fearful of the power of the German left, made its grubby compromises with National Socialism, seeing the Nazis as a blunt instrument with which to bludgeon both communism and trade unionism. German businesses made huge donations to the Nazis both before and after their rise to power, the industrial conglomerate IG Farben and Krupp among them. Many businesses profited from Nazi slave labour and the Holocaust, including IBM, BMW, Deutsche Bank and the Schaeffler group.It is possible to believe in capitalism passionately, or simply be resigned to it as the only viable system, but also acknowledge that it has its own dark shadows and complicities with murderous episodes in human history. It serves a useful political function, of course, to suppress the idea that there is an alternative to capitalism, resting on different principles and values.The democratic radical left has long repudiated the totalitarian nightmare, and has reflected at great length as to how it happened. But many of capitalism’s unapologetic defenders have failed to scrutinise its own past: respectable politicians and historians still defend colonialism, despite its grotesque horrors. Diving back into the darkest days of 20th-century totalitarianism is not a fair way to take on 21st-century democratic socialists.Aspiring to a world of material abundance, freed of the state, rooted in cooperation, does not make someone a murderous totalitarian in the making. Even if you don’t believe any of that will ever happen, that doesn’t mean surrendering to market fundamentalism, not least as climate change – driven by an unsustainable economic order – wreaks growing mayhem on our planet. A new democratic and just society is waiting to be born – one that breaks decisively with all the failed systems of the past."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/caec2aa179cae3bfd19735b0718da1111101b245/0_96_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c60c6bacf06afed952b8e97630b7762","title":"instagram david beckham social influencer","story":"David Beckham and I are alike in countless ways. We are both carbon-based organisms, for example, and I can state with some degree of certainty that we have both been in a lift. However, despite our endless similarities, our lives do erge in one very important way: Beckham can earn up to £228,000 just for posting something on Instagram and, well, I cannot.Beckham has just been named the country’s best-paid social media influencer. He’s still small fry compared with the might of Kylie Jenner’s $1m-per-post fee but, nevertheless, earning multiple times the average national annual wage just for putting a photo on the internet is nothing to be sniffed at.But why does he get all this money for Instagramming and I don’t? An investigation:It goes without saying that Beckham has more Instagram followers than I do. He has 49.7 million of them, all hanging on his every pixel whereas I’ve got a paltry 4,755. But let’s do the maths here – £228,000 sounds a lot, but it means that Beckham is only being paid a fraction of a penny per follower when he does a sponsored post. Would I dupe my fans by selling my soul to a corporation for a similarly small amount? Are you kidding? Of course I would. Sign me up. No, really, sign me up. I’m cheap.As far as a cursory glance through his most recent posts reveal, Beckham’s Instagram account has three big sponsorship clients: Adidas, Tudor Watches and Kent \u0026amp Curwen. This last one is especially interesting because, although Beckham co-owns the company, he doesn’t label the posts as being paid for. This apparent blurring of lines raises some questions about the ethics of the social media influencer.The last two identifiable brands I featured on my Instagram account were Tropicana (from an article where I ate loads of trifle and then vomited), and Vintage Books, because they published my memoir Don’t Be A Dick, Pete, which came out in paperback last month. Did I receive a single payment for posting either image? No I didn’t, not even for the book, which Cosmopolitan magazine called “the funniest book of the year” and is still on sale at a very reasonable price. Beckham might have all the money, but I clearly have the moral high ground here. I cannot be bought. Unlike my book, which very much can.OK, now I’m annoyed. Going from what we both post there is nothing – literally nothing – to separate Beckham’s Instagram account from mine. He posts pictures of his dad, and I post pictures of my dad. He posts pictures of himself taken by other people, and I post pictures of myself taken by other people. He posts pictures of his children, and I post so many pictures of my children that it’s likely to cause them several deep-seated psychological problems once they reach adulthood. Surely I should receive remuneration for this?Really, and I’ve explored this with some degree of intensity, there are only a handful of things that separate @DavidBeckham and @StuHeritage on Instagram. First, he posts quite a lot about football and I do not. But then again football was his job, so it’s no different to me posting that time the  Guide did a bad job of superimposing my face on to Mystic Meg’s body last year.Second, his feed is full of pictures taken with his celebrity pals. Scroll back far enough and you’ll find pictures of Beckham with Prince William, Diego Maradona and the Stone Roses. But then again in October 2015 I posted a selfie taken with the man who came fifth in the 11th series of The X Factor. It got 80 likes, so who’s the real big shot here?The only other thing I can think of is that Beckham is a globally recognised sporting hero famed for his charm and good looks, and I am a man paid to eat trifle for a newspaper. But that can’t be the reason why he gets paid a third of a million to use Instagram and I don’t, can it?

It could be throwing red meat to its backbenchers, to try to show that a no deal hasn’t been ruled out. It could be trying to influence EU negotiators, either by showing that the UK has plans in place, or by suggesting that the negotiators take the blame for the consequences of no deal. It may even be trying to reassure us that it knows what it is doing.But here’s the problem with any of the above: the government appears to have forgotten to do even the most basic of planning.As ministers admitted on Tuesday that the UK would be making preparations to ensure an adequate supply of food, medicines and even blood in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the newly installed Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, revealed the staggering extent of his ignorance as to what that would entail.“We will look at this issue in the round and make sure that there’s adequate food supplies,” he told the Brexit committee during an extended hearing. “It would be wrong to describe it as the government doing the stockpiling.”The implication of Raab’s comments – especially combined with comments from other ministers – is that it will be the role of industry to stockpile food, and that that is be something they would be able to do. In an interview yesterday evening Theresa May even said the public should find “reassurance and comfort” in the stockpiling. From those comments, you’d think stockpiling food would be easy.It would not. Anyone knowing the very basics of food production – frankly, anyone who has watched an episode of Inside the Factory on the BBC – would know just how difficult it would be for industry to stockpile food. Most UK factories rely on multiple daily deliveries to keep production, which usually runs 24 hours a day, flowing. Within just 18 to 36 hours without deliveries of ingredients, production in almost all of the UK’s food sector (the country’s largest manufacturing sector) would stop.Factories couldn’t just step up production before the Brexit date and store the surplus, either. They no longer have much space to store their product: the UK’s highly efficient supply chains work on a “just in time” basis – factories have just enough storage space to manage about a day’s worth of deliveries, as do supermarket depots and the warehouses in the back of stores.Stockpiling more food would mean industry having to buy or lease vast amounts of extra space, at short notice, and probably at great cost. In practical terms, it would ideally have needed to start spending that money months ago – and it would be serious money. Part of the reason people keep less inventory is that it reduces the amount of money you need to operate. If you increase the amount of stock kept in reserve from a few days’ worth to a few weeks’ worth, businesses across the sector would need five to 10 times the working capital they do now.Who’s going to pay that? Are we going to require an industry that operates on famously thin margins to prepare for this contingency out of its own pocket? What if it refuses? What if it makes these stockpiles, then we cut a deal?This is before we step into many of the extra complexities: food has a habit of going off, for example. Other food takes time to make – nine months for mature cheddar for example. And crops, funnily enough, take time to grow – and can’t be rushed.The UK food sector, like the UK car industry and much of the high-end goods and services economy, is a finely tuned machine, and the sort of disruption we might see in the event of a no-deal Brexit, such as chaos and delays at the border, would result in it grinding to a halt.With their comments – presumably meant to assure us that they have a plan, or at least a clue – May and her ministers have shown us instead how woefully under-prepared we are. Brexit is perhaps the most complex thing the UK has attempted in the lifetime of most of us, and it is being run by people who don’t understand the absolute basics. In 2016, these sorts of concerns were constantly dismissed as “Project Fear”. In 2018, we now know that we have good reason to be afraid.• James Ball is a former  special projects editor, and the author of Post-Truth: How Bullshit Conquered the World"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83647b9a57d917066c10fa89d4013282dcc402bd/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ada9d680ae1c08ba90a21ddd01edace","title":"every mercury prize winning album ranked","story":"Following the announcement of this year’s nominees, we run the rule over the 26 albums that have earned the crown, from Klaxons and James Blake to M People and Talvin SinghIt’s hard not to feel sorry for Speech Debelle. In some ways a precursor to Kate Tempest, she channelled experiences such as homelessness into her debut’s smoothly jazzy raps, but her Mercury winner was met with poor sales and sparsely attended gigs. Speech Therapy isn’t bad – none of these albums are – but perhaps it’s not great enough for such an unforgiving spotlight.For many, the wizard-costumed, glowstick-wielding Klaxons’ victory was a “What the …?” moment. The band’s debut certainly ticked all the Mercury boxes – it felt zeitgeisty, it blended dance and psychedelia and it was rooted in the then painfully trendy “new rave” genre – but perhaps too determinedly so. Still, Golden Skans remains a cracker.The album cemented the band’s journey from University of Leeds DIY types to the Top 20 and made them bookies’ favourites for the prize. The well-connected posh boys’ success spawned predictable social media outrage, but their debut’s clever mix of experimental glitches, daft lyrics and quirkily catchy tunes nonetheless shifted 100,000 copies.Niomi McLean-Daley’s Mercury triumph was a rare early victory for British hip-hop in a field dominated by US culture you heard Dy-na-mi-tee’s hook being sung by fans everywhere. Sixteen years on, A Little Deeper’s mix of Lauryn-Hill-inspired singing, ragga and R\u0026ampB sounds somewhat of its time, but it’s not without its charms.The classically trained electronic musician triumphed at the second attempt. Following his debut’s Mercury near-miss two years before, Overgrown saw off previous winners Arctic Monkeys and the critically beloved Laura Mvula with its disembodied vocals and eerie, neo-dubstep songwriting deconstructions.The London-born winner accepted his prize in tears – as you would, had your career taken you from sleeping rough to being hailed (by Debrett’s, no less) as “one of the most influential people in Britain”. At Least for Now didn’t shift units, but the pianist tenor mixed emotion, grandeur, poetry and humour with a striking, anguished voice.Controversially, this saw off such era-defining albums as the Prodigy’s Music for the Jilted Generation and Blur’s Parklife. Although the Hacienda-influenced band’s advert-hogging pop was seen as dance music for Mondeo man, it shrewdly took club culture into the mainstream.Polly Harvey’s first Mercury-winning album is her most commercial. The title recognises the songs’ inception in New York and her coastal home in Dorset. While Big Exit is contemporary, punky melodrama, not all fans were comfortable with the album’s shift from her former edgy, ramshackle, indie-blues to a more FM radio sheen.This Edinburgh-based, LiberianNigerianScottish experimental hip-hop trio overcame long odds to win. The Mercury did its job in shining a spotlight on a relatively unknown but deserving band whose music inventively fused electro punk and African sounds.Gomez’s winner sold shiploads, but it was not received well among elements of the music press. However, the Bring It On 20th anniversary tour proved a hot ticket: there’s still much love among its dusty psych-blues-funk and vim-filled tales of youthful escapades.The singer-songwriter-cum-Beyoncé-producing-whizzkid’s winner is one of the Mercury’s most personal: the south London soul singer addressed his mother’s death from cancer and his fears for his own physical health. It’s beautiful and moving.The Bury band’s fourth album has quite a story behind it. They had been dropped from their label and suffered the death of a close friend, Bryan Glancy (the “seldom seen kid”). Guy Garvey and the band poured their frustrations into a set of emotional but uplifting songs, including the exuberant One Day Like This, arguably the best song of their career.The Bristol collective’s debut was doubly significant: it was the first Mercury winner to come out of leftfield and, conversely, the album that took drum’n’bass into the mainstream. Twenty-one years on, the likes of Brown Paper Bag and Heroes still hold up admirably.The tabla-playerproducer’s prize marked a triumph for the emerging British-Asian underground dance music over established acts such as Manic Street Preachers and the Chemical Brothers. Although OK stalled at No 41, it remains beautifully enriching: a global travelogue of sound.The young Londoners’ debut has been widely imitated. Still, in 2010, the Mercury winners’ stripped-down, minimalist, spacious sound – a sparse negative of Joy Division, with whispered tales of sexual longing and shades of contemporary R\u0026ampB – felt as fresh as a daisy.Although it’s debatable whether Suede’s debut is even their best album, it certainly helped justify frothing music-paper claims about “the best new band in Britain”. Brett Anderson’s voice soars over Bernard Butler’s guitar, a pirouetting, pre-Britpop collision of glam-era David Bowie and the Smiths.A man who single-handedly made the scruffy woolly hat a fashion item and performed drunken press-ups onstage, Bolton singer-songwriter Damon Gough was an uncomfortable victor. However, the mega-selling Bewilderbeast’s 18 beautifully observed songs remain widely loved.After the Strokes revitalised indie rock, the 2004 Mercury winners gave it an art-school makeover. The Glaswegian four-piece stylishly combined influences from Edinburgh’s Fire Engines to Los Angeles’s Sparks into sharp lyrics and killer pop songs, especially the No 3 hit Take Me Out.Skepta’s British-sounding album had an international reach, finding room for a guest spot from Pharrell Williams and lyrical references to male stripping troupe the Chippendales. The 2016 winner beat off David Bowie’s Blackstar, its triumph cementing grime’s commercial second wave.Harvey is the only artist to win two Mercurys. Her most recent triumph was almost unanimously well received. Let England Shake is a dark but strangely uplifting collection of anti-war contemporary folk songs, with mesmerising lyrics, articulations of soldiers’ experiences in Iraq, zinging tunes and rabidly strummed autoharps.Few expected the transgender vocalist now known as Anohni to triumph with an album about death and identity. There was a subsequent ruckus about whether an artist who had lived in the US since the age of 10, despite being born in Chichester, should win a British music prize at all. Still, I Am a Bird Now is beguiling, a Mercury winner unlike any other.Its impact in popularising trip-hop was gradually dulled by its own ubiquity and a glut of inferior soundalikes. Now that shoddy replicas of Sour Times and Glory Box no longer blare from shops, Dummy’s mix of Beth Gibbons’ haunting vocals, well-placed samples and inventive production sounds special once again.Still the fastest-selling debut by a band in British music history, the young Sheffield indie rockers’ album swept the Mercury and the nation with Alex Turner’s tales of urban romance and prostitution, memorable put-downs (“you’re not from New York City, you’re from Rotherham”) and pithy tunes.The Sheffield sextet’s big breakthrough still sounds like the record Jarvis Cocker had waited all his life to make. Pulp’s gangly frontman poured years of sexual, social and class frustrations into Disco 2000 and, of course, Common People. The long-struggling, charismatic misfits stormed pop’s gilded palace.Dylan Mills may have acquired a slightly goofier image since Bonkers slayed the chart, but it’s hard to overemphasise what a game-changing original this was. Startling, grim tales of inner-city life combine with stomach-rumbling bass and disorienting synths to form one of the foundation stones of grime.It’s faintly disturbing to think that the first Mercury winner is the best, but Primal Scream’s genre-busting colossus remains the benchmark. The hedonistic, record-box-scouring Scots had already been fey, jangling Byrdsy types and leather-trousered Stooges aficionados before the combined influence of ecstasy, acid house clubs and DJ Andrew Weatherall (as co-producer) came into the mix. Screamadelica captured the zeitgeist, like any Mercury winner should, with its mix of dub, house, indie-dance and – in Loaded, Movin’ On Up and Come Together – era-defining but timeless anthems."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/336d9c61f97757f08c3ad49ac292be5570cbaed5/2_0_10663_6400/master/10663.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16ec65fd85f5745c3da0996abbc107e1","title":"the bright side why women fell out of love with black","story":"For decades it has been synonymous with timeless chic – but now joyful, attention-grabbing colours are pushing it out of the wardrobeNew Yorkers do it. Parisians do it. Fashion types, Swedes and architects do it. In fact, name any stylish tribe and you’ll find that they do it. Wear black, that is – a colour that has come to signify so much: rigour, elegance, sex appeal, piety, formality, slenderness, even wickedness.Recently, however, black’s supposedly timeless status as the go-to hue for the chic has been thrown into the shade. And maybe that is no bad thing.Scroll through any British fashion website today and a rainbow of colour beams out. The breadth of shades feels remarkable: Topshop sets out its stall with a parrot-green silk skirt, a lemon coat and an azure trouser suit. At Boden, it’s all tomato-red cardigans and spotty cerise frocks. At Zara, there are russet and emerald tartans and rollneck jumpers in highlighter pen yellow and candy pink.Yes, Britain is in the midst of a heatwave, but this is no seasonal aberration. For months, the fashion news agenda has been hijacked by colour, seen everywhere from Amal Clooney’s dandelion-yellow royal wedding frock to Janelle Monáe’s so-called “vagina” trousers (pink, of course).Black is not dead, but Florence Allday, Euromonitor International’s analyst, predicts it will become an “increasingly smaller proportion of retailers’ product offering”, thanks to shifts in our lifestyles. “Now your office can be anywhere, the boundaries between formalinformal, workhome, onlineoffline are blurring,” she says. “Colour is no longer seen as frivolous, eccentric or inappropriate.”Colour is going nowhere for autumn, when the trends set to trickle down from the catwalk include neon and hi-vis. And this is not just for the very young or achingly hip: the philosophy behind John Lewis’s biggest womenswear relaunch in decades, on sale in September, is about using colour as a means for expressing iniduality, with most items available in up to four hues.The professionally seen-and-not-heard have used colour cannily for decades. The Queen, for one, dresses brightly to ensure visibility. Recently, she has noticeably ramped up the intensity, dabbling in head-to-toe lime green and shocking chartreuse.Such expert tricks are becoming part of civilian wardrobes, too, thanks to social media, and what Smith describes as “millennial peacocking”. She says: “It’s the fastest way to stand out on an endlessly updating feed.”Instagram stars are virtuoso colourists. The Danish street style star Pernille Teisbaek, for example, is an icon for what passes as understated chic now. Although monochrome makes up a significant part of her feed, she uses colour when it counts. On the cover of her recent book, Dress Scandinavian, for example, she wears mustard trousers, a canary-coloured jacket and a T-shirt with the word “yellow” over a picture of a bunch of bananas, an image which kills dead the idea of navy-and-cream Scandi minimalism.As the internet threatens the future of the traditional high street, the niche brands flourishing online have colour at the centre of their business plans. Kitri, for example, has seen products such as its £145 grass green Gabriella dress go viral. When the company launched, in March 2017, founder Haeni Kim says: “There was more of that traditional retail sense of putting more quantity behind neutrals. Now, we have started phasing out neutral colours, which is very unlike the traditional rules.” Bright colours, she says, “make people feel special. They get such amazing compliments. They photograph well on our website, and also stand out when customers take photographs of themselves. We are living in a very photographed world.”Even vampires don’t wear much black these days, according to Susie Cave, the wife of musician Nick, whose label, the Vampire’s Wife, has quickly captured the fashion zeitgeist. The brand’s name, which was always meant to be ironic (“You know, my husband has been held hostage by the Prince of Darkness thing for years,” she says), might suggest a Morticia Addams palette – but the emphasis is on peaches-and-cream florals and deep shimmering greens.“I think the world in which we live as women has become so isive, so bloodthirsty, so vindictive and puritanical that women want to exist beyond these reductive influences, and colour is one way of doing this,” says Cave. “Colour has a huge positive psychological impact – it is a shout of iniduality – and I think women want some life and wonder and joy and wildness in their lives and colour gives them that.”Cave is far from alone in using emotional language about colour. In fact, one of the most fascinating shifts in our approach to colour is the way we talk about it. In the 90s, colour analysis meant finding out if you were “cool autumn” or a “warm spring” in order to buy a jumper that would make your eyes sparkle. Now, colour chat rarely mentions appearance, but is about politics, identity and mood.In 2016, the term “millennial pink” was coined to describe a shade said to encapsulate the moment’s “ambivalent girliness”. Since then, as the fashion blog ManRepeller wrote in May, colour has become clickbait. Other shades with catchy names – among them “Gen Z yellow” and “melodramatic purple” – have also been briefly posited as generation-defining, while bright colours are increasingly used for protest, from pink pussy hats to calls to wear red for International Women’s Day, or green for Grenfell or orange for gun safety.WGSN’s colour director, Jane Boddy, believes we are all increasingly aware of “how colour connects us, as human beings, and how we use it as a tool to define us”. Certainly, a fascination with something as digestible as colour makes sense when the news agenda is so tangled and baffling, thanks to Brexit and Trump.We may be living through the most visual era ever. But at least fashion experts are no longer urging women to wear black clothing to look thinner or less distracting in the workplace.Issues of class and gender swirl around black dresses like clouds of chiffon. Black has been linked with money and taste since the 1500s. In the Victorian era, it was a signifier of mourning, and scandalously worn by women of loose morals in paintings, including Manet’s A Bar at the Folies-Bergère and John Singer Sargent’s Madame X. The pivotal moment, however, for black as we know it was Coco Chanel’s little black dress, a simple, long-sleeved, straight-up-and-down shift hailed, on a 1926 Vogue cover, as the fashion equivalent to Ford’s Model T, “a sort of uniform for all women of taste”.The reality of Chanel’s LBD was far less progressive than the mythology suggests. According to Shelley Puhak, writing in the Atlantic: Chanel’s innovation was an appropriation of servant’s uniforms, part of the luxurious poverty – “la pauvreté de luxe” – trend “reserved exclusively for those who could ‘afford’ to look poor by pretending that they simply couldn’t be bothered with fashion. But on closer inspection, there would be some small detail in her seemingly anonymous garment – a certain cut or fabric or label – that acted as a secret handshake for those in the know.” Plus ça change.Little black dresses have since become a cultural totem. They can launch careers (Liz Hurley and her safety pins) and wreak revenge (Princess Diana at the Serpentine Gallery party in 1994). Their icons are usually very sharp and very thin. The patron saint is Audrey Hepburn in a black Givenchy shift in Breakfast at Tiffany’s or a black beatnik rollneck in Funny Face. Other notable black dress icons include the quartet of grumpy glamazons in the video for Robert Palmer’s Addicted to Love.Black is not very friendly. So many of the aphorisms that exist about the shade have a hectoring tone: “A woman without a little black dress, has no future,” said Coco Chanel. Black, according to the Japanese designer Yohji Yamamoto, says: “I don’t bother you. Don’t bother me!” Karl Lagerfeld, of course, thinks wearing black is much safer than dressing according to your own terrible taste. “If you’re wearing black, you’re on sure ground.” And behind it all is the pernicious idea that black matters because, as Christian Dior put it: “It is the most slimming of all.”So, is black a feminist issue? Susie Orbach says black has been “coded” as elegant, but often this really means slimming. “You could go back to Breakfast at Tiffany’s, the image of the gamine, cute sophisticate in the black dress. What’s in that is skinny, which, of course, has been absolutely critical to the representation of femininity for years.”At a time when body image issues are worse than ever, according to Orbach, dancing on black’s grave is probably not merited. “There is no bloody difference when you are talking about clothing,” she says. “It’s still about: ‘How do I represent myself?’ There is always an internal eye that’s judgmental, whether the current trend is that you need to stand out, rather than look svelte and sophisticated. It’s the same thing, just a different version of it. It strikes me as a wish too far, frankly.”Naomi Wolf, the author of The Beauty Myth, is a little more optimistic. “If women are embracing colour, it suggests that they are confident they can be taken seriously without wearing black,” she says. “If people aren’t choosing clothes primarily to appear smaller, I think that’s really politically important. It says: ‘I’m here and I’m not ashamed.’ It’s very non-apologetic.” And that’s an argument that I can buy into. After all, we may as well look on the bright side."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bad3f6775f483a0373a08c54b05ccf54a5476fff/0_78_4544_2726/master/4544.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3cdcef516d67c7cad1f96d0a4a2f6735","title":"michael pena netflix extinction","story":"One of the few visible Latinx actors working in big-budget blockbusters, the star of Netflix’s splashy new sci-fi thriller Extinction talks about his time in HollywoodMichael Peña is right at the career juncture where a character actor breaks into full-fledged movie stardom, where an oh-it’s-that-guy graduates to household-name status.The actor has logged over two decades of uniformly serviceable work in films of wildly varying quality, from straight-faced ensemble appearances in Oscar contenders like Crash, American Hustle, and The Martian to comedic turns in other people’s star vehicles, such as Tower Heist and 30 Minutes or Less. Recently, however, he’s moved to the fore as a nonchalant everyman type easily cast in projects with a broader reach. He was the secret weapon of Ant-Man and returned to steal even more scenes in the recently released sequel, but this week brought him the official signpost of mainstream success in the film industry: a leading role in a big-budget, effects-heavy sci-fi epic. He stars in Netflix’s Extinction as a man haunted by recurring nightmares of an alien attack, until one day, his visions become a violent reality. (Let’s just say that not all is as it seems, and leave it at that.)Perhaps the secret to Peña’s success is that his easygoing-dude schtick is no act he likes hanging out with his son more than hobnobbing with A-list elites and seems entirely comfortable busting out a Bob Dylan quote at a moment’s notice. Across a far-reaching phone call, the ascendant actor offered his thoughts on pirate dreams, molding a character around a big twist, and the trials he faced as a Latino actor looking to gain a foothold in the biz.Do you believe in extraterrestrial life, out there among the stars?Aw, I don’t know, dude! It’s hard to see anything that you’re not a part of. Maybe there is. What do you think?I think if there are aliens, they’re not gonna be invaders. They’ll be nice, like ET or David Bowie in The Man Who Fell to Earth.It’s like this: as big of a universe we have, are we not the aliens? Our galaxy is huge enough that there must be life forces, whatever you want to call them, somewhere out there.Your character can’t shake this nightmare of an alien invasion – do you have any weird recurring dreams?Yeah, you know what: for ages, I had this dream that I was on a pirate ship, and I’d get cut in half. I had no idea why that kept popping up. In the dream, getting cut in half never hurts, I’d keep on fighting. There’s nothing in there based on the reality of what scares me, but it kept coming back.They say these sorts of things are symbolic, right?The only thought I have is that it’s about searching for treasure, that I might be looking for something. But I don’t know what that’d be.Extinction was pulled from the schedule right before its release and sold from Universal to Netflix. How’d you get that news, and how’d you take it?I just knew that when we stopped shooting, with all the CGI, I thought that there was no way we would make the initial release date. There was a lot of special effects stuff to be added in post-production. I’ve been on enough sets to know that doing CGI right takes a lot of time and effort. Then, pushing a release date is always tricky, because you can’t just put it on whatever weekend you feel like. You don’t want it too close to another sci-fi movie.I heard Netflix has billions of dollars in acquisitions, and they’re really into sci-fi. Look at Bright, which I think was going to go to Warner Brothers until Netflix outbid them, and then it turned out to be a hit for them. I think David Ayer is working on Bright part two right now. I watch a lot of sci-fi on Netflix. There’s something kind of futuristic about getting new high-quality movies right on your television.Without giving too much away – there’s a big twist in the final act – was it difficult to balance how your character is seen prior to the big reveal and then after?Yeah, man, I know what you mean. Reading the script at first, I didn’t really know how I was going to do it. I love that third act, that’s really what drew me to the script. With movies, I can usually see the ending coming, and with this one, I just couldn’t see it. There are clues to how it’ll end, but the writer covered them up so well that I wasn’t able to identify them. I’m that annoying guy, always telling my wife what’s going to happen during movies. She’s like: “Come on! Be quiet!” That’s why me and my son see a lot of movies together, we’re the same way.I noticed you’ve done some voice work in children’s movies lately. Have you been looking for opportunities to give your kid something to watch?Yeah, exactly. I watch a lot of movies with my kid, and when he laughs at someone else’s character or jokes, I want to be a part of that. I get a little bit jealous! It feels really good to be a part of something my son’s watching.Something your son probably won’t be seeing – you’re going to be on the new season of Narcos. Can you give us the lowdown on your character?I play Kiki Camarena, who’s based on a real-life figure. He was a DEA agent in the mid-eighties, when the DEA was in its infant stages. He goes out to Mexico to try to make a difference, and he sees things coming to a head, tensions forming that would eventually grow into the cartel system.Italian American groups sometimes object to gangster movies on the grounds that they perpetuate negative stereotypes. Is there any equivalent with Latino Americans and narco fiction?No, not that I know of. This is based on a true story, so that keeps it all pretty simple.I feel like there’s a lack of visible Latino and Latina talent in the kind of blockbuster-scaled movies like Ant-Man that you’ve broken into. Do you get that sense yourself, and does it create any pressure to be a representative for the community?The thing is, I started acting about 23 years ago, and it was very tough to get an audition, let alone a part. There are these things called “breakdowns” where they give character descriptions and outline who can audition for them. I still have some of these, where the first 10 would be caucasian, so only caucasians could audition for them.Twenty-three years ago, that’s just the way it was. It would be around the 12th character down the line where it was open to other ethnicities, and that’s all I had to go on. It was difficult for me to break through, because nine times out of 10, it was some gangster or whatever. Now, though, I don’t have such a pessimistic viewpoint about it all. The way that I’m seeing it, things are changing and becoming better all the time. I’m glad I can be a part of that. I want to keep on changing the status quo. It’s good to want change, but only if you’re willing to be part of that change. Be active, instead of just talking about it. I try not to complain. Instead, I just keep on finding interesting projects.We’ve got Jennifer Lopez, Penelope Cruz, Javier Bardem, Guillermo del Toro, Diego Luna – I don’t know how many – really coming up through the business. Is the situation perfect? No. But it’s like Bob Dylan said, the times they are a-changin’. We gotta stay proactive.Superhero movies remain the biggest draw right now I see your Ant-Man role as the entry to this uppermost level of the industry. Having talked about coming up as a younger actor just now, do you get a sense of perspective about your career?Not really. I see a lot of friends that have had good spells, they’re hot for a certain time, and then it goes away for them. The entertainment business is all dependent on whether people like your stuff or not. Ant-Man was one character, but the question is always what comes after that. For me, I’m just trying to do good work so that I may keep on doing good work. I think more about looking out for directors and producers with good material, like, are they looking at me? Will they hire me? Ask me this again in five or six years, we’ll see where I am."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aee3677d202e46aeb942c87ef62891f93af2cfbc/355_0_4496_2697/master/4496.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b2bacaf3a9045324a001d03029ff935","title":"jose mourinho says liverpool spending puts pressure on klopp to win trophy","story":"José Mourinho has said there is a “demand” on Jürgen Klopp to win a first trophy at Liverpool next season because of the club’s high level of investment.Liverpool have been the transfer window’s biggest spenders, recruiting Alisson for £67m, Fabinho (£43.7m), Xherdan Shaqiri (£13m) and Naby Keïta for around £52m. They also spent £75m on Virgil van Dijk in January.Klopp, who has been at Anfield for nearly three years, had previously stated he was against paying high fees for players and the Manchester United manager referenced this.“That’s OK. But maybe this season finally you demand they win. Now you have to demand and say the team – with the investments you are making last season and you make now, that will probably be the record of the Premier League this season, a team that was a finalist in the Champions League – you have to say you are a big candidate, you have to win.”Mourinho also said he knew of Anthony Martial’s decision to return home for the birth of his child earlier this week. “When it is personal reasons, everyone analyses the way he thinks is the correct way,” Mourinho said.“And when a man is going to be a father – in this case, it’s the second time he is going to be a father – and he decides it is very important for him to go, nobody has the right to stop him to go.”Mourinho also confirmed the defender Matteo Darmian wants to leave United. “Matteo wants to leave and when a player wants to leave, if the right offer arrives, you have to try to be human and let the player follow his instinct but not at any price,” he said, before discussing his lack of options at right-back.“Ashley Young is a possibility to play right-back but he is on holiday. I don’t know if he fancies to be back for that and put himself to be available for the team or stay on holiday. Victor Lindelöf is a possibility, he is not a right-back but he is a possibility – he starts training next Monday. I will send people to Manchester to train with Victor, it makes no sense for him to come to the US.“So if Matteo leaves he leaves because the right offer arrives and if he stays, he can be important for us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87f2869b2e39fc05a9779469422601030cf4a67d/0_179_3048_1829/master/3048.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d495a235aaf0eae5aa8a318ebbce527","title":"sadio manes stoppage time winner lifts liverpool over manchester city","story":"Sixty days after his last Liverpool appearance was brought to an abrupt, painful and tearful halt in the Champions League final, Mohamed Salah returned seamlessly to his role as tormentor-in-chief for Jürgen Klopp’s team. Manchester City were again made to suffer, succumbing to their fourth consecutive defeat in seven months to Liverpool courtesy of Sadio Mané’s stoppage-time penalty.Salah transformed a pre-season friendly in which a youthful City side held the edge, and the lead through Leroy Sané’s fine finish, before succumbing to the greater energy and quality that the Egypt international and Mané brought to the Liverpool attack. The scorer of 44 goals for Liverpool last season equalised 70 seconds after his introduction at the MetLife Stadium. He could have finished with a hat-trick but had to settle for a pivotal role in the penalty that gave Liverpool victory instead.Preparations for the International Champions Cup fixture were far from ideal for both teams. The pitch was a problem too, sodden following a day’s downpour and patchy having been relaid at 5am on Tuesday after a series of Taylor Swift concerts. City had 16 members of their first team squad missing due to post-World Cup holidays and injuries. A youthful, inexperienced starting XI was the inevitable consequence although £60m record signing Riyad Mahrez made his second appearance in City colours. Liverpool’s selection issues were less dramatic, with Georginio Wijnaldum returning for his first game of pre-season and Klopp’s team far more recognisable, but they only arrived at their hotel in New Jersey at 2am on the day of the game. Technical issues with their plane and an electrical storm delayed their flight from Charlotte by almost eight hours. Summer signing Naby Keïta suffered a sore neck on the journey and was omitted from the match-day squad as a result. In the circumstances City’s youngsters acquitted themselves well, playing the sharper and more threatening football in the first half despite Liverpool enjoying more possession. Lukas Nmecha, the Hamburg-born England Under-19 international, caused frequent problems for Joe Gomez and Virgil van Dijk in the centre of Liverpool’s defence with intelligent movement and strong hold-up play. Oleksandr Zinchenko settled comfortably into a holding midfield role and Brahim Diaz also impressed behind Nmacha. It was Mahrez who dictated the rhythm of the City performance, however, effortlessly controlling proceedings in a more central midfield position than he usually had at Leicester City. Mahrez created the first opening of the night with a perfectly weighted ball into the path of Nmacha. The 19-year-old’s low shot was parried by Loris Karius and, under pressure from Fabinho, he skied the rebound wastefully over an open goal. The striker appealed in vain for a penalty, as did Luke Bolton when he was caught by Andy Robertson inside the area but stayed on his feet before falling once the ball had rolled out for a goal-kick. Referee Sorin Stoica was unmoved by a third penalty claim when Curtis Jones was sent tumbling by Cameron Humphreys shortly before the interval. Jones was Liverpool’s stand-out performer in the first half. The 17-year-old has enjoyed a fine pre-season for Klopp’s team and he posed the greatest threat to City’s defence from the left of Liverpool’s attack. That was until his replacement, Salah, entered the fray in the 61st minute. The friendly was in desperate need of incident to enliven a crowd of 52,635 – a healthy attendance by any standard yet way below the MetLife Stadium’s capacity of 82,500. The appeal of two of the Premier League’s leading lights was inevitably diminished by the absence of so many star names. The quota, and the spectacle, was improved by the second half introduction of Sané. Within seconds of Solanke having a goal disallowed for offside, City opened the scoring with a quality goal on the counter attack. Bernardo Silva, another half-time substitute, sent Sané sprinting clear of Van Dijk with a fine turn away from Fabinho and ball down the left channel. The Germany international, still smarting from his surprising omission from Joachim Löw’s World Cup squad, left Van Dijk in his wake before sweeping a powerful finish beyond substitute goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher. Liverpool levelled swiftly and, to the audible delight of the majority in the crowd, it was Salah who scored with a close-range header from Rafael Camacho’s inviting right-wing cross. The Egypt international had been on the pitch for only 70 seconds when he equalised past an exposed Joe Hart, who replaced Claudio Bravo during the interval, and Salah was instrumental in turning the game emphatically in Liverpool’s favour thereafter. Salah almost headed in a second from Mane’s cross but his effort was deflected wide by Humphreys. He then struck the crossbar when clean through on goal and helped create two decent openings for Mané, neither taken. Liverpool’s late dominance appeared set to peter out into a penalty shootout but, in the 92nd minute, they were awarded a spot-kick when Tosin Adarabioyo clumsily pushed Solanke in the back as they challenged for Salah’s chip into the penalty area. This time Stoica did point to the spot and Mané made no mistake, sending Hart the wrong way to record another win for Klopp over Pep Guardiola. “It is incredible what we have done,” the City manager said. “It was amazing what these players have done for 75 minutes against that team, one that played for the Champions League. I am so, so proud. I am happy to be manager of these guys for that reason. In the last 15 minutes we were so tired and the quality of the changes that Liverpool made up front meant they deserved more goals in the end, but the way we played for 75 minutes was incredible. The average age was 19, so good.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db395978ad1bef6be6669cfdb44a7f3404226ea4/0_0_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7191d7d497e289ecf55b6246e348002","title":"france croatia final trophy russia 2018 ends on high world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss France’s World Cup final triumph over Croatia, another penalty, another controversial VAR incident, the tournament’s highs and lows and players taking shots to the conkers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b1b73edee09c5e588fcf25eb303a9ea8765e543/0_286_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=faaa24d1706e1bbc960865b3e79a89c0","title":"atletico madrid v arsenal international champions cup live","story":"Hands are slapped, captains embrace, and photos are taken. It’s very moving. Here come the teams...Unai Emery is looking forward to the game. He’s looking forward to his team showing how they’ve improved and what they’ve been working on in training. This is quite strange now. We learn about the “uniquely competitive nature of this International Champions Club ... a hugely ambitious project in its scale”. Er, ok mate. The ground is filling up, and we are basically watching a tourist film about Singapore. It looks nice. I’ve just seen that Spurs won 4-1 last night, with both Llorente and Moura scoring braces. Imagine how badly Roma must’ve defended! Like how back in the day, and still in the lower leagues, items of each player’s gear were sponsored by local businesses and such, what if different people can design bespoke features on players’ kits? Imagine how much fun Hector Bellerin could have with that, or whoever paid to decorate Mustafi with images of Baresi, Beckenbauer and Desailly. Is this going to be a regular feature? It could get very funny. Matteo Guendouzi, Arsenal’s new signing from Lorient, is also one on whom to keep an eye. It’s a fair while since they’ve had a decent defensive midfielder - since Santi Car-Zola got injured, at least - and he’s got a chance now to try and establish himself in that position, at least until Lucas Torreira is ready. Of course, the pair could play together, which would allow Ramsey to do what he wants, rather like Frank Lampard did for Chelsea. It’ll be interesting to see how Reiss Nelson gets on today. He looks and is said to be a talent, the problem being that the standard of flair player is so high, it’s rare to see a young one come through at the top end of things. There are roles in which kids can be hidden, but bloke responsible for performing cool stuff is not one. So, though Unai Emery has said nothing public on the subject, it looks like Leno will be first choice in net when the season starts, and not Cech. That seems fair enough to me - well, Cech is well past his best, and though we can be far from certain that Leno is any better, that should probably be investigated. Otherwise Ramsey, who’d like to captain Arsenal, will captain Arsenal - we can probably assume that he’s staying.Atlético de Madrid (a what you looking at 4-3-3): Oblak Juanfran, Montero, Thomas, Moya Rodrigo, Olabe, Joaquín Correa, Gameiro y Vietto. Shall we have some teams? Yes we shall, when Atlético let us have theirs, but in the meantime, Arsenal are playing 4-3-3, the most notable element of which is that Lacazette again plays in the middle with Aubameyang from the left. Quite where Mesut Ozil fits into this, I’m not sure: I am sure that he’d like to be the third man in midfield, but quite how that works, especially when Aaron Ramsey is also involved, I’ve no idea.It must be an invigorating time to be an Arsenal fan: for the first time in a decade, they really don’t know. And what a joy that is, to not know - one of the principal joys of following sport. If everything always went as we expected it to, it’d be real life:More than anything, though – and please correct me if I’m projecting – but the main invigoration is surely the that the issue is no more For the last five years, being an Arsenal fan has looked like the most exhausting pursuit in the world, half the family turning on its patriarch, the other half defending him out of duty, and everyone else laughing, cringing and demanding tedious to interminable questions. All of that is now over, forever. Wenger has been celebrated as he deserved, a proper replacement has been found, and however that goes, there’ll be a period of grace and enthusiasm while it resolves. Atlético, meanwhile, might just be ready to become the best team in the world. Their defence is their defence, and three of its members seriously enhanced their reputations in Russia Saúl is special Griezmann is staying and Lemar is a clever addition, so too Gelson Martins. None of that lot are playing this morningthis afternoonthis evening, but those who are will be as drilled as you’d expect. As far as pre-season friendlies go, this should be a decent one.

This was Venice in the mid-00s and, in the city’s back-street bars such as Caffe Rosso and All’Arco, Norman kept noticing big drinks glowing orange or red. These were Aperol or Campari spritzes, he was told, an assemblage of those tangy apéritifs, local white wine and “seltz” (soda water to us in the UK), garnished with lemon and an olive.Though he didn’t know it then, Norman was researching what would become his first restaurant, Polpo – now a small chain of Venetian-inspired eateries – and when it came to opening in 2009, he needed a signature drink. “We were a regional restaurant, and the spritz seemed an important hallmark of what we were trying to do.” Unsure whether punters would take to them – “Aperol was a complete unknown, Campari was a bit naff” – Polpo gave away spritzes when people walked in. They went down a storm.Why the surge in popularity? Partly, it is marketing. Grupo Campari, which owns Campari and Aperol, has funnelled giant budgets into the latter especially, which included a sponsorship deal with Manchester United in 2014 promotional accessories (RIP my Aperol sunglasses, lost at Notting Hill carnival in 2012) and a roster of events including the Aperol Spritz Social in east London in June – not just two spritzes and a few bites for a tenner but also an Aperol-hued canal with rowing boats and a carousel of lurid orange Vespas. Low-key, then.There is no doubting that the Aperol spritz is Instagram gold. Search the #spritz hashtag and your screen will be awash with lurid orange drinks alongside similarly\u0026nbsporange millennials, spritz tattoos and spritz\u0026nbspmerch. Ex-Made In Chelsea star Millie Mackintosh and Benedict Cumberbatch are both fans of the drink, while it’s arguable that Donald Trump even shares genetic material with it.The definition of a spritz varies depending on where you are. In essence, says Kay Plunkett-Hogge, the author of Aperitivo: Drinks and Snacks for the Dolce Vita, it’s a drink of white wine, soda and Italian bitter liqueur over ice – “I favour one part of each” – and can be traced back to the mid-19th century, when Venice (or Lombardy-Venetia) was part of the Austrian empire. “The story goes that Austrian soldiers didn’t much like the local wines, so they took to adding soda water to punch up their acidity. So ‘spritz’ derives from the German spritzer, ‘to spray’.” In other wealthy north Italian cities such as Milan and Turin, where pre-dinner aperitivo culture is deeply embedded, prosecco and an orange slice replace the white wine and olive of Venice. This is the style favoured on British soil and, personally, I’ve always thought Campari or Aperol to be a handy weapon for masking cheap sparkling\u0026nbspwine. Ironically, then, for something so adored for its taste today, the spritz’s roots lie in hiding certain flavours rather than celebrating them.In the UK, not least with these sizzling temperatures, the rise of the spritz continues unabated. Some bars serve Aperol Spritz on tap, others have whole spritz-dedicated menus, serving up ever more creative spins on that original formula of aperitif-plus-wine-plus-soda: St-Germain elderflower liqueur with rose, maybe or the Dandelyan bar in London’s Pantone spritz of “Plymouth gin, black rice, Cocchi Rosa, corn syrup and bubbles” or, indeed, the alternative spritzes now popular in Venice.Norman says there is a movement\u0026nbspof young Venetian restaurateurs and bar owners “who have seen their city and culture appropriated by the rest of the world, and are trying to claw it back”. Aperol and Campari are sidelined in favour of the more herbal and vegetable bitters enjoyed by their grandparents – Amaro, Cynar – which, if you can overlook their muddy water complexions, hit the spot in a spritz. That’s what the locals are drinking you heard it here first. So, unlike Norman, you won’t have to pluck up the courage to ask.All in a tumbler filled with ice ...1 part Cynar1 part Prosecco1 part sodaA squeeze of grapefruitGarnish with another slice of grapefruit1.5 parts Pimms2 parts Prosecco1 part sodaGarnish with celery leaves or cucumber1 part St-Germain2 parts rose wine1 part sodaGarnish with a slice of lemon1 part Crodino (Campari’s non-alcoholic aperitif) 1-2 parts tonicGarnish with a slice of lemon This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Although Marks said on Thursday that the main motivation was to get hold of Fairfax’s TV streaming asset Stan and its property business Domain, Nine said there were no plans to close the newspapers.On a call to investors and business analysts, Marks said news was an important part of both Nine and Fairfax and the two newsrooms would now have multiple platforms to distribute their content on.Fairfax’s chief executive, Greg Hywood, who will remain for about six months but will then depart the business entirely, said on the same briefing that Nine has a “great history of journalism” and he believed the television company was “a great home for the mastheads”.Marks gave a media conference in Sydney on Thursday morning to talk about the deal which came after Nine approached Fairfax at the beginning of July. “This morning we announced that Nine and Fairfax Media would merge, resulting in one of Australia’s leading independent media companies,” he said. “The merged company will be called Nine.”Costello said: “Both Nine and Fairfax have played an important role in shaping the Australian media landscape over many years. The combination of our businesses and our people best positions us to deliver new opportunities and innovations for our shareholders, staff, and all Australians in the years ahead.”In the joint statement to the ASX, it was also revealed that once the process was finished Nine will “review the scope and breadth of the combined business, to align with its strategic objectives and its digital future”.Pending approval from regulators and Fairfax shareholders, the takeover was expected to be completed before the end of the year. Hugh Marks told staff on Thursday the deal marked a “truly momentous development” for Nine. “The ground-breaking merger – harnessing the strength, assets, quality and reach of two of the country’s most famous industry brands – is another highly significant step in the evolution of Nine’s business into one of the most powerful media organisations in the country. The scope of this deal is genuinely quite breathtaking.“This merger is not about cost reductions. This merger is all about creating a business with the ersity and scale of revenues and earnings to be able to continue to do what we are all about. Create great content. Distribute it broadly. And engage our audiences and advertisers … “Make no mistake, these are exciting times for Nine.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43ed561fc30748b6fb5c5c17446b5e7cc2b341d1/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6914bc4d9259f5ac6acd3dd9bf4d3bcd","title":"mercury prize 2018 shortlist nominees noel gallagher florence and arctic monkeys","story":"Other nominees for the prestigious album award include Lily Allen, Jorja Smith and Wolf Alice, jazz group Sons of Kemet, and experimental acts Nadine Shah, Everything Everything and King KruleArctic Monkeys’ sixth album, Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino, has been named among the nominees for this year’s Mercury prize. The nod makes them the joint second most-nominated act in the prize’s history: the Sheffield band and PJ Harvey have both received four nominations since its inception in 1992, while Radiohead have five.The list features a handful of other bands: Everything Everything receive their second Mercury nomination for A Fever Dream, as do Wolf Alice for Visions of a Life. The London band tweeted: “We are really proud of our baby Visions of a Life and had a such a weird and wonderful time recording it, it is extremely nice to be nominated for the @MercuryPrize. Thank u! We are absolutely buzzing! Lagers on us tonight”.Filling the Mercury prize’s notorious jazz slot are London-based group Sons of Kemet for Your Queen is a Reptile, their first nomination. “It’s great to know that our music and our ideas will have the chance to resonate with as wide an audience as the Mercury nominations permits,” said Sons of Kemet leader Shabaka Hutchings. “Our aim is to merge the music and ways of perception associated with histories of the Afro-Caribbean diaspora to the developments happening within the London music scene and propel the results outwards to the world as a force for good.”It is a good year for first-time nominees: King Krule’s experimental opus The Ooz, Nadine Shah’s political post-punk statement Holiday Destination and Lily Allen’s No Shame. “BOOM. So fucking happy!!!!!” Allen tweeted, while Shah said she was “still in shock” about the news. Two debuts made the list: grime act Novelist’s Novelist Guy, and R\u0026ampB star Jorja Smith’s Lost and Found. Noel Gallagher (and his High Flying Birds) receives his first solo nomination for Who Built the Moon?, but his history with the prize stretches back to the mid-1990s when Oasis were nominated for their debut album Definitely Maybe in 1995 and follow-up (What’s the Story) Morning Glory? in 1996.XL Recordings boss Richard Russell’s all-star Everything Is Recorded album also marks his first nomination – however the album features Sampha, who won last year for his debut Process, and Damon Albarn, who has been nominated with Blur, Gorillaz (who rejected the nomination for their 2001 self-titled debut) and as a solo act.Bookmaker William Hill has tipped Florence + the Machine, Noel Gallagher and Arctic Monkeys as potential winners with odds of 41.There is little crossover between the shortlist and the artists tipped by the bookmakers prior to the nominees’ unveiling. Paddy Power, Coral and Ladbrokes had south London band Shame tipped at 31 as outright winners, followed by experimental teen duo Let’s Eat Grandma at 51. Arctic Monkeys had odds of 81, with alternative pop group Superorganism at 121 and producer Sophie at 161. Acclaimed albums by Leeds psychedelic band Hookworms, Welsh electronic artist Gwenno and pop iconoclast Charli XCX were also notable by their omission.The judges for the Mercury prize are editor Phil Alexander, BBC Radio 1’s Clara Amfo, broadcaster Danielle Perry, jazz musician Jamie Cullum, pop artist Ella Eyre, the  Guide’s deputy editor Harriet Gibsone, musician Lianne La Havas, Times critic Will Hodgkinson, DJ MistaJam, Mumford and Sons’ Marcus Mumford, BBC 6Music’s head of music Jeff Smith, musician Jessie Ware and Radio X head of music Mike Walsh.

After Theresa May’s Chequers deal and the subsequent departures from the cabinet of Boris Johnson and David Davis, the Conservative party is ided and the Brexit debate has entered its final, critical phase. How did we end up here? And what could happen in the coming months?In the 1990s, as Conservative opposition to ever-growing closeness to what was now the EU festered, John Major faced repeated challenges from what he called the “bastards” – die-hard Eurosceptic MPs who opposed the Maastricht treaty and other integration moves.After the Tony Blair and Gordon Brown years, during which the main debate about Europe was whether or not the UK should join the euro, from 2010 David Cameron was tormented both by Tory Eurosceptics and a seemingly rampant Ukip, and so in 2013 he proposed an inout vote. Emboldened by the 2014 Scottish independence vote, he took the Tories into the 2015 election with an EU referendum as a manifesto pledge. There are two key dates in Theresa May’s mind: 18 October, which is the start of the two-day EU summit that is expected to approve a withdrawal agreement and 29 March 2019, Brexit day. But there are several other milestones along the way.In September the government is due to unveil its plans for a post-Brexit immigration policy, one of the most tortuous and controversial elements of the process. Then, at the end of the month, May faces what could be a hugely hostile Conservative party conference.If all this is achieved, the work begins on trade talks and the other measures to come into force at the start of 2021, when the transition period is due to end. This would be when any deal on a backstop solution to prevent a hard border in Ireland would expire.Is the Chequers proposal dead?It’s certainly not very popular, possibly even among May’s cabinet, but it has one thing in its favour. No one else currently has an alternative plan that could conceivably pass through parliament and have a chance of being accepted by the EU while not breaking the Tory party apart. As with almost everything connected to Brexit though, all this could change.Will May face a leadership challenge, or could there be an election? As with her Brexit plan, the one thing keeping May in No 10 is the lack of a plausible alternative. The PM is, at best, grudgingly respected by her fellow Tory MPs for her dogged persistence, and many would like to see her go. Not enough seem committed to forcing an immediate leadership contest though, mindful that installing a committed Brexiter in her place could fracture the party, and that the two most talked-up contenders, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, are hugely isive in their own party, let alone the country. As such, May seems a fair bet to see Brexit through. As with the Chequers plan, however, everything could change almost overnight. An election is seen as less likely, with MPs painfully aware the public would not relish yet another call on their attention, and it could be seen as self-indulgent given the Brexit deadlines. Conservative MPs in particular will have also noted their party’s recent mini-slump in the polls.What are the various camps up to this summer?With parliament in recess until September, it would be nice to think the more single-minded MPs from both sides will focus on constituency duties, and on reintroducing themselves to their families and spending a quiet couple of weeks on a beach.In reality, the plotting is unlikely to take a summer break. May cannot realistically expect a leadership challenge without the Commons sitting, but her principal opponents will be gathering their forces before the Tory conference.Similarly, some among the majority of Labour members who wish Jeremy Corbyn would do more to oppose or mitigate Brexit will hope to raise a proper debate on the issue at their conference. This could even include dissent from the Momentum group that back Corbyn.Officially, just two. A deal based on May’s Chequers plan, with whatever alterations are imposed during negotiations, or a departure without a deal, whether moving to World Trade Organisation trade terms or some other hastily agreed arrangement.Some of May’s MPs advocate other options. Boris Johnson used his first speech since stepping down as foreign secretary to call for a plan based on May’s more hard Brexit-based Mansion House speech, while David Davis’s allies hanker after a Canada-style deal. Given the strict timetable, however, and lack of any details as to how these would work, it seems a big ask.What are the forecasts for these options?The only semi-official forecasts, made by government officials and seen by MPs but not published, suggest that whatever Brexit outcome emerges, the UK economy will take something of a hit.Brexiters have dismissed the figures as alarmist, and it is true that it is difficult to extrapolate what might happen given so many variables, but big business groups such as the CBI and Institute of Directors agree that a no-deal Brexit would be seen as the most damaging.Could there be a second referendum, and what would it ask?What was until fairly recently something of a fringe position, advocated largely by the Liberal Democrats and the remainer edge of the Labour party, has moved slightly more into the mainstream in recent weeks.The idea seems unlikely though, for now at least, given the government’s intractable opposition, the public’s scepticism and the, at best, ambivalence of the Labour leadership. There is also extremely limited time to make the necessary legal preparations.Could it all be delayed?Pressured UK negotiators would be advised not to rely on this. Some believe that if the October EU summit fails to reach a deal, an emergency EU gathering before the end of the year could achieve one, but that’s probably as far as the flexibility goes. There one overriding reason is article 50. When this was triggered by May’s government on 29 March 2017, it set in place a formal legal process heading in one direction: the UK’s exit precisely two years later.Officials in Brussels say that while the article 50 process could in theory be extended, there would be no appetite to do so if it were merely to delay an inevitably disorderly departure. The only way it could conceivably happen, they say, would be because of some fundamental shift in the UK position, for example a new prime minister or a general election.When will we know if it’s been worth it?Among the many moveable deadlines of Brexit, this is perhaps the most elusive of them all. For all the Brexiters’ pre-referendum talk of sunlit uplands and the easiest trade deals imaginable, even some diehard believers now seem to be arguing that the benefits will be more visible in the long term.How long term depends on who you ask. In a much-shared recent interview with Channel 4 News, the Brexit cheerleader Jacob Rees-Mogg was challenged on how the success or otherwise of departure could be gauged. He replied that it was “a question of timescale”. Pressed on this, he said: “The overwhelming opportunity for Brexit is over the next 50 years.”• This article was amended on 26 July 2018. Measures would be set to come into force at the start of 2021, not the end of that year as an earlier version said.

But Smith said some had accepted the invitation to perform, only to withdraw after looking into the visa process. He blamed the situation on the 2016 decision to leave the European Union, which sent a message out that the UK was closed to foreigners. “We’ve had situations where, say, an African artist has been due to come who plays a particularly rare instrument, and we’ll be asked: ‘Can’t you find someone in the UK who plays that instrument?’, which is absurd,” he said.“The saddest thing is always the number of artists struggling to get visas to come and perform. What we’re seeing this year is unexpected and even more depressing, which is artists saying we’re just not going to tackle the immigration system, saying it’s too difficult and too expensive, and it’s humiliating.”Womad (World of Music, Arts and Dance) was founded by the musician Peter Gabriel in 1982. Smith said that in recent years the festival had been helped by “good people” in the Foreign Office, but that his sense was that the situation was only going to get worse. He said he and Gabriel had spoken at length about how to support artists to continue visiting the UK for Womad. The 36th Womad begins on Thursday at Charlton Park in Wiltshire, with headline acts including Amadou and Mariam, Django Django, Leftfield and the Herbaliser. About 35,000 people attended last year’s festival.

Nine seats for constituency representatives on Labour’s national executive committee are up for grabs and more than half a million members will get a vote.Candidates backed by Momentum, the pro-Corbyn organisation, won the last big set of NEC elections two years ago, and they gained all available seats again in another more recent election when three extra NEC seats were created. Anything other than a clean sweep in this election would be seen as a setback for the Corbynites.Here is the New Statesman’s Stephen Bush on the Momentum message.There is an alternative slate of nine candidates backed by centrists in the party. They have the support of Progress and Labour First. They are all named here. Among other things, they are campaigning for party members to have a say on Brexit and for the party to adopt the full version of the IHRA definition of antisemitism.Describing these candidates as “centre-left”, the Progress director Richard Angell said in a message to Labour members:These NEC elections really make a difference. Whether it is the NEC’s appalling decision on antisemitism, the continuing denial of party members to have a say on Brexit and the total London-centric way the NEC works, who represents party members at the top of the party matters. Voting for the same candidate means you get there same outcomes – denegrating Labour proud anti-racism credentials, support for a Tory hard Brexit and no real say for members outside London. The centre-left is standing the most erse slate every stood for the NEC – they deserve your consideration and support.The Office for National Statistics has published a report today saying that in 2017, for the first time in almost 30 years, UK households on average were spending more than they were bringing in. It says:On average, each UK household spent or invested around £900 more than they received in income in 2017 amounting to almost £25 billion (or about one-fifth of the annual NHS budget in England).Households’ outgoings last outstripped their income for a whole year in 1988, although the shortfall was much smaller at just £0.3 billion.Here is a chart illustrating the trend.The report also says that short-term borrowing has surpassed its pre-crisis levels. This chart, which shows consumer credit (through credit cards, car finance plans and payday loans), shows the trend.Commenting on these findings John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said:In the same week that the Tory government delivered a slap in the face to workers over public sector pay, the ONS findings show the disastrous impact of eight years of austerity on the living standards of families.For the first time in nearly 30 years, we see average household outgoings surpassing incomes.The ONS findings are a stark example of how brutal Tory pay restraint and austerity has led to living costs outstripping earnings for families.Request to readers: I monitor the comments here quite regularly, and so I have a reasonably good idea as to what readers think about the way this blog gets written and what it covers, but around this time of year I find it helpful to ask for some feedback formally.

Thank you in advance.In his Spectator diary Boris Johnson also renews his attack on Theresa May’s Chequers Brexit plan that led to him resigning as foreign secretary. He says:Imagine you leave some stifling desk job and decide to get out into the big wide world — make new contacts in America, that kind of thing. How would you feel if your former company still treated you like an employee? What would you do if you had to obey all the organisation’s rules, and do exactly what they told you? What if you got regular emails saying do this, do that, make me a cup of coffee, your skirt’s too short, please cough up for the company car park — even when you had left? You’d go nuts. You can’t leave an organisation and still be bound by its rules. But that is what the Chequers white paper means. It is vassalage, satrapy, colony status for the UK. For the first time in a thousand years our laws will be made overseas, enforced by a foreign court. It can’t and won’t work. Chuck Chequers.You can see Johnson’s argument, but it is not a great analogy. If you have got a boring desk job and you fancy a bit of travel, you will find it much easier going to the EU, where freedom of movement means you can just turn up, than trying to get a green card for America.Also, Johnson seems to be ignoring the fact that, even if you do land that exciting new job in America, their companies have got rules and car park charges too.Boris Johnson, the former foreign secretary, has written the diary in this week’s Spectator. The first item (the diary comprises several self-contained entries, a mix of serious and light) is about the decision to accept the death penalty as an option for the jihadists facing trial in the US. As Downing Street said on Monday, that decision was jointly taken by Sajid Javid, the home secretary, and Johnson when he was foreign secretary.Johnson defends the decision, of course. But, interestingly, he does so by likening it to authorising a drone strike and by arguing that drone strikes are in part “retributive”. This is significant because the British government justifies drone strikes, such as the one ordered by David Cameron in 2015 that killed two British citizens in Syria, on the grounds of self defence - that they are necessary to counter an imminent threat. Retribution is not a legal basis for extra-judicial killing, and Johnson’s argument implies that the legal justification for such attacks may be spurious.Here is the key quote:Surely there is a bit of humbug in this outrage about the two remaining jihadi Beatles, Kotey and Elsheikh, and Sajid Javid’s difficult but correct decision to send them for trial in America. Suppose the grisly pair had been located a couple of years ago in Raqqa. And let’s suppose there was a Reaper drone overhead, and that British intelligence could help send a missile neatly through their windscreen. Would we provide the details — knowing that they would be killed without a chance for their lawyers to offer pleas in mitigation on account of their tough childhoods in west London? Would the British state, in these circumstances, have connived in straightforward extrajudicial killing? Too damn right we would. It was just such a drone strike that vaporised that other ‘Beatle’, Jihadi John, and I don’t remember hot tears being wept for him. These four ‘Beatles’ were responsible for killing at least 27 people, and there are credible accounts of other bestial behaviour. Of course we legally justify these drone strike assassinations as preventative: to stop future acts of terror in Syria. But that scarcely masks the reality that killing them is also retributive — payback for the filmed executions of innocent people. So why do we support these extra-judicial killings, with no due process, and panic at what might happen in American court? Johnson also says that he and Javid had to balance the “small risk” that Kotey and Elsheikh might be executed in the US against the risk that, without an American prosecution, they would be let free. “Sajid Javid and I decided that the first risk was worse than the second,” he writes. “Who really believes we were wrong?”At the time of the 2015 drone attack Johnson was mayor of London, not in government, and not part of the government decision-making process, and so anyone hoping that this Spectator column could put Cameron in the dock at The Hague will be disappointed.But if Johnson himself ever became prime minister, and ever had to order an attack himself, then presumably human rights lawyers would be digging this out very quickly.And here are some more lines from the Today programme interview with Nathalie Loiseau, the French Europe minister. (See 9.10am.)I do remember Prime Minister May saying that no-deal was better than a bad deal. It’s among the bad solutions but I should say that no-deal is not as bad as a bad deal for the European Union as well. There should be no mistake. Michel Barnier does not represent only the commission. He is the negotiator for the European Union. He gets his mandate and his guidelines from the heads of state and government. And we have discussed it regularly at the level of ministers. We meet with Michel Barnier on a regular basis. So do the heads of state and government. So there is no difference between what Michel Barnier says and what we would say inidually, each and every member state. This is significant because some in the British government seem to think that, if the UK appeals over the head of Barnier to EU leaders directly, it will get a more sympathetic hearing. The Times has a story (paywall) today reflecting this, saying Theresa May will get a chance to lobby EU leaders directly at a summit in Salzburg in September. Here is an extract:Until now EU leaders have insisted that all Brexit negotiations have to be conducted through Mr Barnier. But diplomatic sources said the German chancellor had expressed concerns that the talks were going nowhere. “There is a sense of drift,” said a source. “It is time for leaders to have a serious discussion in the European Council.”Another added: “There is potential to have talks between all 28 EU leaders.”Privately, the commission has already rejected Mrs May’s white paper plans for Britain in effect to remain inside the single market for goods. It said there “cannot be give and take” on the EU’s four freedoms — the movement of goods, capital, services and labour. The proposals for a facilitated customs arrangement where Britain collected tariffs on behalf of Brussels were dismissed as unworkable.They fear that unless EU leaders intervene directly the commission will kill off the proposals, isolating Mrs May and raising the chance of no deal. Some fear that this could come as early as this week.Whilst most of us are looking forward to our summer holiday, the People’s Vote campaign is promising to “turn up the volume” over the next few weeks as it intensifies its call for another referendum on Brexit. There are multiple obstacles in the way, and another poll still seems unlikely, but this morning there was a shaft of good news for the campaign on the Today programme. One unresolved question has always been, if the UK changed its mind and voted to stay in, would the EU agree? According to the French Europe minister, the answer is yes.Asked if staying in was still an option for the UK, Nathalie Loiseau told the programme:We have always said, always, that the door would remain open and that we were not the ones who wanted to erge from the United Kingdom. It was the British people who decided to leave the European Union.And when asked if that meant the UK would be able to stay in, “on the same terms”, she replied:There were other good lines in the interview. I will post more on it shortly.We should get more Brexit today because Dominic Raab, the new Brexit secretary, is in Brussels for more talks with Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator. The two men are expected to hold a press conference late in the afternoon, but details have not been confirmed. And Theresa May is attending the Royal Welsh Agricultural Show.As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web.

The USA, ranked seventh in the world, started the stronger with England pinned back in their final quarter of the pitch. But the home side grew into the match as Danson, the captain, and the defensive stalwart Hollie Pearne‑Webb began to orchestrate attacks through the wingers, Lily Owsley and Hannah Martin.England broke the deadlock just after half-time as Danson found the back of Jackie Briggs’s net and equalled the all-time goalscoring record for England and Great Britain that has stood for 81 years. Their lead lasted two minutes, however, as the 18-year-old Erin Matson fired high over the hapless Maddie Hinch in what will be regarded as one of the goals of the tournament.Danson, whose strike was her 115th for England and drew her level with Marjorie Pollard, was modest about her achievement. “The players that set up the goals should be recognised as much as the goalscorer,” she said.As the match entered the final phase it was clear that only a piece of brilliance or an error was likely to decide the outcome. The USA, through their captain, Melissa Gonzalez, began to push as they searched for the goal that would give them a lifeline in the World Cup, having lost thirfirst match. But neither side could find the winner.England’s final group game will be against Ireland on Sunday while the USA face India. After two draws Hinch knows the size of England’s task. “We’ve been playing well, things are just not falling for us,” she said. “It now sets up a massive match on Sunday. We can’t put it down to one or two factors but we know very well that we need to be scoring more than one goal.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c04b7476bf4393e33d2ac90d4222c77741893bba/0_305_2884_1730/master/2884.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5077002f8226e4af94fc94e971db90f","title":"adil rashid recalled england test squad india cricket","story":"Adil Rashid has been recalled to the England Test squad to face India at Edgbaston on Wednesday despite his decision to turn his back on red-ball cricket in February.The leg-spinner has been in impressive form for England’s limited-overs side but has not played a Test match since facing India in Chennai in December 2016. The 30-year-old’s recall will prove controversial given he walked away from first-class cricket with Yorkshire saying: “It was a decision made purely because of how I felt playing red-ball cricket at this time. My mind’s not there, my heart’s not there.”He signed a white-ball-only contract with Yorkshire, who were disappointed with that decision, and this summer he has shone for England in one-day cricket, taking 20 wickets at an average of 23.95 in series victories over Australia and India.Ed Smith, England’s chairman of selectors, said: “Following his decision in February 2018, Adil has a white-ball-only contract to play for Yorkshire this summer. That arrangement is unchanged by his selection for England. However Adil fully understands that if he wishes to be eligible for Test cricket in the 2019 season, he must have a county contract to play four-day cricket. Moving forward, England Test players must be committed to the County Championship.“Clearly, the one-off circumstances around Adil’s return to the Test squad are unusual. However the selection panel was unanimous in believing that Adil should be selected.”Moeen Ali has been recalled to the Test side for the first time since the tour of New Zealand and the Essex seamer Jamie Porter earns his first call-up at Test level after impressing for his county and the England Lions, while Sam Curran stays in the squad. “With his resilience and appetite for wicket-taking, Jamie fully deserves his elevation to the England Test squad,” Smith said. “Sam Curran, also full of form and confidence in Lions and county cricket, retains his place after his promising debut at Headingley.”There was no place for Chris Woakes, who is still recovering from thigh and knee injuries, with England afraid of rushing him back too soon. The Somerset teammates Dom Bess and Jack Leach miss out but will join the squad for preparations for the Test, which will be England’s 1,000th.“The selection panel felt that Chris Woakes needed a little more time to regain full form,” Smith said. “Chris will combine playing for Warwickshire in T20s alongside building up red-ball fitness and workload with the England coaches.“Jack Leach has had an exceptional run of bad luck which now leaves him short of bowling at the start of the series against India. Having broken his thumb before the first Test against Pakistan, Jack then suffered concussion on his return to county cricket. As a result, Jack has bowled only 37 overs in county or Lions cricket since first being injured. The selection panel felt it was too early for Jack to play in a Test match.“Dom made an outstanding all-round contribution in his debut series against Pakistan and impressed everyone with his character and competitiveness. For different reasons, unfortunately Dom has also found opportunities scarce in championship cricket.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5076c0d33664478866f7a5738434af77ac90ddbf/338_239_2469_1482/master/2469.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e018b674ad859056be439b5ee636c9d","title":"paris tour de france memories skiing down k2 and free kick tomfoolery","story":"This week’s roundup also features pre-season friendly pass brilliance, waterskiing problems and silky AFL skills1) The Tour de France reaches its conclusion in Paris this weekend, which makes it worth a quick look back at the most memorable finishes on the Champs-Élysées. In 1991, elbows-out sprinter Djamolodine Abdoujaparov wore green into the final stage (despite controversy after he had forced Johan Musseeuw into the barriers on an earlier stage) but crashed on the final sprint – yet clung on to the jersey when the team got him over the line. But that finish pales into insignificance next to the 1989 finish, when Greg LeMond overcame his deficit to Laurent Fignon to time trial his way to victory in 1989.

We’ve seen it with the filly in the Oaks and we just have to be careful.”\u0026nbspThat filly was Magic Wand, well backed for Saturday’s Irish Oaks but a shocking disappointment, beaten a long way from home and eventually fifth of the seven runners, nine lengths behind Sea Of Class. She was described as having a dirty nose the next day.\u0026nbspIt’s not like all of O’Brien’s are performing below expectations. His Forever Together was beaten just a neck in Magic Wand’s race and the trainer has had four winners since, including two from four runners at Naas yesterday. Still, it’s a worrying time if you’re interested in one of his at a short price.\u0026nbspKew Gardens was just about the most interesting runner in Saturday’s race, being a rapidly improving three-year-old who’d won a Group One last time. I must admit, I thought we’d hear little of him after he was stuffed in the Derby but he’s won twice since then. Hopefully he can bounce back in time to run on summer fast ground, which apparently suits him.\u0026nbspThere’s an enticing card at Sandown, where bits of 5-1 are still available about Antagonist (4.30), the nap. This is the second day in a row where James Doyle is booked for the nap and I hope he actually does ride this time yesterday, for reasons I don’t know, Employer was eventually partnered by another jockey who hadn’t been on him before and it didn’t work out brilliantly.\u0026nbspAntagonist may also have a side to him, as his name suggests, and he didn’t settle for a 7lb claimer on his reappearance in May, which was also his handicap debut. So far, we haven’t seen a great deal of ability from him but that’s why he’s in this race on a modest horse’s racing.\u0026nbspWhether Antagonist is actually a modest horse remains to be seen but his breeding is encouraging. He’s a half-brother to Almodovar, who ran third in a Hardwicke and ended up on a rating 40lb above the one Antagonist has. His dam is a half-sister to Tante Rose, who won a Haydock Sprint Cup.Roger Charlton, who is faring much better than when Antagonist made his reappearance, also trained Almodovar and Tante Rose, so he knows the family well, as they say. Antagonist opened at 15-2 and looks like going 9-2 across the board shortly.\u0026nbspEarlier, I’m interested in 8-1 about Look Around (2.20) in a tricky-looking Star Stakes. The Kempton race she won last time wasn’t all that but she travelled nicely, made up quite a bit of ground in a short time and took a huge step forward on her debut.\u0026nbspAndrew Balding brings his juveniles along steadily and I think it’s reasonable to imagine she has more to give, another three weeks later. She’s by Kingman, who has made a useful start with his first two-year-olds.I was going to mention Tahreek at Newbury tonight but I see that Sir Michael Stoute is 123 over the past two weeks and has had a couple of disappointing favourites in that time. Perhaps it’s nothing but I shall sit on my hands, watch his runners and ponder what this might mean for the King George.\u0026nbspTips by Chris Cook"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99a43d694ecf6e2e168e00f52358176845b7f906/77_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c136b8e25e2cd9c0f2af21504c53701","title":"nine endorphin boosting ideas to get you outdoors this spring and summer","story":"Time outdoors has a hugely positive impact on our mental health and wellbeing. Whether you fancy paddleboarding around the coast or zipwiring across the treetops, here’s how to unlock a healthier, happier you this spring and summerFrom reducing blood pressure to alleviating symptoms of depression, countless studies have proved that being outdoors and in contact with nature is beneficial for both physical and mental health. In these milder months, there’s no excuse not to be outside as much as possible. Here are nine ideas for inspiration.Ride a waveThe north Cornwall coast, with its big Atlantic seas, is Britain’s premier surf destination, with Fistral beach at Newquay probably the country’s best-known surf beach. But there are great places to learn to surf all around the UK. If you’re after a board experience with a less steep learning curve, stand-up paddleboarding offers the chance to take to the water in an easy-to-learn fashion. As well as the exhilaration of surfing the waves, paddleboarding can be a means of exploring the wonders of Britain’s tranquil inland waterways.Get started: Surfing England (surfingengland.org) has information on surf clubs and learning to surf. The British Stand Up Paddle Association website (bsupa.org.uk) has information on where to learn.See colours in bloomSpring and summer are the best times to explore England’s most glorious gardens. Among the Royal Horticultural Society’s (RHS) stunners is its flagship garden, Wisley in Surrey. Home to one of the world’s largest plant collections, it’s a riot of flowering bulbs and blossoms in spring, with fragrant roses and colourful mixed borders in summer. The RHS also runs summer flower shows around the country, including the world-famous Chelsea flower show. The National Trust is  to more than 200 gardens and landscaped parks, many attached to its historic houses, with Studley Royal water gardens at Fountains Abbey, also a world heritage site, among the best known.Freewheel through forest trailsZip along peaceful country lanes between summer hedgerows, pedal past glowering mountains above Scotland’s Glencoe pass as part of a tour or expedition, race with other cyclists, or even head off-road along forest trails on a mountain bike. Cycling can provide high-adrenaline sport or light, relaxing exercise, but whichever way you ride, getting on a bike gives you an up-close view of the countryside that you’d never get from a car.Get started: Cycling UK (cyclinguk.org) can help you get on the road, with advice on everything from buying a bike to cycling groups and routes.Escape to the countryCity dwellers craving a rural fix should seek out one of the many regional annual outdoor shows, a celebration of farming and rural life, with sheep and cattle competitions, horse and dog shows, sheep-shearing contests and farm machinery displays. These days, though, the events are also packed with family-friendly entertainments, ranging from air displays and carriage-driving races to skateboarding and marching bands. Local producers showcase their food and drink, and makers display arts and crafts.Get started:UK County Shows (ukcountyshows) has countrywide information and links to inidual shows.Swim in scenic surroundingsWhat could be a more perfect summer idyll than plunging into a cool lake or river on a hot, sunny day? Wild swimming – taking a dip in rivers, lakes, streams and waterfalls – has a growing number of fans. Popular spots to swim include Ullswater in the Lake District and lochs throughout Scotland, while rivers in the Brecon Beacons are home to stunning waterfall plunge pools. In the south of England, Pangbourne on the river Thames is one of many popular locations, and there are even urban swims to be had in London’s Serpentine and Highgate ponds.Get started: There’s information on locations throughout the UK and all-important safety tips tips at wildswimming.Soar into the treetopsThere’s a special kind of thrill to hurtling through the treetops suspended on a wire. Locations range from urban parks (such as Heaton Park in Manchester and Battersea Park in London) to mountains and forests. Zip World, with locations in Wales, offers a variety of adventures through forest, over a quarry and even – this one’s for the fitter and more adventurous – underground in caverns. Go Ape has locations throughout England, Scotland and Wales, and a collection of mainly forest-based attractions.Kayak along the waterwaysBritain has thousands of miles of rivers, lakes, reservoirs and canals canoeing (single-ended paddle), or kayaking (double-ended paddle), is a great way to explore them. Assuming you don’t have your own canoe, you’ll need to join a club or go to an activity centre, where staff will generally help new paddlers with an induction session. Sea kayaking is a lot of fun, too, and more experienced paddlers may enjoy canoe polo (just as it sounds) or white-water canoeing. Get started: British Canoeing (britishcanoeing.org.uk) has information on canoe clubs and activity centres around the country, and on canoe hire.Walk this wayWhether it’s a Sunday stroll or a serious hike, there’s no simpler – or cheaper – way to explore Britain’s great outdoors than on foot. The British countryside is laced with public footpaths all you need to get going is a pair of walking boots or sturdy trainers (plus a map and weatherproof gear if you’re going far). Among myriad footpaths, 16 national trails pass through some of the country’s most iconic landscapes. They include the South West Coast Path, with 630 miles of trails snaking around the Dorset, Devon, Cornwall and Somerset coasts, and northern England’s hilly Pennine Way.Get started: National Trails (nationaltrail). In addition, Ramblers (ramblers.org.uk) has suggestions for hiking routes on its website.Combine your love of music with the outdoorsPack your tent and wellington boots and head for one of the country’s iconic music festivals this summer. These days the biggest international names (from Beyoncé to Ed Sheeran) vie to play them: there’s no other way to see so many top artists in a single location. Glastonbury is taking a break in 2018, but there are many others picking up the slack, from Bestival to Latitude, the Isle of Wight festival, V and many more.

The majority of this collection of jewellery, letters, photographs and items from her wardrobe (including hand-painted corsets) was only recently discovered, having been shut away for 50 years since her death. Consider this essential for demystifying the Mexican artist and sartorial icon, and it’s a lot cheaper than going all the way to Mexico. Granted, the exhibition is indoors, but you can combine your visit with a stop-off at the V\u0026ampA’s garden cafe, a hidden oasis in the centre of the museum, where you can sit at one of the courtyard tables or picnic on the lawn.vam.ac.uk from 16 JuneArrange a bouquet of flowersYou don’t have to be embarking on a second career as a florist to appreciate a beautifully arranged bunch of flowers, although a workshop at The Narcissus Flower School in Edinburgh could well send you in that direction. From learning to hand-tie a spring wedding bouquet to perfecting a festival-ready floral crown, this is the place to go this summer for cutting-edge botanical design. The highlight in the programme has to be The Foragers Garden Party workshop, which caters to all al fresco needs, from rustic barbecues to afternoon tea. Bring it on.narcissusflowers 21 June (and various dates)Learn a new craftStep away from the sandy beaches and seafood and head straight to The Studio at Burlingham Hall in Norfolk to get your hands – rather than your toes – dirty this summer.

Here, she explains how her palate has developed, and the importance of smell in getting the most out of a tastingIt was while I was working as a model in my 20s that I discovered a real love of wine, and realised how important the nose is in my ability to taste. But I certainly wouldn’t have guessed that wine would become my passion and career. Before that, if I’m honest, wine was not a big part of my life at all. Growing up, my parents would buy the odd cheap bottle if someone was coming for dinner but it’s not like they collected it or took us to vineyards in the summer holidays.When I got older, I much preferred wine to beer or spirits, but I was totally unsophisticated and used to drink fortified wine flavoured with herbs, which I don’t remember ever sniffing. I thought I was drinking a cocktail. Now I know it was just a vermouth, which is trendy these days, but at the time it was just sweet and easy to drink. A bit later, I was in a bar with actual grownups and didn’t know what to drink. I asked for a martini, so they got me a real one and I was like: “Woah, that is so strong – that’s not what I remember.”Going to France changed all that. I was about 22 and my career was going well and I was lucky to be able to travel and experience lots of different food and cultures. I remember working in France and being amazed that on shoots they would all stop for lunch. In London, nobody stopped for lunch and you’d be constantly starving and usually freezing cold.But on this one job, for a big store in Paris one November, there was a big budget and I thought: “OK, this is going to be a good lunch.” But then we were working through it and I was wondering what was going on. Then, at about three o’clock, everything stopped. It turned out it was Beaujolais Nouveau Day, when people celebrate the harvest of the new wine. I didn’t know what it was but we sat there for hours eating and drinking and it really felt like I’d found my kindred spirits.By my late 20s I was getting a bit bored of modelling and got into restaurants. I cooked and then got into wine, and then I ended up crafting a freelance career as a consultant sommelier. I also write, and run Wine Car Boot, an occasional independent market for wine tasting and buying. During this stage of my life, smell became so important. When you know nothing about wine, you go to the supermarket and it’s all about the same price and they all say on the labels that they’re really delicious. But it was when I began to engage in taste and smell that I realised I could make better choices.The more you smell, the more you can sense things and the more enjoyment you get out of wine. That allows you to learn more, which spurs you on to wanting to taste more and different things. Even a small amount of engagement in your senses – especially smell – enhances your enjoyment of life generally, and you get more out of everything you do.The whole thing about how to taste wine is really how to smell it. Sure, wine does also affect your mouth – the sweetness on your tongue, the acidity and structure on your gums, and how mouthwatering it is – and you could have the best wine in the world and just swallow it down and still enjoy it. But it’s about maximising that pleasure, like savouring an amazing sandwich rather than just wolfing it down. And if you hold your nose while tasting wine you don’t taste much.When I smell a wine now I’m looking for a hint of what’s there – to start the tasting process. Does it smell fresh or older? What kind of fruits am I getting? Does it smell particularly alcoholic or is it very delicate? What is the grape variety? Non-aromatic wines can be very minerally and refreshing, and more able to take on other flavours. Then the aromatic grapes have a strong perfume, like a good riesling. Sometimes it can be like smelling a perfume rather than grapes.I love the perfumes of grapes like pinot noir and burgundy that are highly fragrant, often with some oak in them. You can get floral and spicy or even leathery notes. Instead of being a single smell there’s a whole load going on. Every time I smell a wine like that I can detect something new.It’s got to the stage now where I can’t really remember what it was like to not smell wine, and when I go back and have the wines I drank 10 or 15 years ago they seem awful. Your palate changes both with experience and age and you become more or less sensitive to certain things. I certainly think I have a bigger perspective on smells now. It isn’t like wine experts go around having this constantly fragrant experience of everything and that we’re hypersensitive. But it does become habitual. Sometimes I find myself almost smelling a glass of water and I’m like: Why am I doing this?Wine has also made me more aware of smells in cooking. I swing between rosemary and sage as my favourite herbs. When I worked in restaurants, I did the wine list for a chef called Stevie Parle. He makes these amazing kind of fried sage leaves, done almost in a tempura batter that you can nearly see through. Crispy-sage crisps almost, with this fragrant, herbal and slightly sweet touch to them. They’re absolutely delicious. I could think of a few wines to pair with them, but I’d have them as a little nibble with a glass of good, cold champagne - and I would smell them and savour every moment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40d5117a268c0ec5178f5d9ed1cc76815fbdcbdc/0_380_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d5584ecbe541e1982f62f47e1709ace","title":"parklife britains green spaces in urban places","story":"Spending time outdoors in nature has a hugely positive effect on our wellbeing, but you don’t have to live in a rural area to experience the benefits. Kevin Rushby shares some of his favourite city parks, heaths, wetlands and gardens The only British city to ever win the European Green Capital award (for 2015), Bristol is an urban park-lover’s paradise. Close to the centre is Castle Park, a garden with ruins that is linked across the river by the elegant Castle footbridge. There’s a good five-mile walk to be had along the river, linking gardens and the docks, including Brandon Hill Park. Climb the 30-metre-tall (105ft) Cabot Tower for a fine city view. Scattered all around the city are some great parks worthy of cycle adventures. To the south there is Victoria Park, presided over by the colourful terraced houses of St Luke’s Crescent. Nearby, a real gem is Arnos Vale Victorian cemetery, 18 hectares (45 acres) of greenery where, with luck, you can spot woodpeckers, deer and even slow worms basking on tombstones.Arriving at Glasgow Central, you might be forgiven for wondering where all the green spaces might be, given the extent to which the city’s formidable architecture dominates. Dotted around, however, are some magnificent spots: a top place to go is Kelvingrove, a park with everything for a day out – cafes (try An Clachan), a brilliant museum, monuments, and fountains (the Stewart is a good meeting point). Heading east, check out the Necropolis, last resting place of Victorian grandees. Southwards, the gem is Pollok country park, a lovely day out, even though the unparalleled Burrell Collection is currently closed (till 2020). In the west are the Botanic Gardens, with their fascinating hothouse collection.Given London property prices, you might reasonably expect the city’s green spaces to shrink, not grow. But there have been recent additions, notably Walthamstow Wetlands, a huge area of lakes with 13 miles of trails just a few minutes’ walk from Tottenham Hale station. There is great birdwatching, fishing, cycling and a decent cafe, the Engine House. Also new are the Woodberry Wetlands, a green space that had existed since 1833, but only opened to the public in 2013. Right beside Finsbury Park, it is a good inner-city birding site: you can spot red kites and even marsh harriers. Not exactly new, but renewed, is Burgess Park off the Old Kent Road in Southwark, which recently had an £8m facelift, introducing a bigger lake, new bridge and play areas. Downriver from Greenwich, there are fascinating brownfield parks.Birmingham has hundreds of parks, many of them vast. Kingfisher country park, for example, runs for 11km along the river Cole, while Cannon Hill Park covers around 100 hectares (250 acres). Within that space you have lakes, tennis, golf, playgrounds, running trails and tearooms – this place really can do a full family day out. If you believe that any great park must be in search of a stately home, then try Aston Park – it has a magnificent Jacobean palace. All the above, however, are dwarfed by Sutton Park, a 970-hectare (2,400-acre) national nature reserve six miles north of the centre, which boasts 22 species of butterfly, plus a few rarities. Look out for the startling Camberwell Beauty – unseen since 1996.Holyrood Park certainly has the size (263 hectares650 acres) and the eye-catching eminence of Arthur’s Seat, but this former royal hunting park also leads through to the less well-known Dr Neil’s Garden, a lovely area created by two local GPs who used caravan holidays in Europe as plant-hunting expeditions. Other off-the-beaten track green spaces in Edinburgh include the Archivists’ Garden, one of several small city gardens tucked away from the busy streets. Also check out Dunbar’s Close, a 17th-century garden, and the roof garden at the National Museum of Scotland. About a mile north from the centre is Inverleith Park, which neighbours the magnificent Royal Botanic Garden.Few cities can boast a green space like Cardiff’s Bute Park, a vast expanse of woodland, grass, trails and playgrounds close to the city centre. Its true magic, however, is that it connects, all along the banks of the river Taff, to several other parks: across the Millennium footbridge check out Sophia Gardens – home to Glamorgan Cricket Club, plus cycle hire, horse-riding centre and cafes – then various meadows, parks and gardens all the way north to the M4. Forest Farm country park is worth a visit: the footpath along the old Glamorganshire canal is rich in birdlife, including kingfishers. Also right in the heart of the city is another, much smaller, green space: the Victorian roof garden on top of the Bute Tower in Cardiff Castle.Green may not be the first colour that pops into your mind when thinking of Liverpool, but the city is blessed with great parks. Stanley Park, a classic Victorian creation, separates the Reds and the Blues – the two football grounds of Anfield and Goodison Park. There’s a good cafe in the Isla Gladstone conservatory, plus fishing lake, playground and a red sandstone wall that inspired the Redwall series of children’s books by Brian Jacques. On the other side of the city, check out Sefton Park and Calderstones. From the latter you could walk the mile to another green space: St Peter’s church, Woolton, scene of arguably the most important musical moment in the 20th century: the first public performance by Lennon and McCartney. Also in this quiet churchyard is the gravestone that inspired the Beatles’ Eleanor Rigby."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1bbdf3b8cf78b143b58a57df5e907917a6fbfae/0_169_2381_1428/master/2381.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f8d683d5182ff2295cd1652cc9ecf26","title":"top 10 waterparks uk swimming lidos paddleboarding kayaking","story":"Whether it’s hurtling down a waterslide or a spot of paddleboarding, an aquapark on a summer’s day is always funThe Blue Lagoon waterpark is part of the Bluestone holiday resort, but day visitors are welcome.

The reboot would feature a new setting, but would see Grammer reprise his role as the title character, Frasier Crane. A spin-off of the 80s sitcom Cheers, Frasier ran for 11 series between 1993 and 2004 on the US network NBC. The series saw Grammer’s character return to his hometown of Seattle and reconnect with his cantankerous father, Martin, played by British actor John Mahoney and fastidious brother Niles, played by David Hyde Pierce. Jane Leeves, who played Daphne, Martin’s physical therapist and love interest of Niles, and Peri Gilpin, who played Frasier’s radio producer Roz, also starred. Acclaimed by critics for its witty dialogue and strong characterisation, Frasier won a total of five Emmy awards for outstanding comedy series, a record figure that has only been matched since by Modern Family. Frasier’s finale, which saw Frasier leave Seattle for Chicago with his girlfriend Charlotte (Laura Linney), was watched by 33 million viewers.Aside from Grammer, it is unclear whether a potential reboot would feature cast members from the original series. Mahoney died earlier this year due to complications from throat cancer.

None have served in Congress – and the possibility of a landmark election is galvanizing voters in New Mexico.“Congress has never heard a voice like mine,” Haaland says in a campaign ad that emphasizes her working-class background and progressive platform.Last month, she soundly defeated five Democratic opponents to win the primary for an open congressional seat in a district that includes Albuquerque, the state’s largest city. In November, she will face the Republican Janice Arnold-Jones, a former state lawmaker, and Lloyd Princeton, a Libertarian candidate, in a general election race that is expected to center on immigration, healthcare – and Donald Trump.“Trump has given many people the courage to be bold in their racism. He gives the white supremacists and the far-right folks cause to be,” she said. The president, Haaland says, is completely ignorant of Native Americans’ place in the country’s history. His repeated attacks on the Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren, whom he mockingly refers to as “Pocahontas”, are “disgusting and disgraceful”, she said. At a recent rally in Montana, Trump mused that he might “toss” a DNA test at the Massachusetts senator, challenging her claims to Native American ancestry.“First of all, he doesn’t get to decide who’s native,” Haaland said. “And it is extremely disrespectful for him to continue to use the name Pocahontas as a racial slur.” But she said Trump’s policies, even more than his words, posed an urgent threat to Native American land and traditions. Haaland pointed to the administration’s plan to enforce Medicaid work requirements for Native Americans, a move that tribal leaders say would restrict access to healthcare and undermine their sovereignty. She is also alarmed by the administration’s decision to shrink national monuments and roll back federal land protections.The daughter of military veterans, Haaland attended 13 schools before she graduated high school. To pay her way through college, she decorated cakes and started a salsa business. She earned a law degree while raising a daughter as a single mother and working part time at an antique auction shop. At times, her family relied on food stamps, a reality she said many New Mexicans face as the state has one of the highest poverty rates in the country.A longtime activist, who protested the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline at Standing Rock and marched with women in Washington, Haaland is running on a progressive platform that includes Medicare for All, a $15 federal minimum wage and universal childcare and pre-K. She also supports calls to eliminate the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agency and to impeach Trump. If she wins, Haaland says her top priorities in Washington would be protecting the environment and growing a clean energy economy. She would also fight for more funding and resources to combat violence against women, a scourge that disproportionately affects Native women. Her Republican opponent says voters in the district are more pragmatic than progressive – and that Haaland’s “extreme” positions on border security, oil and gas, and abortion will alienate moderates there.“Quite frankly, the Democratic primary made this a very different election,” Arnold-Jones said. “My opponent is much further left than the district.”Political analysts view it as safely Democratic. Hillary Clinton won the district by more than 16 percentage points and Democrats have held the seat since 2009.Arnold-Jones anticipates Democrats will try to tie her to Trump, but she believes the president’s popularity is on the upswing in New Mexico thanks to a growing economy and the GOP tax cut plan.“It has taken a little bit of time for the state to warm up to him but the result of his policies have been exceptionally positive,” she said, adding: “I actually think if the election were held today, the president would win.”Haaland is part of a broader trend of Native Americans increasingly running for national office, after centuries of systematic persecution, marginalization and disenfranchisement.“Since 1789, we haven’t been able to elect a single Native American woman to Congress,” said Mark Trahant, the editor of Indian Country Today. “That it could finally happen is incredibly important.” Partly driven by opposition to Trump and the #MeToo moment, dozens of Native American women are running for local, statewide and congressional office this year, a cohort that far outpaces past cycles, said Trahant, who is tracking the data. It remains possible Haaland won’t be the only Native American female elected to Congress this year. Sharice Davids, a member of the Ho-Chunk nation, is running in a competitive Democratic primary in a swing district in Kansas, and Amanda Douglas, a member of the Cherokee nation, advanced to a runoff election in the Democratic primary for a deeply conservative Oklahoma congressional district.Unlike many of the female candidates running for office in the wake of Trump’s election, this is far from Haaland’s first foray into politics. She worked for years in Democratic politics before an unsuccessful bid for lieutenant governor in 2014. She then served as the state party chair.The historic nature of Haaland’s candidacy probably helped distinguish her in a race with little ergence on policy, said Joe Monahan, a longtime New Mexico political blogger. He recalled that New Mexicans elected the Republican Susana Martinez after she reminded voters that she would be “the nation’s first Hiic female governor”.“People like to make history. I don’t think that should be underestimated,” he said.But Haaland’s primary success was not a marginal one, Monahan added. She sailed past her opponents in what was expected to be a competitive race by turning out a coalition of progressive voters that agreed with her on issues such as climate and healthcare.In a Democratic district, she is positioned favorably ahead of the general election. A victory in November would seal her place in American history.“It hasn’t really hit me,” she said. “But every now and then I’ll get a sense from someone else and it makes me emotional because I realize that, for some people, they never thought they would see someone like them in Congress.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c20e6b66c3093d0ca51d830c67a265450358afa7/0_141_4732_2840/master/4732.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0336766dc2b487059165359c0fd504ce","title":"pakistan election in disarray as incumbent rejects result","story":"Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz alleges ballot is rigged in favour of Imran Khan’s partyPakistan’s general election has been plunged into chaos after the incumbent Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PMLN) said it would reject the result amid widespread allegations that the military was rigging the ballot in favour of the party led by the former cricketer Imran Khan.With only a third of the vote counted by 3am – an hour after the result was officially due – Khan’s Pakistan-Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) led in 110 seats, with the PMLN trailing on 68.Results continued to trickle in slowly on Thursday, hours after Khan’s supporters took to the streets to celebrate victory.Most projections held that the PTI would go on to win between 107 and 120 seats out of a total 272 in the lower-house, exceeding expectations and delivering the role of prime minister to Khan for the first time.Also known as the Justice party, it is led by the former cricketer\u0026nbspImran Khan, and has had some success at provincial level but has never been able to convert it into national power. Khan has been accused both of lacking a coherent political philosophy and of sympathising with extremists. He has described the Taliban’s fight in Afghanistan as a\u0026nbspholy war, and accused “liberals” who support Nato’s war on the group of being\u0026nbsp“thirsty for blood”.Hopes to win control of parliament again, even though its leader, Nawaz Sharif, is in prison for corruption. Tried and\u0026nbspsentenced\u0026nbspin absentia, he returned to the country this month to serve his sentence, hoping to revitalise the campaign before the election.Now led by Sharif’s brother Shahbaz, the party is focusing on its economic success and promises of energy and infrastructure investment from China. However, efforts to increase tax revenues have faltered.Led by Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, son of the assassinated former prime minister Benazir Bhutto. The party lost ground after Benazir was killed in 2007 but the family name still carries considerable weight. The third-generation leader appears to be playing a long game, rebuilding support in its heartland with an eye on future elections. If it does well in this vote, the PPP could potentially serve as a junior partner in a coalition.The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), an independent body, blamed the delay in announcing the result on a breakdown in the Results Transmission Software it purchased from a British company.“There’s no conspiracy, nor any pressure in delay of the results,” the ECP secretary, Babar Yaqoob, told reporters. “The delay is being caused because the result transmission system has collapsed.”But Shehbaz Sharif, the leader of the PMLN, said his party “wholly rejects” the result of the election, telling a press conference that his party’s polling agents had been evicted from dozens of stations by security officials before a final tally was reached, leaving them unable to monitor potential tampering.“The mandate of millions of people who came out to vote has been humiliated. Our democratic process has been pushed back by decades,” said Sharif. The PMLN, which tried to curb the power of the military while in office, has claimed for months that the establishment was “engineering” the vote against it. The party’s former leader Nawaz Sharif, who on 13 July began a legally-dubious 10-year prison sentence for corruption, has accused the deputy head of the country’s all-powerful ISI spy agency of leadinga campaign against the PMLN. He said it included pressure on its candidates to defect, a spate of court cases and the silencing of supportive media channels.As election workers sorted through massive piles of paper ballots, almost all the parties – except the PTI – alleged that their polling agents had been excluded from polling stations. Bilawal Bhutto, the leader of the liberal Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) – the country’s third-largest party – tweeted it was “inexcusable and outrageous” that his activists had been excluded “across the country”. The complaint was echoed by his rival Khadim Rizvi, the foul-mouthed cleric who leads the far-right Islamist group, Tehreek-e-Labbaik (TLP). “This is the worst rigging in history,” said a spokesman for Rizvi.The PMLN senator Musadik Malik told journalists that security officials had taken over proceedings inside polling stations, with a particular focus on constituencies where the race was close between the PTI and PMLN.“If what most political parties are alleging is true,” Aqil Shah of Oklahoma University said, “it would be the biggest theft of an election since the 1970s”, adding that the the parties should “unite and demand a repeat.”PTI leaders batted away the claims. Pakistan’s likely next finance minister Asad Umar said that only those “sympathetic to India” were crying foul, while the rest of Pakistan “can see the country is going towards betterment.”Terming the vote a “contest between the forces of good and evil”, Naeem ul Haq, a spokesperson for Khan, said the party chairman would address the nation later on Thursday.In a tweet on his official account, Pakistan’s military spokesman Gen Asif Ghafoor called accusations of interference “malicious propaganda.” Concerns about the electoral process were heightened after the ECP last month announced it would allow military officials inside polling stations, and granted them ultimate authority on proceedings there, while the armed forces announced it would deploy 371,000 troops on the day of the election, a fivefold increase on 2013 despite greatly improved security across the nation.After a bloody campaign in which a terrorist attack in the eastern province of Balochistan killed 151 people at a rally, fears of election day violence were confirmed. Within hours of the polls opening, a suicide attack in Balochistan’s capital, Quetta, added 31 to the death toll and was later claimed by Isis.The allegations of vote-rigging marred what was supposed to have been only the second transfer of power from one civilian government to another in Pakistan’s coup-prone 71-year existence.Many supporters argued that 65-year-old Khan, the captain who brought home the 1992 cricket World Cup and a notable philanthropist, could fulfil his promises to end corruption and turn Pakistan into an “Islamic welfare state”.At a street-party in Islamabad, PTI supporters danced ahead of the announcement of the official results.Earlier in the day, 20-year-old Muhammad Junaid brandished his ink-stained thumb outside a polling station in Islamabad and said: “We want change”. His friend, Muhammad Salman, 20, said that an entire generation of young voters were turning out for Khan after being unable to vote in 2013.Electoral projections suggested that the PTI would easily be able to form a coalition that would deliver the required 136-seat majority, drawing on the support of natural allies in the federally administered tribal areas and independent candidates.Analyst Fasi Zaka argued that long-term instability would be limited: “Shehbaz Sharif is not a rabble-rouser, he is an administrator,” he said, adding that the PPP would also quickly cool down if it received the projected 40 or so seats.Analysts said that, from an economic perspective, a stable PTI-led coalition would help the country deal with a looming current-account crisis. “In September we have to go to the IMF to ask for the biggest bailout in Pakistan’s history, of between $15bn to $18bn,” said Adnan Rasool of Georgia State University. “If you have a strong coalition you can push through policy measures that we need in order to secure that kind of bailout, which is to take away subsidies and reduce budget deficit and reduce the value of the currency – again.”But, he added, “this has been a selection process, not an election. It is embarrassing to watch.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/872bf1071b2a84694f535f83a4254bcddbbd7d74/765_238_2401_1441/master/2401.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca17fafeeab50bc81480ec54dcad1d47","title":"pope francis adviser decries matteo salvini policy on crucifix","story":"Antonio Spadaro says League leader and other politicians should keep their hands offA close adviser to Pope Francis has strongly condemned a proposal by Italy’s far-right League party to make it obligatory for crucifixes to be displayed in all public spaces, including ports, schools, embassies and prisons.The bill, introduced for debate in parliament earlier this week, would include fines of up to €1,000 (£890) for failing to comply.In a tweet that went viral on Wednesday, Reverend Antonio Spadaro, the editor of the Jesuit magazine La Civiltà Cattolica, wrote that the crucifix should never be used as a political symbol and said politicians should keep their hands off.“The cross is a sign of protest against sin, violence, injustice and death. It is NEVER a sign of identity. It screams of love to the enemy and unconditional welcome. It is an embrace from God without defences,” he said.The League has made similar attempts to ensure crucifixes are hung in public spaces in the past, but the latest is all the more pertinent given the drive by the party’s leader, Matteo Salvini, to close Italian ports to migrant rescue ships.The southern German state of Bavaria passed similar legislation in May in an attempt to reinforce “Bavarian identity” after an influx of migrants. The law, which made it mandatory for crucifixes to be displayed in the entrance of all public buildings, came into effect despite strong opposition from the Catholic church. The League has a strong following among devout Catholics, and Salvini – who is also Italy’s interior minister and deputy prime minister – often brandishes a rosary during public speeches.Italian priests, however, have been the strongest opponents of his vitriolic anti-immigration stance since his party took power in coalition with the populist Five Star Movement in early June. The leading Roman Catholic weekly, Famiglia Cristiana compared him to Satan on its front cover on Wednesday.“The bishops’ conference, inidual bishops, religious groups: the Church is reacting to the aggressive tone of the interior minister. Nothing personal or ideological, it is just the Gospel,” the publication said.Salvini hit back. “They are comparing me to Satan? I don’t deserve that,” he wrote on Facebook. “I am comforted by the fact that I receive daily support from many women and men of the Church.”Salvini, whose popularity has surged since general elections in early March, often exploits religion to galvanise support. During a speech in early July he swore on the gospel to be “loyal to his people” while pledging to create a European-wide alliance against mass immigration.“It’s ridiculous,” Gianfranco Formenton, a priest in Italy’s central Umbria region whom Salvini attacked in 2015 after he banned racists from his church, said. “He knows that by using the cross he gets consensus among voters. Spadaro said it perfectly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/876e1ea815e877a623be337ec1ee5dd2911e39a9/0_217_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1895c76a51b6380d693caf0b685376da","title":"us embassy blast beijing china","story":"Officials say suspect was only person injured in blast from ‘firecracker-like explosive’A man has detonated a small, low-grade bomb outside the US embassy in Beijing, according to US and Chinese authorities, injuring himself but no one else.The explosion occurred at the south-east corner of the embassy compound, a heavily fortified structure in the north-east of the Chinese capital, at about 1pm local time (6am BST).Chinese police said in a statement that the suspect was a 26-year-old man who hurt his hand while setting off a “firecracker-like explosive”.A US embassy spokesperson said: “According to the embassy’s regional security officer, there was one inidual who detonated a bomb. Other than the bomber, no other people were injured, and there was no damage to embassy property.”Chinese police identified the suspect only by his surname, Jiang, and said he was from Tongliao, a city in China’s Inner Mongolia region. Police said he had been detained and taken to hospital. They did not identify a motive.Videos and photos posted on social media earlier on Thursday showed smoke at a crossroads as groups of pedestrians gathered and police surrounded the area, which is home to several embassies. A Chinese police car near the embassy appeared to have been damaged. Witnesses reported hearing the blast.A witness who only gave his surname, Li, said he was cleaning the road outside the nearby Japanese embassy at the time of the incident. “I heard the sound of a big explosion and then women screaming,” he said. News of the blast spread quickly on Chinese social media, attracting nearly 1m views before search terms related to the incident were blocked. The bombing comes as China and the US are locked in a trade dispute. While Chinese officials and state media have been critical of the White House, there has been no groundswell of public anger towards the US.Within a few hours of the blast, police were ushering journalists away from the scene. Traffic was allowed to flow again and visa applicants were lining up outside the embassy.The state-run Global Times earlier reported that a woman spraying petrol on herself had been taken away from outside the US embassy on Thursday morning in what appeared to be a separate incident.

Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WirePreventing an “east-west border” between Northern Ireland and Britain is as non-negotiable for the UK in the Brexit talks as avoiding a “North-South” Border is for the EU, Britain’s chancellor of the exchequer has said. During a rare visit to the North, Mr Hammond said he did not agree with Tánaiste Simon Coveney’s view that the British government could not afford a “no deal Brexit”.“I think there is no doubt that Britain would be better off with a deal than without a deal. But I don’t think we are sliding to towards no deal,” he said. Mr Hammond said the recent British White Paper, which sought to reconcile how to avoid borders, was a “constructive move forward” and could be engaged with by both the British and EU.“I very much hope over next few months we are going to see rapid progress towards a shared vision of what the future relationship can look like and of course putting in place the Irish backstop arrangements which are a crucial part of the overall package.”Mr Hammond said he was sure that the long-running row over the possibility of a hard Border was not being “hyped up”. “One of the challenges we have had over the past few months is getting the EU to understand that no east-west border is as non-negotiable a part of this picture as no North-South border is for them,” he told reporters. “The no east-west border is equally non-negotiable from the point of view of British Conservatives and unionists. I certainly would not be prepared to sign up to any solution that involved an east-west border between Northern Ireland and GB.”As a Remainer during the EU referendum debate, he acknowledged there were tensions on Brexit within the Conservatives but did not think that it would lead to the implosion of the party. He said “no one disagrees with the direction of travel, that we are leaving the EU and seeking to get the best deal we can with the EU”. On the restoration of powersharing, he said that during an earlier meeting with financial services executives in Belfast he “sensed frustration and a concern that if the situation were to go on it would exact a toll on inward investment and confidence by foreign firms who are investing here”.He said US chief executives of firms based in the North also told him it was “very difficult to explain to their corporate leaders in the US what it means and how it works to be in a place that has no political governance”.“We have to go forward, we have to get back to the powersharing arrangements that have delivered such progress over past 20 years.”Mr Hammond’s visit to Belfast and Derry raised suspicions among some nationalists that an attempt was being made to deflect attention from the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, which took place in London on Wednesday. The DUP had described the conference as a “talking shop” and some suspected Mr Hammond’s arrival was a sop to the party, which is keeping Theresa May’s government afloat.The chancellor denied this was the case and said he was there to announce £12 million in funding for a Bombardier factory and also to talk to financial services executives and to meet academics at Ulster University in Derry. Mr Hammond said he had invited “a city deal” bid from Derry whereby the local council, university and businesses were given the chance to submit plans to the British government on their priorities for economic growth in the region. The British government already is investing more than £1.6 billion in city deals in Scotland and Wales and is in negotiations for a Belfast city deal."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3576502.1532550309!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach says he was not chancing his arm with 2020 election proposal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar said anyone who breaks the law ‘should be willing to do the time’ in jail. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has insisted his proposal for a general election to be held in the summer of 2020 was a “serious” one, and said he was not “chancing his arm” with the suggestion. Speaking in Venice, Italy, Mr Varadkar for the first time publicly confirmed he asked Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin to agree for the election to be held in summer 2020. The proposal was tabled at a meeting between the pair in Killarney, Co Kerry, last week to discuss the confidence and supply agreement.Mr Martin has since claimed Mr Varadkar only “threw out” the suggestion without “any serious discussion”, adding: “There’s a bit of chancing the arm going on there.”Mr Varadkar said his proposal still stood. “I wasn’t chancing my arm it was a serious proposal. And the proposal stands. We are going to meet again in September before the Dáil resumes, and I am sure we can take it up from there.“I suppose the question you are asking me is why 2020? Because I think the country needs political stability. We are heading into a period over the next couple of months where we are going to conclude the negotiations on Brexit. Then Brexit is going to happen for real. And then also there are external threats to our economy, which is going very well, but there are external threats, particularly around international trade and so on.”An agreed date in 2020 would be “in the interests of the country”, and would not be “taking advantage of opinion polls”. Fianna Fáil has claimed Mr Varadkar is attempting to provoke an election to capitalise on strong opinion poll ratings. Separately, Mr Varadkar said tax fraud and evasion were serious crimes, and anyone who breaks the law “should be willing to do the time” in jail. He was responding to one of his Ministers, Finian McGrath, lobbying for the release of a GP who is in jail for failing to pay €100,000 in tax. Mr Varadkar said he had not “yet” had a conversation with Mr McGrath about his lobbying, which was reported on Wednesday in The . The Taoiseach also effectively ruled out Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan granting Mr McGrath’s request to free Dr Bassam Naser, saying sentencing was “absolutely a matter for the courts and a matter for judges”. Mr McGrath, the Minister of State for Disability Issues who attends Cabinet, visited Naser in Loughan House open prison, Co Cavan, earlier this week, and said Mr Flanagan had the option to commute or remit any sentence imposed by a court.Naser, of Howth Road, Sutton, Dublin, pleaded guilty to two charges of delivering an incorrect return in connection with his income tax affairs. Mr Varadkar said there was “provision in the law for probation and for early release, and those things are possible, and of course the Minister is free to lobby on behalf of his constituent when it comes to that”. The Taoiseach was speaking as he visited the 2018 Venice Biennale, which has been curated this year by Irish architects Yvonne Farrell and Shelley McNamara of Grafton Architects. He will on Thursday meet Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte in Rome."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3576207.1532530527!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk should take reassurance and comfort from brexit preparations","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTheresa May: UK Prime Minister has said her government is being “responsible and sensible” in Brexit negotiations Photograph: Matt DunhamReutersThe UK public should take “reassurance and comfort” from its government’s preparations for a no-deal Brexit, Theresa May has said after ministers suggested food and medicines would be stockpiled in case of shortages.In an interview with 5 News on Wednesday, the Prime Minister did not deny stockpiling is happening, but said the government is being “responsible and sensible” while still trying to get a good deal with the European Union.It came after health secretary Matt Hancock told MPs on Tuesday he had asked officials to “work up options for stockpiling” by the pharmaceutical industry, and Brexit secretary Dominic Raab said the government would also take steps to ensure an “adequate food supply”.Mrs May said: “Far from being worried about preparations that we are making, I would say that people should take reassurance and comfort from the fact that the Government is saying we are in a negotiation, we are working for a good deal – I believe we can get a good deal – but . . . because we don’t know what the outcome is going to be . . . let’s prepare for every eventuality.“This is not just about stockpiling. That concept, what it is, is about making sure that we will be able to continue to do the things that are necessary once we have left the European Union, if we leave without a deal.”Mrs May’s comments came as a new poll suggests trust in her ability to handle Brexit is falling.A ICM poll found she had an eight-point lead over Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn over who could be trusted to negotiate a good Brexit deal, down from 16 points in January and 34 points before the 2017 general election.Chancellor Philip Hammond said it is “sensible and responsible” that the Government is working with industry to stockpile certain vital supplies for the event of a no-deal.Speaking during a visit to the Bombardier aircraft factory in Belfast on Wednesday, he said: “That’s a sensible and responsible thing for a Government to do and large businesses who are importing or exporting large volumes of products or produce will be making contingency plans, and we would encourage them to do so and work closely with them as they are putting those plans together.”Mr Hammond also ruled out extending the Article 50 process to give more time to negotiate withdrawal from the EU, after the Irish Government said it would back such a move.He said Parliament had legislated for the current exit date in March after suggestions an extension could help avoid the risk of a no-deal Brexit taking place.It came as talks continued in Brussels, with a meeting between EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier and Mr Raab scheduled for Thursday.Ms May confirmed on Tuesday that she had taken personal charge of the negotiations, with Mr Raab “deputising” for her in Brussels.Tory Eurosceptics have voiced concerns that Mr Raab’s department has been sidelined by Number 10 and Ms May’s Europe adviser Olly Robbins, amid increasing speculation that isions within the Conservative camp may result in no deal.Mr Coveney confirmed Dublin is making contingency plans to cope with Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal, but he told BBC Radio 4’s Today that Dublin would “absolutely” back an extension if Ms May’s Government asked for it.Speaking outside Parliament in London after the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, the Tánaiste said a no-deal Brexit is not in British or Irish best interests, but he remains confident a deal will be reached.He said: “We need to be focusing on the intensification of negotiations to try and find the solutions on a way forward as opposed to the sort of tough stance that some people feel the need to take in relation to saying ‘well do your worst, we can deal with a (no-deal) situation’. That isn’t going to solve this problem.” – Press Association"},{"url":null,"title":"summer sun britons make heatwave pictures","story":"As Britain continues to bake in heatwave conditions, a young man jumps in to the sea from a wall opposite Brighton pier.Sunseekers took to beaches and beauty spots across Britain at the weekend, as the fine and dry weather looks sent to continue for at least another week.Here we look at how people across Britain are making the most of the scorching temperatures while they can.UK blood moon: How to view the longest total lunar eclipse so far this century tomorrowBBC to pay £850,000 in costs to Sir Cliff Richard as privacy case bill tops £1 million after damagesUK weather: Britain bakes in heatwave nearing all-time record of 38.5C as pollution alerts issuedJapan executes final six members of doomsday cult behind rush hour sarin attack on Tokyo metroWembley turf recycled for grassroots football pitchesGreek authorities attacked for \u0026#39inability to protect citizens\u0026#39 as inquest begins into botched rescueNewsnight gaffe confuses Imran Khan with fellow Pakistan cricketer Wasim AkramPakistan Election 2018: Imran Khan on the brink of victory as rivals decry \u0026#39rigging\u0026#39Kelsey Grammer is reportedly in talks to reboot FrasierExam boards reveal \u0026#39huge amount\u0026#39 of time spent checking for cheating on social mediaMan held in Beijing after triggering \u0026#39explosion\u0026#39 outside US embassyBritain unprepared for heatwaves, warn MPs as Friday could be hottest day on record at 38.5CImran Khan has shown he can win the backing of Pakistan\u0026#39s military - now he needs to prove he is his own manWest Hampstead fire: Firefighters battle blaze in London block of flatsJapan’s ninja heartland flooded with job applications from round world after mix-upComment: Calls for \u0026#39orces on demand\u0026#39 are gathering pace, but is the country ready for them?How the last of Zimbabwe\u0026#39s whites are forging new roles in the post-Mugabe eraOn-the-spot fines for breaking new drone rules - and children could be banned from flying themComment: Britain cannot serve justice to returning jihadists until we tear up our human rights lawsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

Did Newsnight just use a clip of Wasim Akram to illustrate a story about Imran Khan? (Yes. They did.)At the end of the programme, presenter Evan Davis said: We made a mistake in our opening tonight. The footage we showed was of the cricketer Wasim Akram not Imran Khan.Don\u0027t know how that happened, sincere apologies for that.Later, a BBC spokesman said: We’d like to reiterate the sincere apology we made on air last night for an error that occurred during the programme.We are looking into how this mistake happened and will be tightening our processes on Newsnight to prevent an incident like this happening again.Both men are icons of Pakistan cricket. Prior to launching a political career that could see him become the country\u0027s new prime minister, Khan - who retired from the sport in 1992  - led Pakistan to victory at the 1992 Cricket World Cup, Pakistan\u0027s first and only victory in that competition.Host Evan Davis later apologised for the mix-upDuring his international career, he made 3,807 runs and took 362 wickets in Test cricket, and in 2010 was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.Akram, meanwhile, has remained in the sport since his retirement and spends much of his time commentating on the game.As a left-arm fast bowler, he was the first to reach the 500-wicket mark in One Day International cricket during the 2003 World Cup and also took more than 400 wickets for his country in Tests.Please review our commenting policyUK blood moon: How to view the longest total lunar eclipse so far this century tomorrowBBC to pay £850,000 in costs to Sir Cliff Richard as privacy case bill tops £1 million after damagesUK weather: Britain bakes in heatwave nearing all-time record of 38.5C as pollution alerts issuedJapan executes final six members of doomsday cult behind rush hour sarin attack on Tokyo metroWembley turf recycled for grassroots football pitchesGreek authorities attacked for \u0026#39inability to protect citizens\u0026#39 as inquest begins into botched rescuePakistan Election 2018: Imran Khan on the brink of victory as rivals decry \u0026#39rigging\u0026#39Kelsey Grammer is reportedly in talks to reboot FrasierExam boards reveal \u0026#39huge amount\u0026#39 of time spent checking for cheating on social mediaMan held in Beijing after triggering \u0026#39explosion\u0026#39 outside US embassyBritain unprepared for heatwaves, warn MPs as Friday could be hottest day on record at 38.5CImran Khan has shown he can win the backing of Pakistan\u0026#39s military - now he needs to prove he is his own manWest Hampstead fire: Firefighters battle blaze in London block of flatsComment: Calls for \u0026#39orces on demand\u0026#39 are gathering pace, but is the country ready for them?How the last of Zimbabwe\u0026#39s whites are forging new roles in the post-Mugabe eraJapan’s ninja heartland flooded with job applications from round world after mix-upOn-the-spot fines for breaking new drone rules - and children could be banned from flying themComment: Britain cannot serve justice to returning jihadists until we tear up our human rights lawsHeartbreak and heroics in Greece as wildfire survivors search for loved ones in the scorched rubbleWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/07/25/TELEMMGLPICT000170240075_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqMnyC4S5FxYt0W1P60ASQfhKi2sT3vi7ux2-RDZwC4QA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"scotland faces gold rush uks largest nugget discovered river","story":"Gold expert Leon Kirk examines the record breaking gold nugget found in a Scottish riverDumfries and GallowayThe largest gold nugget found in British waters for 500 years has been discovered by a man lying face down in a river in Scotland.The man, who wishes to remain anonymous, came across the 85.7g (2.75 Troy ounces) lump with a method called \u0027sniping\u0027, in which the prospector uses a snorkel to lie face down in the water and search the riverbed. Named the Douglas Nugget, it is expected to be worth at least £50,000.The discovery was made two years ago but its precise location remains a secret to avoid Scotland\u0027s biggest gold rush in years. Upon finding the nugget the man - in his 40s - ran from the water clutching his gold shouting “bingo”.Finally breaking his silence, he said: “I was following a crack in the bedrock and found around 2g in fine gold.“This then led to a pocket, where I uncovered the nugget. I called over my friend to have a look and we both assumed it to be around 5-7g in weight.“It wasn\u0027t until I removed it that we realised just how big it was.”He added: “I took off my glove and picked it up, jumped out of the water and screamed, \u0027Bingo!\u0027 to my friend.“We were both stunned and couldn\u0027t believe it. I\u0027ve never seen anything like it in my lifetime.”A crack in the bedrock of the river showed a fine line of gold and led to a large pocket containing the huge chunkThe man, who has been looking for gold as a hobby for 20 years, is unsure what to do with his find and is currently keeping it in a safety deposit box - but there is a danger the Crown Estate could claim the proceeds if it is sold.Under law, gold and silver are classed as Mines Royal, meaning that in most cases they belong to the Crown. Permission from The Crown Estate is required to take away any gold that is found, regardless of the method used to find it. It is not clear whether permission has been granted. Leon Kirk, from Gold Panning Supplies UK, and friend of the successful prospector, said that while they were concerned that giving away the location of the river could cause a huge gold rush, his friend was also keen to keep his find a secret to allow him to fully search the river. The technique used to find it is called sniping, where the treasure hunter lies face down in the water with a snorkel and goggles“It’s a bit of a secret society, gold panning, when you find a good river,” he said. “I know this guy has spent the last two years looking through the rest of the river where he found this huge nugget.“He’s found lots of other pieces of gold since so that’s probably why he’s kept it quiet - you wouldn’t want to give something like that away. “I think we’re both of the view as well that telling people where it was could ruin the river - but I don’t even know where he found it.”Although he does not know exactly where the gold was found, Mr Kirk recommended that people scour Wanlockhead in Dumfries, Galloway where gold nuggets have been discovered before. In 2015 a £10,000 nugget, which weighed approximately 18 grams, was found near Wanlockhead. Mr Kirk added: “This is a very exciting and unprecedented find.

Beijing police said the lone suspect, a 26-year-old man from China\u0027s Inner Mongolia region, had injured his hand and been taken to hospital. Police did not provide a motive. China and the United States have been involved in an escalating trade dispute initiated by Washington after the two sides imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of each other\u0027s goods, with President Donald Trump threatening ultimately to impose punitive tariffs on all Chinese imports.While Chinese officials and state media have been outspoken in their criticism of Washington\u0027s trade moves, there has not been a groundswell of outrage on China\u0027s heavily censored social media, and no reported boycotts of US goods.Witnesses told Reuters that they heard an explosion near the embassy and felt tremors.I\u0027d just arrived and started to queue and then heard a loud explosion about 100 metres away, said Li, a 19-year-old student. He said the blast happened shortly after 1pm as he queued for a visa.A police vehicle appeared to have been damaged, with its back windshield missing, and was cordoned off by police before being removed, a Reuters witness said. There was no damage to US embassy property, the embassy and normal operations were soon resumed.Crowds were still queueing outside the embassy after the explosion and traffic was moving as normal in an area of northeastern Beijing that is home to numerous embassies including those of France, India and Israel.Postings on social media showed pictures of smoke close to where people line up outside the compound for visa appointments. Some video clips and images were later removed.Reports suggested a police SUV vehicle had been damaged in the explosionLi Shaohui, a 58-year-old sanitation worker, said he felt the ground shake and that some people screamed.I thought first there was big a car crash, Li told Reuters, adding that the smoke had cleared quickly.Staff members at the Indian and South Korean embassies said they were unaware of any unusual incident and were working as normal.The state-run Global Times reported separately, citing a witness, that Chinese police took away a woman who sprayed herself with gasoline in a suspected self-immolation attempt outside the embassy at around 11 a.m. on Thursday.Beijing police did not immediately reply to a request for comment.Security in the Chinese capital is tight and protests are often quickly disbanded.

Fears were also growing of civil unrest as allegation of rigging spread.Monitors had been thrown out of polling stations as votes were tallied and results were unexpectedly delayed for hours.We will use all political and legal options for redressal of these glaring excesses, said Shahbaz Sharif, leader of the Pakistan Muslim League.This is an outright rigging and the results based on massive rigging will cause irreparable damage to the country.Supporters of Imran Khan, head of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), also known as Movement for Justice, hold signs while celebrating on a street in LahoreOn Wednesday night a top Pakistani election official said results from the election were coming in late because of technical issues, and there was no conspiracy in the delay.There\u0027s no conspiracy, nor any pressure in delay of the results, Babar Yaqoob, secretary of the Election Commission of Pakistan, told reporters.  The delay is being caused because the result transmission system has collapsed.On Thursday analysts were warning Pakistan may be facing further instability amid fears opposition parties would stoke unrest by contesting the results.This is complete chaos, said political analyst Azeema Cheema, who said she was very concerned about what comes next.Imran Khan has had to be very flexible indeed on his long climb to power in PakistanIt depends on how the civilian disobedience is being organised. You may have spontaneous riots among political party workers. Then maybe political parties will organise sit-ins and demonstrations, she told AFP.Michael Kugelman, an analyst at the Wilson Center in Washington, shared the concern: No matter how you slice it, the immediate post-election climate in Pakistan will be quite tense.I don\u0027t see any way to prevent a period of turmoil, he said.Polling day had already been marred by a deadly suicide bombing that killed 31.Carnage outside a polling station in the city of Quetta marred the vote. At least 31 voters and police died and several dozen were wounded when a suicide bomber tried to enter and detonated as he was stopped by police.The blast was claimed by Islamic State group. The attack came despite the largest polling day security operation the country has ever mounted, with more than 370,000 troops posted at 85,000 polling stations.There were also clashes between supporters of Mr Khan\u0027s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (Pakistan Justice Movement) and the Pakistan Muslim League (PML-N) of Nawaz Sharif.Twenty-two years since founding his party, Mr Khan appeared to have finally broken the stranglehold of the mainstream political elite as the country voted for only its second ever democratic transition of power.Mr Khan\u0027s populist message of a less corrupt, new Pakistan has captivated many young voters hungry for change.Yet the election campaign has been overshadowed by claims Pakistan\u0027s powerful military has tipped the playing field in his favour, in a vendetta against former prime minister Sharif.Shahbaz Sharif shows a document as he speaks during a press conference at his political office in LahoreThe PML-N has complained of a concerted campaign of harassment and media restrictions.Before voting, Pakistan\u0027s human rights commission had complained of “blatant, aggressive and unabashed attempts to manipulate the outcome of the upcoming elections”.The army denies meddling and says it supports democracy.A PTI supporter voting in Rawalpindi told the  a younger generation was demanding a change from the notoriously corrupt political elite.Raja Waheed Ahmed said: “The new generation wants change. The first thing is corruption and then education and healthcare.”But one young office worker, who would only give his name as Jawad, said he feared there had been widespread “pre-poll rigging”.He said: “Today on the day it\u0027s very difficult to do anything, but the way they are controlling the media and the judiciary the damage is already done.”The suicide bomber struck outside a crowded polling station in Pakistan\u0026#39s southwestern city of QuettaFarooq Ashgar, a PML-N activist said Sharif\u0027s party had achieved a good track record in its first term. Pakistan\u0027s notoriously patchy electricity supplies had improved, and militant attacks had dwindled. “He has brought peace to the country,” he told the .Following a bitter contest, police told the  they feared violence after polling day as well as during voting.Qasim Ali, a senior police superintendent with special branch in Peshawar, said: We beefed up the security at each and every polling station and around the cities on election day. Very strict security measures were in place and there were less chances of terror incidents, but the post election period is critical - there is a fear of violence during celebrations.A hung parliament could also deadlock the country\u0027s politics with coalition horse-trading and weaken the mandate of any new prime minister. The country is facing a severe debt crisis and is expected to seek an International Monetary Fund bailout in the autumn.Three main parties lead the way, but in reality it has come down to a two-horse race.The Pakistan Muslim League (PML-N) has governed since 2013, led by Nawaz Sharif. In a spectacular fall from power, he is now languishing in jail in Rawalpindi with his daughter Maryam, after the pair were convicted by an anti-corruption court.His younger brother, Shahbaz, now runs the centre right party, which operates from a formidable powerbase in Punjab.Pakistan launched an unprecedented security operation ahead of Wednesday\u0026#39s electionThe PML-N\u0027s main challenger is Imran Khan\u0027s center-right Pakistan Tehrik-e-Insaf (PTI) party which has surged in popularity on an anti-corruption platform. The former cricketer has spent more than 20 years trying to break the stranglehold of the political elite and appears to be at his closest ever to power.Leading the third main party, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, 29, is the son of the slain former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. His Pakistan People\u0027s Party\u0027s political strength lies in southern Sindh province. His party has failed to gain traction in the campaign but could potentially become a king maker in coalition negotiations if the PML-N or PTI cannot win an outright majority.Large numbers of other parties and independents are standing, but are not expected to win many seats.Corruption and the tense relations between civilian government and the powerful security state have dominated the election campaign.Imran Khan\u0027s vows to clean up Pakistan\u0027s corrupt politics have chimed with younger voters hungry for change. At the same time Nawaz Sharif has been convicted and jailed for failing to disclose how he bought opulent flats on London\u0027s Park Lane.Yet Mr Khan\u0027s rise at the expense of the PML-N is seen as due to military pressure to sabotage Nawaz Sharif\u0027s campaign. Sharif and the military have butted heads over relations with India and Pakistan\u0027s use of militant proxies and the generals have retaliated with a concerted campaign of “pre-poll rigging”.Sharif\u0027s allies have been pressured to switch sides, independent media have been muzzled and high-level party members have faced politically-motivated legal investigations, the PML-N allegesImran Khan arrives at a polling station during the general election in IslamabadThe winner has an unenviable to do list. Pakistan\u0027s economy is on the verge of a debt crisis, and will need an IMF bailout within months. The country is short of water and has a rapidly growing population. America has withdrawn security aid and accused it of lies and deceit.Pakistan has suffered terribly from militant violence in the past 15 years, struggling with a host of extremist groups ranging from its home grown Taliban to a new local branch of the Islamic State group.Military offensives in the border regions with Afghanistan in 2015 and 2017 caused numbers of attacks inside the country to plummet but militant groups remain a threat.Before polling day, the campaign had been marred by several attacks on rallies and candidates, including one of the nation\u0027s worst ever terrorist atrocities. An Islamic State suicide bomber killed 148 at a rally in Baluchistan province earlier this month. Pakistan\u0027s military has deployed more than 370,000 troops to secure the vote.UK blood moon: How to view the longest total lunar eclipse so far this century tomorrowBBC to pay £850,000 in costs to Sir Cliff Richard as privacy case bill tops £1 million after damagesUK weather: Britain bakes in heatwave nearing all-time record of 38.5C as pollution alerts issuedJapan executes final six members of doomsday cult behind rush hour sarin attack on Tokyo metroWembley turf recycled for grassroots football pitchesGreek authorities attacked for \u0026#39inability to protect citizens\u0026#39 as inquest begins into botched rescueNewsnight gaffe confuses Imran Khan with fellow Pakistan cricketer Wasim AkramKelsey Grammer is reportedly in talks to reboot FrasierExam boards reveal \u0026#39huge amount\u0026#39 of time spent checking for cheating on social mediaMan held in Beijing after triggering \u0026#39explosion\u0026#39 outside US embassyBritain unprepared for heatwaves, warn MPs as Friday could be hottest day on record at 38.5CImran Khan has shown he can win the backing of Pakistan\u0026#39s military - now he needs to prove he is his own manWest Hampstead fire: Firefighters battle blaze in London block of flatsComment: Calls for \u0026#39orces on demand\u0026#39 are gathering pace, but is the country ready for them?How the last of Zimbabwe\u0026#39s whites are forging new roles in the post-Mugabe eraJapan’s ninja heartland flooded with job applications from round world after mix-upOn-the-spot fines for breaking new drone rules - and children could be banned from flying themComment: Britain cannot serve justice to returning jihadists until we tear up our human rights lawsHeartbreak and heroics in Greece as wildfire survivors search for loved ones in the scorched rubbleWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"sweltering schoolsto melting roads mps reveal britain not prepared","story":"Henry Bodkin will be answering reader questions in the comment section about how Britain is managing the heatwave, live at 1pm.

Log inFigures from Nielsen released this week pointed to the strongest UK grocery sales in five years thanks to the heatwave.Separate data from the Kantar Worldpanel also showed supermarket sales spiking over the 12 weeks to the 15 July, with credit given to “the prolonged hot weather”.Yet official data from the Office for National Statistics showed an unexpected fall in retail sales volumes in June, with the agency saying that “consumers stayed away from stores and instead enjoyed the World Cup and the heatwave”.So is the heatwave likely to boost retail sales, or not?And will it have any positive effect on the wider economy?For the obvious reasons.People buy things they need to cope with or enjoy the hot weather. Kantar says that Britons stocked up on items such as barbecue firelighters, alcohol and sun cream.Domestic tourism can\u0026nbspalso get a\u0026nbspboost.There’s also the feel good factor. If people are happier because of the hot weather the theory is that consumer confidence will be higher and they will spend more in the shops.But economists stress that the economic impact can be ambiguous.“It is a bit of a double edged sword,” says Howard Archer of the EY Item Club.“Pubs are taking spend share off restaurants and food spend is also a rotation of spending patterns rather than volume increase.”Mr French is also sceptical of the consumer confidence boost channel.\u0026nbspOther economists point out that hot temperatures can adversely affect workers’ productivity levels.According to the ONS, roughly £400bn\u0026nbspwas spent on retail sales, including fuel, in 2017.Total GDP last year was around £2 trillion, meaning retail sales account for roughly a fifth of the economy.So a decent performance from retail sales in a quarter can deliver a significant boost to overall growth. Indeed, despite the slippage in June, the ONS estimates that over the second quarter retail sales were still up 2.1 per cent.That alone should deliver 0.4 percentage points to second quarter GDP growth.That’s very useful after growth slumped to just 0.2 per cent in the first quarter.The UK had a very hot summer in 2003. And GDP grew rapidly in the second half of the year.However there was a marked growth slowdown in 2004, which signals that any household consumption boost was merely expenditure brought forward rather than being additional.The last comparable UK heatwave to the current one was in the summer of 1976.GDP did grow extremely quickly in the second half of that year, rising by 1.2 per cent in the third quarter and 2.1 per cent in the final quarter.You can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/03/27/09/exams.jpg","title":"unconditional offers universities ucas a level grades teenagers school leavers","story":"Created with Sketch.\u0027Giving out unconditional offers just to put bums on seats undermines the credibility of the university system\u0027Click to followThe Independent OnlineUniversities have increased the number of unconditional offers made to school-leavers by nearly a third, prompting fears that institutions are sacrificing standards in a bid to attract students and bring in cash.Almost a quarter of 18-year-olds have been handed at least one guaranteed place on a degree course regardless of the A-level grades they have secured this summer, new Ucas data shows.The rise has prompted calls for the admissions system to be overhauled, as critics say they risk distracting students during their final year at school\u0026nbspwhile putting them under pressure to make quick decisions.Sam Gyimah, universities minister, branded the rise irresponsible and said institutions that hand out unconditional offers to just put bums on seats undermine\u0026nbspthe credibility of the university system.The Ucas\u0026nbspdata reveals\u0026nbspthat 67,915 unconditional offers have been made to 18-year-olds in England, Wales and Northern Ireland this year, up from 51,615 in 2017 – a rise of 32 per cent.Overall, 23 per cent of 18-year-old university applicants – some 58,385 in total – from England, Wales and Northern Ireland, have received at least one unconditional offer this year.This is up from just 1.1 per cent – 2,570 applicants – in 2013, and a 29 per cent rise compared to last year.In total, 7.1 per cent of all offers made to students this year were unconditional, the data shows.Unconditional offers have traditionally been made in certain circumstances, such as to mature students who already have the qualifications needed for their university place or for those applying for creative arts courses who may have submitted portfolios or auditioned for places.But there are signs that these offers are being used by universities competing to recruit students\u0026nbspwho have to pay up to £9,250 a year in tuition fees.\u0026nbspThere is no cap on the number of students a university can admit and, at the same time, the UK\u0027s 18-year-old population is falling.Mr Gyimah\u0026nbspadded: “The rise in unconditional offers is completely irresponsible to students and universities must start taking a lead, by limiting the number they offer.“Places at universities should only be offered to those who will benefit from them, and giving out unconditional offers just to put ‘bums on seats’ undermines the credibility of the university system.“Along with the Office for Students, I am closely monitoring the number being issued and fully expect the regulator to take appropriate action.“Unconditional offers risk distracting students from the final year of their schooling, and swaying their decisions does them a disservice – universities must act in the interest of students, not in filling spaces.”Helen Thorne, Ucas\u0027 director of external relations, said: “Students should take the time to carefully think about all their options fully before accepting an unconditional offer. Information and advice on the Ucas website highlights the key points students need to think about before accepting any offer.“While unconditional offers are made for a number of reasons, we believe that universities should always emphasise to students the importance of completing their studies to the best of their abilities.“This will help make sure they’re well prepared for their degree course, and for future employment.”UK news in picturesLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn during his visit to HS2 trains bidder Bombardier in Derby, following the launch of the party\u0027s new Build it in Britain campaignGreat Britain\u0027s Geraint Thomas cleans his eyes after tear gas was thrown at the pelaton during a farmers\u0027 protest who attempted to block the stage\u0027s route, during the 16th stage of the Tour de France, between Carcassonne and Bagneres-de-Luchon.

So she started oneClick to followThe Independent OnlineAtes is also the author of 2009 book ‘Islam Needs a Sexual Revolution’, and has required police protection ever sinceSeyran Ates recalls the searing pain of a bullet tearing through her neck. She remembers wavering on the brink of death and telling God that she had to rejoin the living.A 21-year-old law student at the time, working at a women’s centre in West Berlin, she was nowhere near finished with the world.“\u0027I want to go back,’ I told God,” Ates, now a 55-year-old lawyer and women’s rights activist who is also studying to become an imam, recalled of that afternoon. “I still have a mission.”More than three decades later, that mission came to fruition a year ago when she stood before a congregation of Muslim men and women kneeling side by side as they recited prayers in the Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque – the first Muslim house of worship in Germany where women, many with dark ponytails and long curls uncovered, are recognised as imams.Any Muslim is welcome to join: men or women, Sunni or Shia, transgender, gay or straight.“We want to send a signal to political Islam,” Ates, wearing a long, white tunic trimmed with gold, told a packed room on the opening day, when journalists outnumbered worshippers.“We want to show that another Islam exists, that has nothing to do with terrorism.”Over the past year, that something has grown into a congregation of 35 core members – many of them women. They help Ates organise weekly prayers, give tours to school groups and hold seminars on democracy, love and the concept of an open, tolerant interpretation of Islam and a forgiving God.Religious groups join together for interfaith collaborationHere\u0027s a reminder of what Donald Trump said about Muslims in the past When is Eid al-Fitr and how do Muslim people celebrate it?During Eid, it\u0027s important to reflect on Islam in BritainThree years after a wave of more than 1 million, mostly Muslim, migrants arrived in Germany seeking asylum, culture wars over religious identity and the possible threat posed by Islam have led to a rise in nationalist, populist movements.The government of Chancellor Angela Merkel was nearly brought down this week over a dispute with the Bavarian sister of her conservative party, which sought to turn back refugees at the border.The Bavarian conservatives of the Christian Social Union joined the far-right party Alternative for Germany in promoting a narrative that refugees pose a threat, after several highly publicised killings and sexual assaults in the country led to charges against Muslim migrants.The party ordered that crosses be displayed in all public buildings in the state, and Merkel’s new interior minister, Horst Seehofer – also a Bavarian – declared: “Islam is not a part of Germany.”Against the backdrop of these debates, Ates sees the survival of the Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque, which recently celebrated its first anniversary, as proof that Muslims living in Germany need and are open to an interpretation of Islam that reflects the values of the Western society in which they live.Tombs in the centre of Tarung village serve as handy laundry driers on a sunny Sumba morning.Each tomb in Waihola village (near Nihiwatu) represents massive expense in terms of ritual sacrifices for local families who observe the ancestral Marapu religionCatholic imagery on a tomb in Waihola village (near Nihiwatu) shows how imported religions seem often to have blended almost seamlessly with the ancient Marapu religion.In an effort to minimise economic strain the law stipulates that only 5 buffalo can be sacrificed at funerals - in reality many more are often killed and a big buffalo with a wide horn spread will often fetch close to $4,000.A royal tomb in Pasunga village is flanked by the smaller tombs where servants were buried (sometimes buried alive!) alongside their master.Village dogs - currently s but, more than likely, part of some future feast - on tombs in Pasunga village.A horse - another part of Sumba\u0027s ancestral warrior heritage - grazes among the tombs in Pasunga village.A more humble modern style tomb stands next to the kings burial place in Galu Bakul, Anakalang.A village dog relaxes on a tomb in Prai Ijing village.While still considered sacred the tombs very quickly become part of normal village life.

The Arabs will never allow it,\u0027” she said. Instead, hundreds of people from across Germany, Europe and abroad have visited or attended services.Those most committed to its survival have made donations, some as much as €500, Ates said, emphasising that the mosque receives no public funding.“Even atheists come here and appreciate this place, as a spiritual place, a place of peace,” she said recently, standing barefoot on the pale carpet of the mosque. “I had hoped, but never dreamed, that so many atheists would be interested. That was a positive surprise.”The criticism and rejection, in its fierceness and intensity, less so. Even before the mosque opened, her personal Facebook page and that of the mosque were flooded with derogatory messages and even some death threats.“May Allah put you on the right path, or destroy you,” someone writing under the name Xalo Bero said, in one of the friendlier remarks.Protection provided by the police and paid for by the city government, in place since she published the book Islam Needs a Sexual Revolution\u0026nbspin 2009, was increased to a personal security detail after the heightened threats on her life.Days after the mosque opened, Dar al-Ifta, an influential arm of the Egyptian Justice Ministry that issues religious verdicts, denounced the mosque and declared that allowing men and women to pray alongside one another violated Islamic law.Turkish news outlets reported that the mosque was a terrorist organisation with links to the Islamist cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkey blames for a coup attempt in 2016 against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Despite a video message in which Ates states that the “the Rushd-Goethe mosque has nothing to do with the Gulen movement”, the rumours have persisted.She blames them for the fact that few Turks have joined the congregants, although they make up the vast majority of the estimated 4.5 million Muslims living in Germany.Despite the demands of running the mosque, she takes Arabic classes and continues to work as a lawyer. She considers achieving a degree in Islamic theology important to her recognition in the Muslim community.“I want to understand the words and know the meanings so no one can say, ‘She’s just a lawyer,\u0027” she said.Born in Istanbul to a Turkish mother and a Kurdish father, she emigrated with her parents to what was then West Berlin in the late 1960s, part of the first large wave of Muslim immigrants who came to fill the blue-collar jobs needed to rebuild the German economy after World War II.Ates was 6 when she and her four siblings moved into a one-room apartment with their parents.As she learned German and excelled in school, Ates says, she came to understand that it was not the crowded living conditions that she found suffocating, but the realisation that because of her gender, she was not afforded the freedoms of her non-Muslim peers.“I was a girl,” she wrote in 2007 in Zeit Online. “I embodied the family’s honour, and my hymen – for a long time I didn’t even know what that was – was more important to the whole family than my brain.”At 17, she fled her home, graduated from high school and started studying law at the Free University of Berlin. To support herself, she worked as a counsellor in a women’s centre.In September 1984, she was speaking with a client when a man wearing a trench coat entered the centre, pulled out a pistol and fired three shots. One hit the client in the stomach, killing her the other struck Ates.She survived to see the suspect, a Turkish bricklayer, acquitted for lack of evidence, which enraged her. For years, she struggled with the psychological fallout of the attack.Violent clashes leave ’86 dead’ in NigeriaFrench far-right group arrested over alleged plot to attack MuslimsShe returned to her faith, but was again alienated by Berlin’s traditional, conservative mosques, where women were forced to pray behind a curtain.

It’s\u0026nbspterrifying and exhilarating, simultaneously desirable and absolutely the last place you would want to be.Then there’s the drop. The wind hits your face, your stomach feels as if it’s leaping through your body, your cheeks are pushed back into a laugh – or a scream – your whole being is lifted, and despite the rigorous health and safety restraints, for a moment it feels like you’re flying. Then you hit the track again and your whole body is pumping along with your heart and you breathe and laugh – and want to go again. Or not. I can’t understand how some people hate rollercoasters\u0026nbsp– they are one of my favourite things in the entire world.Theme parks around the worldMeet famous characters and get your autograph book signedLego statues of all sizes - from miniland to life size modelsFerrari Land in Port Aventura, Spain, is famous for its fast rollercoastersOakwood is the only theme park in Wales and is home to Megafobia, voted the best ride in the UK and third best ride in the world by the Roller Coaster Club of Great Britain.

You can bet that any resort you visit will be filled with varied and never ending things to discover.Whether it’s the thrill-inducing rides, the milder water rides, the inventive “worlds” or the over-priced but delicious doughnut and ice-cream combos that draw you in, it’s hard to deny that theme parks offer something for everyone. They are often marketed as family attractions, something for the kids, but they are places that can captivate and entertain at any age.I don’t feel like I enjoy theme parks any less now that I’m an (admittedly childish) adult – if anything, I enjoy them more. My mood is not as volatile (kids have the tendency to be excited one moment and in a strop the next), I don’t tire at the end of the day and I can appreciate things I didn’t as a kid – the engineering that’s gone into creating a place (not that I know anything about engineering), the small details, the truly fine art and craftsmanship.And as far as I’m concerned theme parks are a work of art. As Bill Watterson, creator of the cartoon strip Calvin and Hobbes, believed, I couldn’t agree more that there is no such thing as high art and low art – rather creations that either speak to people or don’t. And what could speak to people more than a place created for the sole purpose of having fun?Kingda\u0026nbspKa, New Jersey, is the world’s tallest rollercoaster at 456ft – higher than Big BenAfter all, when most of us spend the majority of our weeks working, worrying about finances, trying to stay on top of life admin and suffering from increasingly poor mental health, there is nothing more precious than escapism. Our cities, towns and villages revolve around practicality – offices for working in, shops for buying things, gyms for exercising. Most of what surrounds us is mundane – it’s pretty wonderful in this context that we have places created for the sole purpose of having fun.But while some of the elements of enjoyment are\u0026nbspeasy to recognise as such – good food, fun family rides and the opportunity to take a picture with a lifesize Donald Duck – what is it that is so enticing about rollercoasters? By definition they should evoke sheer terror, yet we absolutely adore them\u0026nbspand queue for hours on end for the two-minute scare they provide.Richard Stephens, a senior lecturer in psychology at Keele University, argues that rollercoasters invoke a good kind of stress, called “eustress” – a word that has the same route as “euphoria”. This kind of stress is not bad for you – rather it is pleasurable and many of us actively seek it out.Eustress can also explain why we like being scared in other contexts, such as on ghost trains or in live action horror mazes. It makes sense that we must all have different ways of seeking this kind of good stress – which is why some people love rollercoasters and some people can’t stand them. I’m a big fan of rollercoasters but the thought of scuba ing absolutely terrifies me. But for others I imagine this is a “eustressful” experience.For the ultimate thrillseeker, the fastest rollercoaster in the world is currently the Formula Rossa at Ferrari World in Abu Dhabi, which reaches an eye-watering 150mph. The second fastest, Kingda Ka at Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey, is also the world’s tallest,\u0026nbspat 456ft. To put that into some perspective, Big Ben in London stands shorter at 320ft.But Kingda Ka will not hold its title for long, as a new coaster, Skyscraper, is set to open in Florida in 2020 and will reach 500ft, plus have the steepest drop of any rollercoaster in the world.And lastly the longest rollercoaster, the Steel Dragon 2000, at Nagashima Spa Land in Japan is a whopping 8,133ft. It is the only existing rollercoaster to break the 8,000ft threshold, and it lasts for a whole four minutes.With rides becoming increasingly complex and impressive, it’s fascinating to see where things all started. The first commercial rollercoaster in the world, Switchback Railway, opened in 1884 in Coney Island, New York. It kickstarted the growth of attractions in the US, and before long Coney Island housed a few similar rides. The oldest acknowledged theme park was also located in the US:\u0026nbspSanta Claus Land opened in Indiana in 1935, and included many rides themed around the big\u0026nbspman in red.If you’d like a taste of an ancient theme park,\u0026nbspthe oldest\u0026nbspstill in operation can be found in Klampenborg, Denmark. Bakken opened in 1583 and has more than 150 attractions, including a wooden rollercoaster built in 1932. Denmark is also the home of Lego, and the original Legoland Park – so a heaven for theme park fans.In the UK we’ve also been breathing life into old theme parks, such as\u0026nbspDreamland\u0026nbspin Margate. First opened in 1880 and popular all the way through to the\u0026nbsp1990s, it was closed in 2003 and set to become a residential area. But after local residents campaigned to restore and open Dreamland instead, it was brought back and soon had a £25m\u0026nbsprevamp.It now has a concert venue, seaside pub and rooftop rum shack, and new rides are being introduced to sit alongside the restored vintage ones. According to its Wikipedia page, it’s intended to be a “working museum of vintage funfair rides”. And it’s changing the fortunes of the surrounding small seaside town in Kent.Another intriguing destination is an unexpected one. Nestled deep in the Italian woods, Ai Pioppi boasts a colourful range of rides – none of which are powered by electricity. Instead, riders push, pedal and swing – but we’re not talking playground-style attractions here\u0026nbspwe’re talking full-on Ferris wheels and rollercoasters. But perhaps even more impressive than the park’s eco-credentials is its founder, Bruno Ferrin, who has been building the park himself since the late 1960s. He started by adding a few slides to accompany his restaurant – and it grew from there.Around the world there are a whole host of niche theme parks – those interested can visit Hello Kitty’s castle in Japan, unearth mud at Diggerland\u0026nbspin various locations across the UK and US and view a host of farting and vomiting statues\u0026nbspat BonBon-Land in Zealand, Denmark.Of course, obscurities aside, you’re still guaranteed to have fun at your local attraction. And increasingly we’re seeing theme park culture enter\u0026nbspour day-to-day – less traditional workplaces are starting to install slides and ball pits and Penn State station in New York is considering adding a rollercoaster alongside it’s shops and subway platforms.It would do us all some good to get out the office and have some fun for the sake of fun –\u0026nbspor even better\u0026nbspwe could incorporate theme park rides and attractions into our daily lives.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The prize aims to recognise artistic achievement across a range of genres. Albums by British and Irish artists with a UK release date between 22 July 2017 and 20 July 2018 were eligible for this year’s prize.\u0026nbspLast year’s Mercury Prize was awarded to Sampha for his album Process, while Skepta picked up the award for his record Konnichiwa in 2016.\u0026nbspThe 2018 Hyandai Mercury Prize shortlist in full:Sheffield rock band Arctic Monkeys scored their fourth Mercury Prize nomination for the isive concept album Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino, which was released in May this year. The band won the Mercury Prize in 2006 for their debut album Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not.\u0026nbspTranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino was written by frontman Alex Turner on a Steinway Vertegrand piano at his home in LA, and incorporates elements of lounge pop, glam rock and psychedelia, signalling a major departure from its predecessor, the guitar-heavy AM.\u0026nbspThe Independent gave it four out of five stars upon its release, praising it for its bold leap to a new sound and for Turner’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics, which narrated characters living at the titular hotel.\u0026nbspFlorence \u0026amp The Machine were shortlisted for their fourth studio album High As Hope, which featured the single “Hunger” where singer Florence Welch featured some of her most personal lyrics to date. This is the third time the band have been shortlisted for the Mercury Prize.\u0026nbspNoel Gallagher’s band High Flying Birds made it onto the shortlist for their album Who Built The Moon? Gallagher has been shortlisted two times before with his former band, Oasis.\u0026nbspRapper Novelist made it onto the list for the first time with his self-produced debut album Novelist Guy, which has influences as wide-ranging as the Pet Shop Boys and the soundtrack for 80s TV show Beverly Hills Cop, and\u0026nbspfeatures astute social commentary about youth culture in the UK.\u0026nbspNovelist and singer Jorja Smith are the youngest artists on this year’s shortlist, both aged 21: Smith was shortlisted for her debut album Lost \u0026amp Found, released in June this year. She was consistently named through 2017 as one of the UK’s most promising new artists and was featured twice on Drake’s album More Life, supporting him in the UK and Canada. She won the Brit Critics’ Choice Award in January this year.\u0026nbspArguably one of the more surprising appearances is Lily Allen earning her first ever Mercury Prize nod for her anticipated fourth studio album No Shame, which The Independent hailed as a “return to form” following the lukewarm reception to her previous record Sheezus.\u0026nbsp“She’s managed to move with the times but still hold onto a sound that defines her as an artist, rather than attempting to emulate anyone else… that freshness is enabled by the fact that she still, after all this time, has the finger on the pulse of modern music,” The Independent review said.\u0026nbspKing Krule (singer-songwriter Archy Marshall) received his first Mercury Prize nomination for third album The Ooz, which made The Independent’s Albums of the Year 2017 list. Nadine Shah was another newcomer on the Mercury Prize shortlist, for her record Holiday Destination.\u0026nbspBritish jazz group Sons of Kemet – formed of Shabaka Hutchings, Seb Rochford, Tom Skinner and Theon Cross - received a nod for their album Your Queen Is A Reptile. The album and sleeve notes reference how the British monarchy does not represent black immigrants, while the track titles all pay tribute to influential black women throughout history.Music industry experts predict this year\u0027s Mercury Prize shortlistMy day with Amy Winehouse: Never-before-seen photos of the late singerAlbum reviews: Gaika, Daughtry, Israel Nash and moreMeanwhile, XL founder and producer Richard Russell made it onto the list with an album titled after his project Everything Is Recorded, which includes collaborations with Kamasi Washington and last year’s Mercury Prize winner Sampha.\u0026nbspAlternative rock band Wolf Alice were shortlisted for their second album Visions of a Life, marking the second time in a row they have been nominated for the Mercury Prize, after their debut My Love Is Cool received a nod in 2015.

There had been some signs of liquid water currently on Mars, including disputed evidence of water activity on Martian slopes, but not stable bodies of water.The discovery was found by scientists using the\u0026nbspMars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding (Marsis) instrument on the Mars Express spacecraft. That instruments sends out radar pulses that penetrate the surface and ice caps on Mars, and measures the radio waves when they come back to the spacecraft.Scientists led by\u0026nbspRoberto Orosei\u0026nbspexamined that data between\u0026nbspMay 2012 and December 2015 and found that there was a very sharp change in the radar signals, when looking at the area, which was found 1.5km beneath the surface.The researchers spent two years ensuring that the data wasn’t the result of some other effect – eventually ruling out every possible explanation apart from liquid water of some kind.“It’s tempting to think that this is the first candidate place where life could persist\u0026nbspon Mars,” said Orosei.The data is similar to that seen when radars look at\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbsplakes of liquid water found beneath the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets on Earth. Scientists have suggested that microbial life could live in those extreme conditions – as it might on Mars.“This kind of environment is not exactly your ideal vacation, or a place where fish would swim,” Orosei added. “But there are terrestrial organisms that can survive and thrive, in fact, in similar environments. There are microorganisms on Earth that are capable of surviving even in ice.”Scott Hubbard, a professor of astronautics at Stanford University who served as Nasa’s first Mars program director in 2000, called it “tremendously exciting”.\u0026nbsp“Our mantra back then was ‘follow the water’.\u0026nbspThat was the one phrase that captured everything,” Hubbard said. “So this discovery, if it stands, is just thrilling because it’s the culmination of that philosophy.”\u0026nbspIt is even colder on Mars than it is in the Antarctic and Greenland, making the discovery of liquid water even more surprising.The water itself is likely to be a briny sludge. The\u0026nbspsalt that makes that brine is also probably the reason there is liquid water at all, since it helps melt the otherwise icy water in the same way grit is used to remove snow from streets.“This is a stunning result that suggests water on Mars is not a temporary trickle like previous discoveries but a persistent body of water that provides the conditions for life for extended periods of time,” said\u0026nbspAlan Duffy, an astronomer from Swinburne University and the lead scientist of Australia’s Science Channel.There is nothing particularly special about the area where the water was found – it is simply the region on Mars where the radar that made the detection is most sensitive. That means that there could be similar deposits under the ground all the way across Mars.It remains to be seen if more subsurface reservoirs of water will be found or whether the newly discovered one is some sort of quirk, Orosei said.If others are detected and a network of subglacial lakes exists like on Earth, he said, that could indicate liquid water has persisted for millions of years or even dating back to 3.5 billion years ago when Mars was a more hospitable planet.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Michel Barnier does not represent only the Commission. He is the negotiator for the European Union,” she said.“He gets his mandate and his guidelines from the heads of state and government. And we have discussed it regularly at the level of ministers. We meet with Michel Barnier on a regular basis.\u0026nbsp“So do the heads of state and government.

Prime Minister Imran Khan, although his party has officially held off on declaring victory.That may come in a speech Mr Khan is due to deliver at\u0026nbsp4pm this afternoon (local time), set to be broadcast live.And while the official results are still trickling in, PTI\u0026nbspsupporters are not waiting to celebrate what they see as Mr Khan\u0027s victory.\u0026nbspThroughout the night, Khan supporters celebrated outside party offices countrywide.Dawn, Pakistan\u0027s leading independent newspaper, declared that PTI appeared to be sweeping the board across the country and that we are on the brink of a new Pakistan. PML-N\u0027s performance, according to polticial commentator\u0026nbspAsha’ar Rehman, gave the impression\u0026nbspof a party which was faced with its toughest hour and which was on the verge of collapse.Supporters of the jailed prime minister Sharif seized on the delays in the\u0026nbspcounting process, calling it an assault on democracy in a country that has a history of military rule.Khan leads as bloodshed and \u0027foul play\u0027 taint historic Pakistan voteThe World Cup-winning cricket captain hoping to become Pakistan\u0027s PMMajor party accuses authorities of \u0027deliberate\u0027 voter suppressionHere\u0027s what we can expect of Pakistan\u0027s likely new leader, Imran KhanPakistan prepares for elections amid concerns over bulk voting Election officials said the demand of counting the ballots of up to 105m registered voters had caused the electronic system to break down, meaning they were now being counted by hand.There\u0027s no conspiracy, nor any pressure in delay of the results. The delay is being caused because the result transmission system has collapsed, said Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) secretary Babar Yaqoob.But\u0026nbspearly on Thursday, Mr Sharif\u0027s brother Shehbaz, who now leads the PML-N, rejected the results amid further complaints that soldiers stationed in polling stations had thrown out poll monitors from political parties during the counting.It is a sheer rigging. The way the people\u0027s mandate has blatantly been insulted, it is intolerable, Shehbaz told a news conference as the counting continued.We totally reject this result, he said. It is a big shock to Pakistan\u0027s democratic process.The Pakistan People\u0027s Party (PPP),\u0026nbspled by the son of assassinated two-time prime minister Benazir Bhutto, was ahead in\u0026nbsp42 constituencies and, as expected, appears to have secured third place.A progressive party compared to the conservatism of both the PML-N and PTI, they have vowed not to enter coalition with either of the main frontrunners - once a major party, analysts said they would be best placed to rebuild for 2023.The PPP also denounced the validity of PTI\u0027s imminent victory, saying\u0026nbspits polling agents were asked to leave during the vote count in a number of voting centres.This is the warning bell of a serious threat, said PPP senator Sherry Rehman. This whole election could be null and void, and we don\u0027t want this.If he does indeed become Prime Minister, it will be because Mr Khan was able to both secure the support of establishment institutions and also a broad spectrum of followers with sometimes troubling populist messaging.\u0026nbspThe 65-year-old has courted the more extreme wings of Pakistan’s religious spectrum by touting the death penalty for blasphemers and vowing to implement an “Islamic welfare state” if he comes to power.Yasir Yusuf, a 33-year-old chef from the capital’s small and downtrodden Christian minority, cast his vote just before polls shut at 6pm on Wednesday evening.He told The Independent he had decided to vote for PTI despite concerns about Mr Khan’s perceived tolerance for extremist Islamist parties.“We are concerned, but when you are a minority you become meaner we just think for ourselves,” he said.“We are too little and this country is too big. I really want to vote for my country, not only for this small minority.”​Asim Majeed, a 24-year-old MBA student, complained of “how slow the people are in there” as he emerged from casting his vote for PTI in Islamabad. He said he believed Mr Khan was different from other leaders.\u0026nbspA profile on his PTI party\u0027s website says Mr Khan was a quiet and shy boy in his youth and attended the Royal Grammar School, Worcester, before completing his formal schooling with an undergraduate degree in economics from Keble College, Oxford.He was captain of the Oxford University cricket team in 1974, before going on to an illustrious sporting career, leading his country to victory in the 1992 World Cup.\u0026nbspHis profile says: The party has Islamic overtones and is inspired partly by Imran Khan\u0027s renewed commitment to Islam.As a politician, his vision is to turn Pakistan into a just society, based on humane values, by creating an independent and honest judiciary that will uphold democracy, protect human rights and ensure the rule of law and, by promoting a merit-based system that provides equal opportunity for upward social mobility to the working classes.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Why has there been an upsurge in violence?At the heart of the latest escalation is 16 weeks of Palestinian protests that have taken place at the border fence between Gaza and Israel. \u0026nbspSince 30 March, hundreds of thousands of Gazans have marched each week on the heavily fortified border with Israel demanding the right to return to lands they fled for were forced from after the 1948 war, which resulted in the formation of Israel.Palestinians, who have suffered for over a decade under a crippling blockade, have said the marches are peacefully demonstrating during the Great March of Return which is their right. But Israel has accused Hamas, the proscribed militant group that runs the enclave, of encouraging protesters to be violent towards their soldiers, to cut the border fence and to launch raids inside Israel.\u0026nbspThe Israeli military has responded with live fire, leaving more than 140 Palestinians dead, and many more with life changing injuries, in moves described by the UN General Assembly as excessive, disproportionate and indiscriminate”.\u0026nbspAt the same time, protesters say, in frustration, they have taken to launching burning kites and balloons laden with incendiary devices across the border, setting alight to over 2,600 hectares of Israeli farmland and causing hundreds of thousands of pounds of damage.\u0026nbspThe Israeli army, that said its citizens near to Gaza are in danger, subsequently tightened an 11-year-old blockade on the strip, closing Kerem Shalom, the sole goods crossing between Israel and Gaza, and strangling Gaza’s fishing zones to just three nautical miles, a third of what it was before the protests. Israel said earlier this week that it would allow fuel and gas to be transferred via Kerem Shalom, and widen the fishing lanes, partially lifting the restrictions, should a shaky ceasefire hold.\u0026nbspNeither side to date will back down, saying their respective responses are fair and legitimate. This has created a cycle of violence that has reached boiling in the last week, with warnings from the UN that a war could break out.Q. Why is the UN fearful there could be another war? \u0026nbspOn Friday, 20 July, Israeli Staff Sergeant Aviv Levi, 21, was killed by what the Israeli army called a “violent raid” during the protests.\u0026nbspIt marked the first time an Israeli soldier was killed by Palestinian gunfire near Gaza since the last war in 2014 and so crossed a definitive red line. Israel said that gunmen had shot at and lobbed grenades at its soldiers. It responded by bombarding Gaza with tank and air fire, and said its forces struck 60 “military sites” run by Hamas.Four Palestinians were killed that day. Palestinian health officials said that at least one was a civilian. Earlier in the month, there was the most intense exchange of fire between Gaza militants and Israel simcea the 2014 - largely due to the border protests.\u0026nbspEgypt has intervened several times enforcing ceasefires which keep being broken.\u0026nbspGazans protest as US embassy moves to Jerusalem – in picturesPalestinian mourners carry the dead body of Mukhtar Ebu Hamas, 25, killed by Israeli forces in Gaza on 14 MayA Palestinian woman flashes a victory sign during a protest near the border fence Israeli soldiers guard on top of a watch tower along the Israel-Gaza borderPalestinian demonstrators react to fired tear gasPalestinian demonstrators run for coverUS President\u0027s daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Senior White House Advisor Jared Kushner arrive for the controversial inauguration of the US embassy in Jerusalem.

He said it was “imperative” both Israelis and Palestinians abide by the ceasefire.On Monday,\u0026nbspZeid Ra\u0027ad Al Hussein, the UN’s human rights chief, called for an investigation into Israel’s actions at the border calling the most recent killings “shocking”. He said it was also vital to address the root causes of the Gaza demonstrations which would continue, as living conditions under Israel’s blockade are “grossly inadequate”.\u0026nbspPalestinians in Gaza, including the armed factions, say the Israeli security forces have used live ammunition against peaceful protesters, and launched devastating airstrikes on the strip, killing dozens of people. They said that Israel has also exacerbated a humanitarian and economic crisis within the enclave by adding the new restrictions.\u0026nbspIsrael maintains Hamas, that it regards as a terrorist group, has incited violence and endangered the lives of Israelis near the border. It says the fires caused by the burning kites have caused significant damage to farm land.Q. Who are the protagonists?The main protagonists are Israel and its army, and the myriad armed factions within Gaza, that answer to a central operations room that is ostensibly led by the militant arm of Hamas – called the Qassem Brigades. Within that are vastly different factions, with anything ranging from small far-left Marxist armed groups like the National Resistance Brigades to Islamic jihad’s al-Quds Brigade.\u0026nbspQ. What is at stake?For this region, everything. In the last war more than 2,200 Palestinians, and 73 Israelis, were killed. Gaza took several years to recover and still has not been fully rebuilt. More fundamentally is the moribund Middle East peace process, which is arguably dragging into its eighth decade. A new devastating war would only put another nail in its coffin.\u0026nbspEgypt, that has long held a position as mediator in the Israel-Palestine conflict, has reportedly intervened multiple times in the past few weeks to broker a ceasefire. Last week\u0026nbspHamas said it once again stepped in and brokered a truce which so far hold.\u0026nbspQ. What is going to happen now?Both sides of the conflict, as well as civilians, have repeatedly expressed an interest in stopping the current escalation from tumbling into a full-blown war. Further deaths with only worsen the situation.Q. But if neither side wants war why does the violence continue?\u0026nbspFirstly, Hamas is in a tricky position. Gaza is experiencing one of the most severe economic crises in its recent history. There are many reasons, including the Israeli blockade, new sanctions from the Palestinian Authority which is dominated by Hamas’ secular political rival Fatah and a massive shortfall in International aid funding.\u0026nbspIn a bid to force Hamas to relinquish power over Gaza, last April the PA ordered early retirement for nearly a third of its 60,000 Gaza employees as well as restrictions on electricity access to Gaza. In May it slashed salaries to its civil servants in the enclave by at least 20 percent, piling on more pressure.\u0026nbspCash-strapped Hamas, that once relied on taxing goods smuggled through tunnels to Egypt, has also been unable to pay its own 40,000 employees in full.Meanwhile the United Nation’s refugee agency UNRWA said it is suffering from an “unprecedented” £164 million funding shortfall acerbating the problems.\u0026nbspThe 1.8 million population of Gaza, that was already suffering from one of the highest jobless rates in the world, cannot sustain further devastation and many are increasingly frustrated with their own leaders.\u0026nbspMembers of Hamas’s Palestinian political rivals in Gaza have told The Independent that Hamas wants the focus of Gazans\u0027 anger to be directed towards Israel, which it regards as an occupier, rather than at local government and themselves.\u0026nbspAnd therefore, the protests at the border cannot stop.\u0026nbspIsrael, meanwhile, is facing a potential war at its northern border as well as its frontier with Gaza. \u0026nbspOver the last months, Israel has been increasingly concerned by Iran’s attempts to build permanent military infrastructure near Israel in Syria, where Tehran is backing Syrian President Assad and the rebels. Iran and its allied forces have fired into Israel.\u0026nbspMembers of the Israeli army and government have told The Independent they have no interest in fighting a war on two fronts.

Dinosaur fossil discovery shows first flying fearsome beast                Back from the DEAD: Scientists looking to clone the DODOWhat is significant about the findings is that it would mean that sauropods, who were believed to have emerged about 160 million years ago, is that they evolved 15 million years earlier than expected.Study co-author Paul Upchurch, a palaeontologist at University College London, said: \u0026ldquoPreviously, we thought all of these advanced sauropods originated around 160 million years ago and rapidly ersified and spread across the planet in a time window perhaps as short as five million years.\u0026ldquoHowever, the discovery of Lingwulong means that this hypothesis is incorrect and we now have to work with the idea that, actually, this group and its major constituent lineages originated somewhat earlier and more gradually.Lingwulongs would have lived in a warm and wet environment which would have been full of vegetation, according to lead author Xing Xu of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.The fossils were found in Lingwui, China (Image: REUTERS)They would have fed on plants such as conifers and ferns, and as its necks would not be as long as other sauropods it probably would have grazed on low, soft plants with its peg-like teeth.As so many were found together, the researchers have concluded that lingwulongs were herd animals.Previously, there have been no other findings of sauropods in East Asia as it is believed they evolved after Pangea \u0026ndash an ancient super continent which accounted for the majority of the land mass \u0026ndash had split and began forming continents as we know them today.But as Dr Xu points out: \u0026ldquoOur discoveries indicate that eastern Asia was still connected to other continents at the time."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/590x/Gary-Lineker-Second-Brexit-Vote-994424.jpg","title":"Gary Linker Brexit referendum UK EU","story":"The ex-footballer and star BBC pundit added his voice to the \u0026ldquoPeople\u0026rsquos Vote campaign which is calling for another referendum on whether the UK should quit the EU.Mr Lineker commented: \u0026ldquoSome things in life are more important than football.\u0026ldquoI am not a politician but I know when something is going wrong and right now Brexit feels like it is going very wrong indeed.\u0026ldquoWhether you voted Leave or Remain, did anyone really vote for the mess we seem to be in, let alone the prospect of no deal with all the terrible consequences attached to that?Mr Lineker commented: \u0026ldquoSome things in life are more important than football.

The spread of social media and other online communication, with its inherent anonymity, has only increased the misery for victims.But the speed of change has not been matched by a more robust framework to deal with it.Yes, we have tougher sentences — the Government was absolutely right to last year double jail terms for the worst cases from five to ten years.But progress has been too slow in recognising these crimes.In 2016-17, fewer than 1,000 prosecutions were commenced under stalking legislation.It was horrifying to read the account of Nicola Roberts from Girls Aloud yesterday.She told how she faced a barrage of more than 3,000 texts over five years from an ex-boyfriend, including threats to stab and burn her.Soon after being handed a lifetime restraining order, her ex began following her on Instagram.He “wanted me to know he was still watching me”, she said, chillingly.And yet the CPS saw no realistic chance of a successful prosecution for stalking because the social media activity was not taken sufficiently seriously, despite the obvious impact on Nicola’s life.As she put it: “I should be able to move on from an unhealthy relationship if I want and that’s not been able to happen.”She wants change — and she is right to.These kinds of messages leave you in fear for your life — feeling that someone is watching or following you is immensely distressing.A bunch of flowers is not a romantic gesture when sent by a stalker but a reminder that your persecutor is still watching and can still reach you.Stalking is a crime of obsession and fixation and it needs to be stopped before it becomes deeply ingrained.No legislation will be effective unless it is accompanied by training at the front line of policing and across the wider courts system.Victims must have the confidence to come forward at an earlier stage, for all forms of stalking to be recognised for what they are. It is my intention to make this happen.My Stalking Protection Bill will introduce so-called Stalking Protection Orders (SPOs) to help fill some of the gaps in the law.It will allow the police to act more quickly and to protect victims of so-called stranger stalking, where the stalker is not a former partner.Importantly, it will also take the onus off the victim to have to take action, as is currently the case for stranger stalking. At present many victims are left unprotected because they have to put protective measures in place for themselves, such as applying for a civil injunction to restrain someone from harassing them.Needless to say, many victims find this such a daunting task — not to mention expensive and time-consuming — that they end up not going through with it.If passed, the Stalking Protection Bill would allow the police to apply for an SPO through the magistrates’ courts on behalf of victims.Orders will require the civil standard of proof “on the balance of probabilities” but breach of an order would be a criminal offence, punishable in the most serious cases by a term of up to five years in prison.SPOs could set out requirements prohibiting certain behaviours, such as contacting the victim either directly or indirectly.It would be able to prohibit behaviours such as driving past the victim’s house, harassing friends, colleagues or family members, going within a certain distance of the victim or following them online.It could also set out so called positive requirements, such as attending a psychiatric assessment.In this digital age, the law would cover online contact from abroad and require that any IT equipment would be free from encryption, so perpetrators could not cover their tracks.Unlike the now-abandoned Police Information Notices, SPOs will have teeth, as they would be enforceable and breaching the terms of an order would have consequences.SPOs would also require stalkers to register all the names they use, as well as their address.While SPOs will provide better early intervention to protect victims, they are not intended to replace full prosecution for an offence of stalking.They will, however, enable police to better protect the safety of victims while gathering the full evidence for the CPS to prosecute a full stalking case.The Bill has almost completed its Commons journey but will not now return to the Chamber until late November.When the case for change is so pressing, and the Bill is backed by members across the House, I believe the Government should bring forward the final Commons stage so we can get on with delivering this vital change to the law — which will help to save lives.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The 27 EU states, or most of them at any rate, might individually want good relations with us.But, in Brussels, there are plenty of officials who would rather see all sides suffer than watch Brexit succeed.If their view prevails, the implications go well beyond Brexit. For 70 years, Britain has been a European power.Although we kept our military ties with the other English-speaking democracies, our focus was the defence of Europe. It still is.There are, for example, British soldiers patrolling the borders of Poland and Estonia.The RAF is, to all intents and purposes, acting as Romania’s air force, responding to incursions into that country’s airspace. And so on.In intelligence and security, rather as with the Common Fisheries Policy, Britain puts a lot more than its share into the common pot.We have done so cheerfully because we saw European states as our allies, and felt that we had a stake in their security. But what if that feeling is no longer reciprocated?Visiting Germany on Monday, Jeremy Hunt, the Foreign Secretary, pointed out in measured and polite language that the EU could not expect to treat Britain aggressively without consequences.Now Mr Hunt is no Little Englander. He is an entrepreneur who made his money from language courses, is married to a Chinese woman and, after some soul-searching, came down on the side of Remain.But what he said is impossible to argue with. If the EU chooses to treat Brexit as a hostile act, the basis of European security will be undone — at the very moment that Donald Trump has made it clear that America is no longer interested in defending Europe.In almost every European speech since the referendum, Theresa May has said that she wants Britain to be the EU’s closest friend and strongest ally.But when have you ever heard those good wishes returned?The PM keeps saying she wants the EU 27 to succeed. EU leaders keep saying they want Brexit to fail.They mean it. Eurocrats are not offering Britain the kind of deal that they have with neighbours such as Norway and Switzerland.They think UK will just swallow what’s offered.If we want to remain in the single market, says chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier, then, unlike those countries, we’d have to give Brussels 100 per cent control of our trade policy — an impossible condition.But neither are they offering the kind of simple free trade deal that they have with, say, Canada and Japan.If we want a straightforward trade deal, Barnier says, we’d have to leave Northern Ireland under EU rules — an equally impossible condition.In other words, Britain won’t be allowed the friendly relations with the EU that other democracies take for granted.It is not for a lack of willingness on our side. In February, Theresa May told a Munich audience: “Europe’s security is our security. And that is why I say that the United Kingdom is unconditionally committed to maintaining it.”The EU’s response? To exclude us from the Galileo satellite programme on grounds that we could no longer be trusted.Well, fine. I never saw much point in the Galileo system, which was pushed by French leader Jacques Chirac to challenge the “technological imperialism” of America’s GPS system.Britain should now either go in with the Americans or create its own satellite system, possibly with friendly states such as Australia and Canada.But the point is, the EU’s logic goes well beyond satellites.If Brussels no longer sees us as an ally, we can hardly carry on behaving like one unilaterally, so to speak.While we talk of trade and co-operation, EU negotiators talk of border queues and grounded flights.Ireland’s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, even threatens to close his airspace.If such thinking wins out, we shall have no choice but to leave Europe to itself and turn our faces, as our ancestors did, to the open seas.That is not an outcome anyone should want, but we shall be ready if it comes.Understandably enough, you might say, given what feeble negotiators we have been so far. But Britain has a bad habit of switching from vague amiability to sudden resolve when it is almost too late.Such a moment is upon us.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She started to come around and I told her the Candyman concept and my vision.“She is the one that I disclose everything to, shes the one I have the most trust for and shes the mother of our children and the one thats going to be there long term.For her part Taesha is more than okay with sharing her playboy hubby with his live in girlfriend Nisha.Taesha said: I feel like its really normal now. It kind of just works, everyone gets along really well. Im into Nisha and shes into me, and shes into Travers.Travers added: Nisha articulated it well by saying Taesha respects Nisha as a girlfriend and Nisha respects Taesha as the wife.”He continued revealing that rather than problems arising between his wife and his girlfriend, they usually occurred between the other women he invites back.Travers says he shares his bed each with three or four different women in an average week.The Instagram star said: Its not so much between Nisha and Taesha but between the girls that came in groups fighting for my affection, if theyre trying to pull me away.Im a good manager and I have to be not just at work but at home, with such a dynamic family and relationships.Ive been with Taesha, nine, 10 years. They said it wouldnt last because shes so young but she ticked a lot of boxes and she believed in what I was doing. Nisha came on the scene three years ago and people said its impossible.“Its a massive family when you start to consider all the different relationships and we all do get on as a family.For the record can I just say that Taesha is the prettiest.Revealing how his unique living situation came to being Travers said it was at least partly his wife’s idea.I never set out to be the Candyman and I can you my two biggest idols were Gianni Versace and Hugh Hefner but I never wanted to be a fashion designer and I never wanted to be a Playboy with a lot of girls.As a kid all I wanted to do was play football. I was drafted at a really young age and then when I was 17, 18, I broke my back and couldnt play anymore.“Then I got an opportunity to model. I worked for Levis, Versace, then I travelled the world for about nine, ten years. Around that time my parents where starting up the company that is known as Free Choice now.Ive been throwing parties for 22 years. I suppose that comes back from the days of when I was modelling, this was in some pretty big cities, but they all lacked something. Its the entertainment, its how its run.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/t-may1.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may defends stockpiling food and medicines for brexit saying shes being sensible in preparing for a no deal","story":"Speaking yesterday the PM said it was “sensible” to be ready for “every eventuality” despite her confidence of striking a good deal with the EU.It came a day after new Health Secretary Matt Hancock said his department was working up options for stockpiling medicines and blood products.The Sun earlier this month revealed Ministers had drawn up secret plans to stockpile processed food in case of a ‘No Deal’ Brexit in March – where Britain would leave the EU without a trade agreement in place.Challenged by Channel 5 yesterday if Brits should be “worried” about the plans, the Prime Minister rejected the suggestion anyone should be alarmed.She said: “Well, far from being worried about preparations that we’re making, I would say that people should take reassurance and comfort from the fact that the government is saying that we’re in a negotiation working for a good deal.“I believe we can get a good deal.“But actually it’s right that we say because we don’t know what the outcome is going to be, we think it’s going to be a good one, we’re working for a good one but let’s prepare for every eventuality.”Pressed on the issue Mrs May added: “Look, this is not just about stockpiling that concept, what it is about making sure that we’ll be able to continue to do things that are necessary once we’ve left the EU, if we leave without a deal.“Now I think people should take reassurance from the fact that this is a government that’s saying you know what we’re going to be responsible about this we’re going to be sensible about this.”The PM was backed by the Chancellor yesterday who said No Deal preparations were the “responsible thing for a government to do” during a visit to Northern Ireland.Ministers on Tuesday announced the recruitment of nearly 100 new officials for the Brexit Department to help prepare for a No Deal.New Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab promised to issue a series of technical notices which would explain the work being done to “mitigate the risks” in a “responsible and reassuring way”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’ve never seen anything like it in my lifetime.”The nugget is safely locked up in a deposit box as he is still undecided what to do with it. And the location where it was discovered is a closely guarded secret.Gold panning expert Leon Kirk said: “This is a very exciting and unprecedented find.“I would say it is worth at least £50,000 but, as it’s rarer than a Aston Martin or a Faberge egg, a billionaire could easily come along and pay a lot more for it.“Historically, it is off the Richter scale.”There are three “gold belts” in Scotland — around the Lowther Hills near Wanlokhead and Leadhills in Galloway Tyndrum in Perthshire and at Helmsdale in Sutherland.Dr Neil Clark, author of Scottish Gold: Fruit Of The Nation, believes there could be more gold around the secret area where the Douglas Nugget was found.He said: “The rounded edges of the piece indicate that it has certainly been in the watercourse for a while.“The size of the nugget suggests that it probably did not travel far, though.”But he added: “The fact that we have waited over 500 years for this nugget suggests it may be difficult to find another comparable one in the near future.”Prior to the Douglas Nugget, the previous record holder for the biggest gold nugget to be found in British waters dates back to 1808.This was a 59g lump discovered in Cornwall.In 2016, a 97g nugget was found off the coast of Anglesey by Vincent Thurkettle.However, experts later concluded that it had originated from Australia and gone down with the steam clipper Royal Charter.The boat, laden with gold, sank when it was hit by a hurricane while sailing from Melbourne to Liverpool in 1859."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000422824175.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"the met office can stick advice where sun doesnt shine let us enjoy the heat while it lasts","story":"You get a lovely chill from the cotton. OK, later you might find a hash brown stuck halfway up your bottom, but it’s worth it, just for the pleasantly cool sensation.It’s been a lovely summer, the best that I can remember since 1976. That summer was the happiest time of my life. But this hasn’t been bad, has it?But there are downsides to the driest and warmest spell we’ve had for years.Public transport isn’t always much fun, especially if you’re crunched up on the Tube next to a large bearded lady who last washed when hula hoops were all the rage.If you live in the country, there are mosquitoes — I’ve got bites in ­places I ­forgot existed.Work can be a bit of a chore. And if you’re a smoker, the pub gardens are suddenly full of tossers who waft their hands around if the smoke goes anywhere near them.Where were you when it was snowing, huh? I was there, lighting my Superking in a blizzard, while you were tucked away inside.But the hot weather is very good for us.There’s a link between clear, sunny days and good health — mental as well as physical.People feel better about themselves and tend to spend more money, which is good for the economy.OK, crime rates tend to increase when the weather is hot — more precisely, when the temperature ­hovers between 28C and 32C, according to psychologists.But on the whole, this summer — a proper summer, at last — is something to be enjoyed, cherished and remembered. We don’t have them very often.We can admire the women walking around with not many clothes on and laugh at the men dressed in toddler shorts with beer bellies hanging down to their knees.We can relax with a beer and forget about bloody Brexit for a while.The authorities think of nice summers as altogether something very different.For them, nice summers are a crisis.That’s why those tiresome drongos at the Met Office put out an amber alert when the temperature rose this week.“Don’t go out! Stay in your homes! Or you will die — DIE, I tell you.”Oh, with the greatest respect — f*** off!We’ll go out when and where we please, thank you, so you can stuff your advice where the sun isn’t shining.And, of course, the climate change ­monkeys are in full voice.“This is it! The end of the world! Look at the incredible temperatures and those wildfires in poor Greece. We told you!”Give it a rest. I think there is something to global warming. I am not a denier. But I remember the last few ­summers we’ve had — rainy and cool — and the climate change monkeys saying THAT was a consequence of global ­warming, too. You can’t have it both ways.And there have been wildfires in hot, dry areas for the past 100,000 years.So enjoy this wonderful heatwave while you can. Because someday, quite soon, it will be gone and the rain and the cold will be back, and the Christmas adverts will start appearing in supermarkets.And this summer will just be ­something you talk about in years to come. Remember the summer of 2018? Wasn’t it brilliant? If only we could have it again.Carlos Delacruz was in court in Scotland accused of having sex with two women with something other than a penis.The lasses THOUGHT it was his todger. But then, the lights were off.And the sad truth is that Mr Delacruz does not have a penis. Not even a small one.The women complained the sex was painful. So what was it, then?It was referred to in court as an “unknown object”.Here are my guesses:Incidentally, the prosecuting lawyer was called Ms Cockburn.No kidding, love.NO sooner has the World Cup finished than the domestic football season is about to begin.And with it the endless round of transfer speculation.If you’re still wondering why England didn’t win the World Cup, check out how many top foreign teams are trying to buy our players.None. None whatsoever.All the sides we played against in the final stages had players at Juventus, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich etc.That’s because they are very good players.But none of the top European clubs wants Harry or Dele or Raheem.We are a lot further behind than many people think.LABOUR MP and fervent Brexiteer Kate Hoey received the following email from a man called Robert Crangle.“I have never written to an MP before. I just want to say that you are a f***ing disgrace for helping to keep the Tories in power. I hope you die soon.”Lefty Remainers are a lovely bunch, aren’t they?IS it actually the law that all pop musicians must end up skagged out of their heads and taken to hospital?And then, if they survive, check into some poncey rehab clinic and tell their fans they are “fighting my demons”.And then come out of rehab and get skagged out of their heads again.The latest is Demi Lovato.I must admit I’m not a huge fan, but still.First time we knew anything was amiss was when she forgot the lyrics to one of her songs. The track was called Sober.So let’s wish her a speedy recovery from whatever foul substance laid her low.And remind pop singers that nobody looks cool in a pine box.THE Palestinian Authority has just revealed that at least half of the money it receives in aid goes to funding vile acts of terrorism against Israel. One Hamas bomber even pocketed £100,000.Please, think carefully and do your homework before giving money to charities working in Palestine.The British Government has already stopped aid to the Palestinian Authority. It’s time these Islamist thugs had the plug pulled on their slush fund from naive Westerners.LATEST news from the front line of scientific research on . . . crows.Apparently these birds are fond of a bit of necrophilia.Experts Dr John Marzluff and Kaeli Swift professed themselves “surprised” to seeing crows trying to have sexual intercourse with dead members of their species.The pair put this down to confusion caused by hormonal imbalance.I am not so sure. I have watched crows. And I can tell you that if I were forced to have sex with them I would much prefer it if they were dead.They would make that awful cawing noise if they were alive, and probably try to peck at your bits.Crows, I think, feel the same way.JUST a short word of congratulations to Jeremy Corbyn’s favourite country, Venezuela.The socialist paradise will soon experience an inflation rate of ONE MILLION PER CENT.

Every time I go out she says, bring me back some Hot Takis, bring me back some Hot Chips. I want to make her her happy, so I brought them back.She was eating big bags and would take them to school with her.When my daughter had to have this surgery I knew I had to tell everybody about it.I was very surprised that my daughter was sick like that. The gallbladder is in the upper right part of the abdomen.It stores bile - a fluid produced by the liver that helps to break down fatty foods.Removing the gallbladder doesnt cause huge problems, but some people find they suffer with digestive issues after surgery.The makers of Cheetos told CBS News: At Frito-Lay, food safety is always our number one priority, and our snacks meet all applicable food safety regulations as well as our rigorous quality standards.Some consumers may be more sensitive to spicy foods than others and may choose to avoid spicier snacks due to personal preference."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000374162670.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"increase in nurses outside the eu","story":"The regulator is now registering an average of 440 overseas workers each month – up 86 per cent from 237 in previous months. The Nursing and Midwifery Council changed the way that workers had to demonstrate their language skills last November.It came after the entry test was blamed for a sharp drop in recruitment, with candidates claiming it was too difficult.They can now choose to take an alternative test, which is less academic and easier to pass.  They can also qualify by showing they have practiced in an English-speaking country or trained and been examined in English.The NMC is now considering scrapping a rule that says candidate must have practiced abroad for at least a year after qualifying.There were 69,425 nurses and midwives on the register from outside the EU at the end of June – up from 67,534 in July 2017.Emma Broadbent, from the NMC, said: “It’s pleasing to see an increase in nurses and midwives from outside the EU joining the UK workforce over the past few months. The UK workforce is under significant pressure and it’s vital that we continue to enable the right people with the right skills and knowledge to join our register in the quickest and safest way possible.”The number of new EU nurses coming to work in the UK fell by 87 per cent over the past year. And increase from outside the EU is not enough to make up the difference. One in ten nursing posts is vacant, with around 35,000 more nurses needed.A new poll by The Health Foundation think tank found 71 per cent of Brits think the UK should continue attract nurses from the EU after Brexit.Janet Davies, from the Royal College of Nursing, said: “Uncertainties and nervousness around Brexit have seen EU nurses leaving in droves. A nurse who trained in Barcelona is as welcome as a nurse who trained in Bradford, not least when the shortage is so great. “The very latest figures on nurses from the wider world reveal a small but encouraging increase that we will continue to monitor.“While the NHS has always relied on the contribution of its international workforce, there is no alternative to a proper domestic plan and that is still seriously lacking.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They were human-like and that made it even weirder.Whaley said she suffered no ill-effects from the bite.Game Warden Tyler Howser  said the fish was likely purchased as a pet and was released into the lake when it grew too large for the aquarium of the family that owned it.Pacu are considered an invasive species that can destroy the fish ecosystem and habitat.The fish was taken by the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation and destroyed.Howser said he recognized the species immediately.“I’ve actually caught one myself,” Howser said. “As soon as I saw it I said ‘I know what that is.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000422919229.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"us embassy explosion beijing china latest news","story":"Dramatic pictures showed huge plumes of smoke billowing from the southeast corner of the embassy compound on Thursday at around 1pm local time (6am BST).Beijing police said the suspect, a 26-year-old from Inner Mongolia, Northern China, had injured his hand.He had aimed to throw the firework device over the compounds gated fence, but it exploded next to him, Radio Free Asia reported.Chinese state media outlet Global Times said locals heard a thunder-like bang at around 1.30pm local time.Footage posted shortly after the blast filmed dozens fleeing for cover as smoke filled the area.But in pictures which have now been removed, others appeared confused as they lined up outside the compound for visa appointments.Traffic appeared to move as normal in an area of northeastern Beijing is home to numerous embassies including those of France, India and Israel.Staff at the Indian and South Korean embassies near the US compound said they were unaware of any unusual incident and were working as normal.A police SUV appeared to have been damaged, with its back windshield missing, and was cordoned off by police before being removed, a witness said.The scene remains on lockdown.Police did not immediately respond to comments on the incident.A witness told the New York Times the Mongolian was trying to attract attention for a contentious human rights issue.Chinese police had previously detained 39 Mongolians who were protesting over land rights.Hours before the explosion, a woman had sprayed herself with gasoline and was taken away by police, state-run media reported.But it has not been confirmed if the two incidents are linked.China and the US are in the middle of a trade dispute, but America remains a hugely popular destination for travel, education and immigration for Chinese citizens."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT0004197053921-e1532588594338.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"gary lineker brexit second referendum more important football","story":"The former England striker has thrown his support behind the Peoples Vote group’s “summer of action” with rallies and protests across the country.They want to boost support for another vote to be held so they can try and overturn the historic decision to leave the EU.Mr Lineker said he has been left more bewildered and worried than ever after catching up on developments since returning from Russia following his coverage of the World Cup.The Match Of The Day host said: It was impossible to avoid what was happening in the Brexit debate back home.

Congratulations @ImranKhanPTI.Most of the revellers last night were young men, who danced to the sound of beating drums draped in Tehreek-e-Insaf party black and green-coloured flags.Mr Khans Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) party was leading in 113 of the 272 National Assembly constituencies after votes were counted in 47 per cent of stations.Khans leading rival Shahbaz Sharif - who heads the Pakistan Muslim League, the party of jailed ex-prime minister Nawaz Sharif - has already rejected the vote.But officials have denied claims of vote rigging.Khans party spokesman, Fawad Chaudhry, tweeted: Congratulations to the nation on a new Pakistan! Prime Minister Imran Khan, although his party has officially held off on declaring victory.Mr Khan himself has denied allegations that he is getting help from the military which has ruled Pakistan for almost half of its history.The army has also denied allegations of meddling in the election.Imran Khan is a cricket star-turned politician who is a leading contender in Pakistans election.Described as a quiet and shy boy in his youth Mr Khan attended the Royal Grammar School, Worcester, before completing his formal schooling with an undergraduate degree in economics from Keble College, Oxford.He was Pakistans cricket captain when the national squad won the World Cup in 1992.But after marrying Jemima in 1995, he moved into politics, founding his Tehreek-e-Insaf, the Movement for Justice party.The pairs romance generated shockwaves as he was a strict Muslim, and she was 20 years his junior.Jemima, daughter of the late Jewish financier Sir James Goldsmith, converted to Islam when she married Mr Khan, who was dubbed crickets greatest playboy in the 1980s and 1990s and was a favourite with women.The couple divorced in 2004.Mr Khans passion for politics was spurred by his renewed commitment to Islam.A profile on his party website says: As a politician, his vision is to turn Pakistan into a just society, based on humane values.[He aims to create] an independent and honest judiciary that will uphold democracy, protect human rights and ensure the rule of law.Mr Khan also hopes to provide equal opportunity for upward social mobility to the working classes.This election will mark the second transfer of power from one civilian to another in Pakistans 71-year history.The country was been under military rule on and off for a total of 33 years.Since obtaining independence in 1947, all of 29 of Pakistans Prime Ministers failed to complete a full term, with four only lasting for one day.They were booted out of office for a variety of reasons including military coups and assassination.Election campaigns were plagued for months by allegations the powerful armed forces have been trying to tilt the race in Khans favour.Military officials had fallen out with the outgoing ruling party of Shehbaz Sharif, who was jailed on corruption charges this month.Pakistans military have been accused of interefering in the election results.Around 371,000 soldiers were stationed at polling stations across the country on Wednseday, nearly five times the number deployed at the last election in 2013.Mr Khans rivals Benazir Bhutto who leads the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and Sharif who leads the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party, have reported of election rigging.The PML-N and the PPP both said they recieved hand-written tallies of election counts that officials could not verify, as monitors in many voting centres had not received the official notifications.PPP Senator Sherry Rehman said:  This whole election could be null and void, and we dont want this.Mr Shehbaz told a conference on election day: It is a sheer rigging.

Where are the sirens?A medic, who was several hours into her shift, then asks the man where he would like her to park the vehicle.He says the bay, however she explains that the ambulance does not fit in the bay.She says: Im not being funny, Im not going to use a disabled space... so where would you like me to park?Ive been on since 6.45am this morning, Ive had nothing to drink, nothing to eat.And now Id like to go to Tesco to get some water.According to the law - set out in the  Traffic Signs Regulations \u0026amp General Directions 2002 - emergency vehicles may park on double yellow, white, or red lines.Ambulance drivers are told they should always consider the safest place to park, however in the video the medic explains that her ambulance would not fit in the bay.The law advises that drivers try and leave the area as soon as possible, however the parking attendant would not even allow them to pop in for a bottle of water on one of the hottest days of the year.An ambulance may also exceed the speed limit if it safe to do so, however they are generally advised to go no quicker than 20mph above the speed limit of a road.They may also use bus lanes.But the parking attendant continues to give them a ticket.The video was uploaded onto Facebook after 10am on Tuesday by local man Ian French who was walking past at the time.Walking away, the medic says: If you ever need an ambulance... while Mr French, still filming, says to the warden, shame on you.A LCP spokesperson said: LCP supports all of our emergency services, and their staff and vehicles are regular visitors to our shopping centres and retail parades across the UK, where they are always welcome.On this occasion, we do not agree with the parking officer’s interpretation of the parking restrictions relating to emergency vehicles.

She and her brother later flew more than 4,000 miles to the UK to report Hayyawi to police.Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester heard the revenge porn attack occurred after the pair met online while Hayyawi was living in Ashton-under-Lyne having emigrated from his native Iraq.Miss Laura Nash prosecuting said: They used an app which allowed them to talk online in their own languages and they moved to communicating by Facebook messenger. The complainant said they were in a relationship and she spent time with his family and was fully welcomed in as his girlfriend.But during this time, he asked her for photographs both fully clothed and naked - he told her that because he claimed she should trust him. She then sent him photographs and videos, including what can only be described as full-frontal nudity.He said he had deleted them but he had not. There were issues during the relationship and he threatened to circulate the content and messages to her contacts.She was unsure if he was really able to do this or how he would have access to her contacts. This would have been very embarrassing for her and her family who have a very large standing in the community.She considered taking her own life due to the stress of the incident. Mr Hayyawi sent the photographs to her brother over WhatsApp. The defendant then made her go to a hotel in Saudi Arabia whilst he did this.Messages said he demanded she should come to the UK as he owned her now. This was extremely distressing. Overriding shame and fear came from her statement and she and her brother flew to the UK to report the case.Hayyawi was questioned on June 14 but claimed he took medication which affected his memory.The court heard he blamed the incident on family pressure and pressure from her brother due to their families being Muslim and the pressures they faced with relationships.Hayyawi admitted an offence of disclosing private sexual photographs and films with intent to cause distress and was jailed for ten months. He was also ordered not to contact the victim under the terms of a restraining order.His lawyer Andrew Marsh said in mitigation: Mr Hayyawi takes medication from post traumatic stress disorder. He shows substantial remorse, and says how he was not thinking everything through due to his obsession with this lady.He took an extreme action and apologies for that. His intention was not to maximise stress, and says his actions resulted from his condition. He did not go into great thought of what he was doing or the impact it would have on her. He understands it is a serious matter.He is 21 years old, and was a refugee as a child from Iraq.Sentencing the judge Mr Recorder Michael Hayton QC told Hayyawi: You met a young lady online and pursued a relationship. This happens all the time and several times a day. That connected into a form of relationship and caused you to meet in this country.But that relationship began to break down and you struggled to come to terms with this - and in fact you still haven’t come to terms with this. Mr Hayyawi, you chose to deal with the breakup in a particular way. You have images and videos of her in a state of undress and sent them to her brother.I accept that you did not publish them online or publicly, but sending them to her brother had a severe impact on her. Full of shame, she felt she needed to fly all the way to England to complain against you.The impact psychologically caused her to look on the internet and search up terms on how to take her own life. You callously disregarded her and tried to stop her from having any other relationships without considering the consequences.I accept that you are a 21 year old man with good character and an early guilty plea which will be considered. But your reported behaviour was controlling and you had not fully understood the consequences.You thought you had a sense of entitlement, and the report says you pose as a risk against women. This is beyond the custodial threshold. You caused devastating impact in a calculated way to maximise her distress and that distress was extreme."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000422960386.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"tycoon landlord demands 5k from homeowners to get onto their own drive after he bought road behind their homes","story":"Ian Jones, who drives a Rolls Royce, bought a road behind a row of cottages in Penrhynside, North Wales, last April.He sent letters to the 14 homeowners asking if they could each pay £350 so he could renovate the track.Mr Jones wanted to widen the road and cut back the hedges and trees and told the residents they could use it if they coughed up the cash.But he claims he did not receive a reply from any of the residents and has now installed a gate at the bottom, the Daily Post reports.Residents are furious and have said they can’t park their vehicles behind their homes.One homeowner told the paper: This is a very upsetting situation for all of us.

The BBC presenter accused Theresa May of being “unable to resolve” the “mess” the UK is in as it prepares to exit the EU. And he backed campaigners who have demanded millions of Brits get a say on the final deal. The 57-year-old ex-footballer said: “I spent most of the last few weeks totally focused on a fantastic World Cup.  But it was impossible to avoid what was happening in the Brexit debate back home. “Now I’m back I find the whole thing more bewildering and worrying than ever.  Whether you voted Leave or Remain, did anyone really vote for the mess we seem to be in, let alone the prospect of no deal with all the terrible consequences attached to that.  “There are some things in life that, even for someone like me, are more important than football. This is one of them. “I am not a politician but I know when something is going wrong and right now Brexit feels like it is going very wrong indeed. “The politicians seem unable to resolve the problem the people gave them in voting to Leave.  That is why I think there should be a People’s Vote on the final deal, and why I am sending best wishes and good luck to the campaigners who will be stepping up the pressure over the summer.” Meanwhile, Theresa May today insisted the British public should take “comfort” from the fact the government is stockpiling blood and food in preparation for a no deal Brexit. The Prime Minister said her government was doing the “responsible” and “sensible” thing and not trying to alarm people. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has told MPs his department is working with industry “for the potential need for stockpiling in the event of a no-deal Brexit”. He added: “This includes the chain of medical supplies, vaccines, medical devices, clinical consumables, blood products.” "},{"url":null,"title":"theresa says you should take","story":"NewsTheresa May says you should take \u0027reassurance and comfort\u0027 in plan to stockpile food for no deal BrexitThe Prime Minister says Government preparations for a no-deal Brexit are a good thing\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical reporter20:46, 25 JUL 2018Updated09:12, 26 JUL 2018News (Image: AFP)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheresa May says the British public should take \u0027reassurance and comfort\u0027 in the Government\u0027s plans to stockpile food and medicines for a no-deal Brexit . In an interview with 5 News on Wednesday, the Prime Minister did not deny stockpiling is happening, but said the Government is being responsible and sensible while still trying to get a good deal with the European Union. It came after Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs on Tuesday he had asked officials to work up options for stockpiling by the pharmaceutical industry, and Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said the Government would also take steps to ensure an adequate food supply.  Irish deputy prime minister Simon Coveney had earlier said he does not believe that Britain can afford a no-deal Brexit, and he hit out at bravado from Brexiteers who claim such a scenario would be acceptable. Mrs May said: Far from being worried about preparations that we are making, I would say that people should take reassurance and comfort from the fact that the Government is saying we are in a negotiation, we are working for a good deal - I believe we can get a good deal - but... because we don\u0027t know what the outcome is going to be... let\u0027s prepare for every eventuality. This is not just about stockpiling. That concept, what it is, is about making sure that we will be able to continue to do the things that are necessary once we have left the European Union, if we leave without a deal.  Mrs May\u0027s comments came as a new poll suggests trust in her ability to handle Brexit is falling. A /ICM poll found she had an eight-point lead over Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn over who could be trusted to negotiate a good Brexit deal, down from 16 points in January and 34 points before the 2017 general election. Chancellor Philip Hammond said it is sensible and responsible that the Government is working with industry to stockpile certain vital supplies for the event of a no-deal. Speaking during a visit to the Bombardier aircraft factory in Belfast on Wednesday, he said: That\u0027s a sensible and responsible thing for a Government to do and large businesses who are importing or exporting large volumes of products or produce will be making contingency plans, and we would encourage them to do so and work closely with them as they are putting those plans together.  Mr Hammond also ruled out extending the Article 50 process to give more time to negotiate withdrawal from the EU, after the Irish Government said it would back such a move. He said Parliament had legislated for the current exit date in March after suggestions an extension could help avoid the risk of a no-deal Brexit taking place. It came as talks continued in Brussels, with a meeting between EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier and Mr Raab scheduled for Thursday. Mrs May confirmed on Tuesday that she had taken personal charge of the negotiations, with Mr Raab deputising for her in Brussels. Tory Eurosceptics have voiced concerns that Mr Raab\u0027s department has been sidelined by Number 10 and Mrs May\u0027s Europe adviser Olly Robbins, amid increasing speculation that divisions within the Conservative camp may result in no deal.

Evie-Beth Taylor was just five when she flummoxed doctors with chickenpox so bad they initially told her parents it might be a rare genetic disease and not the childhood disease at all. The infection was so severe the little girl was left screaming in pain whenever she was touched making it impossible for mum Lianne Taylor, 33, to clean her airways. So poorly she couldn\u0027t eat, drink or even use the toilet, poor Evie-Beth\u0027s nose became so clogged with \u0027rock hard\u0027 mucus that the little girl struggled to breathe. Lianne called paramedics and her poorly daughter was rushed to A\u0026ampE twice in just two days.  But Lianne claims she was \u0027treated like an over the top parent\u0027 and turned away both times, claiming she was told that she had to wait 10 days for the antibiotics prescribed by her GP to work. Desperate, Lianne took her daughter back to the GP once more who immediately arranged for her to go straight to hospital - where doctors told Lianne she was lucky to have brought her in when she did. After four days in hospital Evie-Beth was finally allowed to return home but it took months for the spots to completely go and has been left with scarring across her face and body. But now a year on, Lianne and Evie-Beth are bravely sharing the shocking images of her ordeal to raise awareness of just how serious chickenpox can be and tell other parents to seek help if concerned. Lianne, from Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, said: It was really traumatic seeing Evie-Beth like this.  She was struggling to breathe because she was so blocked up with mucus that went really hard. We couldn\u0027t get near her to wash her down or clean it away because she was screaming in pain. The spots just kept coming and coming. Even when she was in hospital the doctors were coming in every day and she was coming out with more and more spots. The doctors said they had never seen chickenpox that bad. They had a photographer come in and take photos of her skin because they had never seen a case as bad as hers before. They didn\u0027t know why. Mum-of-two Lianne first noticed a spot on her daughter\u0027s arm on February 4 2017 and thought it could be chickenpox. When the infection broke out in spots all over her body on February 8, her worried mum and dad Stuart Taylor bathed her in a bath with oats and rubbed her with creams and camomile lotions to ease the itch. But their daughter only got worse.  Lianne started sleeping in the same bed as little Evie-Beth so she could wake her up every hour to give her a drink. She was devastated when Evie-Beth only got more and more lethargic and eventually had to be carried and held over the toilet because her spots were too painful for her to even sit. Her GP prescribed her with antibiotics - but when paramedics took Evie-Beth to A and E on Feb 10 they turned her away then and on Feb 11 and told Lianne to wait 10 days for them to take effect. It wasn\u0027t until her GP sent Evie-Beth straight to Darlington Memorial Hospital on February 13 that the little girl was finally admitted. Lianne, who studies history at Teesside University, said: It was absolutely awful. It was really bad. Being sent away from A and E made me feel like I was treated like an over the top parent. It made it feel like it was beyond me and I couldn\u0027t do this. This was beyond the help I could give her. She couldn\u0027t eat or drink, she just lay there. She was crying and moaning and every time she moved she screamed. I was having to sleep next to her every night and not having much sleep myself and having to set an alarm to wake myself up every hour to get some fluids in her throat and give her paracetamol every four hours. It was horrendous. It was a really tough time. "},{"url":null,"title":"how much water should drink","story":"NewsHow much water should I drink a day in heatwave?

Bhaskar Somani, a consultant urological surgeon at University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, said attitudes towards water consumption remained poor even among those at higher risk of health problems.  He said: We should take this opportunity to remind people that consumption of three litres of water a day is a small price to pay to help maintain and improve your health, particularly during heatwave spells such as the one we are in right now. The consultant recommended people drink three litres (six pints) of water a day to stay hydrated in the heatwave.  He spoke out following a study of 162 patients who received treatment for kidney stones - for which poor hydration is a significant risk factor - at Southampton General Hospital.   It found less than a third (28%) increased their water intake, despite receiving advice after treatment on the need to drink 2.5 to 3 litres a day, particularly in the summer months, with the average intake of water at around 1.5 litres. Almost a quarter (22%) said the reason for avoiding water was because they didn\u0027t like the taste, while 26% blamed their habits and 10% said they only drank when thirsty. Mr Somani said: As a urologist, it clearly concerns me that patients who have suffered with the pain and discomfort of kidney stones are not keen to take this simple step to help improve their health. It then begs the question that, if those are the views of people in a high-risk group, what is the feeling among those who have no current health risks which could be aided by better hydration?

The Met Office had issued a warning to stay out of the sun as temperatures in the south east reached a sweltering 33.3C on Monday, the day the kids took part in the sweaty trudge. But acting headteacher at St Gregory\u0027s Catholic school in Margate, Kent, Diane Rougvie-Fevrier, says the walk was optional and water and hats were provided. One of the pupil\u0027s grandparents raged on social media, labelling the decision disgusting in a Facebook post that garnered almost 300 comments before it was deleted. The fuming gran said: So my granddaughter came home from school today saying they had to walk around the field five times so they would know how a refugee would feel like.  They had a guy from CAFOD (the Catholic Agency For Overseas Development) come to speak to them. The whole school had to do it the younger ones done the playground. I think this is disgusting on the hottest day of the year. Many supported the initiative, while others said it should have been abandoned because of the hot weather. The headteacher said: Children were invited to walk around the school field and we were overwhelmed with the number of children who chose to join in. Although the day was hot, the children enjoyed the early-morning stroll in the shade and had plenty of water and hats to wear. Others have since voiced their opinion online. Brian Varney said the decision was not acceptable.  But Lucy Boyle said: This was a walk was to show support to the refugees who have to make a longer and hotter walks to a safer place, as their home has been turned into a battle ground. I think it wonderful this walk still went ahead, it helps the kids truly understand what refugees have to go through. The walk was optional and lots of water provided. I think everyone is just trying to use the weather as an excuse to get off whatever they can at the moment. Rachel Louise Sheavills added: Early morning stroll with hats and water provided- we are lucky to have tap water that we can drink for starters. The walk was part of the school\u0027s spiritual day, with a representative from CAFOD giving talks to the children.

Kids can sometimes get bored and fed-up stuck in the back of the car. But the good news is there\u0027s plenty you can do to ensure everybody reaches the destination feeling happy. Below we\u0027ve listed eight great ideas for keeping kids entertained on the road. And you never know...a few grown-ups might enjoy passing the time with these too! Create a music playlist they\u0027ll love  Many parents will remember the days when FM radio and a creaky tape deck were the only option for long car journeys. Thankfully, things have improved with a range of car stereos that allow you to stream online music services and radio stations from your phone.   If your radio is lacking Bluetooth support then maybe it’s time to upgrade. A Pioneer MVH-AV290BT Car Stereo (above) is now \u0026pound120 (save \u0026pound39) and can link to any phone that supports Bluetooth. What\u0027s more it can directly control an iPhone via a cable. In fact, it can play audio or video from almost any source.  Remember, most streaming services allow you to download songs to your phone before you set off. This will save you data on a long journey and ensure you don\u0027t have to sit in silence when your phone signal gets too weak. Take DVDs to watch  As nice as music is, it can sometimes generate little arguments of its own. The kids want Ed Sheeran and the adults want Queen and never the twain shall meet. In those situations it might be time to give the kids something else to do.  It\u0027s well worth settling them down with a Nextbase Car 9 Portable In-Car DVD Player (above), priced \u0026pound79 (save \u0026pound20). It\u0027s a DVD and media player with a nine-inch screen and support for USB storage and SD cards to play music and video files.    If you have two kids you might need to consider two players – and Halfords has a twin version - the Nextbase Car 7 Dual - 7 Dual Portable In-Car DVD Players (above), now \u0026pound110 (save \u0026pound29).    If you\u0027d rather not listen to what the kids are watching, you can also get each child a set of these Nextbase CAR Series Wireless Headphones priced \u0026pound14.99. They\u0027re perfect for little ones as there are no wires for them to get into difficulties with. The headphones automatically link to the Infra Red signal from the Nextbase CAR DVD player and provide the ultimate immersive sound.  Pack a picnic and stop for a break  When you\u0027re driving it\u0027s tempting to keep going to get there quicker. But tiredness is dangerous and you\u0027ll probably find everyone is a lot less grumpy if you stop for a break. You can decide how long you want to spend having a rest, but it\u0027s well worth taking the time to stop for lunch.  Take a Halfords XL Waterproof Picnic Blanket - now \u0026pound10 (half price) - to sit on and pack a lunch in a Summerhouse Coast 4 Person Wicker Picnic Set (above), now \u0026pound61.99 (save \u0026pound29). It has everything you need for lunch in one handy basket.    Or you could take along a Halfords 40 Litre Mains and 12V \u0026amp 24V Electric Coolbox (above), which is now \u0026pound85 (save \u0026pound25). It can be powered either from 240V mains or by a 12V in-car or 24v in-truck cigarette plug and will keep your food and drink supplies nice and chilled.

The rodents are swarming in their numbers to gnaw at discarded sandwiches, chips and whatever else they can find that has left by holidaymakers basking in the glorious sun. The heatwave baking Britain has also meant fruit has ripened faster and food rubbish is being warmed for the rats. Now experts have warned the number of the rodents has risen alarmingly in recent weeks as the sunshine becomes the perfect breeding ground for them.  Prof Steve Belmain, from the University of Greenwich, told The Sun : “The increased warmth is increasing their activity.  When it’s warmer they have a higher metabolism and will need more food and water just to survive. People are outdoors more and, the more we picnic, the more food waste we create.”  And he warned: “Rodents are known to transmit more than 60 different diseases. “More diseases are coming from Europe. Climate change increases temperatures which means those diseases could establish themselves here in time.” Meanwhile, pest controllers are receiving an higher than usual number of calls for this time of the year, as vermin invade homes. Kevin Higgins, from The British Pest Control Association (BPCA), said: “As the warmer weather takes hold, the number of call-outs for mice and rats normally drops, as the rodents move away from the warmth and shelter of homes and outbuildings to outdoor environments. “However, this year we are seeing no evidence of that, with our members saying that call-outs to deal with rodents are continuing in the summer months. “It seems they are staying indoors in commercial and domestic properties and the volume of calls being received is highly unusual for this time of the year and while we cannot be sure exactly what the cause is for this, it is something we are looking closely into. He added: One theory is that there is a good deal of fruit around this year due to the warm weather and that rats and mice don’t have to travel as far as usual to feed.  And it\u0027s not just rats that are thriving in the sunshine, wasps are also becoming a cause for concern for some, the BPCA says, with numbers rising significantly and \u0027exceeding expectations.\u0027 Mr Higgins added: Wasps get giddy on the fruit, it makes them slightly inebriated, and this is when they are most likely to sting.  Meanwhile, the Met Office has warned temperatures could reach 37C in some parts of the country tomorrow - making it the hottest July day ever.

They can make a huge difference and many of us now have them on the go from the moment we walk through the door. But experts have advised people to turn off their fans today - because it\u0027s actually going to be TOO HOT. Yep, that\u0027s actually a thing. Using your fan today could terrifyingly actually make your room even hotter - if that\u0027s even possible.  According to the Government\u0027s heatwave plan, electric fans only work if it\u0027s less than 35C. This is because when it gets that hot fans just blow hot air directly on people, which makes them even hotter rather than cooling them down. Quoting research from the Cochrane Review, the plan states: Use of fans at temperatures above 35C fans may not prevent heat related illness. Additionally fans can cause excess dehydration).  The advice is to place the fan at a certain distance from people, not aiming it directly on the body and to have regular drinks.  This is especially important in the case of sick people confined to bed. Temperatures are set to continue rising and the Met Office forecast states Friday could be the hottest day ever recorded in the UK. The all-time UK high is 38.5C which was set in August 2003. The Met Office has issued a warning for people to stay inside, check their elderly neighbours are coping with the heat, and keep windows closed during the day.

The 22-year-old was convicted of sexual assault in 2016 in a case which sparked national outrage after he was jailed for just three months. Turner was convicted of three counts of felony sexual assault after Swedish exchange students discovered him “aggressively thrusting” on top of a half-dressed, intoxicated woman outside a Stanford fraternity party in 2015. He is now appealing that conviction. Attorney Eric Multhaup, representing Turner, told a California appeals court in San Jose that Turner’s conviction should be overturned due to lack of evidence and that the former swimmer only wanted \u0027outercourse\u0027.  \u0027Outercourse,\u0027 his lawyer Multhaup explained to the three justices, is sexual contact while fully clothed, reports the East Bay Times. Turner is required under a state law to register as a sex offender for the rest of his life because of his conviction on the charge of attempting to rape an intoxicated person. On Tuesday Mr Multhaup tried to convince the justices to overturn the attempted rape charge, arguing there was not sufficient evidence for the jury to find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. However the justices appeared skeptical of his argument. The panel has 90 days - until late October -to issue a ruling. Assistant Attorney General Alisha Carlile argued that Mr Multhaup had presented a “far-fetched version of events”. The Stanford law school professor who led the campaign to recall Judge Aaron Persky following Turner\u0027s lenient sentence said the 22-year-old had a chance to make that argument at trial, but did not.

His blond fringe was completely uneven in the middle, I have no idea how my dad even let him leave the hairdressers looking like that. I was furious, it looked like the hairdresser had used a bowl to cut around his head. I only wanted him to have a little trim and he ended up looking like the character Lloyd.

Social media have heaped praise on the five-year-old girl - calling her stunning and a living doll after a professional photographer shared her portrait. Last Friday, photographer Mofe Bamuyiwa posted three photos of the young girl named Jare, saying: “Oh yes she’s human! She’s also an angel! and children are a gift from heaven. The little girl shows no hint of shyness in the distinctive portraits where she looks straight into the camera and shows off her skillful poses.  Fans gushed over the images on Instagram commenting simply gorgeous, soo beautiful and absolutely stunning. Mofe reportedly works as a lifestyle and wedding photographer in Lagos, Nigeria. Despite Jare\u0027s obvious confidence Mofe told Yahoo Lifestyle: “Jare isn’t a professional model.  She has two sisters - Jomi, 7, and Joba, 10 - who also model and have their own instagram page. Although not everyone was a fan. Some people couldn\u0027t believe the images were real and asked if photoshop was used or the girl was given a wig. Jare isn\u0027t the first girl to take Instagram by storm at such a young age. French supermodel and actress Thylane Blondeau, 17, first made a name for herself at just four years old modelling for Jean Paul Gaultier.   Two years later, aged six, she graced the page of fashion-bible vogue and her blond her and blue eyes made her a global superstar.  The photo earned her the original title of the \u0027most beautiful girl in the world\u0027 and she is now a regular on runways across the world. Meanwhile, six-year-old Anna Knyazeva, from Russia, has attracted over 1.2 million fans on Instagram thanks to her model-looks.

Definitely not.“I think this was to do with the changes we had to make and because we didn’t keep the ball in the front and be more simple.“Nicky Clark was tired and James Keatings has just come back from an injury so he got tired. After that our attacking game was not there.“But I want a team who is ready for Dunfermline, that is ready for the league. We have the two weeks and we go now for the next level.”And Csaba was quick to point out United have not been the only team to have problems in these early season fixtures.“I have watched the results and every big team is struggling. You are not there where you want to be at the moment. This is not an excuse but it is true. If you train every week two times daily you see that legs are tired.

The first is my collections of jewellery which I design and make to be distributed to the shops that stock my designs up and down the country.“The second is my bespoke pieces.“This is where someone comes in with a design in mind or with a piece they want to be remodelled.“With my bespoke designs it is much more fun as I can be a bit more creative.“It can be a big responsibility as a lot of the time someone is grieving over the loss of a loved one and they want a piece to remember them by or they want a piece of their loved one’s jewellery reworked.“You can’t change it back, so it can be quite nerve-racking.“I have also incorporated people ashes into designs, so it can be a very emotional journey with my customer.“It is lovely that I can really help customers after the passing of a loved one with a piece that is incredibly sentimental.“The third part is teaching.“I have held workshops since the beginning. I think it makes the pieces more sentimental when someone has made the ring themselves.”After taking the plunge to work on her business full time only a year ago, Scarlett has urged anyone else in the same position to take that leap into self employment.“This business is my life and I love it. It is hard and scary to take that step but I am so glad I did it. I can really put my heart and soul into my pieces now.“I should have done it way sooner.”Scarlett’s workshops allow couples to have a personal touch at their wedding.A growing number of couples are visiting her studios to create their wedding rings – and some of those ready to get down on one knee are even coming to create a bespoke engagement ring for their other half.Scarlett said: “The workshops are incredibly popular and weddings are becoming a lot more DIY with couples wanting to be more hands on.“I love being part of the love story of making their rings.“We also hold hen parties a lot and brides love to come in and make matching silver rings with their bridesmaids.“It is a lot of fun.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people spar customers raise cash for good causes","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe Spar store on Ballindean Road in the Douglas area of Dundee has been raising funds for a number of local good causes, including Brown Street Kennels, The Crescent in Whitfield and seven-year-old Garvie Winter, who is being treated for leukaemia.Kirsty Laing, from the store, said: “We do quite a lot of different things in the shop to raise money.“We sell a lot of books, mostly for 50p, which are really popular and we also get a lot of little things from customers who want to sell them to raise funds too.

It has completely blighted the community and many homes are now unsaleable.\"He said the proposed expansion would bring the substation boundary within 30 yards of the nearest property, and 75 yards of his home.He added: \"SSE refuses to acknowledge any fault or offer compensation of any kind.\"There appears to be no clearly established legal obligation for SSE to compensate, but there is a moral one, considering the substantial financial loss suffered by the residents and the spoiling of a peaceful rural atmosphere.\"He added that the planning authority, Highland Council, has expressed little interest in helping them.Mr Lanning said that in February he was forced to take his house off the market after a year because he could not sell it at \u0026pound40,000 below the market value.The substation began growing to accommodate the Beauly to Denny power line and the new renewable energy sources in the surrounding hills.Pensioner Mr Lanning, who has lived in the glen for 11 years, said: \"The substation has been enlarged about four times.\"There are liaison meetings but they are simply PR exercises.\"This is not just about me. The other residents are my friends and we are all in the same boat.\"A spokeswoman from SSE said: \"Our proposal has been developed in close consultation with the local community and other stakeholders based on a range of economic, environmental and technical considerations.\u0026nbsp\"As a responsible developer, we have listened carefully to the feedback during consultation, and to minimise the visual impact of the extension, we are proposing a gas-insulated switchgear solution, which significantly reduces the footprint of the site.\"We have also purchased additional land to allow for enhanced screening and bunding to further mitigate the visual impact.\"We remain committed to working constructively with the local community.\"She added that there have been two public consultations, and SSE also facilitate a dedicated community\u0026nbspliaison group in the area where senior management and project teams are on hand to engage directly with residents to address any concerns raised.A detailed planning application has been lodged and a council planning decision is expected in September.A Highland Council spokeswoman said: \"Our decision will take into account all

according to a trade union.The GMB represents most of the hospital\u0027 security staff.It has calculated the sum on the number of hours that high-ranking, highly paid NHS officials have dedicated to the discussions.There have been nine meetings to date.Three more are scheduled to follow.The board has hit back, insisting that \"organisational change is managed within existing resources\".Such a reason is regularly given by public bodies when questioned about the use of staff time that is clearly beyond their regular, scheduled\u0026nbsp duties.The union has complained that morale among security staff is low while general staff safety has become an increasing concern at the north of Scotland\u0027 largest hospital.It is furious that the lengthy review of staff cover within the security department was apparently prompted \"because an ex manager has the view that the guards don\u0026rsquot have enough work to do\".The GMB\u0027 regional officer Liz Gordon calculates that the process has so far cost taxpayers \u0026pound7808.34.It prompted her to ask: \"How many operations would that pay for?\"Ms Gordon said: \"The security staff cover a 32-acre site and have an increasingly challenging job.\"The statistics show that aggression and the threat of violence is escalating not diminishing.\"It\u0027 suspected that the board want to save money by getting security guards to undertake more of the work done by the porters, and vice versa.\"Equally, nursing is going to be expected to call upon the security guards less frequently and, therefore, do more themselves.\"She added: \"Police Scotland will be looked upon as a resource but their new triaging system will prevent this.\"Portering is literally run off its feet.\"It is covering an average of 22,000 steps per eight-hour shift \u0026ndash that\u0027 11 miles \u0026ndash and is often in crisis being reduced to single-man working.\"A spokeswoman for NHS Highland attempted to dismiss all the

complete the lengthy application process in time or find the \u0026pound559 required for a public entertainment licence. She said: \"Everything for kids is so expensive nowadays, I thought we could have some good old fashioned fun on the beach and bring a few families together.\"The idea was for the kids to have an hour to make their sandcastles, they would all get stickers and we would get someone local to judge the best ones.\"She had thought that parents would simply mind their own children, but Highland Council told her she would have to provide formal first aid cover and explain fully how the event would impact other beach users.As Mrs Cowie-Mcinnes had advertised the event on social media and circulated flyers around the town, she was worried she might have to call the whole thing off: \"I was panicking when I got the email through, thinking I might need to cancel it and the kids were already excited.\"There is too much red tape and so many barriers to get through to run an event, people will end up giving up.\"Unsure of how to save the event, she took to the Nairn Rocks social media page to ask people for advice.And as a result, Fochabers firm Saltaire Security offered their services for free and provided a copy of their own public liability insurance certificate to Highland Council.There were also offers to provide lifeguard cover and Nairn Business Improvement District also came forward to say it would help.In the end, Highland Council agreed to waive permission fees.\"It couldn\u0026rsquot have gone ahead without the security company and everyone else who is helping for free,\" said Mrs Cowie-Mcinnes, who has also been delighted at the offers of prizes from local businesses.Weather permitting, the event will now go ahead on Sunday with registration taking place from 10am at Nairn Links for categories ranging from pre-school through to teenagers and adults.A spokeswoman for Highland Council said a public entertainment licence was required for the use of either indoor or outdoor premises for certain types of events.Thursday 26 Jul 2018 12:34

taken from the murky waters of Loch Ness and sent to Hull so that the DNA can be extracted.It is all part of a Kiwi scientist\u0027 plan to finally answer the question of whether Nessie is real.Neil Gemmell, geneticist and professor at the University of Otago in New Zealand, visited the Highlands with a team of specialist scientists to collect the water samples in June.The Super Natural History Team will then study the samples in bases around the world for signs of DNA.Mr Gemmell is satisfied that the collection process went well.\"All is going to plan but it is too early for any results,\" he said.He believes it will be late in this year or the beginning of next before they have any revelations.Once the DNA has been extracted in Hull the samples will be sent on to France and Switzerland to get the sequence data \u0026ndash the digital breakdown of all the DNA found.\"From there the data goes all over the world,\" Mr Gemmell added.He has previously admitted that while he does not believe in the Loch Ness Monster he is \"open to the idea of something unusual living in the loch\".The team used specialist equipment and boats to take samples up to 200m below the surface.The

project.\u0026nbspIf approved by councillors, it will consist of patterned sculptural stepping stones made of granite, sitting in a stainless steel channel or lade.Water from the river will feed into this channel where some of the stones will be fitted with moveable sluice gates to allow children to control the flow of water themselves.The plan is for it to be located in the middle of the Ness Islands at a spot already popular with families.The proposal is just one element of the River Ness Public Art Project, worth a total of \u0026pound727,000.Inverness Provost Helen Carmichael was yesterday hopeful that the concept would find favour with councillors on Highland Council\u0027 south planning committee, especially since local schoolchildren had been consulted on what they would like to see there, and Inverness College UHI design students had input on the concept.She said: \"Children were very involved along with students at the university. Children love jumping from stone to stone and guddling about in water.\"It has all been looked at from the safety point of view, but let\u0027 face it, if you take children to the beach they jump from stone to stone. I think it is a good project and if necessary I will be the first to dip my toe in the water there.\"Inverness city manager David Haas said: \"This has had youth engagement all along and I think it is something that is going to sit well in the environment of a place that will become even more popular as people engage with the river.\"Masterminding the project is Bespoke Atelier, a Glasgow-based design studio.Its design statement, which will be discussed at a planning meeting later this summer, explains the lades and weirs already around the River Ness were used as inspiration. The stones would be patterned, partly to minimise slips and also to reflect foliage patterns from trees growing on the islands.A report from Inverness City Artworks Group states: \"While it was preferable to use natural stone, the cost might prove prohibitive and alternative materials might need to be considered.\"It was also minuted that if concerns were raised regarding the cost of this feature, the high cost of \"providing basic play equipment should be highlighted.\"The group was given assurances that the design would, when completed, look like part of the landscape, and members were told that Bespoke Atelier was confident that all aspects of the design could be met within the available budget.Path improvements in the vicinity are included in the application.Company director Yvonne Elliot-Kellighan said the stepping stone forms envisaged were inspired by the shape of the Ness Islands, and the stones themselves could be engraved with botanical patterns \"creating a ow and connection between stepping stones\".The children\u0027 feature is not far from MY Ness, a \u0026pound300,000 centrepiece which was unveiled as a concept in May and has still to receive planning permission.The River Ness Public Art Project is funded by Creative Scotland (\u0026pound305,000), Inverness Common Good Fund (\u0026pound250,000), HIE (\u0026pound66,000) and Highland Council (\u0026pound106,000).At a time of heightened concern about public spending, Highland Council has stressed that the vast majority of the money for the projects comes from third parties and cannot be used for other purposes, and the council\u0027 \u0026pound106k is from capital investment and not revenue spend.Thursday 26 Jul 2018 12:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116731.jpg","title":"New cinema proposed for the Black Isle","story":"\u0026nbspA THRIVING film society on the Black Isle looks set to take its next big step after plans were submitted for a permanent cinema to cater for growing demand.The brand new cinema, which would be located on the seafront in Cromarty, will cater to Cromarty and Resolis Film Society events and serve as a base for the town\u0027 increasingly popular annual film festival.Cromarty Estate, which owns the land, has lodged the application in partnership the film society, which would act as its tenant.The plans feature two key elements. The first is the cinema, which would be built on land close to the ferry slipway and next to an existing boat storage shed.The cinema would seat roughly 30 people and host weekly screenings throughout the year, rising to twice a week in the summer. It would also be used to help house Cromarty\u0027 growing film festival, which attracts fans and famous faces from across the country late every autumn.Cromarty Estate also plans to build an office hub alongside the cinema in a bid to cater for growing business demand in the town.In a supporting statement submitted by the estate alongside its application, its agents said: \"A dedicated cinema space will allow screening all year which currently is not possible using existing buildings with poor black out facilities.\"The cinema may also be available for other users to hire for screenings, presentations and lectures.\"They added that the cinema would also \"ideally\" feature an outdoor area \"for summer screenings and festival events\".Making the case for new office space in the town, the estate said: \"Cromarty has a thriving entrepreneurial community but this is not matched by suitable office accommodation with the result that many find themselves having to move their business bases from Cromarty to Dingwall, Tore or Inverness when they outgrow their own homes, with the resulting loss of employment opportunities in the town.\"Addressing this need... will make Cromarty a more balanced and sustainable community.\"In a statement supporting the application, the film society said that a survey of Cromarty residents found that 82 per cent backed a cinema in the town and the same number would go to more screenings if the venue was better than what is currently on offer.Justifying the decision to proceed with an all-new site for the cinema, the estate\u0027 agents said the site\u0027 position close to adequate parking and its location away from homes were both positives, as was the existing vehicle access from the harbour.The buildings would feature dark metal cladding to the walls of the cinema, with timber cladding on the office hub.If the plans are approved construction could start as early as spring next year.Thursday 26 Jul 2018 12:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116735.jpg","title":"Pamiloo to make its first visit to Black Isle Show","story":"\u0026nbspCAMPAIGNERS have welcomed news that accessible toilets will be installed at this year\u0027 Black Isle Show \u0026ndash allowing people with complex needs to enjoy the event.Fiona MacLeod-Chiarini, whose brother Ewan MacLeod is severely disabled, contacted the show\u0027 organisers to ask about the availability of a Pamiloo (right), a mobile facility for those with profound impairments.Rod Mackenzie, the Black Isle Show\u0027 company secretary, immediately got in touch with the charity Promoting a More Inclusive Scotland (Pamis), which owns the Pamiloo, in order to make the event accessible for the family.Mrs MacLeod-Chiarini hailed the move, and believes facilities such as the Pamiloo can be life-changing.She said: \"We are absolutely delighted that the Black Isle Show have taken our concerns on board and have booked the Pamiloo.

It is not like a normal situation where if you concede at home and then score for 1-1 it is all square.“That is not the case as your opponent has that advantage with the away goal.“That is something we really need to focus on and try to make sure we get that clean sheet at Pittodrie.”For McKenna the Battle of Britain offers an opportunity to prove the strength of the Scottish game to any doubters in England.He said: “Maybe south of the border they don’t realise how good the standard is.“This is a chance for us to go and really showcase ourselves and put in two good performances against good opposition.”Burnley’s pre-match preparations were thrown into chaos as their chartered flight to the Granite City was delayed due to technical issues with their aeroplane.McKenna does not anticipate any delay in the Premier League outfit delivering the ball into the Reds’ box.“By all account Burnley like to get the ball forward early, which is something we will have to deal with,” he said.“Burnley are maybe not your typical English team that puts in abut 50 passes and then gets a cross in the box.“They might try and go direct.“Whatever way they come at us we will be ready for any situation.”Dons boss Derek McInnes was at Deepdale earlier this week to watch Burnley defeat Preston North End 3-2.He has formulated a game plan for tonight that McKenna insists can pay off if the Reds, to a man, carry it out.He said: “We are expecting a very good team as Burnley didn’t finish seventh in the English Premier League last season for no reason.“We will need to show them respect but go into the game fully prepared.“The manager has got us fully set up on what he wants us to be and if we carry that out we will give ourselves a chance.”McInnes secured Watford centre-back Tommie Hoban on loan yesterday before the 11pm UEFA deadline to register new signings.However, the central defensive partnership is likely to be McKenna and Mikey Devlin, who played together in the 1-1 friendly draw with West Brom on Friday.McKenna said: “We are strong at the back now.“The West Brom game was a good test for us and bar the goal they didn’t really have a shot on target.“We were quite solid.“Andy (Considine) is available after his concussion so there is a lot of strength and experience in the defence.”The closest McKenna, who captained Scotland against Mexico this summer, has come to Euro action so far was a place on the bench in the 1-1 draw against Bosnian’s Siroki Brijeg at Pittodrie last season. Now he is one of the first names on McInnes’ starting team sheet.He said: “European football is something that I have always wanted to be involved in.“I had been on the bench once before in Europe so to get my first appearance would be brilliant.”Burnley finished seventh in the English top flight to qualify for Europe.That surprise high league finish secured a Premier League payment of £198m. The bookmakers rate Burnley favourites to progress to set up a third qualifying round clash with Turkish side Istanbul Basaksehir.However, despite the Dons’ underdog status, McKenna’s aspirations for his debut campaign at European level have not altered.Asked if the group stages remain the target, he replied: “Yes, definitely.“However, we will take it game by game – starting with Burnley at Pittodrie.“First of all we need to try to get a clean sheet and a positive result to take down to Turf Moor next week.“We need to get through this round first and if do that the next one will take care of itself.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"mcinnes targets home clean sheet but says its not be all and end all","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFired up boss Derek McInnes has the belief the Dons can knock out Premier League Burnley but admits it will take two huge performances to overturn the odds in their Euro show-down.Aberdeen host the Clarets in the Europa League second qualifying round first leg at a packed Pittodrie tonight.The Turf Moor outfit are the bookmakers favourites to progress from the Battle of Britain to secure a clash against Istanbul Basaksehir in the next round.However, McInnes is confident his Reds can rise to the occasion.He said: “The target is to bring a strong performance tonight and ultimately get through the tie.“We believe we can.“But it is going to have to take a lot of things to go our way and two big performances from our team.“We will certainly do all we can to do that.”McInnes accepts a fundamental component of progressing in Europe is a clean sheet at home.Aberdeen have conceded at Pittodrie in six of their last seven European ties.He today challenged the Reds to achieve what English giants Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea failed to do last season – keep a clean sheet at home against Burnley.He said: “It ( a clean sheet) is important, although it is not the be all and end all as we back ourselves to create chances and score.“I always find in Europe that when we have kept a clean sheet at home we have always won our game.“When we have went into the later rounds and been put out it is normally the goal we have lost at home that has inflicted the biggest pain and impacted on the outcome.”McInnes expects a physical, British-style game against a side that finished seventh in the English top flight to secure a Euro slot.He said: “Burnley are the type of team who really impose themselves on the opposition so it will be a tough game.“They have good players and a great understanding of each others’ roles.“Burnley have a good physicality and any team that can gain European qualification from the English Premier deserves the utmost respect.“They are a good side and we have a tough game on our hands.“But it is equally important Burnley see us exactly the same way and realise they have been in a game.”McInnes bolstered his defence with the signing of Watford centre-back Tommie Hoban on a season-long loan before the UEFA deadline to register new signings at 11pm last night.Former Partick Thistle keeper Tomas Cerny also joined yesterday on a season-long deal.Despite the addition of Hoban, there could yet be a deal earned by on-loan Polish centre-back Krystian Nowak.The 24-year-old ex-Hearts man will feature in Sunday’s friendly at Abroath.McInnes said: “Krystian’s in an unfortunate situation where the game with Inverness was cancelled and he was supposed to start.“He was supposed to play 45 minutes against Cove Rangers but the game was abandoned.“We have not really had the opportunity to see him in action, although he got 20 minutes or so against West Brom.“We have invited Kyrstian to stay with us this week and play in the game on Sunday.“Then we will sit down and make a call on that after the game.”The need for defensive cover increased with centre-back Mark Reynolds yesterday undergoing surgery on a knee injury sustained against Cove Rangers.McInnes said: “Mark was in Glasgow yesterday getting an operation on his knee.“We are fearing he may well be out for a considerable amount of time based on some of the evidence we have.“It is disappointing for us and Mark.”The Dons welcome back Niall McGinn (thigh strain) and Andy Considine (concussion) for tonight’s clash.McInnes said: “Scott Wright missed training on Tuesday with a little knee complaint, but we are hoping he is going to be okay.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"new back up stopper cerny knows role and says hes delighted","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNew Dons signing Tomas Cerny admits he is a realist and is only at Pittodrie as back up to No.1 Joe Lewis.The 33-year-old Czech Republic stopper has signed a one-year deal and will be on the bench tonight for the Euro clash with Burnley.Dons boss Derek McInnes recently admitted securing a keeper before the UEFA registration deadline at 11pm last night was not a priority.However, that changed following a knee injury sustained by keeper David Craddock in the Dons’ reserves’ 3-2 friendly win at Inverurie Locos on Monday evening.Cerny was a free agent having left relegated Partick Thistle at the end of the season.Cerny said: “I am realistic.“Joe is arguably the best goalkeeper in the country at the moment and has had two brilliant seasons for Aberdeen.“My role is to work Joe and push him as hard as I can in every training session to support him so that he can be at his best.“However, at the same time to be 100% ready to step in if required and do my very best for the team.”Following the injury to Craddock, the Dons needed goalkeeping back up as Danny Rogers joined St Mirren on a season-long loan.Cerny spent three years at Partick and had five seasons at Hamilton from 2007-12 before joining CSKA Sofia.Cerny said: “Everything happened very quickly and it was Tuesday afternoon at 5pm I was asked if I could make a medical for eight that night.“I am really excited to be with Aberdeen as it is a great club.“There was a couple of times when I was linked and was gutted when things didn’t work out but finally I am here so I am excited and happy.”Cerny suffered relegation from the Premiership with Partick Thistle last year.After his contract expired he opted to remain in Scotland.He said: “I have a Scottish family, my wife is Scottish and our son was born here so I do feel half Scottish.“As a family staying in Scotland was our preference.“Aberdeen is a club with a great history and have been really successful under their current manager.“It is a great opportunity to be here.“It (relegation) still hurts as we had two very good seasons and finished top six in the second I was there.“Everyone at the club was really excited and thought it would progress forward.“But that last season didn’t work out at all and it is something that still hurts a lot.”Cerny made 25 starts for Partick Thistle last season and has racked up more than 150 starts in the Scottish top flight with both Partick and Hamilton.He said: “Things were a bit quiet over the last week or so with regards to potential moves.“The decision to stay in Scotland really narrowed down the options of where I could sign.“When that call (from Aberdeen) came it was out of the blue and very unexpected.“I am absolutely delighted to be here.“Burnley is a massive game for the club and it will be great to be part of it.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/pressandjournal/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/07/BOABERDEENBlack.jpg ","title":"win a beoplay m5 wireless speaker with bang olufsen

shopping centre.Developer Rockspring lodged an application last year to create an extension linking Union Street with Aberdeen Indoor Market.Planners said the extension could make the site more attractive to retail occupiers.The plans are the latest in a series of applications submitted by the firm to revamp the Aberdeen Indoor Market and former BHS building as a modern retail space.In their report, planners approved the extension subject to conditions.They said there would be “slight tension” with council policy due to the loss of original building fabric within the Union Street conservation area, but added the extension has otherwise been “suitably designed” and the wider character of the conservation area would be preserved.It said: “The extension would potentially allow a retail unit on Union Street to be more attractive to current or future occupiers.”It would link the buildings on 81 to 85 Union Street on to the East Green/ Aberdeen Market building. Planners said no work should take place unless a scheme detailing how the reuse of the granite block work removed from the building has been approved by the local authority.An earlier design statement for the wider proposals said the redevelopment would see an “under-utilised, unloved building” revitalised into a “vibrant retail space”.Under the plans, new shopfronts will be introduced on The Green and Market Street with the intention of providing better pedestrian access.Rockspring has also submitted plans to re-configure buildings at 101-103 Union Street to allow for retail uses, a residential development and a cafe.The proposals indicate the development could include bar and restaurant uses as well as retail.A spokeswoman for Rockspring said: “We’re very pleased that Aberdeen City Council has granted planning approval for this prominent city centre site.“We are now exploring all the options open to us and are in ongoing dialogue with Aberdeen City Council with a view to creating a sustainable development that we can all be proud of.”\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":"//content.assets.pressassociation.io/2018/07/26083446/1b52eb61-0179-4148-a470-46fe24f74358.jpg ","title":"explosion reported outside us embassy in beijing","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn explosion outside the US embassy in Beijing was caused by a small homemade device wielded by a 26-year-old man who only injured himself, according to Chinese police.Photos on social media showed a large amount of smoke and police vehicles surrounding the embassy after the incident.

We did well and we were well organised.“We defended well but offensively we could have done better and that is a part of the game we are still working on.“We still need to get guys like Derek Lyle and Rory McAllister, who has an ankle knock, up to speed.“We are getting there but defensively it was a really good performance against a very good Dundee side.“We looked out on our feet against Stirling Albion on Saturday but tonight we looked fresher and we now have 10 days until we start the league campaign with a home game against Queen’s Park.”The result saw Peterhead finish bottom of their section with just the two points they collected from the goalless draw and bonus point at Brechin City’s Glebe Park.They were without suspended midfielder, dead-ball expert Willie Gibson. Dundee, who were more or less at full strength, were also looking to make amends for Sunday’s 1-0 home cup defeat at the hands of Dunfermline Athletic.In the seventh minute only a timely tackle by Peterhead’s Jack Leith on Mendy, just as the striker was about to pull the trigger on the edge of the box, averted the danger.At the other end Dundee keeper Elliot Parish did well to divert a close-range Russell McLean effort round the post for a fruitless corner kick.The visitors continued to press, Sofien Moussa managed to get in a back-post header but he was falling backwards when making contact and Fleming in the Peterhead goal gathered the ball with ease.In the 34th minute Ross Kavanagh had a chance to score the Blue Toon’s first goal of the competition but he shot straight at Parish from just inside the box.Then a strong run by Kavanagh, after he had been fed by Rory McAllister, caused a moment of panic in the visitors defence until giant central defender Steven Caulker booted the ball to safety.Mendy shot wide in the first minute of the second half but the opener for the visitors was only delayed by three minutes when Paul McGowan played in Madianga, who gave Fleming no chance with a rasping 15-yard shot.And, ten minutes from time, Peterhead assistant manager Davie Nicholls was sent to the stand, apparently for remarks made to the stand-side assistant referee.Two minutes into injury time, Mendy made it 2-0 with a simple finish.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"locke to go professional following silver medal success at carnoustie","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNorth-east teenager Sam Locke has announced his decision to join the professional ranks after winning the Silver Medal at the 147th Open Championship.The 19-year-old from Stonehaven was the only amateur to make the cut at Carnoustie and went on to finish the week on nine over par.Locke carded rounds of 72, 73, 70 and 78 to finish as the highest-ranking amateur and Scot, leading him to make the decision on the back of his best career performance.Locke works part-time in the coffee shop at the Paul Lawrie golf centre in Aberdeen, and is a protege of 1999 Open champion Lawrie.He said: “I’ve decided to turn professional after winning the Silver Medal at the Open.“I just think for me, personally, it’s the right decision.“I’ve always wanted to turn pro and compete with the best players in the world on the biggest stage and this week’s kind of accelerated my decision.“I’ve always wanted to be a professional golfer from a young age.“I’ve always loved playing the game and competing and I just love the feeling of winning.“So I can’t wait to get going now – it’ll be good fun.”He added: “The decision to move in to the professional ranks is always something I’ve wanted to do.“It’s been a genuine goal of mine to play golf for a living for some time now.“My dad, Andrew, who caddied for me, is a PGA professional at the Paul Lawrie GC and obviously I have close ties to Paul Lawrie, so have an understanding of what it takes to be successful in the pros.“My experiences over the last week or so, since I won the Open qualifier at Renaissance and throughout last week, have allowed me to see things differently.”Lawrie added: “Winning the silver medal was hugely impressive and while this is just the beginning of the journey for Sam, I certainly think he’s ready to make the transition and I’ll be on hand to give him any advice he feels he may need along the way.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/06/18, 3:50 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.The last thing David MacInnes sees himself as is a hero.Be we believe differently.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 25","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 23/06/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Labour and the Lib Dems must recognise and respect the recent vote in the Scottish Parliament and the views of their Scottish colleagues who refused to give consent to the damaging Brexit legislation proposed at Westminster.Labour amendments to former clause 11 of the bill require consent of the Scottish Parliament unless a UK Minister ‘has reasonable grounds for believing that regulations are required for the purpose of giving effect to any international obligations’.It would be catastrophic for Scotland if Labour left the door open for the Tory Government to breach the devolution settlement.Leaving Holyrood exposed to powers taken without consent in any area connected to an international trade agreement would be disastrous. This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

His problems did not end there, though, as injury also ruled out Gordon Whyte, Thomas Whyte and Dunky Kerr although the latter was stripped as Kyles only substitute, while Robbie MacLeod was unavailable.Caberfeidh manager Jodi Gorski had Ally MacLennan back but he was also short of players, with Jamie Matheson and Colin MacLennan among his absentees and they lined-up with the Cabers with the second team.Kyles settled into the game with a goal on four minutes. There was a scramble in the goal area where Colin MacDonald fought for possession with Caberfeidh keeper Ewen Pilcher and defender Blair Morrison, and it was actually Luke Thornton who got the final touch to put the hosts ahead.Luke Thornton got Kyles and his second on eight minutes. Sandy MacKenzie played the ball across from the left wing forward position to Luke Thornton who smashed a shoulder-high volley past the Cabers keeper from 15 yards.Kevin Bartlett made it 2-1 on 13 minutes when he latched onto a loose ball in defence and carried the ball forward before thumping it past John Whyte from a central position.However Kyles restored their two-goal cushion on 42 minutes to make it 3-1 at the break. Former Skye Camanachd player Neil MacVicar, playing in attack, switched play from right wing forward to Sandy MacKenzie at left wing forward and he rifled the ball past keeper Pilcher from 18 yards.Grant Irvine got in on the act on 55 minutes. A ball forward from midfield was brought out of the air by Colin MacDonald, who slipped it out to the right wing forward position to the onrushing Grant Irvine, who swept the ball across the keeper into the right-hand side of the net.Sandy MacKenzie put gloss on the win with a rather fortuitous effort on 62 minutes. MacKenzie turned full back Blair Morrison and as keeper Pilcher came out to clear the ball, it rebounded off MacKenzie into the net.Donald Irvine was superb for Kyles, while Grant Irvine was an instrumental figure at full centre.Caberfeidh did not perform at the levels seen when they took shinty’s top flight by surprise in the earlier part of this season.\u0026nbspMarine Harvest South Division 1Title hopefuls the Kyles Athletic second team march on, beating Ballachulish 1-0 at the Jubilee Park.Balla’s Cain MacPhee was free of a one-match ban, while Kyles were without Luke Thornton who was on first team duty.The only goal of the game came on 19 minutes and it was a superb strike from Martin MacFadyen whose 25 yard piledriver from the middle of the park gave the keeper no chance.Balla’ had the chance to level on 35 minutes when referee Callum Duff awarded them a penalty, penalising a \u0026#8216kick\u0026#8217 inside the D.Lorne Brown took the penalty and he struck the ball well enough but his effort was superbly saved by Kyles keeper Douglas Nicolson. It was one of a number of great stops by the Kyles custodian.Kyles have a five point lead on second place Bute although they have played a game more.Bute 4 Bute scored three times in the final third of the game to defeat Aberdour 4-1 in their 12.30pm throw up at The Meadows.Bute’s Craig MacKay was unavailable as he served the second game of a two-match suspension.Aberdour travelled without Cameron McCue and David McDougal.James Craig gave Bute the lead after just five minutes and that proved to be the only goal of a tight first 45 minutes during which Bute goalie Kevin Queen saved well from David MacKenzie, tipping his effort over the bar.Referee Robert Baxter pointed to the penalty spot when Ruairidh Reid was wiped out inside the D, taking a stick across the knees, when he looked set to equalise. Angus Thorburn struck the penalty well but Kevin Queen made a brilliant save to keep his side in front.The visitors were awarded a second penalty shortly after when Roddy MacColl was felled inside the box. Angus Thorburn stepped up again but this time he did not catch the ball as he would have liked and his effort went past the post.The penalty misses were a blow for Aberdour and Bute took advantage and, with some good running and quick passing, they went on to score three more times.Robert Walker made it 2-0 on 65 minutes and Iain McDonald added a third with 15 minutes remaining.Chris Lawrence made it 4-0 on 80 minutes, although there was some consolation for Aberdour when Ruairidh Reid finished well a couple of minutes later. Angus Thorburn battled to get the ball to Reid and his powerful strike from just outside the D gave the keeper no chance.Bute were sharper on the day and they deserved the win but the final scoreline was a little harsh on Aberdour in what was only their second league defeat of the season.Bute now leap-frog Aberdour into second place in the league on goal difference and the Islanders have a game in hand.Kilmory 1 MacRae Park was in perfect condition to host the local derby between Kilmory and the Inveraray second team.A large crowd gathered to watch two teams filled with youth and experience.Kilmory started with top scorer Alister MacArthur in defence and they had young Andrew Innes up-front, supported by the more experienced Hal Jones.Inveraray went with a mature forward line which included Euan McMurdo, John MacKenzie and Neil Campbell but their back five were all aged under 18.But it was across the centre line where all the action happened in the first half.Referee Alex MacVicar had a busy afternoon and David Macpherson was first into the book for a cynical challenge on Sandy Leiper.It wasn’t long before Leiper joined him, yellow carded for a late swing on his fellow winger, young Ruaraidh Graham.Duncan MacBrayne was next to fall foul of the official for persistent fouling.In-between all the yellow cards, Alister MacArthur was dictating the play from the Kilmory defence, with young Hamish MacLennan doing the same for Inveraray and the first half ended scoreless.Inveraray came out the traps the quickest in the second half. A long range effort from David Macpherson was easily saved by the Kilmory keeper, but Neil Campbell was quickest to react and slot the rebound home to open the scoring on 48 minutes.Inveraray added a quick second following a well-worked set-piece routine on 56 minutes. Euan McMurdo’s free-hit found Campbell Watt, whose movement caused the Kilmory defence problems all afternoon, and he made 2-0 with fine finish.The goal sparked life into Kilmory who pulled one back on 65 minutes when Hal Jones blasted home an unstoppable shot from the edge of the penalty area to make it 2-1 and it was game on.After getting themselves back in the game, Kilmory’s discipline let them down soon after, with both Duncan MacBrayne and Sandy Leiper receiving their marching orders from referee MacVicar within minutes of one another.Inveraray capitalised on their two-man advantage and former Kilmory player David MacAllister scored his first goal for his new club on 69 minutes to make it 3-1.Euan McMurdo finished the day’s scoring off with a well-constructed goal to make it 4-1 with 15 minutes remaining.Inveraray will be happy with their league first win of the season, while Kilmory will be disappointed with the result and the fact that they will be missing two influential players over the weeks to come.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"graham love is leaving macpool","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/07/18, 2:20 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowGraham Love is moving on from Lochgilphead\u0026#8217s MacPool at the end of July.MacPool will be looking to recruit a new pool manager after the summer.

It is also the story of a family trying to reunite cousins on both sides of the Atlantic.Except this is not fiction. This is the mysterious story of James Campbell Hay Robertson, known as Jim, who was born and raised in Lochgilphead, and who was so determined to make a fresh start in America that he never saw or spoke to his Scottish family again.Why Jim would cut himself off from his family is something his granddaughter Morgan has been trying to find out and she has asked the Argyllshire Advertiser to help solve this mystery.James Campbell Hay Robertson was born in Lochgilphead and lived in Calman Villa in Ardrishaig. He was the son of the schoolmaster, a noted talent on the Lochgilphead football team and an aspiring doctor. Born in 1896, he had just turned 18 when the Great War began. He enlisted and, when the call for new officer candidates came, he signed up, becoming a \u0026#8216temporary gentleman\u0026#8217 rising to the rank of acting captain in charge of a battery of 4.5-inch Howitzers at the Ypres front. When the war ended, he spent six months in the army occupying Germany near Bonn.Jim was a smart boy, who loved his parents, and he was especially fond of his older sister Alexandria – a very talented pianist. She is often mentioned in the Advertiser as leading musical events in Lochgilphead, and was known as \u0026#8216Miss Lala Robertson\u0026#8217. According to Jim, she went off to study piano around 1910 in London or Edinburgh, but returned to Lochgilphead by the time the Great War broke out.After the war, Jim left for America and banished all of them from his life. It is here the mystery begins: what caused Jim to turn his back on his family and keep their existence hidden, from leaving Scotland in 1921 until his death in 1995 at the age of 99?Jim had a long and happy marriage and he and his wife Ruth had four boys who have grown up without extended family and under the impression that no relations existed in Scotland, which is not true. On a visit to Lochgilphead, Morgan found cousins in Furnace.Jim did share some clues about his family, but they were not all they seemed. He said his older brother William was in the Navy during the Great War, but had become an alcoholic, fallen overboard and drowned. This was not true. William\u0026#8217s signature was on their mother\u0026#8217s death certificate, signed in Aberdeen in 1943. William clearly lived a long life after Jim left Scotland and perhaps had his own family, themselves unaware of their American relatives.Jim\u0026#8217s telling of Alexandra\u0026#8217s story is even more tragic, saying she volunteered as a nurse in the war, fell in love with a South African soldier and left for Cape Town, only to die of food poisoning six months after arriving. This too was false, as the Advertiser\u0026#8217s obituary for their father in 1926 stated he \u0026#8216is survived by three children\u0026#8217, including Alexandra. Part of the story was true, however, as the Advertiser noted in 1920 that she married Henry Beck of Cape Town, in Dorset.Why Jim wanted to make a clean break with his family to such a degree he pretended his brother and sister had died will never be known. But it is possible his brother and sister lived long lives and had large families. Jim\u0026#8217s family in the United States now amounts to three surviving children, six grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.Jim\u0026#8217s father, William Robertson, came from a family of printers and dyers in Bonhill, Vale of Leven, and served as a schoolmaster from 1883 to 1920. He died in 1926, possibly in Kilmun, and, according to family records, was \u0026#8216buried in Dunoon\u0026#8217, but this may be another red herring from Jim.His mother, Wilhelmina, came from a farming family in Aberdeenshire. She moved to Lochgilphead in 1874 when she was 14, to live with her uncle, Alexander Cameron Robertson, the new minister of Lochgilphead Parish Church, a position he held for more than 50 years, from 1876-1933.There is one picture which could help crack part of the mystery. It shows Jim\u0026#8217s mother with two girls and appears to have been sent to him after his move to America. Part of the handwriting on the back is obscured but reads: \u0026#8216Hannan\u0026#8217s daughter, mom and myself taken last summer.\u0026#8217\u0026#8216Mom\u0026#8217 would refer to Jim\u0026#8217s mum, \u0026#8216myself\u0026#8217 the teenage girl whose age meant she could not be the daughter of Wilhelmina or the sister of Jim. Who was she and was she part of the story which caused Jim to cut himself off from his Scottish roots?If you have any information which could help solve this mystery please email the Argyllshire Advertiser editorial team at editor@argyllshireadvertiser\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"delighted scott reclaims toss title","story":"\t\tJoanne SimmsUpdated: 23/07/18, 12:00 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowScott Rider is once again World Caber Champion, after he had to toss for it at Inveraray Games on Tuesday.The former Commonwealth Games shot-putter and Olympic four-man bobsleigh team member won in 2013, 2014 and 2016.Judges at Winterton Park declared it was too close to call between the Englishman and Peter Bouma from Holland and it was down to a single toss of the caber each to decide the honour.The field of 10 was whittled down to a final five which also included Jamie Gunn, from Falkirk Lukasz Wenta, East Kilbride and Stuart Anderson, Lochearnhead.The event is sponsored by The George Hotel, Inveraray. Donald Clark from The George said: ‘It’s good on games’ day to see so many well-kent faces and to see new faces doing well in the games.’Once face missing from the games this year was the Duke himself he and his family are currently in India celebrating his 50th birthday.The honour of chieftain of the games was given to Rear Admiral John Weale OBE RASM, FOSNI, ACNS(SM) who heads the Royal Navy in Scotland and Northern Ireland.Amongst the guests this year was a contingent of members of the German branch of the Clan Campbell Society.More than 4,000 people attended the games the numbers held up well against other years and the visitors were rewarded with fine weather.They saw two records broken on the track this year: Jax Thoirs from Glasgow set a new open ground record for the long jump at 21 ft 7 inches and Aiden Quinn of Glasgow took the open hop, step and jump to 47ft 2½ inches.Numbers entering the solo piping contests were, like many other games, slightly down.

It was difficult to hold the bottom at times, however, we managed to hook into dab, plaice, grey gurnard, haddock and a good haul of thornback rays to bring our species tally for the day to five.All in all a decent day’s fishing given the rough conditions. We returned to harbour a tad battered and soaking wet.Day two was almost as windy as the first day, however the rain kept away which was a bonus.Conditions were still far too rough for fishing the deep so we started off on the soft ground for flats but the spurdogs had other ideas. Everywhere we went \u0026#8211 singles, doubles, trebles \u0026#8211 there was just no getting away from them despite Robbie’s best efforts.I have never seen so many chunky spurs, with the best of the day tipping the scales at 14lbs 8oz.Needless to say a fair number of rigs were wrecked, leads snagged and lost on the rough ground, and quite a few fish dropped. On the plus side there were a few PBs and a couple of new club records set.In between the spur attacks, we picked up a few decent dab, plaice, cod, grey gurnard, red gurnard and coalfish (coalies) to take our species count for the day to eight.Despite the rough and tumble we enjoyed the trip and the opportunity to catch some decent fish. Hopefully the weather will be kinder next year and we’ll get to drop a line out in the deep water marks which hold so many more species.The combined scores over two days:Nikki Thompson 185%***********************It was no surprise to find ourselves fishing in the pouring rain yet again. We don’t seem to have much luck weatherwise, but at least it was relatively calm out of Oban with only the slightest breeze.We headed out on board the ‘Laura Dawn’ in search of fresh bait but despite several drifts the mackerel eluded us.With the big tides, skipper Ronnie suggested we fish the rough ground and reefs for pollack and coalies. The plan was to play around here until the tide eased off enough to drop the anchor.It was pretty desperate though with only a few miniscule whiting to show for our efforts. The incredibly rough ground and fast drift were challenging to say the least and most of us left a fair amount of tackle and lead stuck fast to the seabed.Enough was enough, so we decided to head for deeper water and anchor up even though the tide was still pretty strong, resulting in some horrendous tangles.It proved to be a sensible move from a fishing point of view though, with reasonable sized spurs hooked on the very first drop. More spurs, spotty dogs and a couple of bonus thornbacks were taken throughout the afternoon.It was nip and tuck right to the end with just one fish separating the top three placing.Final scores:\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"rock from rest and be thankful be reused in new project","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 26/07/18, 10:07 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA new innovative method to help mitigate against potential landslips is being rolled out in Glen Kinglas near the Rest and be Thankful.The ongoing £1.84 million catch-pit works at the Rest and be Thankful involve digging and constructing three large ‘pits’ at the bottom of the slope that are designed to collect materials and run-off from a potential slip. The project has produced around 18,000 tonnes of usable rock, which has been stored temporarily, and designs have now been completed to reuse this material as additional protection for the A83.The material will be used in the construction of landslip mitigation bunds above streams along Glen Kinglas, some three to four miles from the Rest and Be Thankful. These bunds will form a constructed embankment of material initially across six individual water channels next to the roadside that geotechnical engineers have assessed to have the potential to deposit debris onto the trunk road should a landslip occur. The bunds will reduce the risk of debris reaching the roadside.The bunds will be up to 10 metres high in some sections and have the combined capacity to contain over 1,000 tonnes of debris should a landslip occur.Teams from BEAR Scotland have been working closely with the landowner and specialist sub-contractor to develop this sustainable approach to protecting the A83 for the long-term benefit of users of this important route.This sustainable method allows BEAR Scotland to maximise the benefit of the material being excavated from the Rest and be Thankful while minimising the overall cost of these works to the public purse via these projects which are being funded by Transport Scotland and the Scottish Government.As the works are focussed initially within six watercourse channels there will be short lengths of traffic management for approximately two to four weeks in each location. The A83 will remain open but it will be necessary for temporary traffic signals to be in place for the safety of road workers and road users.  The project will move in phases along this stretch of the A83 as the works progress.Real time journey information is available from Traffic Scotland on their website: trafficscotland.org\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert golf club is looking for players","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 26/07/18, 7:54 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowSort that swing because Tarbert Golf Club is holding its James Mundell memorial gents open.On Sunday August 5 players will compete at Glenralloch for various gross and net prizes between £20 and £60 and, of course, for the coveted James Mundell memorial trophy.So book your place for a chance to win.Tee off times are 7.50am to 9.10am, 10.45am to 12.05pm or 1.40pm to 2.50pm.To book, call 01880 820565 and entry fees are £15.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"teenie takes the title in myargyll","story":"\t\tSandy NeilUpdated: 26/07/18, 9:24 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA competition capturing #myargyll has been won by Teenie Wilson, an amateur photographer on the Isle of Lismore, who took this stunning image before an evening’s fishing at Port Ramsay, as the sun set over Glensanda quarry in Morvern.The competition, run in in association with Wyvex Media and Argyll and the Isles Tourism Co-operative, sought to recognise why you think our region is such a fantastic place to live, work and visit through photography, video and prose.Teenie, who runs the Lismore Post office and shop with her husband David, took up the hobby, which they share, two years ago.‘I love it,’ she said: ‘It gets me out. I take the camera wherever I go. I always keep my eye open for the right shot. With a good camera you can’t go wrong.’One summer evening last year, Teenie said their neighbour Duncan Black, a retired seaman, had asked if she wanted to go fishing. ‘I was waiting for him to bring the boat in,’ she recalled. ‘I thought it would make a great shot. We caught 40 fish that night. When I downloaded it, I thought ‘wow’.’‘Wow’ indeed, because it was voted the best from hundreds of brilliant photographs sent in by you – you can still enjoy them all by visiting #myargyll.‘I am chuffed,’ Teenie said. ‘I am not very confident in my own work \u0026#8211 everybody tells me they are good. This has given me a huge boost.’Thanks to her winning photograph, Teenie has won an autumn break for two on Islay, featuring an overnight stay at the Machrie Hotel, dinner and B\u0026ampB in Bowmore’s Harbour Inn, a tour of Islay’s newest distillery, Ardnahoe, a boat trip with Islay Sea Adventures, travel via Hebridean Airways, based at Oban Airport, a night at the Falls of Lora Hotel in Connel, and an Oban walking tour.Teenie said: ‘I am taking my sister, because she persuaded me to enter the competition.’Teenie also runs the island’s photography club and has just been awarded £1,000 to set up a junior one this winter.The runner-up was Alan Frew from Helensburgh.

The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"mayboles christmas celebrations in jeopardy","story":"NewsMaybole\u0027s Christmas celebrations in jeopardyThe community association organises a Christmas lights switch-on ceremony, as well the summer gala day.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post11:18, 25 JUL 2018NewsMaybole Christmas lights switch on (Image: David Kiltie)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe town’s Christmas celebrations will be in the ice box this year after a community group agreed to freeze itself for six months. Maybole Community Association will not meet again until January, by which time the festive fun will be over. The group organises a Christmas lights switch-on ceremony, as well the summer gala day. But members could not form a committee at an extraordinary general meeting (EGM). A statement issued after the meeting states: “Following the EGM held by Maybole Community Association on Thursday, July 12, 2018, regrettably no one came forward at the meeting prepared to be an office bearer, knowing that the present committee were standing down. “The decision was therefore made at the meeting for all activities of the association to be frozen and put on hold for a minimum period of six months and a maximum of 12 months and will be reviewed again at that time. “No business will be conducted during that timescale. This decision means that there will be no Christmas lights switch-on and potentially no gala next year.” Outgoing chairperson Senga Mason had been in her role for three years and took over after a similar committee crisis.  She said: “People didn’t come forward for the main committee roles and there’s far greater pressures on people’s time now than there was 40 years ago.” Mrs Mason’s connection to the group, founded in 1975, goes back to 1978. Maybole Gala Days in days gone by featured lorry floats and impressive bunting displays across the High Street. But Mrs Mason pointed out: “Health and safety rules meant the end of using lorries, which in any case are normally needed 24/7 by operators. “Even for simple things like bunting you need permits and a cherry picker to put it up. “Rules are in place for a reason and we have to abide by them.” Community association members are also upset at what they saw as unfair criticisms made on social media following this year’s Maybole Gala Day on June 9. A switch-on ceremony in Maybole can only now be saved if another group of volunteers steps forward. If the community association decides to wind up in January its assets - cash, tables, chairs and gazebos - would be dispersed to other groups in the town.

And United proved that underdogs can upset the odds by finishing sixth and leaving Aberdeen, Dundee United, Dundee and St Johnstone in their wake. It was a stunning effort but McSherry, who was signed by Ally MacLeod on a free from Kilmarnock, reckons Ayr can once again confound the pundits and enjoy a great season. United kick off the league at home to Partick Thistle on August 4 and midfielder turned publican McSherry expects them to be up for the challenge. He said: “Consolidation should be the aim but there is no reason why Ayr can’t rise again and enjoy the good times that we enjoyed in the 70s.” An old team picture that surfaced in McSherry’s Wee Windaes got punters rewinding the years and reliving past glories. It was taken at the start of season 1975-76 and showed Ayr in their change kit of Barcelona strips. Proudly standing tall are, back row – Davie Wells, Alex McAnespie, Ally MacLean, Hugh Sproat, Rikki Fleming, John Murphy. Middle row – Alex Ingram, Gerry Phillips, Johnny Graham, Johnny Doyle, Hugh Cameron, Jim McSherry. Front row – John Dickson, Danny MacDonald, Davie McCulloch.   Jim recalled: “No one could work out why the team weren’t in their usual black and white if it was an official  team picture.  “We were also puzzled why there were 15 players in it, including two goalkeepers. “Then one of my regulars, Stephen Robb, came up with the answer – it was taken before a pre-season friendly.  “We wore it in a 7-2 defeat at home to Celtic and it was never seen  again. I think it was binned as a bad omen.  “These were good times at Ayr and the team was loaded with some great players. “We were the only part-time team in the Top Ten and were quoted at 66/1, which seemed about right given the teams we were up against. “I remember Ally signing me on the wall at Central Station and then telling me to look out my passport. “He told me ‘You’re going on tour to Canada next week’. It was quite a start to my Ayr career.” Only three months into that season, Ally was lured to Aberdeen and replaced at the helm by Alex Stuart who quickly appointed McSherry as captain. Ayr sealed safety with a last-day 2-1 win over Motherwell, who were bossed by Willie McLean and Craig Brown. Gerry Phillips got a dramatic late winner to spark euphoric scenes at a packed Somerset. The second season of top-flight football saw Ayr again more than hold their own.  They finished eighth in the table on 30 points, three ahead of Hearts and a distant 13 more than rock-bottom  rivals Kilmarnock.  Season 1977-78 marked Ayr’s third campaign in the top flight, a remarkable achievement considering they stayed part-time. Robert Connor, Ian McAllister, Derek McCutcheon and Iain Sim were called up from Ayr United Boys’ Club. But Ayr were always up against it and their life in the Premier League ended when they finished second-bottom on 24 points and were relegated along with Clydebank. Now as a new league season beckons with renewed optimism and a totally full-time structure, it’s time to dream again.

Ayr United head to Firhill to take on Partick Thistle today knowing that a win will be enough to top the group and put them into the hat for the knockout stages. The Honest Men beat Morton 3-1 in their first group game before beating Albion 2-0 on Saturday. McCall’s side then hammered Stenhousemuir 5-0 at Somerset Park on Tuesday. And McCall, who will head to his old stomping ground on Saturday, said: “It’s a good game against a team in the same league as us. “They are fancied to be challenging for the league title, so it will be a good gauge for us to see where we are at. “I don’t think the game will have any similarities to the league opener though, but if there is a place up for grabs in the last 16 then we are going to go for it.” The Betfred Cup format has come under scrutiny from a number of players and managers involved in the game.  But McCall has gone against the grain and offered his support for the group stage style. He said: “I think it’s good and I like it. “I like the games that actually mean something, rather than meaningless friendlies which I hate. “With this format it means you only need three pre season friendlies. “And we have done well in the opening couple of games so that momentum will hopefully stick with us going into the league campaign.” Ross Docherty has been back in full training for the past week, with Chris Higgins set to join back up with the squad next week. •The Ayr United open day will take place this Sunday from 12pm. Fans are welcome to join the party at Somerset where they can meet their heroes amidst a whole host of fun events. The players and managers will be there along with a Stagedoor BBQ, Mancini’s ice cream and a kids v adults match to soak in, plus plenty of more fun activities.

Thirty of the 32 Scottish local authorities have at least one Citizens Advice Scotland centre. But South Ayrshire is believed never to have had the help and rights championing service. Inverclyde is the only other area which does not have a CAB. Now a summit has been staged within Ayr County Buildings to state a case for having the service here. The steering group of councillors met on July 12 and one source said: “There is a definite anomaly here and the question should be asked why there is not a citizens advice bureau here. “I believe need has never been greater, with increasing consumer debt and other problems.” Councils have a duty to provide the advice, but South Ayrshire Council use their own staff to give it. They work out of the Wallace Tower in Ayr, but critics insist that because they are not independent, the advice cannot be of supreme impartiality. The source added: “Often people are coming in to say they cannot pay council tax or rent. “So far from being not involved, the Council is in fact the creditor. “A push is on to finally set up a proper service for the people of South Ayrshire. “There are a lot of odd things about the South Ayrshire model, not least who is informing it on a national basis. “It is a mystery why South Ayrshire Council should or can be operating an advice centre. “They are conflating advice with information.” Citizens Advice Scotland is a registered charity, helping 300,000 people a year from a total of 61 centres. It is often a place of last resort for people having difficulties in their lives, including being weighed down by debt. And the organisation also lobbies for change in government policy where it has identified hardship being caused. All local Citizens Advice Bureaux are managed by an independent board of directors and all bureaux are members of Citizen’s Advice Scotland.  A South Ayrshire Council spokesman said: “We are committed to supporting our communities  and our people, particularly those in need.  “Through our Information and Advice Hub we already provide services which deal with income maximisation, debt and money advice and consumer information.” The umbrella body Citizens Advice Scotland refused to comment.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyrAyr NewsTaxes"},{"url":null,"title":"amythyst-set-to-sparkle-in-selkirk","story":"IN case you missed Amythyst Kiah\u0027s previous two headline slots at the String Jam Club, you have the opportunity to make it third time lucky.\nDescribing herself as a Southern Gothic, alt-country blues singer/songwriter, Amythyst is one of the most incredible singers the musically-savvy County Hotel audience has ever heard.\nBased in Tennessee, her commanding stage presence is only matched by her raw and powerful vocals -

Galashiels has been especially hard hit, with its proportion of vacant retail units now standing at 15% representing a total of 37 empty stores.\nHawick and Selkirk lag not far behind, with 14% apiece of their shops lying empty, and 13% of Jedburgh\u0026rsquos shops are also going spare.\nPeebles, Kelso, Duns, Melrose and Eyemouth have all kept their proportion of empty shops in their town centres at 8% or below, though.\nThe purpose of the town centre core activity area pilot study is to suggest updating the council\u0026rsquos planning policy in a bid to save the region\u0026rsquos high streets.\nIn it, lead planning officer Charles Johnston says: \u0026ldquoRetailing patterns continue to fluctuate, and the role of town centres is changing\u0026nbsp for example, the increase of online shopping and competition from larger national retailers.\n\u0026ldquoThe impacts of the current challenging economic climate are being felt across the country, and these trends are not unique to the Scottish Borders.\n\u0026ldquoPlanning policy must adapt to these changing circumstances.\n\u0026ldquoIn recent years, the council has amended its town centre policy in its local development plan to adapt to such changes, and whilst these changes have helped, it is acknowledged that a further review of relevant planning policy could be tested via this pilot study.\n\u0026ldquoThere are specific immediate concerns regarding Hawick and Galashiels, where reduced footfall and vacancy rates have had a detrimental impact on how these town centres have performed.\n\u0026ldquoThis is of particular concern as Hawick and Galashiels are the two largest towns within the Borders and have a strategic economic and social significance for the region.\nThe report recommends the council tries out pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels, either scrapping or altering their core activity area status marking out the boundaries of their commercial centres to allow a greater range of activity to take place within them.\nPlanning permission is usually only granted in such town centres if proposals are for business use in keeping with the surroundings of the sites in question,

recommends councillors to vote to abolish the core activity centre there altogether.\n\u0026ldquoReducing the core area completely would, in essence, allow a greater number of other uses within the

More of the same please.It was a good day for the Argyll favourites. A positive start which should continue at Kintyre Park against Pollock under 19s tomorrow with a 2pm kick off.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.

A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.

Angela revealed that Paul was a pupil at Musselburgh Grammar School when his condition was first diagnosed.  She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.  Paul hopes that his achievement will inspire others with illness and disabilities to follow their dreams and aspirations.  He said: \u0026ldquoTo graduate with a degree is massive. It took a while to get here from secondary school.  \u0026ldquoI am looking forward to returning to Napier for a year to do my Master\u0026rsquos Degree. They have given huge support.  Paul is hoping to get a job based in computer security once he finishes his studies."},{"url":null,"title":"archer-statue-comes-to-musselburgh","story":"  The work of art is one of two which now has pride of place in the Honest Toun after a \u0026pound76,000 cash boost from Tesco.  The other is a giant stainless steel mussel shell, depicting Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history, which was recently put in place at Murdoch Green.  Svetlana Kondakova and Maja Quille, graduates of Edinburgh College of Art, worked on \u0026lsquoMusselburgh Archer\u0026rsquo, a life-size bronze cast of an archer and 12 steel arrows which will create a trail around the town.  In a joint statement, they said: \u0026ldquoWe hope that the artwork will link the heritage of Musselburgh to the modern day, as well as providing an interactive element of activity for both locals and visitors with the trail.  The lifesize figure represents layers of local history including the Roman invasion in AD 80, the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547 and the Musselburgh Silver Arrow, which dates back to 1603 and is claimed to be the oldest sporting trophy in the world still competed for annually.  The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a striking piece of art that represents so many aspects of local history. Residents of Musselburgh and visitors will no doubt appreciate this latest addition to the public art within the community.  Michael Johnson of Nottinghamshire created \u0026lsquoThe Mussel\u0026rsquo with input from local schoolchildren, and its installation was recently highlighted in the Courier. He has been making artworks for public places since 1991 and has now completed more than 180 commissions for both rural and urban sites throughout the UK and Ireland.  Mr Goodfellow added: \u0026ldquoThis is a work of outstanding beauty that truly complements the town and its cultural heritage.  East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos Arts Service formed a working group to select and commission artists to create the new public artwork. The group included representatives from Musselburgh Area Partnership, Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council, Musselburgh Conservation society, East Lothian Council officers, councillors and other community representatives.  The artists were commissioned to undertake the work, which is being funded by Tesco with \u0026pound38,000 for each of the two sculptures, as part of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art Policy."},{"url":null,"title":"coffee-shop-opens-at-historic-tolbooth-in-musselburgh","story":"  Mr Martin, who lives in Musselburgh and played Eric in the show, was invited to officially open The Coffee Gallery in the historic Tolbooth at the Old Town Hall, leased from East Lothian Council.  The outlet is run by Gibraltar-born Arcon Patron.  He said: \u0026ldquoI have been in Edinburgh for nearly 20 years and now live in Musselburgh. So far this year I have passed my driving test, bought my first car, moved house, opened my first business and am getting married.  \u0026ldquoI was looking to open my own place, partly because I wanted to be my own boss and partly because I wanted to explore more.  \u0026ldquoI have had several people approach me over the years to invest in me, so I eventually took the plunge.

He said: \u0026ldquoThis building is fantastic.  In keeping with the building\u0026rsquos heritage, he is displaying coffee related antiques in the shop, including a 200-year-old coffee roaster and, to mark a forthcoming golf exhibition in nearby Musselburgh Museum, is hoping to exhibit and sell golf prints.  \u0026ldquoOnce we are up and running we are going to devote a wall to local artists to exhibit their work.

Five of those who lost weight suffered a \u0026ldquosignificant loss, according to the report by the Care Inspectorate officers who visited the home during an unannounced three-day inspection in May.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership confirmed it had suspended admission to the home following the report, which has now been fully revealed, after it emerged last month the home had been ordered to make urgent improvements after inspectors raised \u0026ldquoserious concerns.  HC-One, which operates the home, says it has introduced a new home manager and it pointed to some of the more \u0026ldquopositive comments in the report which acknowledged staff were praised for their approach to residents.  A spokesperson for HC-One said: \u0026ldquoThe health and wellbeing of our residents is our highest priority and we take all feedback from the Care Inspectorate extremely seriously. We are pleased their full report included some positive comments about the home, particularly noting our staff team are \u0026lsquokind and caring\u0026rsquo in their approach to residents.  \u0026ldquoWe also recognise we need to do better in some other areas. To do this, we have a new home manager in place who is being supported by the wider management team, and we continue to work closely with the Care Inspectorate and relevant authorities as we implement our improvement plan.  \u0026ldquoWe are pleased significant positive progress has already been made, and are confident the home is in a better place than at the time of the original inspection.  \u0026ldquoWe will continue working hard each and every day so that we are consistently providing the standard of care that Residents deserve.  \u0026ldquoThe Care Inspectorate have recently returned to the home to commence a new inspection, and we look forward to demonstrating the positive changes to them.  Drummohr is the second nursing home in East Lothian operated by HC-One to have admissions suspended in two years.  In 2016, Tranent Care Home was temporarily stopped from admitting new residents by the partnership, which oversees adult care services, after reports of residents being ignored as they asked for help to eat, with others eating with their fingers because of a lack of cutlery or being unable to cut their food themselves, while others were seen wearing clothes soiled or left unchanged after spilling food on themselves.  The report into Drummohr said: \u0026ldquoThere was a lack of oversight and management of food and fluid intake in the home. Nineteen residents were recorded as having lost weight in March 2018. Five had significant weight loss.  \u0026ldquoWe observed instances where residents did not take their meal and nothing else was offered, teas were often left cold and untouched and one resident walked around taking others\u0026rsquo meals and drinks.  \u0026ldquoWe also noted that there was specific guidance in a care file from the dietician in respect of food and fluids that one resident could have. The instructions were not followed. These issues, together with the lack of guidance to staff in respect of monitoring, recording and evaluating intake, is concerning.  The report added that \u0026ldquosome of this lack of care could be attributed to a lack of staff.  Drummohr scored a 2 out of 5 on all four areas inspected, a score regarded as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo. The four areas were quality of care and support environment staffing and management and leadership.  An East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe wellbeing of residents is always our paramount concern and in this case we will continue working closely with Care Inspectorate to ensure that HC-One delivers the required improvements as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoAs an interim measure, we have decided to suspend new admissions to Drummohr to enable staff there to focus on what needs to be done. They will be supported in this by a multi-disciplinary team from the partnership."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8061096.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"bus-mounts-pavement-in-tranent","story":"  The 62-year-old, who was driving an empty Prentice coach at the time of the incident, is understood to have taken ill at the wheel as it pulled out from a bus stop.

WHAT do we remember of our childhood in our later days? Think for a moment of the key happy memories which have framed your childhood. They are often simple ones involving play outside. Sadly, research is showing that children are increasingly less able to explore and play in the outdoors.  There are various reasons for this and there is a horrible irony at the centre of it. We have become far more obsessed with material things, it\u0026rsquos all around us. We are literally buying into the idea that happiness is about purchase and we are passing this on to our children.  It\u0026rsquos in our brains that the economy needs us to spend our money on things we don\u0026rsquot need. We are fed an ideology that spending money on stuff is not just a pleasure but a civic duty. It keeps the economy going and makes us all prosperous. That\u0026rsquos what we are made to believe.  But the result is that more than ever, for our children and ourselves, we are enslaved to the interests of corporate profit at the expense of what really matters: simple time to be and enjoy free pleasures.  These were my thoughts as I set off for the second of this summer\u0026rsquos journeys of discovery. I didn\u0026rsquot share them at the time, and of course I stopped thinking about them as the magic of the wood engulfed us.  We began our journey amongst yew trees which surrounded the ancient kirk of Garvald. It was a scorching day and the shade of trees was such a relief. The plan was to spend the day exploring the wood and discover Stoneypath Castle.  Garvald Kirk has a simple beauty. While parts of its wall are 800 years old, it has been subject to renovation and alteration over the last 200 years. There is a welcoming atmosphere inside and I reflected that when not being used for services it would make a perfect storytelling venue.  By the door there is a reminder of how religion can change its spots. A set of jougs hangs on the wall: an iron collar and chain once used to humiliate and degrade \u0026lsquosinners\u0026rsquo by chaining them up. The victims of this would have been mainly young women who became pregnant out of wedlock.  It\u0026rsquos right that it remains there, I think, as a reminder that religion can be used as a justification for intolerance, hate and cruelty as well as a source for love and compassion. The choice of which version to adhere to is a human one.  We followed the rabbits which scattered from the kirkyard into the wood. I was surprised that the Papana Water, which flows through the wood, was so full given there had been no real rain for weeks  It\u0026rsquos impossible to be bored in a wood. Hours were soaked up under the cooling shade of the tree canopy. It was quite simply a day of utter magic. We had our picnic under the shade of two giant Scots pine trees with the sound of running water in the background. It was the only real quiet moment in what would be hours of constant play. The kids just sat for a while, listening to the running water, and looking up at the trees. It was a communion of simple joy.  The walk isn\u0026rsquot so long in distance but it took us around five hours to complete. It could be done in 20 minutes or less if you just walk. But we didn\u0026rsquot just walk, we explored. There are three bridges which cross the Papana. Each one had a different attraction. Shoes were soon off and clothes got wet but the heat meant none of this mattered. A new game was devised when our youngest, Lewis, tried to use a piece of half-eaten banana as a substitute for a stick while playing \u0026lsquoPoohsticks\u0026rsquo . The girls rushed into the river to reclaim it, but then came up with a new game \u0026lsquohunt the banana\u0026rsquo.  After spending time at various points by the river, getting wet and discovering lots of things, we finally reached the walk\u0026rsquos end: Stoneypath Tower. It suddenly appears above the trees as if out of a fairy tale, its newly restored red walls and parapets a contrast to the green we were surrounded by.  There is much history in the castle, but then again there is history in the woods and hills.  As we headed back to Garvald the kids were quieter, tired by adventure, but in a joyful way. The image of my kids standing in the water, playing and searching for fish seemed to symbolise something immemorial: a powerful and simple truth that what we really need is an immersion in nature, not stuff that hijacks our wellbeing in the name of profit.  We surely stepped on the footprints of Robert Neillans on our return. He was a well-known cooper who lived in Garvald over 200 years ago. Perhaps he came foraging here, I thought. As the water sparkled in the sunshine I reflected that the making of \u0026lsquoillicit whisky\u0026rsquo was once common hereabouts and that Robert was, according to local historian Irene Anderson, one of those involved.  We walked past the house he built on the banks of the Papana when we returned to Garvald. What tales this village could tell!  We\u0026rsquod been \u0026lsquoaway\u0026rsquo for a total of nearly six hours in a magic place. But we\u0026rsquod met only one person walking her dog. In one sense that was a joy, and the absence of litter was another.  But it was tinged with a sense of sadness that the magic is something being lost to so many of us, and indeed that so many of the magic places are themselves being lost.  But my melancholy did not last long. It was a day of joy and we thanked the wood as we left."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8067093.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"day-two-of-the-aberdeen-standard-investments-scottish-open-at-gullane-golf-club","story":"  Rock is 13-under-par, two shots better off ellow countryman Tyrell Hatton.

The early proposals, which will be unveiled to the public later this year, show about 300 homes, with a quarter of those being affordable.  Included in the plans are provision for roads and drainage infrastructure, off-site road improvements, as well as land being set aside for play areas and open space.  The Proposal of Application Notice (PAN) is the first step in the planning process, with the idea of housing on the site, off the A6093.  The land outlined for the development is identified for housing in the new Local Development Plan and, according to the developers, will be designed to integrate with the Letham Mains development.

A detailed planning application is expected later this year.

Susan said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom the runner in the family and I have always done a fundraising event every year.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was a great supporter, she was not a runner herself but she would tease me about the time I had done at the event.  \u0026ldquoShe was a huge supporter and always contributed generously to what I was running for.  \u0026ldquoAfter she had the terminal diagnosis, one thing we talked about was that I would organise some kind of running thing for the family.  \u0026ldquoIt was her choice to go with Edinburgh Maggie\u0026rsquos Centre because she had such amazing support there.  The charity, which has been based in Edinburgh since 1996, offers support to people with cancer and their family and friends.  The centres offer not only practical advice about benefits and eating well but qualified experts provide emotional support and the centres offer a chance to meet people or simply sit quietly with a cup of tea.  Team Jenny, which includes seven-year-old Isla, will in varying combinations be clocking up nearly 200 kilometres of timed runs throughout the summer.  Originally, the plan was for the seven family members to take part together in the same event.  However, with the family spread out in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Coleraine, it proved impossible.  Instead they are taking on half a dozen different events before combining both the distance and fundraising totals together.  Elaine, 32, has already completed the Baker Hughes 10k in Aberdeen, while Kara, 28, and her husband, Duncan, will be joined by Clare, 32, Elaine and Susan at the Run the Blades event at Whitelee Wind Farm, near Eaglesham, this month.  Meanwhile in Portrush, Northern Ireland, Susan will join Laura, 36, together with her daughters Ciara, 13, and Isla, at the Portrush Park Run.  Clare, Elaine, Kara and Susan will all take part in the Great Aberdeen Run 10k next month before Susan\u0026rsquos attention turns to the Scottish 10k, which starts and finishes at Musselburgh Racecourse in September.  Finally, Elaine and Susan will take on the Great Scottish Run Half Marathon in Glasgow, with Laura\u0026rsquos husband Barry competing in the Belfast City Half Marathon in September.  The family set an initial fundraising target of \u0026pound1,000 before increasing that to \u0026pound3,000 but both have already been smashed, with nearly \u0026pound5,000 already raised.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoIt is amazing.  \u0026ldquoPeople are just so incredibly generous and I think that is a measure of Jennifer and Maggie\u0026rsquos and the affection and respect people have for Maggie\u0026rsquos.  \u0026ldquoWe are very fortunate it is a very close family.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was very caring, had a great sense of humour and she was honest.  \u0026ldquoYou could always depend on her \u0026ndash it might not be what you wanted to hear but what you needed to hear.  \u0026ldquoShe had that ability to be completely honest without ever being harsh or unkind.  \u0026ldquoShe was incredibly supportive of the family and everybody in it.

Mrs Reid, known as Kit, told how she exchanged early memories of her nursing career and the transition into the NHS with the royal guest.  She said: \u0026ldquoMy first pay was two pound notes and a 10 shilling note. The week before national health it was seven (shillings) and six (pence).  Mrs Reid, of Haddington worked as a nurse from 1946 until 1952 and spent some of her career at Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Royal Hospital for Sick Children. The grandmother of five, with triplets in Seattle and a grandson in Saskatchewan, Canada, and a further grandson at the University of Edinburgh, said: \u0026ldquoThe Duke was absolutely normal.  \u0026ldquoHe spoke to me and asked various things about the work I had done.  \u0026ldquoObviously he had been briefed because he asked me about the pay and for what felt like a long time he spoke to me.  \u0026ldquoHe was just so charming \u0026ndash it was the thrill of a lifetime, the whole thing.  \u0026ldquoI met so many wonderfully interesting people \u0026ndash people from Orkney and Shetland, from all over Scotland, with their own stories to tell.  \u0026ldquoIt was just absolutely wonderful \u0026ndash I even got to walk on a red carpet.  Mrs Reid said that the NHS had made a massive difference to the way of life across Scotland and said she was \u0026ldquoall for the NHS.  The 90-year-old, who also met Scotland\u0026rsquos new Health Secretary Jeane Freeman MSP, added: \u0026ldquoMy first memory of work was the knowledge that the hospital was getting much busier and there were more children coming in and going out cured. Before that, the parents couldn\u0026rsquot afford medical help and were leaving it too late for their children to come in and many of them didn\u0026rsquot make it.  \u0026ldquoAlso I remember saying to the sister I was working with at the time: \u0026lsquoThe parents coming in now have lost their terribly haunted look because they know now they can bring their children in.\u0026rsquo  She told how the nurses had to live on-site in those days and would therefore tend to give up work when they became married.  Mrs Reid added: \u0026ldquoWe weren\u0026rsquot allowed to live out of hospital, we had to stay in the nurses\u0026rsquo homes.  \u0026ldquoI loved it \u0026ndash I loved the camaraderie, I loved the company, I loved everything about it.  \u0026ldquoIt wasn\u0026rsquot all drudgery and hard work, we had lots of fun into the bargain.  The evening reception, attended by 700 people, was one of a series of events taking place around the UK to mark 70 years since the health service was founded.  During the engagement, Prince William watched a short film about the history of the NHS and listened to singing by the NHS Forth Valley Nurses Choir."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8064994.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"rugby-stars-take-on-golfers-at-gullane-ahead-of-scottish-open","story":"  Scotland caps Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings faced off against South African Dean Burmester and New Zealander Ryan Fox in a \u0027rugby vs golf\u0027 challenge.\u0026nbsp  Kinghorn and Hastings kicked rugby balls around the championship course, while Fox and Burmester got some practice in earlier this week, with the rugby stars coming out on top 2-1.\u0026nbsp  Below is a video of the challenge. . .\u0026nbsp      Rugby \u0026#127386 Golf    With @LeuchieHouse and @MNDoddie5 as the official charities this week, we decided to have fun with a little #RugbyGolf challenge \u0026#127945\u0026#9971 pic.twitter/eCH0KBEjin  The Scottish Open\u0027s two charity partners this year are the My Name\u00275 Doddie Foundation, set-up by former Scotland rugby star Doddie Weir following his diagnosis with Motor Neurone Disease and Leuchie House, the North Berwick-based national respite charity of which Adam\u0027s dad Gavin Hastings is patron."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8070351.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"all-the-latest-from-day-three-of-the-scottish-open-at-gullane","story":"  He carded a two-under-par 68 in his third round today (Saturday) to lead the tournament at Gullane Golf Club.\u0026nbsp  He\u0026rsquos a shot clear of a six-strong group that includes American Rickie Fowler, the 2015 Scottish Open\u0026nbspchampion at Gullane.

The crew chose East Lothian due to its great surfing beaches and its film charter \u0026ndash an agreement between council departments to work together to accommodate film requests in the East Lothian area wherever possible.

For those who can\u0026rsquot make it to an event, there will be a webinar available where you can learn more about what a deposit return scheme could mean for Scotland.  Under a deposit return scheme, customers pay a small deposit when they buy drinks in, for example, a bottle or a can, and then get the deposit back when they return the empty container for recycling. A public consultation on a deposit return scheme for Scotland was officially opened by the Scottish Government last month (Wednesday 27 June, 2018).  Cabinet Secretary for the Environment, Climate Change and Land Reform, Roseanna Cunningham, said: \u0026ldquoA deposit return scheme will provide a new secure source of high quality material which will create opportunities to develop our recycling infrastructure in Scotland and create jobs. This will also improve the availability of recycled material for use in the production of bottles and cans in future.  \u0026ldquoI would encourage everyone with an interest to provide their views on how this scheme can meet Scotland\u0026rsquos needs and help us tackle our throwaway culture.  Iain Gulland, Chief Executive, Zero Waste Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoPeople will make this scheme a success \u0026ndash for our environment and our economy. The Scottish Government and Zero Waste Scotland have committed to designing the best possible deposit return scheme for Scotland. We want it to work for everyone \u0026ndash and that\u0026rsquos why we\u0026rsquore calling on as many people as possible to have their say.  \u0026ldquoWith thanks to support from a wide range of partners we are delighted to be out and about this summer, on behalf of the Scottish Government, visiting a wide range of events and locations across the country \u0026ndash from border towns to Inverness \u0026ndash asking everyone for their views on how a deposit return scheme could work best for them.  Following a successful first event at Glasgow Fort in June, Zero Waste Scotland will be at some of the country\u0026rsquos top events and attractions this summer \u0026ndash including ButeFest, the European Open Water Swimming Championships (part of Glasgow 2018), Edinburgh Mela, and Aviemore Triathlon.

Zero Waste Scotland staff will also be available to chat through four hypothetical examples of how Scotland\u0026rsquos deposit return scheme could work \u0026ndash which are based on 12 main factors to be considered when designing a deposit return scheme. These examples aim to help people understand how different factors of a deposit return scheme could vary to create different scheme designs with different outcomes for Scotland.  Full details on the main factors and examples are available to view as part of the public consultation on the Scottish Government website: https://consult.gov.scot/environment-forestry/deposit-return-scheme.  Fraser Edwards, Sales and Marketing Manager, Deep Sea World, said: \u0026ldquoWe are delighted to welcome Zero Waste Scotland to Deep Sea World to engage with our visitors and gather people\u0026rsquos opinions on a deposit return scheme for Scotland. From news coverage and documentaries to community action groups and social media, it is evident that we need to make a change to the materials which our goods are packaged in and how we dispose of them. At Deep Sea World, we aim to educate our visitors on the importance of protecting our oceans and reducing single-use plastics.  \u0026ldquoAs a business and as individuals, we know that it can be challenging when looking for alternatives to traditional plastic packaging. Measures such as a Scottish deposit return scheme however make it easier for all of us to take these positive steps for a cleaner, more sustainable future.  Zero Waste Scotland research shows over 64,000 tonnes of plastic food packaging and plastic bottles is thrown away into household general rubbish bins and sent to landfill every year in Scotland, costing the country a staggering \u0026pound11million each year. Meanwhile evidence shows countries with deposit return schemes operating overseas can reach over 90% recycling for targeted drinks containers, such as bottles and cans.

The lump of precious metal, the size of a golf ball and said to be worth \u0026pound50,000, was spotted while the man - who has chosen to remain anonymous - was lying face down in the stream using a snorkel.  The technique, known as sniping, allows prospectors to scour riverbeds for traces of gold. But the lucky explorer, who is in his 40s, had no idea he was about to uncover the find of a lifetime.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspGold rush on after Canadian finds \u0026pound10,000 nugget    Named the Douglas Nugget, the ball of ore weighs 2.75 Troy ounces [85.7g], and is said to share a similar diameter to that of a 1.6ins golf ball.  Experts say it is 500 years since a similar nugget has been found in Britain - although there may be more where this one came from.  However, the location of the river is being kept under wraps to prevent a disorderly gold rush.    The man, who has been hunting for gold as a hobby for 20 years, said: \u0026ldquoI was following a crack in the bedrock and found around 2g in fine gold.\u0026nbsp  \u0026ldquoThis then led to a pocket, where I uncovered the nugget. I called over my friend to have a look and we both assumed it to be around 5-7g in weight.  \u0026ldquoIt wasn\u0026rsquot until I removed it that we realised just how big it was.

We were both stunned and couldn\u0026rsquot believe it. I\u0026rsquove never seen anything like it in my lifetime.  The owner is currently unsure what to do with his nugget, but keeping it in a safety deposit box in the meantime.  Gold expert Leon Kirk, from Gold Panning Supplies UK, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a very exciting and unprecedented find. But the nugget\u0026rsquos rarity means it is very hard to put a price on it.  \u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoI would say it is worth at least \u0026pound50,000 but, as it\u0026rsquos rarer than a Aston Martin or a Faberge egg, a billionaire could easily come along and pay a lot more for it. Historically, it is off the Richter scale.  Mr Kirk hopes it will end up being purchased by a British museum, although legally it may have to be handed over to The Crown Estate.\u0026nbsp    The nugget was found using a technique known as \u0027sniping\u0027  Dr Neil Clark, author of Scottish Gold: Fruit Of The Nation and curator at The Hunterian, University of Glasgow, believes the shape of the Douglas Nugget could mean there is more gold just waiting to be found close to the mystery location.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is difficult to say whether this nugget broke from a larger chunk or not.\u0026nbsp  \u0026ldquoThe rounded edges of the piece indicate that it has certainly been in the watercourse for a while.  \u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoThe size of the nugget suggests that it probably did not travel far, though.  But he added: \u0026ldquoThe fact that we have waited over 500 years for this nugget suggests it may be difficult to find another comparable one in the near future.    Prior to the Douglas Nugget, the previous record holder for the biggest gold nugget to be found in British waters dates back to 1808.\u0026nbsp  This was a 59g lump discovered in Cornwall.

They will spend an estimated \u0026pound33 million in shops, restaurants and at other businesses, Airbnb research suggests, with hosts earning a total of \u0026pound15 million.  The company is an official accommodation partner of the Fringe, but the short-term lets industry has been accused of depriving locals of housing and failing to contribute to the city\u0027s services and infrastructure.  UK policy manager Natasha Mytton Mills said: \"Airbnb is proud to return as an official accommodation partner to one of the most vibrant and exciting cultural events in the UK.  \"Local hosts in the city are allowing visitors to experience this iconic event and providing them with an enjoyable, safe stay in all parts of the city, and we are particularly pleased to have supported accessibility at the Fringe this year through funding from our Community Tourism Programme.\"  The top destination for Airbnb guests over the festival is Leith, followed by the Old Town.  Many plan to continue their travels afterwards, with Glasgow the most popular choice followed by Inverness, Fort William, Oban and Skye.  VisitScotland chief executive Malcolm Roughead said: \"Tourism today is all about consumer choice and we are lucky to have a range of options from the five-star experience to, now, the spare bedroom.  \"The global reach of the Airbnb brand brings significant benefits to Scotland in terms of increased business and profile and also helps a lot during pressure points on accommodation such as the Edinburgh Festival.\"  Andy Wightman, housing spokesman for the Scottish Greens and MSP for Lothian, said: \"There is a long tradition of festival lets in Edinburgh which are vital to the success of the Edinburgh Festival and Fringe.  \"Airbnb, however, is a company that is turning a blind eye to unlawful short-term letting operations that are depriving local individuals and families of badly-needed long-term housing and depriving the city\u0027s services and infrastructure of millions of pounds in tax.  \"It\u0027s disappointing to see the Fringe Society joining forces with the short-term lets industry when instead it could be working to balance sustainable tourism with the need to retain a sense of community in our capital city.\""},{"url":null,"title":"brexit-may-cause-dearth-of-cultural-talent-coming-to-the-uk-and-scotland-lords-report-says","story":"  Without new arrangements for the movement of people between the UK and the EU, this decline will be \"to the detriment of the sector, and represent a significant loss to the audiences that enjoy seeing talent from across Europe performing in the UK\", the EU Home Affairs Sub-Committee says.  \"The UK may struggle to attract talent,\" a statement on behalf of the committee said.  Cultural leaders have already warned of the affects that Brexit could have on the arts world, especially if the ability to move rapidly between Europe and the UK is undermined.  Last night Iain Munro, the new acting chief executive of Creative Scotland, the national arts funding organisation, said the body was concerned about the potential consequences of Brexit.  He said: \"Working internationally is key to ensuring that Scotland remains a successful and distinctive creative nation connected to the world.  \"We share the real concerns amongst the cultural community in Scotland as to the impact that leaving the EU will have on their work and the ability of artists to exchange ideas and practise.  \"We have discussed these matters with the Scottish Government and in UK Government forums, and a broader debate on this issue is therefore welcome.\"  The committee says that \"the ability to move between the UK and EU at short notice is integral to the business model of many cultural sector organisations, which are often built on the services of consultants and freelance workers working on a project basis, or working on multiple projects at one time.\"  Lord Jay of Ewelme, chairman of the Committee, said: \"Individuals working in the UK cultural sector are highly mobile, and have thrived on collaboration with people from all over the world.  \"The country benefits enormously from the sector\u0027s contribution to its economy and society, and it makes an important contribution to the UK\u0027s international image and influence.  \"If the Government is to achieve its wish to establish an immigration system that meets the needs of the post-Brexit economy, the UK\u0027s negotiators will need to be flexible.  \"This means recognising that any restrictions on EU citizens wishing to enter the UK to work may be matched by reciprocal restrictions on UK workers in the EU.\"  The report comes on the eve of the Edinburgh festival season, when many artists, writers, musicians, technicians and cultural workers arrive in the Scottish capital for the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, the Edinburgh International Festival and the Edinburgh International Book Festival.  The Fringe and the Edinburgh International Festival are currently permit-free festivals, which means that performers do not need to obtain work permits to appear, or apply for entry to the UK under its points system.  However, many performers still need visas to attend, depending on which country they come from.  A spokeswoman for the Edinburgh Festival Fringe said: \"We are immensely proud of our permit free status and the open access platform that the Fringe provides for artists from across the globe.  \"However, the Fringe Society has no jurisdiction over the visa process and is not an immigration authority.  \"We will continue to work with the authorities in the UK to ensure that our international participants are informed about the immigration requirements and that the process is as smooth as possible.\"  In the report, the committee says that the UK Government consider two possible visa options \"that would recognise the two-way benefits that accrue from allowing artists, entertainers and other cultural sector workers to move freely between the UK and EU.\"  One of these is extending the \"permit free\" festival arrangements to all EU citizens.  The other is \"offering a multi-country, multi-entry short-term \u0027touring visa\u0027 for EU citizens, and seek a reciprocal commitment for UK citizens travelling to the EU.\"  The UK government\u0026rsquos recent White Paper acknowledges that \"the UK and the EU will \u0026hellip need provisions that allow for mobility\" to facilitate the proposed \"cooperative accord\" with the EU on culture and education."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit-blamed-as-number-of-eu-teachers-applying-to-work-in-scotland-plummets","story":"  Figures show only 14 teachers from other EU countries and Switzerland applied for registration in Scotland in the first six months of this year.

Ken Muir, chief executive of the General Teaching Council of Scotland (GTCS), said applications were \u0026ldquofalling off a cliff and placed the blame firmly with Brexit.  He told Holyrood magazine: \"Having maintained numbers pretty high from the EU, they are falling off a cliff, and that\u0027s absolutely down to Brexit.  \"Particularly from three countries in the EU, Greece, Poland and Spain, we get a good number of applicants, followed by the Republic of Ireland it has to be said \u0026ndash those four are our big hitters, and those numbers have dwindled to next to nothing.\"  The overall number of applicants from outside Scotland has also plummeted, with only 126 in the first half of 2018 \u0026ndash compared to 598 last year and 614 the year before.  A spokeswoman for the EIS \u0026ndash Scotland\u0026rsquos biggest teaching union \u0026ndash insisted teachers from other countries \u0026ldquoare a valuable part of the Scottish education workforce, reflecting the society we live in.  She added: \u0026ldquoThis reported drop in applications can only exacerbate the ongoing teacher recruitment crisis.  Research by the Herald last summer showed there were more than 700 unfilled teacher vacancies before the start of term, with the shortfall blamed on a rise in numbers quitting the profession early and historic under-recruitment.  And earlier this year it emerged a teaching post in the north of Scotland had\u0026nbspbeen advertised six times by desperate council bosses \u0026ndash attracting just two applicants.  The latest figures came as teaching unions threatened to strike later this year amid an ongoing dispute over pay.  Scottish ministers said\u0026nbspthe dramatic drop in EU teachers demonstrated the urgent need for migration powers to be devolved, allowing Scotland to tailor policies to its needs.  Deputy First Minister John Swinney said: \u0026ldquoThese figures show the stark reality of Brexit. Already highly-skilled and hard-working EU citizens are thinking twice about choosing to live and teach in Scotland which will not only have a negative impact on the education workforce but our economy and society as a whole.  \u0026ldquoLast year we had citizens from almost every EU member country applying for GTCS registration but, so far this year, citizens from just six countries have applied to live and work in Scotland. And the head of the GTCS \u0026ndash the independent body that registers teachers \u0026ndash has today made plain that Brexit is driving this slump.  Scottish Labour\u0026rsquos education spokesman Iain Gray branded the figures \u0026ldquodeeply worrying.  He said teacher numbers had already plummeted under the SNP Government, and referenced a survey published last month which found a majority of teachers would not recommend the profession to others.  He added: \u0026ldquoA collapse in the number of applications from abroad as a result of the Tories\u0026rsquo shambolic handling of Brexit will only make this SNP teacher recruitment crisis worse.  Ross Greer, the Scottish Greens\u0026rsquo education spokesman, said teachers are \u0026ldquooverworked and under-resourced, adding: \u0026ldquoThis is yet another way in which Brexit, which Scotland overwhelmingly rejected, is already damaging our society.  A UK Government spokeswoman said: \"We deeply value the contribution of all EU citizens working in the UK\u0026rsquos education systems, they are vital to the future of our children and valued members of society.  \"After we leave the EU, we will have in place an immigration system which works in the best interests of the whole of the UK, including Scotland.  \"Freedom of movement will end and we be will creating an immigration system that delivers control over who comes to the UK, but that welcomes the brightest and best who want to work hard and contribute.\""},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-public-should-be-reassured-and-comforted-by-government-stockpiling-in-case-of-no-deal-brexit","story":"  The Prime Minister\u0026rsquos remarks came after Simon Coveney, the Irish deputy premier, dismissed talk of a no-deal as \u0026ldquobravado and warned Britain that it \u0026ldquocould not afford to crash out of the European Union without an agreement.

Her comments came as Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, on a visit to Belfast, also insisted no-deal contingency planning was a \u0026ldquosensible and responsible thing for a government to do and large businesses that are importing or exporting large volumes of products or produce will be making contingency plans.  He added: \u0026ldquoAnd we would encourage them to do so and work closely with them as they are putting those plans together.\"  Earlier this week, Matt Hancock, the UK Health Secretary, told MPs he had asked officials to \"work up options for stockpiling\" by the pharmaceutical industry while his Cabinet colleague Dominic Raab, the Brexit Secretary, said the Government would also take steps to ensure an \"adequate food supply\".  The PM said: \"Far from being worried about preparations that we are making, I would say that people should take reassurance and comfort from the fact that the Government is saying we are in a negotiation, we are working for a good deal - I believe we can get a good deal - but...because we don\u0027t know what the outcome is going to be... let\u0027s prepare for every eventuality.  \"This is not just about stockpiling.

An ICM poll for  found she had an eight-point lead over Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn over who could be trusted to negotiate a good Brexit deal down from 16 points in January and 34 points before the 2017 General Election.  On the parties\u0026rsquo standing, it put Labour on 41 per cent, up two points from a fortnight ago, Tories down one point on 40 per cent, with Lib Dems on eight points, Ukip on five and the Greens on three.  Earlier, Mr Coveney made clear Dublin would back any request from the UK for an extension to the Article 50 process to give more time to negotiate its withdrawal from the EU.  While he said there was still time to reach agreement by October, he called for an \"intensification\" of the talks at official level over the summer to resolve outstanding differences.  The Irish minister warned that certain elements of the UK negotiating position as set out in the UK Government\u0026rsquos Brexit White Paper would be difficult for Brussels to agree to although he noted that the document had made negotiations \"easier\" by backing away from earlier red lines.  Mr Coveney dismissed suggestions that amendments to the Brexit legislation had forced on the PM by Eurosceptic backbenchers would prevent agreement on a \"backstop\" arrangement for the Northern Irish border.  His remarks came ahead of a meeting on Thursday between Dominic Raab, the Brexit Secretary, and Michel Barnier, the EU\u0026rsquos chief negotiator, and Mrs May\u0026rsquos trip to Salzburg on Friday for talks with her Austrian counterpart.  On Tuesday, the PM confirmed that as the Brexit talks entered their final weeks she was taking personal charge of them with Mr Raab \"deputising\" for her in Brussels.  Tory Eurosceptics voiced concerns that the Brexit Department had been \u0026ldquosidelined by No 10 and Mrs May\u0027s Europe chief adviser Olly Robbins, amid increasing speculation that divisions within the Conservative camp could result in a no-deal Brexit.  In a separate development, Lord Trimble, the former First Minister of Northern Ireland, warned that any attempt by the Irish Government to impose post-Brexit tariffs on trade with the UK would lead to an upsurge in smuggling at the Irish border.  The Conservative peer said an increase in smuggling would have the \"delightful\" side-effect of diverting criminal elements away from paramilitary activity by giving them something more useful to do.  But he said the better solution would be the removal or reduction of tariffs across the whole British Isles.  The former leader of the Ulster Unionist Party called on Dublin to press Brussels for a British Isles exemption from the requirement to collect tariffs on trade with countries outside the EU.  \"It\u0027s in its own interests for them to speak to the EU about tariffs and about the reduction or elimination of tariffs within the British Isles.  \"That would be a huge step forward for everyone and it would solve all the other problems, including the problems that have been manufactured by people over the course of the last year or so,\" added Lord Trimble."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-pledges-post-brexit-farming-industry-fit-for-the-future","story":"  The Prime Minister will set out the UK Government\u0027s plans for a post-Brexit farming policy, explaining how the EU\u0027s Common Agricultural Policy subsidy system based on land farmed will be replaced with a system of public money for public goods.  She will make clear to local farmers and food producers that she is committed to safeguarding animal welfare, supporting the production of high quality produce and protecting the farmed environment.  \"Leaving the EU presents us with a unique opportunity to transform our food, farming and environmental policies so we can have a healthy and prosperous agricultural industry that is fit for the future and helps us to leave the environment in a better place than we found it.  \"Scrapping the Common Agricultural Policy and introducing a simpler system which provides funds in return for public goods, like improving water quality, reducing emissions and planting wild flower meadows to boost biodiversity, is fundamental to our new approach, Mrs May declared.  \"I want to make the most of the freedoms provided by Brexit to design a new scheme that is less bureaucratic and does away with the overly prescriptive information farmers currently have to provide to apply for grants.\"  In a roundtable with farmers, landowners and agricultural organisations in Llanelwedd, the PM will also reiterate her commitment to maintaining current funding levels until the end of this Parliament to ensure farmers have the certainty they need to plan for their business.  She added: \u0026ldquoThis Government is committed to supporting the half a million people who work in agriculture and growing our world leading food and drinks sector, which contributes over \u0026pound100 billion to the UK economy.

Violence, bombings, corruption, and above all the ubiquitous and pernicious influence of the military and intelligence services have always made elections in Pakistan fraught affairs.  Yesterday\u0026rsquos vote was no exception with the election getting off to the worst possible start. In thewestern city of Quettaa suicide bomber killed at least 29 people near a polling station, marking the beginning of a divisive election contest pitting cricket hero Imran Khan against the party of jailed ex-Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.  With so much at stake and given Pakistan\u0026rsquos\u0026rsquo past election record, it would have been too much to expect this poll to be violence free.  No prime minister in the country\u0027s history has ever completed a full five-year term in office. With the polls now closed and if things continue to run smoothly, then it will only be the second time there has been a civilian-to-civilian handover of power after a full term. The first was in 2013.  But even with voting now finished many Pakistanis stillexpect an acrimonious election aftermath. True to historical form, the country\u0026rsquos military top brass and shadowy influential security service, the Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate (ISI), have consistently made their presence felt throughout the election campaign. Few expect that to change.  For months running up to the election, accusations have grown that the military and ISI were the hidden power behind Mr Khan\u0026rsquos bid to become Prime Minister.  Pakistan watchers point to themilitary\u0026rsquos guiding hand being visible in the partisan judiciary that went after ex-Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif who now languishes in jail with his daughter.  Sharif\u0026rsquos accusation, made earlier this year, that the Pakistani army facilitated the deadly 2008 terrorist attack in the Indian city of Mumbai, is widely believed to have crossed the line, one that a pliant Pakistan media dubbed as \u0026ldquotreacherous.  For decades Pakistan\u0026rsquos military leadership has regarded itself as the custodian of the nation, one still defined by its birth in the bloody partition of the Indian subcontinent in 1947.  While the military has denied it has backed any particular candidate in this latest vote, observers have warned that the security forces have helped promote candidates running for Mr Khan\u0026rsquos PTI party, and moved to silence its opposition.  Most analysts are convinced that the military\u0026rsquos favourite is Mr Khan or the \u0026ldquoladla\", or spoilt child, as he has been dubbed by by his opponents.  The fact that almost 400,000 troops were deployed at polling stations yesterday to prevent terrorist attacks only further raised suspicions as to the army\u0026rsquos intentions.  \u0026ldquoThe so called soft creeping coup which was conceived by the deep state and midwifed by the judiciary during the last few years has not only culminated in full fledged authoritarian control but has also acquired some hard dimensions, warned Afrasiab Khattak, a former Pakistan senator and political analyst in Pakistan daily newspaper The Nation before yesterday\u0026rsquos vote.  Others shared his concern including the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) who warned of \u0026ldquoblatant, aggressive, and unabashed attempts to manipulate the outcome of the elections.  According to independent international election observers, many were unable to gain visas until days before the vote. Typically such monitoring officials are usually in a country for weeks ahead of any polling day.  \u0026ldquoWe have never had a situation like this in any of our 150-plus missions, Dmitra Ioannou, the deputy chief observer for the EU observation mission, was quoted as saying.  Pakistan is voting at a time when its foreign relations are the most damaged they have been in decades. Currently the US and Afghanistan accuse Islamabad of allowing Taliban militants and itscohorts, like the Haqqani group to operate out of sanctuaries in Pakistan. Also within the region meanwhile a standoff with archrival India over the disputed region of Kashmir grows ever more tense.  Just last month Pakistan was also placed back ona terror financing watch list. Pakistani officials attending a meeting in Paris had tried in vain to persuade the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to keep Pakistan off a list of nations with inadequate controls to prevent terror financing and money laundering.  Pakistan was included on the watch list for three years until 2015, and FATF has now told the Islamabad government what needs to be done, in order for it to be taken off the list again.  For some time now Mr Khan despite hispast as an Oxford-educated, globetrotter has kept up a consistently anti-Americanism rhetoric in his political campaigning.  In doing so he has constantly thrown down the gauntlet to other Pakistani leaders for allowing the country to be used as a \u0026ldquo hired gun by Washington.  Should the Pakistan military have been supporting his election campaign to the extent many believe then he will doubtless now have to tone down his criticism of Washington, leaving him kowtowing to the Pakistan army in foreign-policy matters.  The country\u0026rsquos military and intelligence establishment has long been the main beneficiary of security aid before its love affair with the US turned somewhat sour.  To that end now Pakistan\u0026rsquos generals are keen to salvage their relationship with the Washington and the Pentagon.  For the moment few expect the post election period to be anything other than an even more intensified struggle for control of the government. For decades now many analysts have warned that the military\u0026rsquos role in Pakistan\u0026rsquos volatile politics has only left the country in a permanent cycle of tumult and economic stagnation.  Whatever political manoeuvring now lies ahead among the country\u0026rsquos leaders, real power openly or otherwise will almost certainly stay in the hands of the Pakistan\u0026rsquos generals not any political party or Prime Minister. It seems for now the era of \u0026lsquohard coups\u0026rsquo has been replaced with a \u0026lsquosilent coup\u0026rsquo period."},{"url":null,"title":"ken-smiths-diary-lets-face-it-fudging-it-snap-your-fingers","story":"  STILL enjoying the kids off from school?

While I appreciate that Inverness is the larger and most busy airport, there is a real public perception that, at present, Inverness gets a lot of public money spent on it in terms of development and jobs, to the detriment of other regional airports.The Caithness, Sutherland and Ross MSP added: \u0026ldquoI have consistently made the case that Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport should be considered as a real possibility for the future of the air traffic control service in the Highlands, not least because of the real benefit and impact it would have on the socio-economic climate of the county.\u0026ldquoWe need sustainable, quality jobs and I am worried that this decision will limit many who have seen themselves as having a career in the aviation industry in the Highlands to only being based in Inverness.Mrs Ross added: \u0026ldquoIn May, the rural economy and connectivity committee, of which I am vice-chair, took evidence on this issue and were assured by the then minister, Humza Yousaf, that a full consultation and scoping exercise would take place and that there would be no decisions made until this work was carried out.\u0026ldquoI was very disappointed to learn of the decision to base the new service in Inverness, which seems like a real kick in the teeth to smaller airports that have been working hard to train, support and develop the expertise in their ATC staff.Trudy Morris, chief executive of the Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was also unhappy with the decision.She said: \u0026ldquoWe were extremely disappointed by the Hial board\u0026rsquos decision to select Inverness in principle as the location for a planned centralised air traffic management facility. Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport would have made an excellent base for this facility, and would have offered an opportunity for Hial to reverse the trend of centralisation of public services in Inverness.\u0026ldquoIt is our understanding that Inverness offered significant benefits to Hial with regard to retention of existing and recruitment of new staff, and we can appreciate why this proved to be a significant factor in the decision-making process. Unfortunately the end result will be a loss of skilled jobs from the rural communities which most need them.Ms Morris added: \u0026ldquoAt a time when the future for the north Highlands is looking bright, with significant investments in oil and gas, renewables, tourism and indeed the airport itself, we feel this is a missed opportunity to maximise these. We will be working closely with Hial, public agencies and local businesses over the coming years to understand and address the impact that this decision will have on the north Highlands.Inverness was picked as the preferred location for a new state-of-the art air traffic control centre following a study by consultants.Thursday 26 Jul 2018 12:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"New record set for Lands End to John OGroats cycle run","story":"THE record for cycling from Land\u0026rsquos End to John O\u0026rsquoGroats has been broken by Michael Broadwith.The 40-year-old from Hertfordshire did the marathon bike run in 43 hours, 25 minutes and 13 seconds \u0026ndash more than 30 minutes faster than the previous record held by Gethin Butler.His record of 44 hours, four minutes and 19 seconds had stood for 17 years.Veteran local cyclist Alasdair Washington was a record-keeper for the Road Records Association (RRA) at the north end of the trip.Mr Broadwith, a maths teacher, joins a select number of people to break the record since George Mills, riding a penny-farthing, made the first successful end-to-end attempt in 1886.Broadwith also broke the RRA 24-hour record with 507.511 miles covered at an average speed of 21.1 miles per hour.Bill Mowat, vice-chairman of the Dunnet and Canisbay Community Council, congratulated Mr Broadwith on his remarkable achievement.The women\u0026rsquos record holder is Lynne Taylor who lives in the West Midlands. \u0026ldquoShe is the only one with a Canisbay parish relative to do so, said Mr Mowat, who pointed out that the RRA only recognised female racers in the late 1930s.

Its expertise is thought to have formed part of the case for siting the facility at the Moine, which is about 40 miles west of Dounreay.Cavendish Dounreay Partnership (CDP) and its subsidiary Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd (DSRL) have invested resources in the spaceport proposal as part of its bid to identify and develop new jobs after the closure of the plant.Mr Craig said: \u0026ldquoEvery single one of us here at Dounreay recognises the importance of seizing opportunities like these to create new job opportunities, not just for this generation but the one that follows when Dounreay is gone.He added: \u0026ldquoOur skill sets in engineering, environmental science, programme management and a range of technical disciplines are easily transferable to industries such as the space sector and I am committed to working closely with the developer and operator to make the most of this amazing opportunity for our people.CDP chairman Simon Bowen said: \u0026ldquoDecommissioning a complex nuclear site like Dounreay is about more than getting it into a state that is safe for future generations \u0026ndash it is also about securing the social and economic prosperity of future generations.\u0026ldquoThe UK vertical launch facility is a key priority, with the potential to deliver high-value employment and supply chain opportunities.Sutherland was one of three potential spaceport locations to submit outline business cases to Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) earlier this year. The others were Scolpaig on North Uist and Unst in Shetland.All three were assessed by independent consultants with specialist knowledge of the space sector.Each one met key criteria, including the ability to stage north facing launches over the sea into both polar and sun-synchronous orbit.However, the business case for Sutherland was judged stronger overall, including being successfully awarded UK Space Agency funding for its proposals in collaboration with potential launch operators.HIE chief executive Charlotte Wright said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore very clear that we want to work with others to ensure the benefits of a spaceport in the Highlands and Islands are not confined to Sutherland, but extend well beyond.\u0026ldquoA central part of our approach as we develop this project will be to explore opportunities throughout our region.Thursday 26 Jul 2018 12:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Vet finds Major mess on record paddle run","story":"A VET caused a bit of a splash when she swapped her stethoscope for a paddleboard to complete a memorable Land\u0026rsquos End to John O\u0026rsquoGroats journey.Cal Major was paddling along the seas, rivers and canals of Britain in order to raise awareness of plastic pollution in our waters and to also raise money for mental health charities the Samaritans and Vetlife.The 30-year-old completed her momentous journey inside 59 days \u0026ndash as she\u0026rsquos the first to do this by paddleboard, she is now the official world-record holder.Cal, who hails from North Devon, is keen to highlight not only the untidiness of plastic litter left on our beaches and in our seas but also the damage it can do to both the sea wildlife and the environment.She found many examples of plastic pollution along the way to John O\u0026rsquoGroats and hopes people will give more though to their use and disposal of plastic products.\u0026ldquoThere was plastic wherever I went. I found countless deserted and remote beaches piled high with it \u0026ndash plastic bottles, cotton-bud sticks, fishing gear, plastic bags, she said.\u0026ldquoThe worst-affected beaches in Scotland were on the west coast. On the east coast there was noticeably less on the beaches, but I was still paddling past beaches with nesting birds that had multicoloured plastic littering them.\u0026ldquoPaddling up the north-east coast, and particularly around Duncansby Head, I picked up several large plastic bags.\u0026ldquoThe inland canals were the worst affected.

Storm Hector was approaching, so I had just one window to get around the Mull.\u0026ldquoI set off at 11.30pm, just as it had got dark, and paddled 14 miles across Luce Bay.\u0026ldquoThe darkness made it very hard to navigate so I used GPS and, once I could see lights on the opposite landmass and the lighthouse at the Mull, I focused on that.\u0026ldquoWith the Isle of Arran, I set off with a five-hour window to get to Arran before a storm was due to come in.\u0026ldquoThe winds were strong the entire time, mostly behind me but enough of a crosswind to make the paddling incredibly challenging and painful.

This means 42 per cent of all eligible LFASS 2017 claims have now been paid, with more payments to follow in the coming weeks.Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing said: “Given the pressures that farmers and crofters continue to face, due in part to the extreme weather conditions during the winter and summer periods, I’m glad to see these important payments starting two months earlier than last year.“Earlier in the year we provided a loan option for farmers in advance of these payments, to help provide cashflow and financial certainty. Farmers are the backbone of Scotland’s rural economy and the Scottish Government is committed to supporting them wherever possible.\u0026#8221On behalf of the Scottish Farmers Union, NFU Scotland, LFA Committee Chairman, Robert Macdonald, welcomed the news saying: “The news that LFASS payments will be reaching farmers and crofters is welcome, particularly for those who did not apply for or receive an LFASS loan of 90 per cent through the LFASS loan scheme. The current prolonged period of extraordinary weather, and the economic impact that it brings, once again underlines the importance of these payments to business stability.“As we look ahead its vital that support for the less favoured areas, for hill farms and crofts, continues. NFU Scotland continues to press the Scottish Government for a timetable for payments, delivered in a timely manner to allow farmers and crofters to efficiently plan their cashflow.“Whilst these payments will bring relief for some, NFUS continues to highlight to farmers and crofters the importance of planning ahead for straw and feed supplies with three key messages — Plan ahead, Be flexible and collaborate.”\u0026nbsp\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It has been credited with helping some people to turn their lives around.Confirmation that Mr Harper, who has also sold on the streets of Inverness, had found a successful new niche for himself came when he was handed a Scotland\u0026rsquos Top Seller accolade.Mr Harper, who has overcome major health challenges, averages around 160 copies a week.

The organisation\u0026rsquos chairman, Tony Vandyke, says the money will be used to complete the first stage of an extensive revamp ahead of proposed further work in the next five years.\"We are going to use the money for things like replacing the handrails and changing the electrics and lighting,\" he said. \"These are vital upgrades.

The first is the cinema, which would be built on land close to the ferry slipway and next to an existing boat storage shed.It would seat roughly 30 people and host weekly screenings throughout the year, rising to twice a week in the summer. It would also be used to help house Cromarty\u0026rsquos growing film festival, which attracts fans and famous faces from across the country every autumn.Cromarty Estate also plans to build an office hub alongside the cinema in a bid to cater for growing business demand in the town.A statement submitted by Cromarty Estate said: \"Cromarty has a thriving entrepreneurial community but this is not matched by suitable office accommodation, with the result that many find themselves having to move their business bases from Cromarty to Dingwall, Tore or Inverness when they outgrow their own homes, with the resulting loss of employment opportunities in the town.\"Addressing this need... will make Cromarty a more balanced and sustainable community.\"Film society trustee Tanya Karlebach said the group was \"really excited\" to reach this milestone and the move would help increase the frequency of screenings in Cromarty.She added that there is still some fundraising to do before the \u0026pound240,000 cost of the venue is covered, but that by lodging the application now, they are hopeful permission will be in place to begin as soon as the target is met.They hope to hear about their remaining grant applications and other fundraising by late autumn.She added the society had opted for a new-build because none of the existing sites in Cromarty were suitable for conversion. They would also have cost more to take on than building a cinema from scratch.\"We hope the community is supportive,\" she said. \"We\u0026rsquove had positive feedback so far and it\u0026rsquos in a great location down by the ferry.\"A survey of Cromarty residents found that 82 per cent backed a cinema in the town and the same number would go to more screenings if the venue was better than what is currently on offer.The plans for the cinema and office hub have won support from a leading Highland business figure.David Richardson, the Federation of Small Businesses\u0026rsquo Highlands and Islands development manager, said the organisation \"wholeheartedly supports locally-managed collaborative ventures that make our small rural communities even better places to live, especially for the young people and families that we desperately need to retain and attract.\"Cinemas appeal to all ages and to locals and visitors alike, and they can also be great social hubs.\"Equally, the presence of purpose-designed office space can do much to encourage would-be entrepreneurs to take the plunge and start new businesses existing small business to expand and to attract businesses from outside to relocate.\"It approved the buildings would feature dark metal cladding to the walls of the cinema, with timber cladding on the office hub.Construction could start as early as spring next year.To donate to the cinema project go to www.justgiving/crowdfunding/cromartycommunitycinemaThursday 26 Jul 2018 12:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The utility giant said underlying earnings at its generation and supply unit had soared by more than 300 per cent to £165.8 million in the six months to the end of June. It added that the  division had “recovered” from a poor performance in 2017.            Average customer consumption increased by 4 per cent year-on-year over the period, which was mainly due to cold weather from the Beast from the East around late February and March.            Customer numbers now stand at about 4.9 million, down from the five million reported at the end of the first quarter of 2018.The latest figures come after the Big Six energy company, which is owned by Spanish multinational Iberdrola, increased prices in a move that hit some 950,000 households.The firm hiked its standard variable gas and electricity prices for around a third of its customers from 1 June, with impacted households facing an average increase of 5.5 per cent.ScottishPower attributed the rise to an increase in wholesale energy costs, alongside costs associated with upgrading meters and delivering electricity from low-carbon sources.The firm has been investing in wind power, having completed a £650m project to build eight wind farms north of the Border.            Over the first six months of 2018, ScottishPower also started construction on a major offshore wind farm in East Anglia, the East Anglia ONE project.Underlying earnings at the ScottishPower Renewables business rose 27 per cent to £205.1m while they nudged up 3 per cent to £399.9m at the SP Energy Networks division.The group has also completed the installation of one million smart meters. It is working with four installation partners across the UK, installing at peak 2,700 meters per day with a UK-wide workforce of more than 500 people.ScottishPower chief executive Keith Anderson said: “Everyone knows that installing smart meters hasn’t been plain sailing for suppliers. Challenges have been overcome, with more to face, but it is a major achievement to reach one million installations.            “The potential for customers to reduce consumption and save money is only one benefit. As the energy industry becomes fully digital in the years ahead, the new meters will be a vital cog in a smart network that supports electric vehicle charging, manages locally produced renewable energy and even the storage of electricity at home.”On the half-year results he noted: “All of our business areas are performing in line with expectations. Our investment in onshore wind last year has seen an increase in electricity generated, and excellent progress has been made on delivering the £2.5 billion East Anglia ONE project.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4773314.1532458728!/image/image.jpg","title":"ayesha hazarika on brexit tories tell lies and corbyn sells unicorns","story":"        The Tories are telling lies while Corbyn has a bridge with unicorns to sell you, writes Ayesha Hazarika                Westminster is smoking hot. And not in a good way. This kind of heatwave is no laughing matter. Having been brought up in Glasgow, I am not equipped to deal with this.             I know my parents are Indian, but they came here to escape this kind of godawful evil weather. Cats and dogs are begging to be shaved it’s so bad. And the heat has clearly affected British politics because it has gone into meltdown.            MPs head off for their summer break this week and some of us would normally say it was “well deserved”, but they haven’t covered themselves in glory and leave behind what can be only be described as a genuine political crisis.Brexit has trapped us in a what Danny Dyer brilliantly described as a mad political riddle where the business of running the country has effectively ground to the halt. Although to be fair that hasn’t just happened this parliamentary term. Government ministers, advisers and the civil service haven’t had the bandwidth to focus on the rather difficult day job of running the country since David Cameron called the EU referendum because the toxic politics of the campaign took over. Ironically for a campaign which was dominated by the slogan “take back control”, domestic British politics has spun out of control. We have huge problems the length and breadth of these shores which need the best brains, focus, hard-work, determination and good faith – from funding gaps in the NHS to the lack of opportunities for young people to housing and infrastructure – and sadly our most of our leading politicians seem to be woefully lacking all these qualities.The Conservatives are the equivalent of a circular firing squad and are so busy fighting over Brexit and jostling for who will succeed Theresa May, who will be out the door faster than you can say “strong and stable” once some deal is done on Brexit – although, her words “no deal is better than a bad deal” are proving to be rather prophetic. READ MORE: David Mundell: There’s no alternative to the Brexit White Paper            A ‘no deal’ and crashing out of the EU on WTO terms is now a growing prospect. If this happens, it won’t be because the EU won’t accept a deal, it will be because hard-right Tory Brexiteers won’t. After Chequers, she sent Ministers out on the airwaves to say that this was the absolute, final Cabinet position, then the very next day she gave in to Jacob Rees-Mogg. With this kind of the steel, I bet the EU are sh****** themselves. She then conceded that she would have to probably give way to the EU on further areas, which is true but how do you think the hard-right in her party are going to take those concessions? They are emboldened, and they will not give way. They never have. Ever since the days of John Major, who was out over the weekend calling for a second referendum.I am much more sympathetic to this notion now, but it won’t magic away all the problems – it would simply unblock the Brexit impasse we have in Parliament. What would the question or indeed questions be? How many options would have you have? Would you even include the option to overturn the decision and remain in the EU or would that be seen as undemocratic and unfair? And remainers like me might get a nasty shock – a second referendum may deliver an even bigger margin for leave because, if people hated Westminster in the run-up to the referendum, you can bet your bottom dollar they would want to give it an even bigger two-fingers after two years of arsing around.But it may be the only option if politics can’t find a way though. To give you an idea of how messed up the Government’s Brexit plans are, yesterday it was announced that the Brexit Department will no longer be negotiating Brexit. You literally could not make this stuff up.READ MORE: Food safety controls under threat from no-deal Brexit            Speaking of which, a special mention must go to Vince Cable, leader of the Lib Dems who last week managed to miss a critical vote on Brexit because he was allegedly at a dinner discussing setting up a new party to stop Brexit. Former leader Tim Farron also missed this important vote because he was busy making a speech about homosexuality and the church. It’s great to see the political titan whose only contributions to the last general election was the phrase “smell my spaniel” and a massive row about gay sex is back out there on his “it’s a sin” tour.But things took a more sinister twist when the deputy leader of the Lib Dems, Jo Swinson, was swindled out of her vote at a knife-edge moment because the Tories basically lied to her. She has just had a baby and is still on maternity leave. Julian Smith, the Tory Chief Whip, promised she would be “paired” with MP Brandon Lewis during a crucial Brexit vote. This is an arrangement where if an MP is sick or they can’t be in parliament for an important vote, their “pair” from the opposing party agrees not to vote so that they cancel each other out. It’s based on trust and honour ... Lewis then broke that promise and voted. This is outrageous. The Tories are saying this was an innocent mistake. Do me a favour. We weren’t born yesterday like Swinson’s baby! Lewis and Smith clearly lied, and should be sacked. It’s polite to give up your seat for a pregnant woman – they should be made to give up theirs. Permanently. What a low moment for politics.And don’t look to Labour for any comfort on Brexit. Yesterday Corbyn showed his true Eurosceptic heart by making a speech where he tried to sell us the economic “benefits” of Brexit, which got praised to the rafters by the Leave campaign. He also has a massive bridge to sell you, with a unicorn waiting for each and every one of you on the other side. So, the chances of Labour blocking Brexit or backing a second referendum or a ‘people’s vote’ are pretty slim. Mind you. They have bigger fish to fry right now. Like picking the mother of all rows with the Jewish community over anti-semitism and trying to make communism fashionable again.I really do despair. Never have we needed better politics. And cooler weather.

I have long considered myself an avid radio listener. It is a habit ingrained by weekend afternoons in my grandfather’s kitchen, where after a daunder back from the bookies, we would gather round the wireless and listen intently to proceedings from Ascot or Newmarket, where the rising pitch of the commentators vied for attention with the rush of hooves and the desperate, hopeful shouts of the crowd.            I should probably count myself lucky that I never developed an affinity for the gee-gees as a consequence, but I will always be grateful for that early introduction to a medium that felt more immediate than television ever could.            Growing up with one foot in the analogue age, I kept the flame burning, and with the advent of the internet and the proliferation of digital radio stations, my habit became hopelessly and permanently entrenched. I have lost count of sleepless hours given over to Ira Glass and John Hockenberry on National Public Radio’s Talk of the Nation, discussing obscure issues in a distant country in a way that felt relevant and intimate.Glass, of course, went on to create This American Life, a radio show which morphed into one of the world’s most popular podcasts. Even today, each episode is downloaded by around 2.5 million people. If that particular show’s success is well established, it would appear the popularity of its medium has yet to peak. The latest analysis by Rajar, the official body in charge of measuring radio audiences in the UK, shows that as of this spring, some six million adults across Britain listened to at least one podcast a week.That number might appear relatively small – just 11 per cent of the population – but when you assess it the proper context, its scale – and growth – is really quite something. Only last year, the number stood at just 4.7 million, and the number of people now downloading podcasts now outstrips the reach of BBC Radio 5 Live. READ MORE: From football to knitting: the rise of the Scottish podcast            Such statistics have led to 2018 being hailed by the BBC as the year of the “podcast boom”. Such a bold prophecy may be intended as self-fulfilling, at least on the BBC’s part. In March, the corporation announced the appointment of its first-ever podcast commissioner, Jason Phipps, and it clearly believes it can build on the 240 million annual downloads of its programmes. It, along with other broadcasters and media companies, faces a stern challenge in attracting a younger demographic who do not consume their media via linear channels, and podcasting is one the most obvious areas to focus on. Recent research by Acast, one of the main competitors to iTunes as the world’s leading podcast platform, found that two thirds of listeners are aged between 16 and 34. What is more, nearly a fifth of them have only started listening in the past six months. The success of the BBC’s evolving podcasting operation alone will not solve that problem, but it is a start.            It is hard, however, to see the projected ‘boom’ coming to pass. Podcasting is hardly a new, emerging medium. In one form or another, it has been a staple of our media diet for well over a decade. iTunes first started collating a directory of podcasts as far back as 2005, when the term was named as the Merriam Webster dictionary’s word of the year. Within the space of 12 months, the comedian, Ricky Gervais, helped propel the medium into the public consciousness, with millions of users downloading his comedy shows.  For a good few years, the podcast charts were dominated by such high-profile figures looking to emulate Gervais’s success. And while the podcasting world is still inhabited by any number of celebrities, its greatest treasures are to be found elsewhere. READ MORE: Podcast tells gory tale of Scottish crime writer’s lifeIn the past few days, I have listened to a 50-minute documentary about the economics of US dentistry, an hour-long interview with Kenney Jones, the former drummer with the Small Faces, and a two hour-long show devoted entirely to the 1978 arcade game, Space Invaders.Slowly but surely, such esoteric listening choices have displaced live radio as my audio go-to. I subscribe to more than 70 different shows, and on an average week, I will listen to around 12 hours of programming. Over the past year, the lion’s share of this has consisted of podcasts which focus on US politics, such as FiveThirtyEight, Pod Save America, Trumpcast, Trump Inc, all of which provide incisive takes on the Trump administration.            But so too, my podcast diet is supplemented by an ever-widening spectrum of programmes that embrace niche subjects. On the one hand, it includes the likes of Trade Talks, a weekly insight into international trade deals, and The Tip Off, which interviews leading journalists about how they came across some of their biggest stories. On the other hand, it takes in Wrestle Me, where comedians Marc Haynes and Pete Donaldson revisit every WrestleMania event from 1985 onwards in chronological order, and Cult of Geshcast, in which two Glaswegian friends, Gavin Spence and Phillip Maddison, discuss various cults and sects through the ages. These are my niche interests, but whatever you are interested in, or even curious about, chances are there is a podcast out there for you. There might not be a boom in 2018, but with the bewildering choice of programmes out there, it’s hard to see how podcasts will fail to become an increasingly prominent part of our media landscape."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4774003.1532547966!/image/image.jpg","title":"hundreds of students miss out on nicola sturgeon s bursary scheme","story":"        Hundreds of students are missing out on Nicola Sturgeon\u0026#8217s flagship scheme to get more people who have been in care into university and college.                The First Minister has said she wants to make helping people who grow up in care a defining mission of the Scottish Government. A key part of her plan has been a bursary scheme introduced by the Scottish Government to grant “care experienced” students £8,100 per year.            However, the First Minister is now under pressure from politicians and charities to extend the system because so many students are ineligible for the scheme. Under the rules of the bursary, which was announced at the SNP conference, students from a care background can apply up to the age of 26.            But a large proportion do not make it to university until after that age, because of the difficulties they face in their early life. The most recent data says that last year 679 of the 3,053 care experienced students at college were over the age of 25. While 128 of the 334 at university were over the age of 25.Former Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale said the bursaries were welcome but said more had to be done.She said: “Many care-leavers who go to university do so later in life because of the traumatic experiences they’ve had during their childhood. They tend to be mature students, so are missing out on this bursary because of the little-publicised age limit set by the government. I urge ministers to consider making financial support available for care-experienced students aged 26 and over.She was supported by Duncan Dunlop, chief executive of Who Cares Scotland? the charity which supports people who have been in care.             Mr Dunlop said: “Care-experienced people are like everyone else – they have potential, dreams and the ability to achieve them. Unfortunately our members who are over the age of 26 are being left to do it all on their own.   “We know that many care-experienced people, for example, go onto further and higher education later than others. In some occasions this is because care left them before they were ready and before they were set on the kind of positive path that other young people get the chance to. “Returning to education can be a huge step, especially when people have no financial, practical or emotional support. Our members want to see that the state is on their side and will help them reach their potential, no matter what age they are – just like other parents do.”A Scottish Government spokeswoman said: “We are determined to widen access to university and, by the end of this parliament, we will increase funding for student support by over £20 million per year. This includes an investment this year of more than £5m to increase the bursary for every care-experienced young person at college or university to £8,100 – equivalent to the Living Wage.             “Careful consideration was given to the eligibility for the bursary based on a range of evidence and discussions with stakeholders.”The spokeswoman added: “The age limit aligns with current legislation to provide ‘continuing care’ to care leavers up to the age of 26 – a provision that received cross-party support in the Scottish Parliament.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4773720.1532526154!/image/image.jpg","title":"scottish mps brand royal navy frigate delay utterly shocking","story":"        Five new Royal Navy frigates expected to begin operation in 2023 risk being delayed after the Ministry of Defence admitted it had received no viable bids to build them.                Five new Royal Navy frigates expected to begin operation in 2023 risk being delayed after the Ministry of Defence admitted it had received no viable bids to build them.            Procurement for the Type 31e frigates will need to be restarted, the MoD admitted, sparking outrage from Scottish MPs.

No, he’s not referring to his Strictly Come Dancing days (in case you missed it, he was the unexpected star of the 2016 series).            The former politician, 51, actually wears a skimpy Union flag number to enter the wrestling ring in new BBC Two show, Travels In Trumpland With Ed Balls.            “I’m not someone who previously had bikini line concerns, but they wanted me to wear a really tight-cut leotard, and I thought it would be unflattering,” quips the Norwich-born father-of-three, who’s married to Labour MP Yvette Cooper.“I got a pair of black boxers under it. Had I only worn the bikini line, that might have ruined it for the viewer…”He decided not to shave his legs and torso, like his fellow wrestlers did, either.“My kids think dads should be embarrassing but that I substantially overachieve,” he adds with a grin.“I could explain to my 13-year-old why it was important to do the wrestling, but if I’d have been waxed and shaved, she would have said it was too much.”            The factual entertainment series sees the ex-shadow chancellor walk in the shoes of a variety of supporters of US President Donald Trump, to try and understand why they voted for him.“Lots of people will assume they’re either deluded and don’t understand, or extreme and dangerous, but we just met really nice, ordinary people,” he says.“I thought that after the first year Trump would be losing support, but we didn’t find that at all and it wouldn’t surprise me at all if he won a second term.”The three episodes look at different issues facing Americans, whether that’s the gun control movement or immigration policies, and how they feel about their country since former reality star Trump was elected in 2016.            “I thought he’d drop the wild persona and become a more reasonable, centrist president but he hasn’t at all,” Balls notes.“You assume it can’t get worse, and it does.”As well as being an insightful and entertaining series, what might surprise viewers is how emotional it is to watch at times.In the first episode, Balls stays at a farm with a group of war veterans, and as well as hearing their thoughts on Trump, he joins them round a campfire for a toast to friends who lost their lives in service.And he asks to toast to Labour MP Jo Cox, a mum-of-two who was murdered by a far-right extremist outside her constituency surgery in Birstall, near Leeds, a week before the EU referendum.            “The only thing which felt comparable to me was Jo, who I knew very, very well,” Balls confides of the moving scene. “I did a lot of campaigning and fundraising with her.“From a personal point of view... Jo losing her life is a terrible thing, obviously, but I’m somebody who has three kids, and a partner who does exactly the same kind of surgeries every Friday, so it could absolutely have been us.“I could both think about what it’s like to be Jo but also think about what it’s like to be her family.”Balls agrees that competing on Strictly – on which he won fans over with his memorable salsa to Gangnam Style – showed the public a different side to him.“People kept saying to me, ‘We always knew you were a politician but it’s great to see you’re a human being as well’.”With presenting this documentary series taking him out of his comfort zone once again, he says we can expect to see even more of his personality.“It’s impossible to be in a character for so many hours [of filming] each day, so it’s impossible to conceal who I am.” Did he look to an experienced interviewer like Louis Theroux for inspiration?“I took a decision that I shouldn’t watch anyone else doing this kind of thing until we had made the first episode. I didn’t want to try and be someone else.“If you asked me what the genre is, it’s a mix of old-style, early Louis Theroux meets The Real Marigold Hotel and little bit of Ruby Wax.“I tried to let the characters do the talking. I reveal my opinions to camera but not to the people I’m with.”It was the 2015 general election when Balls lost his seat in the Morley and Outwood constituency, in West Yorkshire.And he doesn’t seem to envy those currently working as an MP.“I’m regretful politics is so chaotic at the moment, and I look back at better times wistfully,” he says.“But if you said to me, ‘You could be in Parliament or you could do this show at the moment’, I’d definitely choose this show.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4774007.1532589497!/image/image.jpg","title":"thousands of scotrail staff could take industrial action over pay","story":"        Passengers have been threatened with \u0026#8220massive\u0026#8221 disruption by ScotRail workers who are to be balloted for industrial action over pay disparity.                Train conductors and other staff are “spitting blood” at earning less than half as much as drivers for working on their days off.            The Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) is expecting strong backing among the 3,500 ScotRail employees affected for a ban on overtime and “rest day” working.            Regional organiser Scotland Michael Hogg told The Scotsman: “The impact would be massive because ScotRail does not have enough conductors, ticket examiners [who check fares on some trains], station staff and cleaners.”The move comes at a critical time for ScotRail, which is struggling to improve its poor punctuality and suffering major delays to the introduction of two new train fleets to ease overcrowding.The vote is expected to be launched within the next two weeks and take three weeks to complete, with the RMT required to give a week’s notice of any action. That means any official action is likely to miss the Edinburgh Festival, which ends on 27 August.However, there are reports that an unofficial overtime ban has already started among some staff in Edinburgh, which could cause disruption such as train cancellations.Meantime, it is understood some union activists are actively campaigning to encourage members to take as much leave as possible next month to also disrupt services during the 11-day Glasgow 2018 European Championships, which start on Monday.            Mr Hogg said the dispute stemmed from an agreement struck between ScotRail and the train drivers’ union Aslef last year to pay drivers £300 for working on their rest days.He said other staff were paid only £112-140 for doing the same.Mr Hogg said: “The gap is massive. As far as we are concerned, there is no difference between a driver and a conductor or cleaner working on their rest day.“We want parity with the drivers.             “We are spitting blood and sick to the back teeth with the way we are being treated.“ScotRail calls itself an equal opportunities employer but what’s crystal clear is different grades of staff are being treated differently.”Industry sources said the dispute reflected Aslef’s stronger bargaining power and ability to win better deals.It is understood the union has always controlled rest day working through agreements with train operators across Britain, unlike the RMT.Mr Hogg said ScotRail would be officially notified of the ballot by today.            A spokesman for ScotRail said: “We have received no notification of a dispute by RMT.“We are continuing to work with the trade unions and our people to try to reach a solution that benefits everyone, and there is no impact on services.”Aslef Scottish organiser Kevin Lindsay said: “We are not in dispute with ScotRail.”The threat of disruption comes as a major setback to the train operator as it desperately seeks to improve performance after notching up its worst June punctuality for 12 years.Nearly three-quarters of delays were caused by track and signalling problems which are the responsibility of its alliance partners Network Rail.A total of 88.7 per cent of trains arrived at their destination within five minutes of time – the official measure – in the four weeks to 23 June.That compares to 92 per cent in the same period last year.ScotRail finally introduced the first two of its 70 brand new electric trains on Tuesday, ten months late.They are running together as a seven-carriage set on the main Edinburgh-Glasgow line, with the next ones not expected until September.The Hitachi trains are not due to take over all services on the flagship Waverley-Queen Street route until later in the autumn because 24 are  required for the 15-minute frequency operation.They have been held up by production delays, faults with electrifying the line and the need to install flatter windscreens because drivers could not see signals clearly through the original curved screens.A second set of trains, to provide more seats on inter-city routes to Aberdeen and Inverness, have been delayed until at least the end of the summer."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4774089.1532593367!/image/image.jpg","title":"man detonates explosive outside us embassy in beijing","story":"        An explosion outside the US embassy in Beijing was caused by a small homemade device wielded by a 26-year-old man who only injured himself, according to Chinese police.

But not causing them.I would venture to suggest that long after life has ceased on  this planet there will still be episodes of change which will also be natural and normal except there won’t be anyone around to grumble, fret or lead campaigns !!\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve. My line-up is: Russia v Portugal, Spain v Uruguay, France v Argentina, Croatia v Denmark, Brazil v Sweden, Belgium v Japan, Germany v Switzerland and Senegal v England.\n: : : : : : : :\nThere has already been a healthy entry for our competition to name Shetland’s greatest football team of the past 60 years, but potential selectors still have a week and a half to make their minds up.\nThe main prize, a return trip for two people with car and cabin courtesy of NorthLink Ferries, is definitely not to be sneezed at. And there are also leather footballs from Cee \u0026amp Jays Intersport for the runners-up.\nSo whether you are a subscriber to the theory that the best players all hung their boots up decades ago, or you believe the standard of today is much better than yesteryear, get your thinking caps on and have a look at the details above. If the price of a stamp puts you off just email your entry to editorial@shetlandtimes\n: : : : : : : :\nEven those who detest cricket most may have raised a modest eyebrow last week when the Scottish team shocked England with victory in a one-day match at Edinburgh.\nReaders, whether they follow the game or not, may be interested that there was actually a player in the home side’s ranks with Shetland connections.\nA glance at the Scottish team sheet may suggest possible contenders – how about Michael Leask, Mark Watt or even Dylan Budge for instance?\nBut it was none of those. The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call (01595) 744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another.

They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships.

I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"vacancy kitchen assistant and dispatch assistant with sandwick baking co ","story":" We currently have a vacancy in our kitchen department assisting in making our range of filled products and also selected confectionery lines.\n We also have a vacancy in our dispatch department wrapping, labelling products and making up customers orders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"blue green algae found in tingwall ","story":"Another loch has been found to contain blue green algae, this time the Loch of Griesta in Tingwall.\nNotices will be posted next to the loch warning against contact with the algal scum.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s environmental health department received notification of the discovery from the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency.

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish Government will be free to make its own arrangements regarding the design and collection of any replacement tax\u0026rsquo, yet, as we have seen time and time again with this Government, the arrangements on offer, limits the ability of the Scottish Government to make changes to benefit the Scottish economy.\u0026nbsp\nIn his response to the Highland MP, Mr Jenrick confirmed that his department was willing to work closer with the Scottish Government to find a solution to the problem, recognising the commitment outlined in the Smith Commission.\nResponding after the debate, Mr Hendry said: \u0026ldquoI am glad that the UK Government recognises it has failed to hand over APD in a workable way, and that Airport Departure Tax cannot be implemented by the Scottish Government without a solution to this problem.\n\u0026ldquoI hope that the assurances from Mr Jenrick today, are followed up by meaningful action from the UK Government, to enable the Scottish Government to introduce its reduced Airport Departure Tax, while protecting the Highlands and Islands exemption.\"\nThursday 26 Jul 2018 12:38 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_0946-e1530785665580.jpg","title":"harold davis 1933 2018 from the korean front line to footballing glory and a spot of fishing in wester","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\n\nHis surname should in fact better reflect the Wester Ross area he’s called home for almost 40 years.\n“I like that to be known up here in MacKenzie country,” he notes from his home near Badachro, on the shores of Gairloch. “My mother was Catherine MacQueen Kirk, and my father was Angus Davis, though originally he was born Angus MacKenzie. The change came when my grandmother remarried, and so then the family name became Davis.”\nFor 37 years “MacKenzie country” has been his base, and these days it’s fishing rather than football which is his passion. Yet before making the move north with wife Vi to build the Craigmore Hotel in Gairloch, Harry Davis had enjoyed a remarkable sporting life — recovering from multiple bullet wounds in the Korean War to carve out a glittering football career with Rangers.\nTalk about “dual contracts” may have loomed large over Scottish football in recent months, but here was one ex-professional who really knew what it was like to serve two paymasters.\nA native Fifer, but brought up in Perth, Harry was an emerging talent with East Fife when he signed up as part of his national service to join the Black Watch. He soon found himself in the thick of the bloody, but often forgotten, Korean War where in the midst of conflict he suffered injuries from which it would take him over two years to recover.\nRemarkably, not only did he return to full health, he resumed his football career with gusto — signing for Rangers in 1956. He would enjoy a memorable eight-year spell with the Ibrox club, winning three league titles, two league cups and a Scottish Cup, as well as playing in the first Scottish side to reach a European final.\nA fearsome defender known as the “Iron Man”, he was never one to shirk a tackle on the pitch, and he’s not afraid to offer an opinion off it either — as he documents in a compelling autobiography which recently hit the bookshelves.\nHis is a tale far removed from the anodyne offerings served up by today’s breed of pampered millionaires. Having witnessed and experienced what he did on the battlefield, it’s hardly surprising that Davis had little time for those less appreciative of their sporting talents.\nTake, for example, the Rangers and Scotland great Jim Baxter.\n“I don’t dispute Baxter’s talent — he was a class player, but he wasted it,” he says ruefully. “He got privileges no one else got and it upset a lot of players in the team. He only turned it on once every three games and for the rest of the time, when your backs were to the wall, Baxter was nowhere to be seen.”\nHe describes Willie Waddell, the man who led Rangers to their only European trophy, as a “lucky manager” who had used his position as a sportswriter to undermine predecessor David White — a man Harry Davis had returned to Ibrox to assist.\n\nIT SEEMS CLEAR that wartime experience — and the discipline and work ethic it instilled — would leave a lasting imprint on everything Harry Davis did thereafter. But, ironically, his prowess on the football field might actually have spared him from active service altogether.\nHis military call came just after he had broken into East Fife’s excellent post-war team under Scott Symon — the man who would later bring him to Ibrox. And he adds: “I had a couple of opportunities, one to be a PTI in the army, and the other to take an airborne course.\n“It was all a scam to get you to play in the army team and I turned them all down. I was quite happy to go and thought it was all a bit of an adventure.”\nThat sense of wide-eyed wonder would soon give way to the full-blooded horrors of war, as he found himself fighting off Chinese forces intent on advancing further south on the Korean peninsula.\nHe remembers that many caught in the thick of the fighting were simple conscripts — scarcely prepared for the brutality they would encounter. Indelibly marked in his memory is the image of one desperate soldier running deliberately into enemy fire and to his death.\n“He was away with the birds,” he added. “I tried to stop him, but just at that moment a shell landed on top of our trench — all the hairs on the back of my hand were singed, but we were sheltered and escaped the full impact. But by the time I got up he was off again, and disappeared.\n“I couldn’t do anything about it, but that stayed with me. You can’t blame the guy — he was just a conscript as well.\n“There was always a little bit of ill feeling in that these conscripts were shipped out to the battlefield, yet regular, more experienced soldiers from the Black Watch were left behind in Germany.”\nHarry’s contribution to the war effort ended in the spring of 1953, though to this day he has no idea where the bullets which left him wounded actually came from. Years later, a former colleague contacted him to say he believed he had been responsible.\n“I said to him it might have been him, it might not have been. Who knows? But everyone was in a state of panic, and again we go back to conscripts. I certainly wouldn’t place any blame on him.”\nThe stray bullets had caught him on the back of the foot — fracturing his heel, but mercifully just missing the Achilles tendon. Having also suffered abdominal damage, Harry Davis would spend months recuperating in a Japanese hospital before returning to the UK to continue a slow road to recovery.\nIn the far east a nursing sister from Stornoway would become something of an inspiration, but it is Harry’s biggest regret that on leaving Japan he would never see the woman again.\n“She was marvellous and encouraged me so much through all the operations, the bad nights and bad days,” he added. “I made a point that I would go and see her, and when I built the hotel up here I thought I’d be able to find her. I only knew her as Sister MacKenzie, but she was from Stornoway and I believe she had something to do with the Post Office over there.\n“But then I did hear from one source that she had died — I never got to make contact with her. It’s one of the great disappointments of my lifetime.”\nON HARRY’S RETURN HOME doctors gave him little hope of ever playing top-level football again — sometimes in fairly graphic terms.\n“One doctor at the military hospital in London told me that my only hope was that my bowels were in such a state, defenders were likely to slip on what would come out! It didn’t look very encouraging.”\nYet after being helped back to fitness by David Kinnear — a physiotherapist and former Ibrox player — Harry Davis would eventually get his career back on track.\nHe resumed action for East Fife, and in 1956 got the call from Symon to follow him to Ibrox.\nIn Glasgow, he initially learned the ropes in the reserve side — one of his memorable early encounters bringing him into direct contact with the Celtic legend Charlie Tully, who by this time was at the opposite stage of his career.\nBefore too long Davis would join a first-team pool that included vintage names likes George Young, George Niven, Sammy Baird and Alex Scott, and Rangers lifted the league at the end of his first full season in 1957.\nIn something of a golden era for the Scottish game, Davis regularly played in front of crowds topping the 100,000 mark, and he remembers a vibrant and competitive league where in his first few years the main challenge came from a Hearts team which claimed two league titles.\n“If we had fewer than 40,000 at a game it was a disaster,” he said. “But regularly the crowds were 60-70,000 and for big games the 100,000-mark wasn’t unusual.”\nA degree of European success followed, as Rangers reached the European Cup Winners Cup Final in 1961. There they would be outclassed by a fine Fiorentina side, and tellingly Harry feels the Scots simply refused to heed their continental lesson. Half a century on, and the same basic mistakes continue to be made.\n“They were ahead of us,” he said. “Scott Symon was a great manager, no question, but he didn’t keep up with modern techniques. He still said get the ball to the winger, get the winger up the field and cross it and get the centre forward to head it into the net. That worked in the old days, but it didn’t work when you played these continental teams.”\nAfter winding down his playing career with a season at Partick Thistle, Harry took the manager’s job at the grand old institution of Queens Park. It was a time he enjoyed immensely, though the lure of Ibrox once again tempted him back across the city — this time to hook up with White.\nThat spell in the dugout was to prove less successful than his playing days, with Rangers then in the shadow of Jock Stein’s great Celtic side. Yet some redemption would arrive at Dundee where White and Davis led the Dens Park club to a memorable league cup final triumph over Celtic in 1973. A few months later the pair gained revenge over their old nemesis Waddell, dumping Rangers out of the Scottish Cup at Ibrox.\nDundee would prove to be Harry’s last staging post in football — and thereafter he set his sights on the quiet life in the north west Highlands.\nTHESE DAYS his football involvement is limited to appearing alongside former team-mates at charity fundraisers for the Erskine Trust, for which he is also to donate most of the proceeds from his book. However, he still keeps one eye on developments at Ibrox, even if he struggles to comprehend the team’s recent high-profile fall from grace.\n“The honest answer is that I just don’t know what to make of it all,” he said. “One conclusion is reached one week, and a week later it’s turned around again. But I do believe a number of teams were quite happy to get rid of them because they were strong competition. I don’t think that was right.”\nAsked for his personal highlights in the game, his answer is a simple one.  He just reels off a list of the players he played with, and it reads like a who’s who of greats for fans of the Ibrox club.\n“I joined Rangers and played with George Young, George Niven, Baird, Billy Simpson, Bobby Shearer, Alex Scott, Jim McColl — a great team. And then by the end I had also played with John Greig, Ronnie MacKinnon, Ian MacMillan, Millar, Brand, Baxter and Wilson. How many people can say that?”\nA Scotland cap may have proved elusive — “in those days they only picked 11” — with a place on the reserve list as close as he got to pulling on the dark blue.\nNevertheless, Harry Davis had long since proved his mettle on the international stage — and he still has the scars to prove it.\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7s.jpg","title":"comhairle must replace barra housing","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar must replace land they gave away for housing in Castlebay, Barra, because it was meant to be kept in perpetuity for recreational use.\nLast month, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart cut the turf on the Corran Ciosmul development at Horve. However, the six houses are to be built on what was a King George V Playing Field, which was set aside and protected in 1962.\nFor anyone to build on this land they must notify and obtain the consent of Fields in Trust, a charity that acts to protect all KGV land. Even though the comhairle took over the management of the land in 1984 they must still obtain the trust’s consent.\nThe Barra Sports Forum have been pressing the comhairle for years to transfer a piece of derelict land near the Co-op, which is adjacent to the KGV area, for use as an all-weather pitch.\nA spokesman said: “The sports forum urge the comhairle to fulfil their legal and moral obligations to the people of Barra and Vatersay to protect the sports and recreation land in Horve by righting this wrong: firstly, by filing for a change of land use to Fields in Trust from ‘sports and recreation’ to ‘housing’ and secondly, by transferring an equivalent area of land to the KGV playing field in compensation for land lost to housing. Only by doing this will the comhairle avoid the danger of stalling the desperately needed new housing that helps secure the future of our islands.”\nRichard McKeever of Fields in Trust the charity recognised that that “sometimes it may be necessary” to change the use of recreational land.\nHe added: “As part of our protection, we have a responsibility to ensure the local owners and managers of these spaces seek our consent to undertake any changes regarding land ownership, land transactions, erection of buildings and structures \u0026#8211 and that proposed changes fit with the purpose of the protected space and benefit its recreational use. We are currently in constructive dialogue with the council and await their proposals for replacement recreational land of an equal or better standard which will be protected for the local community to enjoy in perpetuity.”\nThe housing development at Corran Ciosmul is being undertaken by the Hebridean Housing Partnership, which has owned the land since 2006.\nKatrina Rowlands, HHP development manager, said: “Due to the nature of how the titles were transferred to HHP, the burden in relation to the Fields in Trust was not recorded therefore the responsibility to meet the Fields in Trust conditions remains with the comhairle. We are aware that the comhairle’s legal team are in discussions with Fields In Trust to resolve the matter.”\nA spokesman for the comhairle said discussion with Fields in Trust were continuing.\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/001WH0607NCA.jpg","title":"top four prepare to lock horns in ross cup","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nThe top four teams in the Skye and Lochalsh League will meet this weekend with two places in the Ross Cup Final up for grabs.\nLast season\u0026#8217s league champions Kyleakin will travel to Broadford to play Sleat and Strath, while Mallaig host Portree Juniors in the early kick-off.\n\n In what is their debut season in the Skye and Lochalsh Football Association, Mallaig have made a marked impression in the league \u0026#8211  where they currently sit fourth \u0026#8211 and in the associated cup competitions \u0026#8211 in which they are seeking to reach their second final today.\nWith six wins from their eight league fixtures so far, the Lochaber side are keeping pace with the top teams in the league. Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/advert_whfp.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

SinnFéin believes they should be central to the fabric of a new Ireland.\n\nNelson knows that is our position.\nA false, negative narrative, or ‘project fear’ is being fuelled by some seniorunionists and Orange leaders.\nThey choose to reduce the Good Friday Agreement, the rights and equalityagenda, anti-sectarianism, and reconciliation as zero sum concepts.\nEquality and respect are promoted as losses for unionists, instead of wins foreveryone.\nCampaigning for Irish Language rights is maliciously distorted as culturalwarfare, rather than parity of esteem.\nThe most recent example is the smokescreen created around the DUP leadership’sdecision to renege on the advanced agreement with Sinn Féin on 14thFebruary.\nThis false narrative exposes the failure of political unionist and Orangeleadership.\nThe only possible outcome is to encourage fear and mistrust, and deepenpolarisation.\nThe cheer leaders for ‘project fear’ within unionism are notserious about a shared future.\nThey seek to politically and electorally profit from sectarian division.\nMutual respect and parity of esteem apply equally to our sharedOrange and Gaelic cultures, unionist and Republican traditions, and British andIrish identities.\nThepolitical process is broken.

There are many, many more people who have no sight at all. \n  \n“I’ve done training with a guide dog so that I will be ready when the time comes but I’m not at that stage yet.”\n  \nBrian’s latest sponsored walk went ahead in early July and saw around 50 people joined in at very stages of the 13-hour hike.\n  \nIn the previous two years, Brian’s efforts have brought in almost \u0026pound10,000 and he is hopeful that his latest walk will be the best fundraiser yet.\n  \nBut it is not only about raising funds for Brian.\n  \nHe believes that the charity needs to be highlighted for the vital work it does in providing guide dogs.\n  \n“These animals are trained to the highest degree so that a blind person can put their full trust in thedog.\n  \n“That is the real key factor. The difference these dogs can make to a person’s life is not quantifiable. \n  \n“They are a an invaluable safety tool and a wonderful companion.\n  \n “It takes around \u0026pound56,000 to train each dog so you can see that there is a great need for support from the public,” he said.\n  \nBrian concluded: “I would like to thank ecverybody who supported the walk both physically and financially. \n  \n“I’d especially thank the Antrim and Ballymena Guide Dog Volunteers for their great support and I have to applaud the ‘route manager’, Terry Hasson for all his behind the scenes work and dedication to the event.\n  \nA ‘just giving’ page is in operation allowing members of the public to make contributions online.\n  \nSimply do a google search for ‘Just Giving - the docs 50 mile walk’.\n  \n Meanwhile, tickets will soon be available for a concert featuring Liam McLaughlin which is due to take place on Friday, August 24 at the Michelin Club.

It requires a cut and lift once a year in September where the meadow is mowed and the cuttings are lifted which prevents the grass from taking over. The school has achieved so much by doing less and spending no money.\n  \n“The principal, Mrs Lutton has been very supportive of the initiative and the groundsmen have ensured the meadow is looked after in the proper way.”\n  \nRachael said the meadow has been such a success that the school has agreed to extend its size. \n  \nRachel added: “These flowers have been lying dormont in the soil for years waiting for an opportunity. We now have over 20 of these rare flowers after just two years of changing the mowing regime.”\n  \nOther wildflowers found in the meadow include Self-Heal and Birds Foot Trefoil.\n  \nRachael continued: “We would love to see Ballymena schools become a showcase for meadow creation. \n  \n“Council has planted quite a lot of wildflowers around the town and it would be great to see less mowing and more and more of these wonderful meadows.” \n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/spb27-22-jpeg.jpg","title":"65134  ","story":"    \nTHE Vice Chair of the North Antrim Young Democrats, Ballymoney man Mr Timothy McLean has come out in support of the party leader Arlene Foster. \u0026#160\nLast week DUP party stalwart of some 40 years Alderman John Finlay blasted Mrs Foster in an open letter for attending a GAA final on Sunday.\nTimothy McClean, son of Cllr Alan McClean has responded to Alderman Finlay\u0027s comments with the following statement.\nMr McLean said: Arlene Foster has never asked Councillor John Finlay to abandon his conscious or his deeply held beliefs.

Creating an atmosphere where all people can thrive in peace is the surest way to secure our precious Union.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\")    document.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src=\u0027\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics/ga.js\u0027 type=\u0027text/javascript\u0027%3E%3C/script%3E\"))    \n    \n    var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-4764369-20\")    pageTracker._initData()    pageTracker._trackPageview()    \n      \n\n      \n              \n  \n    \n  \n\n      \n  \n\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/wk19-004cr.jpg","title":"65135  ","story":"    \nTRIBUTES have been flowing in for iconic Ballymoney historian Mr Alex Blair who passed away suddenly at his Lisboy Road home, Kilraughts on Saturday.\nDescribed by one of his many friends as a big man, a private man, a very friendly person the retired Dalriada teacher wore many hats in the town and wider afield.\nHe was a writer and lecturer, the confidante and biographer of the late Mollie Holmes, a traveller and raconteur who had decades long associations with Ballymoney Drama Festival and the Ballymoney Agricultural Show.\nThe Service of Thanksgiving for his life takes place in Kilraughts Presbyterian Church tomorrow (Wednesday) at 11.30am. The house is strictly private.\nFriend and Chairman of Ballymoney Drama Festival, Mr Mac Pollock said: He was a big man in every way, a very private man though he had many public faces he was a very friendly person, was genuine and had many long-standing friendships.

Noel McClean had cut short his holiday in Scotland and returned home when he heard\u0026#160 the news.\nSpeaking to a packed church at the Service of Thanksgiving Rev. McClean said Alex\u0027s death had, shocked the entire community, not only locally but far and wide.\n\u0026#8220We will never see his face again or benefit from his conversation and all the stories that made Alex such a legendry figure with such a wealth of knowledge.\nAfter Rev. McClean\u0027s tribute (see adjoining page), the Rev. Stanley Stewart of Castlerock said a prayer on behalf of the family, his wife Valerie being one of Alex\u0027s closest relatives.\nRev. Stewart said that: Alex had a long life, lived well, and had been a great supporter of the community through his lifelong involvement in many organisations and though his many friendships.\nOne of the many mourners at the service, was Mr Donal O\u0027Hanlon Chair of the Newpoint Players, Newry who have performed at the Ballymoney Drama Festival for 30 years in a row.\nMr O\u0027Hanlon said: We have attended 30 festivals on the trot and the linch pin for us in that was Alex as secretary.\n\u0026#8220Whether there was good adjudication or bad Alex was always there in the tea room to give support and say all that was good about the performances.\nSpeaking from London, Director of Newpoint Players Sean Treanor added Ballymoney will never be the same without him, especially at\u0026#160 festival time.

It was the first time he had competed since withdrawing from the Isle of Man TT Races back in May.\nDunlop was a revered competitor who had more than one hundred wins to his name at both national and international level. 15 of those came at the County Dublin circuit which ultimately claimed his life on Saturday afternoon during practice for the Open Race.\nWhyte said that after some lacklustre seasons where fans only got to see sporadic glimpses of his ability shine through, 2018 looked set to be the start of something special as Dunlop joined forces with Tim Martin in the Superstock and Superbike classes. \nThe team was being built around Dunlop, with Martin ending his sabbatical from the sport after just one year.\n\u0026#8220Tim threw everything he had at it for William, Whyte told Chronicle Sport.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying: \n\u0026#8220People use food banks for many and varied reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\")    document.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src=\u0027\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics/ga.js\u0027 type=\u0027text/javascript\u0027%3E%3C/script%3E\"))    \n    \n    var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-4764369-20\")    pageTracker._initData()    pageTracker._trackPageview()    \n      \n\n      \n              \n  \n    \n  \n\n      \n  \n\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/jbllegiofdoolfna1.jpg","title":"65370  ","story":"    \nARMOY Road Races Clerk of the Course Bill Kennedy says this weekend\u0027s 10th anniversary event is a \u0027massive milestone\u0027 for organisers.\nRace Week continues apace until this weekend with practice on Friday and Race Day taking place on Saturday.\nIt\u0027s been a massive achievement for the club, said Kennedy.

This is because Cameron’s health has declined over the last few weeks and we have just been fully focusing on giving Cameron everything he needs at this time.\n\n“It is with the greatest of pains in our heart that we share his journey is near over. We don’t know how long we have left with our beautiful boy but although he is sleeping mostly now he still is fighting with all his might when he is awake. He is in no pain and is just restful. We plan to be at home surrounded by family where he will be happy.\n\n“We can’t thank you all enough for everything you have done for our sweet boy. Because of the love, help and support we received Cameron’s life was greatly extended and in those times he had amazing days that we where so blessed to be apart of.\n\n“We hope to honour Cameron by continuing Cure4Cam. He has spoke of things he wants us to do in his charity and we hope we can do him proud by helping other kids with cancer and funding help and awareness for DIPG as well as much more.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAll the time in the world would not be enough with our amazing son. But we are thankful and honoured to have had the time we have had. We are filled with pride on the young man he has become. He fought this battle with more strength and courage than we could have.\n\nAs our hearts are shattering we ask for prayers. Prayers for Cameron in all that he needs right now, for his sisters and for us and our whole family. \n\n“We are going to take some time out.

It’s important that we show solidarity with the LGBTQ+ community and send a clear message that inequality and discrimination of any kind is simply not tolerable.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAfter the meeting the DUP issued a statement accusing Sinn Fein of hypocrisy.\n\n“The DUP outrightly condemns any act of hate or violence against any member of the community.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nDeputy Lord Mayor, Paul Duffy\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n“The motion before the Council on Monday night was divisive as there was a significant element of hypocrisy given that Sinn Fein proposed a motion which focused heavily on hate crime, yet the IRA, which by Sinn Féin’s own admission has been inextricably linked to that party, committed some of the most heinous crimes during ‘The Troubles’ for which members of IRA have not been held responsible. \n\n“The families of victims of IRA violence deserve the greatest respect and the ultimate show of remorse for crimes committed against these victims by the IRA would see Sinn Fein ask specifically that those members of the IRA who committed murder and other acts generated by hatred, come forward to face the courts. All other attempts at deflection under the so called banner of ‘equality’ by Sinn Fein will be highlighted by our DUP council grouping.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“The motion appears to have been submitted very late in the day and the implications of such a motion are far reaching. Due process hasn’t been followed, no call for an equality impact assessment as is custom and practise when displaying flags and emblems and we are going against our policies and procedures.\n\n“We as a party fear that this result will open the floodgates for all groups to suggest flying all types of flags from civic buildings, we would argue very strongly that official local authority flagpoles should only be used to fly the nation’s flag or indeed the armed forces flag which incorporates the Union Flag. \n\n“These are the reasons we objected in the strongest possible terms to any other flag being flown and are somewhat dismayed and astounded that only the DUP and Independent councillor David Jones voted against such a haphazard and unprofessional approach. We will on this occasion have to consider taking legal advice and utilising the call in process.”\n\nFollowing the meeting Cllr Jones said: “I opposed the Notice of Motion. My reasons were quite clear. I have no issue or problem with the LGBTQ+ community. Where I have a major problem is such a motion being proposed by Sinn Fein while over a period of thirty years their military wing, PIRA, carried out the most heinous indiscriminate murders on people no matter their sex, religion, colour, age or sexual orientation and have to date offered no remorse or apology for their actions. I do not believe Sinn Fein should be seen as s of minority groups, no matter who or what that group may be.\n\n“During a fractious debate members of Sinn Fein attempted to shout me down. They went as far a proposing a Motion of Censure on me to stop me from speaking at the meeting but following a vote this Motion failed.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“At the close of the debate and despite a rejected amendment being proposed the Sinn Fein Notice of Motion was passed. I and the DUP voted against while the UUP did not vote.\n\n“Once again I feel this shows the desperation of Sinn Fein to latch onto an issue they believe will show them to be the defender of a minority. No doubt they will say I am biased against the LGBTQ+ community. I totally repudiate this. I have worked with, socialised and have friends from the LGBTQ+ community. When I spoke to some of them before last nights meeting and I explained my reasons for not supporting the Sinn Fein Notice of Motion they were equally scathing of it saying they did not want to be used by a political party to bolster their image.”\n\nCllr Catherine Nelson proposed Cllr Jones be censored but this failed due to support from both UUP and DUP members. \n\nCllr Duffy said: “His disregard for the authority of the Mayor fell well short of the behaviour expected from members in the chamber.\n\n“In dredging up the past he used it as an excuse to deny this gesture of solidarity to members of the LGBTQ+ community. I am delighted our motion passed despite his opposition. We will be the first council in the North to fly the rainbow flag and that is something to be proud of.\n\n“I urge members of our local LGBTQ+ Community, and their families, to join me this coming Tuesday night for a celebratory event during Pride Week in Craigavon Civic Centre 7-9pm.”\n\nThose who are interested in attending the event are asked to contact the Lord Mayor’s Office on 028 3752 9633 as they need to know numbers for catering purposes.\n            \n

agent owen becomes secret agent","story":"\nMove over Tom Cruise, there\u0026#8217s a new Mission Impossible star in the making - Portadown Estate Agent Owen Matchett.\n\n                \nAnyone who follows the Williams Estate Agents Facebook page will know only too well they are given to more ‘off the wall posts’.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nWell next week they are set to scale new heights of daring to promote the agency - by ‘dangling upside down from a helicopter’ in a Mission Impossible spoof video.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nEstate Agent Owen will transform into a Secret Agent - resplendent in full tactical gear - for the movie skit as he tries to place a sold sign on one of his properties.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThrow in a some stunt driving and a 30 foot fall into an air bag and you have the perfect recipe for an eye-catching and fun video.\n\nExplaining the thinking behind the video Owen said: “A few years ago we did a James Bond skit for the movie Spectre coming out. It got 18,000 views. With Mission Impossible coming out this week, I thought I’d do a bit of a spoof,”\n\n\n   \n                 \n                \n\n\n\nFilming took place at Todd’s Leap in Ballygawley over the weekend and speaking before his movie moment Owen said: “I’m going to go for it big time, I’m just hoping people will find it amusing and entertaining.\n\n“It will involve a high speed helicopter chase, high speed rally driving, abseiling and me jumping 30ft into an airbag.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAnd, while we don’t want to give away the ending, the concluding message is ‘At Williams, no mission is impossible’.\n\nBut Owen’s exploits won’t just be confined to Facebook, as while he is being filmed doing his stunts a TV crew will be along to film him being filmed for a TV slot (that’s nearly as confusing as a Mission Impossible plot).\n\nThe company had approached Owen after they saw his James Bond spoof and had asked him, if he was doing something similar, to invite them along so they could cover the story.\n\nOwen went on to say: “I do these videos thinking outside the box, something a bit different from what other agents might do with housing market figures and such. I don’t do that type of thing.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“I’m a bit of a movie buff and love action movies and hopefully people will get a laugh and some enjoyment out of it.”\n\nThe video will be released on the Williams Facebook page next week - along with details of a competition to win a family day pass to Todd’s Leap.\n\nAnd to conclude in Mission Impossible style: This message might not self destruct but it is tomorrow’s chip paper!\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8572863.1531997113!/image/image.jpg","title":"lockhart hails donaghcloney success","story":"\nDUP MLA Carla Lockhart has congratulated Lower Iveagh West Orange District on a successful Twelfth July week and parade. \n\n                \nThis year Donaghcloney hosted the demonstration and large crowds flocked to the town.

I want to congratulate the officers of Lower Iveagh West Orange District and their organising committee, Donaghcloney Linen Greer Association. I know many hours of planning and preparation went into this event but to good avail.

And just before the youngsters left the nest to take to County Antrim skies, Aidan led a team of birders to ring them. It was a marvellous occasion for all who took part. These participants now share a special bond, a fellowship of the rings not unlike that from the famous trilogy Lord of the Rings itself.\n\nIn April, Aidan was overjoyed to see his first barn owl when, after a three-hour stake-out of the old cottage with Dúlra, one emerged like a ghost from the window and out over the shimmering, moonlit lough. That night one of the most significant barn owl projects was launched – if the birds successfully bred, Aidan determined to ring the chicks, setting in motion a structured, monitored process to analyse the population of one of our most threatened birds, one which was on the verge of extinction in Ireland.\n\n“Now that they have rings, these chicks have become dots on the map of barn owls in the world,” said a proud Aidan. “They are five ambassadors who will contribute to a national scientific study of these birds in Ireland.\n\n“And I want the public to help us. These five birds will leave their nest by next Friday and set out to make lives for themselves. Their territory will be from Hannahstown right out to Lough Neagh. We want people to look out for them. If anyone sees one, we want to know. \n\n“You’ll often see an owl in your headlights, and if you also see a flash of metal on their legs, then it’s one of ours. And we want to know about it especially if you see one of them hurt and in need of help.”\n\nThe team weighed and measured the chicks, discovering that four of them were male. “That’s four new territories for breeding barn owls next year,” Aidan said.\n\nAidan and pals – including Belfast Media Group editor Robin Livingstone – set out to ring the chicks in a slick operation.\n\n“This was all about planning,” said Aidan. “We wanted to keep disturbance to a minimum so we had it all worked out beforehand.\n\n“Everyone knew their job, be it climbing the ladder to the nest, weighing the birds, writing their details in the log book, putting on the rings. And everyone was caring and sensitive of the brood. We only spoke when we had to and were gone as soon as possible.\n\n “Adult owls leave their chicks alone in the nest, so the two parents were sleeping in the chimney pot when we went to the nest in the rafters and they weren’t disturbed at all. Owls could teach us a lot – once the chicks are four weeks old the parents sleep in a different bedroom. They know they’ll not get any peace with the young ‘uns playing and constantly pulling at them because they want the bird equivalent of McDonald’s and Pizza Hut. \n\n“The parents go somewhere else so they can get a good night’s sleep rather than stay with their teenage brood.”\n\nThe chick with Aidan is about 40 days old – owls incubate their eggs as soon as each is laid, unlike garden birds who wait until all the eggs are laid before they incubate to ensure they all hatch together – so the five chicks are all different ages and weights.\n\n“This was pretty special for me,” said Aidan. “Despite a lifetime of birdwatching, I’d never seen a single barn owl until this year. To see five chicks in a single nest is phenomenal. This is one of the biggest broods ever recorded, and shows that the birds here are healthy and finding plenty of food.”\nThe old abandoned cottage is on land belonging to the owner of Randox Laboratories Dr Peter Fitzgerald, who is said to be delighted that barn owls have chosen to nest there and is backing the study of the chicks.\n\nAidan added: “There may be only a couple of pair of breeding barn owls in the whole north of Ireland, so these chicks are precious and represent hope that they can make a comeback. A big congratulations is due to everyone concerned.”\n\n* If you’ve seen anything interesting or have any nature questions, you can text Dúlra on 07801 414804.\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"internet sensation set to go on stage","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nA WEST\n Belfast comedian whose parody of chart hits from the likes of Ed Sheeran – which has seen him go ‘viral’ on the internet – is about to headline his own show such is the demand to see him live.\nBrooke’s Paddy Rafferty, known to fans as Paddy Raff, will perform at the Foundry Club, formerly the Stiff Kitten, in the city centre on Friday July 27. The 34-year-old told the Andersonstown News how he had always been performing skits and his own take on songs throughout the years and decided that 2018 was his year to try his hand at stand-up.\n“Even back at school I would always try and change the lyrics of songs, whatever was popular at the time. The ability to flip lyrics dead quick always came naturally to me,” he said.\nPaddy explained how he started to play guitar in his teens and began to use his talent to create comedy videos which he has since posted on his social media Facebook page and which now have received thousands of hits.\n“I have my own take on Ed Sheeran’s ‘Galway Girl’ – I do ‘Broadway Girl’ and instead of Fountains of Wayne’s ‘Stacey’s Mom’ I sing about Stacey’s Ma. I’ve only really been performing since March but it has really taken off and it’s going really well.”\nPaddy said he is really looking forward to performing at The Foundry – which is already approaching a sell out.\n“I have always been a big fan of Billy Connolly, who funnily enough used a guitar as well in his early gigs. I’ve always loved stand-up comedy and never for a minute thought I’d actually be up there doing it myself.\n“It’s great to know that people will be coming next Friday to see and hear my stuff, I’m not being complacent, I’m putting the work in so it’s going to be a great night for everyone coming along.”\nPaddy will play The Foundry on Friday July 27.

A petition is to be opened ,which, if signed by 10 per cent of the North Antrim electorate will lead to a by-election and Mr Paisley being forced to stand down.\nSir Kevin Barron, chair of the Standards Committee, who delivered the findings, concluded that Mr Paisley was guilty of \u0026#8220serious misconduct and his actions were of a nature to bring the House of Commons into disrepute\u0026#8221.\nIn response, the DUP have suspended Paisley “pending further investigation into his conduct.”\nSinn Féin North Antrim MLA Philip McGuigan said the DUP cannot dismiss the fact that its Mr Paisley lobbied in defence of a regime with a shocking human rights record.\n “Much of the focus of the Ian Paisley scandal has revolved around his failure to declare two lavish family holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government,” he said.\n“That is understandable given the focus on integrity in government following the DUP’s involvement in a number of scandals including RHI, Nama, Red Sky and dark money for Brexit.\n “These have all severely damaged public confidence in the political institutions but this latest scandal also calls into the question where the DUP stands on fundamental questions of human rights.\n“Amnesty International has said that serious human rights abuses were committed with impunity by the Sri Lankan regime during the conflict there.\n“Yet, after receiving his gifts from the Sri Lankan government, Ian Paisley actively lobbied the British Prime Minister to oppose a United Nations resolution to establish an international investigation into the human rights abuses in Sri Lanka.\n“Does the DUP leadership really believe that it is acceptable to dismiss the fact that one of its MPs lobbied in defence of a regime that carried out mass murder, war crimes and gross human rights abuses?\n“This is a litmus test for the DUP leadership and If Ian Paisley does not do the right thing and voluntarily resign, his party should compel him to do so.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"ms decision to close lisburns bow street mall store described as a blow to city centre","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nSDLP MLA Pat Catney\n has said the loss of the M\u0026#038S Simply Food store in Lisburn’s Bow Street Mall is “a blow” to the city centre, to staff and shoppers.\nIn a statement Marks and Spencer said it had opted not to renew its lease on the Simply Food store but that no jobs were at risk with staff having been advised that all existing employees at the Lisburn branch will be redeployed.\nThe closure of the food store, which has been open ten years and employs 40 staff, will further add to the many already shuttered and empty retail slots in the complex following the liquidation of its anchor tenant BHS.\n“Any loss of business in Lisburn is a drain,” said Mr Catney. “Any business closure makes it more difficult for retailers to build their product up,” he said. “It’s the old saying – there’s no point going to market if there are only two stores in it. We need to be working to lift, build, Lisburn city centre up together.”\nMr Catney told Daily Belfast that the issue of paid city centre parking is taking a heavy toll  as shoppers are choosing to travel and spend their money elsewhere.\n“I personally don’t like the paid parking from a trading point of view, the parking attendants are very, very strict and I’m calling upon the city centre management from us as MLAs to really look at a strategy that will lift where we work in the city.”\nMr Catney described as “disappointing” the fact the Belfast Rapid Transit (BRT) scheme was not rolled out to Lisburn. “You have this Glider bus running from West to East in Belfast that could’ve pulled on out here. This is a commuter town, there are so many developments being built here with a lot more young people and families moving here so I would’ve liked to have seen that considered.\n“I will be contacting Translink over the coming days to request that bus services to Sprucefield shopping centre are frequent enough for those consumers who previously used to shop at M\u0026#038S in the town centre.”\nThe M\u0026#038S Simply Food store is expected to close its doors in the autumn. \n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"name change opposed by belfast celtic society","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nPLANS\n for Sport and Leisure Swifts to change their name to Belfast Celtic suffered a setback yesterday with the news that the Belfast Celtic Society has voiced their opposition to the move. \n\nThe Glen Road Heights outfit announced its intentions to change their name in a statement issued on social media earlier this month, with the aim of “improving the club and improving the footballing prospects for young people in West Belfast”. \n\nHowever, despite approaching the society prior to making their announcement, Sport and Leisure’s plans have been met with opposition from the Belfast Celtic Society. \n\nHaving distanced themselves from the name change in a previous statement, primarily due to their status as a charitable organisation, the Belfast Celtic Society held a full committee meeting yesterday morning (Wednesday) to discuss the matter. \n\n“The Belfast Celtic Society again reiterates that it had no involvement in this venture,” a spokesperson said. “The Society was only made aware of the development 48 hours before the public announcement. \n\n“The Society was surprised by this announcement and the reaction received from both our membership as well as the general sporting public has been overwhelmingly negative. \n\n“Since its foundation almost two decades ago, the Society has been approached on more than one occasion to endorse and support a range of commercial enterprises with the intention of exploiting the name of the club for commercial gain. \n\n“Over this period, our standard response has been that this is contrary to the constitution of the society which is regulated by the Charity Commission.” \n\nThe Society also expressed its concern that the families of the former players of Belfast Celtic were not consulted prior to the announcement. \n\nThe Belfast Celtic Society also claim that the trademark registered by businessman Anthony John Bonnar earlier this year is a new company and is not linked to the old Belfast Celtic Football and Athletic Company. \n\nHowever, speaking to the Andersonstown News, Sport and Leisure chairman Jim Gillen said that while he was disappointed the Belfast Celtic Society hadn’t supported the name change, he stressed that the club will be moving forward with their plans regardless. \n\n“We have everything in place. As of yet, the IFA (Irish Football Association) has yet to rubber-stamp it,” said Gillen. \n\n“We have to go ahead with it. We informed them (the Belfast Celtic Society) and we spoke to a few members. They seemed to think it was a good idea. They’ve obviously put it to their full committee and they have given a different outlook. There’s nothing we can do about that other than trying to change their mind. \n\n“We would like to go ahead with their blessing and indeed the blessing of everybody in West Belfast. We’ll stay positive on what we are trying to achieve.” \n\nSport and Leisure Swifts are set to play their first game of the new season against Armagh City on Saturday, August 18 and are hoping the name change to Belfast Celtic will be approved by the IFA before that fixture.\n"}]
