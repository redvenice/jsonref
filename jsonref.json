Meghan is expected to begin the visit by adding her voice to the thousands who have spoken out about the rising violence against women in South Africa.Meghan, who is a champion of gender equality, is likely to raise the issue when her tour of South Africa with husband Harry and their son Archie starts on Monday.The couple\u0027s first event will be a visit to a Township in Cape Town, where they will tour a workshop that provides a range of services to young people, including self-defence classes and female empowerment training to young girls in the community.Campaigners took to the streets of Cape Town earlier this month to protest at what they claimed was their government\u0027s failure to deal with the problem, following a series of attacks that have shocked the African nation.It is understood Meghan and Harry watched the South African president Cyril Ramaphosa\u0027s address to his country following days of protests, when he acknowledged the African nation was facing a national crisis of violence against women.The former actress is an active humanitarian campaigner – particularly on the topic of gender equality – who has spoken about women\u0027s empowerment.Meghan\u0027s activism famously started at a young age. At 11 she forced a soap manufacturer to alter an advert after she wrote a letter to then first lady Hillary Clinton and other high-profile figures complaining that it implied women belonged in the kitchen.The Sussexes\u0027 first tour as a family comes after the duke and duchess flew to Rome to watch Meghan\u0027s close friend, fashion designer Misha Nonoo, marry oil tycoon Michael Hess on Friday.Among the guests at the lavish celebration were Harry\u0027s cousins Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice, US president Donald Trump\u0027s daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner, and actor James Corden.

People take part in a ceremony to mark the \u0027death\u0027 of the Pizol glacier in eastern Switzerland today         Around 250 people took part in the commemoration, climbing the side of the mountain in a \u0027solemn march\u0027         One scientist said that the glacier \u0027has lost so much substance that from a scientific perspective it is no longer a glacier\u0027         A man with a flag of the glacier initiative places it down as a commemoration point on the Swiss mountainAverage global temperature between 2015-2019 is on track to be the hottest of any five-year period on record, according to the report, which was compiled by the World Meteorological Organization.The period \u0027is currently estimated to be 1.1 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial (1850-1900) times and 0.2 degrees Celsius warmer than 2011-2015,\u0027 it said.The past four years were already the hottest since record-keeping began in 1850.Guterres said last week the world was \u0027losing the race\u0027 on climate change, with the latest report spelling out the extent to which the gap between what is required and what is happening is widening.Rather than falling, carbon dioxide grew two per cent in 2018, reaching a record high of 37 billion tonnes.         Many of the people who took part in today\u0027s ceremony dressed in black, with the event described as a wake         Children also took part in the event, standing side by side with activists keen to raise awareness of climate changeMore importantly, there is also no sign yet of reaching what is known as \u0027peak emissions,\u0027 the point at which levels will start to fall, though these are not growing at the same rate as the global economy.The 2015 Paris Agreement saw countries lay out national targets to reduce their emissions in order to limit long term temperature rise by either 2 degrees Celsius or 1.5 degrees Celsius.These are benchmarks that will limit the impact of warming on world weather systems.But even if all countries meet the goals they set themselves, the world will warm by 2.9 degrees Celsius to 3.4 degrees Celsius, the report found.The current levels of ambition would need to be tripled to meet the 2 degrees Celsius goal and increased five-fold to meet the 1.5 degrees Celsius goal - technically still possible.         People took part in a mourning ceremony to raise awareness of the effects of climate change, particularly on the disappearing Pizol glacier         In a study earlier this year, researchers of ETH technical university in Zurich determined that more than 90 percent of Alpine glaciers will disappear by 2100 if greenhouse gas emissions are left unchecked         Eric Petrini, the chaplain of the Mels municipality where Pizol is located, called on \u0027God\u0027s help to tackle the enormous challenge of climate change\u0027\u0027This reads like a credit card statement after a 5-year long spending binge,\u0027 said Professor Dave Reay, chair in Carbon Management at the University of Edinburgh.\u0027Our global carbon credit is maxed out,\u0027 he added. \u0027If emissions don\u0027t start falling there will be hell to pay.\u0027 In 2018, global carbon dioxide was 407.8 parts per million (ppm), 2.2 ppm higher than 2017 and set to reach or exceed 410 ppm by 2019.\u0027The last time Earth\u0027s atmosphere contained 400 parts per million CO 2 was about 3-5 million years ago,\u0027 the report said.At that time, global mean surface temperatures were 2-3 degrees Celsius warmer, ice sheets at both poles had melted, and seas were 10 to 20 meters higher.         The wake comes as a damning new UN report said that the world is falling badly behind in the race to avert climate disaster as a result of runaway warming         On Monday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will push for countries to increase their greenhouse gas reduction targets       Other major revelations from the report include that the extent of Arctic summer sea ice has declined at a rate of 12 percent per decade over the past 40 years, with the four lowest values between 2015 and 2019.Overall, the amount of ice lost from the Antarctic ice sheet increased by a factor of six each year between 1979 and 2017, while glacier loss for 2015-19 is also the highest for any five-year period on record.Sea-level rise is also accelerating as is the process of acidification, with an increase in 26 percent in acidity today compared to pre-industrial periods, as a result of absorbing increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.The report also found that heatwaves were the deadliest weather hazard in the 2015-19 period, affecting all continents and setting new national temperature records.The summer of 2019, which included the hottest ever month on record, July, saw unprecedented wildfires in the Arctic.In June, these were responsible for emitting 50 megatons of carbon dioxide. "},{"url":null,"title":"Oops German oompah bands fancy footwork avoid horse manure Oktoberfest","story":"Share this article          Interestingly, it is forbidden to drink any beer other than Munich-brewed beer at Oktoberfest as one woman grips on tight to her beverage         Two patrons were downed their beers inside one of the beer tents.

It forms part of a poignant series on rural life in Cuba that he began in the 1990s. The picture is typical of his work, which concentrates on fleeting, almost magical realist images of daily life. Here, a child views caged birds through an opaque window. The photographer is on the inside with the birds, looking out, raising pointed questions about the nature of artistic freedom and its discontents.Cañibano, now 58, was not always a photographer. Born two years after Castro’s revolution in the sugar farming region of Cienfuegos, he grew up to be a welder working in civil aviation. He was nearly 30 when a visit to a show of surrealist photographs inspired him to pick up a camera. At first, he photographed weddings at weekends, but eventually he gave up his day job and moved out on to the streets.His vocation did not arrive at a good moment. The US embargo on trade with Cuba, and the collapse of the Soviet Union, meant that materials, which had mostly come from East Germany, were in short supply. Cañibano had to work with expired photographic stock, and was thus limited in the number of pictures he could take, which made each composition an event.The challenges in making the images seem to add to their value. Cañibano works now as a commercial photographer in Cuba, but the ongoing series captures a complex yearning for the countryside of his childhood: “The child in this picture, the son of peasants,” he said recently, “was playing just like these children do in a different way to city children because their playthings are the countryside and everything that surrounds them.”Raúl Cañibano: Chronicles of an Island is on at the Print Sales space of the Photographers’ Gallery, London W1, until 17 November"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7963eec041d6edec510ec03e38fbbce6d4cd108b/411_161_2303_1381/master/2303.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90a83b14cd53d7d582272692e5d6257b","title":"in it to win it why are we so obsessed with quizzes","story":"The return of the classic quiz show Blockbusters reflects our love of knowledge tests. Rae Ritchie looks at why getting the right answer is so addictive, and why getting the wrong answer can be so funnyWhat Q is one of the nation’s favourite pastimes? Nope, it’s not quidditch. It’s quizzes. We love racking our brains for that obscure bit of knowledge that we’re sure we once heard somewhere. Whether we are in the pub with our mates or at home shouting at the television, the feeling of getting an answer right is addictive. But why do we find quizzes so compelling?A buzz from the buzzerThe very nature of a quiz lures us in. As veteran question writer David Bodycombe observes: “If a question is posed, you can’t help but wonder what the answer is.”When we get the answer correct, various factors make us want to go back for more. Michelle Tolfrey, a clinical psychologist and member of the Welldoing.org community of therapists, explains: “Physiologically, when we win something, we experience a nice hit of dopamine, which can be quite a euphoric and ‘buzzy’ feeling to have. As a result, we may want to replicate this again and again to get the same sensation.”Tolfrey also points out the psychological rewards involved in quizzes. “They can be particularly enjoyable if we are doing them in the context of socialising with peers, where it can help us to feel connected with others and part of something special.“And there are, of course, lots of other social rewards involved with quizzes, such as receiving praise from others or being given a certain title, prize or accolade that boosts our self esteem.”Fellow clinical psychologist and Welldoing.org therapist Patapia Tzotzoli agrees that quizzes can meet basic human needs. “People are creatures of emotion and are motivated by pride and vanity,” she says. “Quizzes offer a platform where our knowledge is being assessed by our ability to retrieve information quickly while others are watching. Doing so offers us quick gratification and a sense of achievement that nourishes our self-esteem and gains us immediate recognition.“In other words, quizzes offer a setting with the right conditions to feed our need to be important and appreciated for it.”But if quizzes are so rewarding, why do our brains seem to crack under the pressure of needing to come up with the right answer – and quickly?“Sometimes anxiety kicks in and interferes with our memory – and consequently our performance,” states Tzotzoli. “The more anxious we become, the harder it is to remember the information we are after and we experience what we commonly describe as our ‘mind going blank’.”Not quite the answerTimes when a contestant’s mind goes awry make for comedy gold on quiz programmes. On the iconic 80s and 90s show Blockbusters, for instance, participants still had “mind going blank” moments despite being given the first letter of the answer. When asked by legendary host Bob Holness “What D, rhyming with a synonym for defraud, means to decrease in number or grow smaller in size?”, quizzer Susie somehow managed to come up with shrink (correct answer: dwindle, rhymes with swindle).At other times, contestants stuck to the right letter, but under the pressure of studio lights, got the wrong word. After answering “What O is the generic word for any living animal or plant, including bacteria or viruses?”, a young man cringed when he realised that he’d replied orgasm not organism. Contestant Pauline looked even more mortified when the penny dropped that the response to “What K is a Chinese ceremony of abasement?” was kowtow – not Kama Sutra.More such moments follow on the new series of Blockbusters that’s about to hit our screens on Comedy Central. Host Dara Ó Briain is met with laughable responses to questions including “What Q is a type of pen that is made from a bird’s feather” and “What N are potatoes when they first come into season?” No, the answers are not quail and nugget.As in the original, this latest incarnation features student contestants, although a celebrity special with Strictly Come Dancing’s Stacey Dooley and Oti Mabuse against comedian Josh Widdecombe starts the series off.For us armchair quizzers joining in from our sofas, the Blockbusters style of question has major appeal. As Bodycombe puts it: “It’s a clever format because there’s a clue inherently built into the question, which automatically makes you think you might have a chance of getting it right.”Bodycombe is spot-on. No matter how smart, we all need a little help. Just try to distinguish between organism and orgasm.What B has a brand new series?The new series of Blockbusters – hosted by Dara Ó Briain – hits our screens at 8pm on Thursday 26 September on Comedy Central."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3169ecc41d3ec20850bbf74c75bb61522702e6cc/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e20e9b2e1ddadc4b6ae43646f32c744e","title":"question are two heads really better than one","story":"Blockbusters, the classic gameshow that pits two players against one, is returning for a second series. So in quizzes – and indeed life – do you get the best results working in a team or flying solo? Abi Smith unpicks the scienceHow good are you at quizzes? Go on, you can be honest. You think you’re pretty good, right? Well, you might have a superior intellect – but then again, you might just be overconfident. “This is known as the Dunning-Kruger effect, which states that the majority of people tend to overestimate their abilities,” says Matt Shaw, a performance psychologist at coaching company InnerDrive.“Interestingly, this is more pronounced in those with the lowest ability, such as inexperienced players,” says Shaw. “Experts tend to underestimate their abilities, which is sometimes called ‘the burden of expertise’.”Knowing whether you are the type of person who is burdened with expert knowledge or likely to overegg your skills is the kind of insight that would come in handy when playing Blockbusters – the classic TV gameshow that pits a single player against a team of two students.Recently relaunched on Comedy Central with comedian Dara Ó Briain presiding, the game sees contestants making their way across the iconic hexagon-filled game board, answering questions that begin with a particular letter of the alphabet. The format rewards general knowledge, lateral thinking, quick reactions and – in the case of the paired-up players – teamwork.“It’s really important that you choose your thinking partner wisely,” says Robert Ritchie, who’s made a career by cultivating positive mindsets and behaviours across different types of teams.Currently head of organisational development at the University of Salford, Ritchie says “one head is better than two” in the idea-creation stages. After that, he says, you can deliberately decide who to bring in and when. “In a quiz format, that process is accelerated. You have to have that initial moment of reaction and decision on your own, otherwise you’ll only ever be going around consensus or groupthink,” he adds. Get the right teammate and gameplay can be dazzlingly swift: just check out this pair of Cambridge students trouncing their single opponent.Intriguingly, however, two heads are likely to be better than one even if you’re not both Blockbusting naturals. “There is a quirky phenomenon called the Köhler effect,” says Shaw. “This is when working with other people, the weaker teammate tends to elevate their performance. Not only do people work harder if their partner is outperforming them, they are also more motivated when they know that the team’s performance relies on them. This is more prominent when team members’ abilities are similar, like in a quiz.” It’s perhaps no surprise, therefore, that across the two Comedy Central series of Blockbusters, 11 out of 20 have been won by the pair – despite pairs requiring one more correct answer each round than the solo players.Question setter Charlotte Hazzard, who runs the quiz at the historic Grapes pub in Limehouse, London, also believes that two heads are better than one. “When you’ve got two brains, you’re able to pull on a greater bank of knowledge, and pub quizzes often need quite a wide spread of general knowledge,” she says.Knowing the information and having it ready at the right moment are two very different skills, however. Team player Philip fell foul of this when asked: “What U is something designed for both men and women?” His immediate response – underwear – was factually correct but not what the question was looking for. The word Ó Briain wanted, of course, was unisex.There’s a reason that the first answer that comes into your head won’t necessarily win you points, according to Shaw. “Gut responses are essentially shortcuts that help us make decisions quickly and when under pressure. However, they’re not always accurate. Under stress or pressure (like in a quiz), our focus can become too narrow, meaning we stop searching for alternative answers, which can lead to mistakes,” he says.Comedian Josh Widdicombe learned this to his cost on the celebrity edition when he buzzed in too soon on a question about West End musicals, proffering West Side Story as his W answer. This allowed professional dancer and presenter Oti Mabuse to swoop in with the correct response – Wicked – and salvage the point for herself and her presenter teammate, Stacey Dooley.Sometimes though, one head is all it takes. “At the end of the day, if you go with your gut instinct and get it incorrect, you’re more forgiving of yourself than if you hadn’t gone with your gut,” says Hazzard, whose quiz is often frequented by the leaseholder of the Grapes pub, Sir Ian McKellen. The other benefit of going it alone is that you don’t need to negotiate the politics of playing in a team. In one of many Blockbuster bust-ups, teammates Manreet and Nyah disagreed on the choice of letter and subsequently lost a point, with Manreet jokingly defecting to their opponent’s side.

For a good while he remained on his back (not his favourite posture) and regarded his distant feet, his paucity of limbs, with consternation. A mere four, of course, and quite unmovable. His own little brown legs, for which he was already feeling some nostalgia, would have been waving merrily in the air, however hopelessly. He lay still, determined not to panic. An organ, a slab of slippery meat, lay squat and wet in his mouth – revolting, especially when it moved of its own accord to explore the vast cavern of his mouth and, he noted with muted alarm, slide across an immensity of teeth. He stared along the length of his body. His colouring, from shoulders to ankles, was a pale blue, with darker blue piping around his neck and wrists, and white buttons in a vertical line right down his unsegmented thorax. The light breeze that blew intermittently across it, bearing a not unattractive odour of decomposing food and grain alcohol, he accepted as his breath. His vision was unhelpfully narrowed – oh for a compound eye – and everything he saw was oppressively colourful. He was beginning to understand that by a grotesque reversal his vulnerable flesh now lay outside his skeleton, which was therefore wholly invisible to him. What a comfort it would have been to catch a glimpse of that homely nacreous brown.All this was worrying enough, but as he came more fully awake he remembered that he was on an important, solitary mission, though for the moment he could not recall what it was. I’m going to be late, he thought, as he attempted to lift from the pillow a head that must have weighed as much as five kilos. This is so unfair, he told himself. I don’t deserve this. His fragmentary dreams had been deep and wild, haunted by raucous, echoing voices in constant dissent. Only now, as this head slumped back, did he begin to see through to the far side of sleep and bring to mind a mosaic of memories, impressions and intentions that scattered as he tried to hold them down.Yes, he had left the pleasantly decaying Palace of Westminster without even a farewell. That was how it had to be. Secrecy was all. He had known that without being told. But when exactly had he set out? Certainly it was after dark. Last night? The night before? He must have left by the underground car park. He would have passed the polished boots of the policeman at the entrance. Now he remembered. Keeping to the gutter, he had hurried along until he had reached the edge of the terrifying crossing in Parliament Square. In front of a line of idling vehicles impatient to pestle him into the tarmac, he made a dash for the gutter on the far side. After which, it seemed a week passed before he crossed another terrifying road to reach the correct side of Whitehall. Then what? He had sprinted, surely, for many yards and then stopped. Why? It was coming back to him now. Breathing heavily through every tube in his body, he had rested near a wholesome drain to snack on a discarded slice of pizza. He couldn’t eat it all, but he did his best. By good luck it was a margherita. His second favourite. No olives. Not on that portion.It’s a satirical novella written from that point where despair and laughter meet.The accumulation of misleading statements and lies made to voters about the benefits of leaving the EU.I wrote The Cockroach during July and August this year. The main facts of this national tragedy were in place. The rest was detail.A bit of local glee along the way. But longer term, no catharsis, only bafflement and gloom and wonder at the state we’re in.I aimed to dream up a nonsensical political project as self-harmingly loony as Brexit. I’m not sure I succeeded.Swift’s A Modest Proposal didn’t change much. I humbly doubt that my Cockroach will.When “take back control’”, “clean break”, “breaking the shackles”, “standing alone” etc are understood for the mendacious nonsense they are.Paul Jennings’s Report on Resistentialism (perhaps I owe a debt).His unmanageable head, he discovered, could rotate through 180 degrees with little effort. He turned it now to one side. It was a small attic bedroom, unpleasantly lit by the morning sun, for the curtains had not been drawn. There was a telephone at his bedside, no, two telephones. His constricted gaze travelled across the carpet to settle on the skirting board and the narrow gap along its lower edge. I might have squeezed under there out of the morning light, he thought sadly. I could have been happy. Across the room there was a sofa and by it, on a low table, a cut-glass tumbler and an empty bottle of scotch. Laid out over an armchair was a suit and a laundered, folded shirt. On a larger table near the window were two box files, one sitting on top of the other, both coloured red.He was getting the hang of moving his eyes, now that he understood the way they smoothly swivelled together without his help. Rather than letting his tongue hang out beyond his lips, where it dripped from time to time on to his chest, he found it was more comfortably housed within the oozing confines of his mouth. Horrible. But he was acquiring the knack of steering his new form. He was a quick learner. What troubled him was the need to set about his business. There were important decisions to be taken. Suddenly, a movement on the floor caught his attention. It was a little creature, in his own previous form, no doubt the displaced owner of the body he now inhabited. He watched with a degree of protective interest as the tiny thing struggled over the strands of pile carpet, towards the door. There it hesitated, its twin antennae waving uncertainly with all of a beginner’s ineptitude. Finally, it gathered its courage and stumbled under the door to begin a difficult, perilous descent. It was a long way back to the palace, and there would be much danger along the way. But if it made it without being squashed underfoot, it would find, behind the palace panelling or below the floorboards, safety and solace among millions of its siblings. He wished it well. But now he must attend to his own concerns.And yet Jim did not stir. Nothing made sense, all movement was pointless until he could piece together the journey, the events, that had led him to an unfamiliar bedroom. After that chance meal he had scuttled along, barely conscious of the bustle above him, minding his own business as he hugged the shadows of the gutter, though for how long and how far was beyond recall. What he knew for certain was that he reached at last an obstacle that towered over him, a small mountain of dung, still warm and faintly steaming. Any other time, he would have rejoiced. He regarded himself as something of a connoisseur. He knew how to live well. This particular consignment he could instantly place. Who could mistake that nutty aroma, with hints of petroleum, banana skin and saddle soap. The Horse Guards! But what a mistake, to have eaten between meals. The margherita had left him with no appetite for excrement, however fresh or distinguished, nor any inclination, given his gathering exhaustion, to clamber all the way over it. He crouched in the mountain’s shadow, on the springy ground of its foothills, and considered his options. After a moment’s reflection, it was clear what he must do. He set about scaling the vertical granite wall of the kerb in order to circumvent the heap and descend on its far side.Reclining now in the attic bedroom, he decided that this was the point at which he had parted company with his own free will, or the illusion of it, and had come under the influence of a greater, guiding force. Mounting the pavement, as he did, he submitted to the collective spirit. He was a tiny element in a scheme of a magnitude that no single inidual could comprehend.He heaved himself on to the top of the kerb, noting that the droppings extended a third of the way across the pavement. Then, out of nowhere, there came down upon him a sudden storm, the thunder of 10,000 feet, and chants and bells, whistles and trumpets. Yet another rowdy demonstration. So late in the evening. Loutish people making trouble when they should have been at home. Nowadays, these protests were staged almost every week. Disrupting vital services, preventing ordinary decent types from going about their lawful business. He froze on the kerb, expecting to be squashed at any moment. The soles of shoes 15 times his own length slammed the ground inches from where he cowered and made his antennae and the pavement tremble. How fortunate for him that at one point he chose to look up, entirely in the spirit of fatalism. He was prepared to die. But that was when he saw an opportunity – a gap in the procession. The next wave of protesters was 50 yards away. He saw their banners streaming, their flags bearing down, yellow stars on a blue ground. Union Jacks too. He had never scuttled so fast in his life. Breathing hard through all the trachea on his body segments, he gained the other side by a heavy iron gate seconds before they were on him again with thunderclaps of hideous tramping, and now catcalls and savage drumbeats. Seized by mortal fear and indignation, an inconvenient mix, he darted off the pavement and, to save his life, squeezed under the gate into the sanctuary and relative tranquillity of a side street where he instantly recognised the heel of a standard issue policeman’s boot. Reassuring, as ever.Then what? He proceeded along the empty pavement, past a row of exclusive residences. Here he was surely fulfilling the plan. The collective pheromonal unconscious of his kind bestowed on him an instinctive understanding of his direction of travel. After half an hour of uneventful progress, he paused, as he was meant to do. On the far side of the street was a group of a hundred or so photographers and reporters. On his side, he was level with and close by a door, outside which stood yet another policeman. And just then, that door swung open and a woman in high heels stepped out, almost spearing him right through his ninth and tenth abdominal segments. The door remained open. Perhaps a visitor was arriving. In those few seconds Jim looked into a welcoming, softly lit hallway, with skirting boards somewhat scuffed – always a good sign. On a sudden impulse that he now knew was not his own, he ran in.He was doing well, given his unusual circumstances, lying on this unfamiliar bed, to recall such details. It was good to know that his brain, his mind, was much as it had always been. He remained, after all, his essential self. It was the surprising presence of a cat that had caused him to run, not in the direction of the skirting boards, but towards the stairs. He climbed three and looked back. The cat, a brown and white tabby, had not seen him, but Jim considered it dangerous to descend. So began his long climb. On the first floor there were too many people walking along the landing, in and out of rooms. More prospect of being trodden to death. An hour later, when he reached the second floor, the carpets were being vigorously vacuumed. He knew of many souls who had been lost that way, sucked into dusty oblivion. No choice but to keep on climbing until – but now, suddenly, here in the attic, all his thoughts were obliterated by the harsh ringing of one of the bedside telephones. Even though he found that he could at last move one of his limbs, an arm, he did not stir. He couldn’t trust his voice. And even if he could, what would he say? I’m not who you think I am? After four rings the phone went silent.He lay back and allowed his frantic heart to settle. He practised moving his legs. At last, they stirred. But barely an inch. He tried again with an arm, and raised it until it towered far above his head. So, back to the story. He had heaved himself up the last step to arrive breathless on the top landing. He squeezed under the nearest door into a small apartment. Usually, he would have made straight for the kitchen but instead he climbed a bedpost and, utterly depleted, crept under a pillow. He must have slept deeply for – but now, dammit, there came a tapping sound and before he could respond, the door to the bedroom was opening. A young woman in a beige trouser suit stood on the threshold and gave a brisk nod before entering.“I tried phoning but I thought I’d better come up. Prime minister, it’s almost 7.30.”He could think of no response.The woman, clearly an aide of some kind, came into the room and picked up the empty bottle. Her manner was rather too familiar.“Quite an evening, I see.”It would not have done to remain silent for long. From his bed he aimed for an inarticulate sound, somewhere between a groan and a croak. Not bad. Higher pitched than he would have wanted, with a hint of a chirrup, but plausible enough.The aide was gesturing towards the larger table, at the red boxes. “I don’t suppose you had a chance to, uh…”He played it safe by making the same sound again, this time on a lower note.“Perhaps after breakfast you could take a … I should remind you. It’s Wednesday. Cabinet at nine. Priorities for government and PMQs at noon.”Prime Minister’s Questions. How many of those he had crouched through, listening enthralled from behind the rotten wainscoting in the company of a few thousand select acquaintances? How familiar he was with the opposition leader’s shouted questions, the brilliant non sequitur replies, the festive jeers and clever imitations of sheep. It would be a dream come true, to be primo uomo in the weekly operetta. But was he adequately prepared? No less than anyone else, surely. Not after a quick glance at the papers. Like many of his kind, he rather fancied himself at the dispatch box. He would be fast on his feet, even though he only had two.In the space where once he sported a fine mandible, the unwholesome slab of dense tissue stirred and his first human word rolled out.“I’ll have your coffee ready downstairs.”He had often sipped coffee in the dead of night on the tea room floor. It tended to keep him awake in the day, but he enjoyed the taste and preferred it milky, with four sugars. He assumed this was generally known by his staff.As soon as the aide had left the room, he pushed away the covers and managed at last to swing his tuberous legs on to the carpet. He stood at last at a vertiginous height, swaying slightly, with his soft, pale hands pressed to his forehead, and groaning again. Minutes later, making his unsteady way towards the bathroom, those same hands began nimbly to remove his pyjamas. He stepped out of them to stand on pleasantly heated tiles. It rather amused him, passing water thunderously into a specially prepared ceramic bowl, and his spirits lifted. But when he turned to confront the mirror over the handbasin, they sank again. The bristling oval disk of a face, wobbling on a thick pink stalk of neck, repelled him. The pinprick eyes shocked him. The inflated rim of darker flesh that framed an array of off-white teeth disgusted him. But I’m here for a proud cause and I’ll put up with anything, he reassured himself as he watched his hands turn the taps and reach for his shaving brush and soap.Five minutes later he felt nauseated as he paused, still swaying, before the prospect of putting on the clothes laid out for him. His own sort took great pride in their beautiful, gleaming bodies and would never have thought to cover them up. White underpants, black socks, a blue and white striped shirt, dark suit, black shoes. He observed with detachment the automatic speed with which his hands tied his laces, and then, back at the bathroom mirror, his tie. As he combed his gingery brown hair, he noticed with sudden homesickness that it was the same colour as his good old shell. At least something has survived of my looks, was his melancholy thought as, finally, he stood at the top of the stairs.He began a dizzying descent, trusting his legs to carry him down safely as he had his hands to shave and dress him. He kept a firm grip on the bannisters, smothering a groan at each step. As he crossed the landings, where there were hairpin turns, he clung on with both hands. He could have passed for a man with a hangover. But what had taken an hour to climb up took only seven minutes to climb down. Waiting for him in the hallway at the foot of the stairs was a group of very young men and women, each holding a folder. Respectfully they murmured, “Good morning, prime minister,” in a soft, uneven chorus. None of them dared look at him directly while they waited for him to speak.He cleared his throat and managed to say, “Let’s get on, shall we.” He was stuck for any further remark, but luckily a fellow, older than the rest and wearing a suit as expensive-looking as his own, pushed through and, seizing Jim by the elbow, propelled him along the corridor.A door swung open and they went through. “Your coffee’s in here.”They were in the Cabinet room. Halfway down the long table by the largest chair was a tray of coffee, which the prime minister approached with such avidity that over the last few steps he broke into a run. He hoped to arrive ahead of his companion and snatch a moment with the sugar bowl. But by the time he was lowering himself into the chair, with minimal decorum, his coffee was being poured. There was no sugar on the tray. Not even milk. But in the grey shadow cast by his saucer, visible only to him, was a dying bluebottle. Every few seconds its wings trembled. With some effort, Jim wrenched his gaze away while he listened. He was beginning to think he might sneeze.“About the 1922 Committee. The usual bloody suspects.”When the bluebottle’s wings shook they made the softest rustle of acquiescence.“I’m glad you weren’t there.”When a bluebottle has been dead for more than 10 minutes it tastes impossibly bitter. Barely alive or just deceased, it has a cheese flavour. Stilton, mostly.“It’s a mutiny. And all over the morning papers.”There was nothing to be done. The prime minister had to sneeze. He had felt it building. Probably the lack of dust. He gripped the chair. For an explosive instant he thought he had passed out.“Bless you. There was talk of a no-confidence vote.”When he opened his unhelpfully lidded eyes, the fly had gone. Blown away. “Fuck.”“That’s what I thought.”“Where is it? I mean, where’s the sense in –”“The usual. You’re a closet Clockwiser. Not with the Project. Not a true go-it-alone man. Getting nothing through parliament. Zero backbone. That sort of thing.”Jim drew his cup and saucer towards him. No. He lifted the stainless steel pot. Not under there either.“I’m as Reversalist as any of them.”By his silence his special adviser, if that was what he was, appeared to disagree. Then he said, “We need a plan. And quick.”It was only now that the Welsh accent was evident. Wales? A small country far to the west, hilly, rain-sodden, treacherous. Jim was finding that he knew things, different things. He knew differently. His understanding, like his vision, was narrowed. He lacked the broad and instant union with the entirety of his kind, the boundless resource of the oceanic pheromonal. But he had finally remembered in full his designated mission.“What do you suggest?”There came a loud single rap, the door opened and a tall man with a generous jaw, bottle-black swept-back hair and pinstripe suit strode in.“Jim, Simon. Mind if I join you? Bad news. Encryption just in from –”Simon interrupted. “Benedict, this is private. Kindly bugger off.”Without a shift in expression, the foreign secretary turned and left the room, closing the door behind him with exaggerated care.“What I resent,” Simon said, “about these privately educated types is their sense of entitlement. Excluding you, of course.”“Quite. What’s the plan?”“You’ve said it yourself. Take a step towards the hardliners, they scream for more. Give them what they want, they piss on you. Things go wrong with the Project, they blame anyone and everyone. Especially you.”“There’s a wobble in the public mood. The focus groups are telling a new story. Our pollster phoned in the results last night. There’s general weariness. Creeping fear of the unknown. Anxiety about what they voted for, what they’ve unleashed.’“I heard about those results,” the prime minister lied. It was important to maintain face.“Here’s the point. We should isolate the hardliners. Confidence motion my arse! Prorogue parliament for a few months. Astound the bastards. Or even better, change tack. Swing –”“I mean it. You’ve got to swing –”“Yes! Parliament will fall at your feet. You’ll have a majority – just.”“But the will of the p–”“Fuck the lot of them. Gullible wankers. It’s a parliamentary democracy and you’re in charge. The house is stalled. The country’s tearing itself apart. We had that ultra-Reversalist beheading a Clockwise MP in a supermarket. A Clockwise yob pouring milkshake over a high-profile Reversalist.”“That was shocking,” the prime minister agreed. “His blazer had only just been cleaned.”“The whole thing’s a mess. Jim, time to call it off.” Then he added softly, “It’s in your power.”The PM stared into his adviser’s face, taking it in for the first time. It was narrow and long, hollow at the temples, with little brown eyes and a tight rosebud mouth. He had a grey three-day beard and wore trainers and a black silk suit over a Superman T-shirt.“What you’re saying is very interesting,” the PM said at last.“It’s my job to keep you in office and this is the only way.”“It’d be a… a…” Jim struggled for the word. He knew several variants in pheromone, but they were fading. Then he had it. “A U-turn!”“Not quite. I’ve been back through some of your speeches. Enough there to get you off the hook. Difficulties. Doubts. Delays. Sort of stuff the hardliners hate you for. Shirley can prepare the ground.”“Very interesting indeed.” Jim stood up and stretched.“I need to talk to Shirley myself before Cabinet. And I’ll need a few minutes alone.”He began to walk round the long table towards the door. He was coming to feel some pleasure in his stride and a new sense of control. Improbable as it had seemed, it was possible to feel stable on only two feet. It hardly bothered him to be so far off the ground. And he was glad now not to have eaten a bluebottle in another man’s presence. It might not have gone down well.Simon said, “I’ll wait for your thoughts, then.”Jim reached the door and let the fingers of one strange hand rest lightly on the handle. Yes, he could drive this soft new machine. He turned, taking pleasure in doing it slowly, until he was facing the adviser, who had not moved from his chair.“You can have them now. I want your resignation letter on my desk within the half hour and I want you out of the building by 11.”• This is an extract from Ian McEwan’s latest book, The Cockroach, which will be published on 27 September by Vintage (£7.99).

The ingredient choices include rose petals and cocoa nibs and there is the option to coat the fingers in ruby chocolate. It has also produced “special edition” flavours – a surprising line-up that includes marmalade, Earl Grey and “whisky \u0026amp ginger”.Cheryl Allen, who heads KitKat in the UK, said it was a good time to try something new because there was a lot of “buzz” around brand following Instagram-friendly updates such as matcha green tea flavour and ruby chocolate that appealed to younger consumers.“KitKat was launched in the 1930s and one of the reasons it has endured for so long is because it has been able to evolve,” said Allen. “These are luxury, handcrafted chocolates and I think it will positively surprise people how far you can stretch this brand.”But a luxury KitKat comes with a luxury price tag. The 150g eight-fingered bespoke bars – which will be made to order in Yorkshire – cost £14 (a 41.5g four-fingered KitKat usually costs 65p). The special editions start at £7.50.Consumers are gravitating towards craft products, a shift that has created a market for posh versions of everything from mixer drinks to gin and beer. The same trend is obvious in confectionery where incumbents are being forced to rethink their models as fast-growing companies such as Hotel Chocolat bring luxury chocolate to the high street. This is the first time Nestlé’s confectionery arm has launched a direct to consumer business in the UK.Nestlé has borrowed Chocolatory from Japan where it already runs KitKat boutiques under that name. What is a popular tea dunker in the UK is a different biscuit in Japan where it has an upmarket image. It is a popular good luck present (the name resembles kitto katsu which means “you will surely win” in Japanese) and since the millennium more than 300 flavours, including sake, edamame bean and wasabi, have been developed for the gift-giving culture.With customised gifts also a huge trend – named jars of Marmite and tins of Quality Street have been big Christmas hits in recent years – it is also possible to put a message on the KitKat box.John Lewis gift food buyer Rachel Costello predicted they would be popular stocking fillers: “I think our customers will love these exciting new flavours and the experience of making their own KitKat.” A 2,000 sq ft pop-up shop opens in its Oxford Street store next on 1 October. It is also stocking special edition Kitkats in 30 shops."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f404202ca3ce61df55c6f1016c2d985b50e3e793/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6d776c844a8164d294c199a4aeaea45","title":"thomas cook as the world turned the sun ceased to shine on venerable tour operator","story":"Woeful merger, sky-high debts and internet revolution all left the venerable firm strugglingWhy did Thomas Cook fail after 178 years in business? The immediate answer is that it was unable to secure a £200m lifeline from its bankers, including government-owned RBS.But in truth the tour operator’s woes go back much further – a victim of a disastrous merger in 2007, ballooning debts and the internet revolution in holiday booking. Add in Brexit uncertainty, and it was perhaps only a matter of time before the giant of the industry collapsed.In May, the group reported a £1.5bn loss, with more than £1bn written off from the 2007 merger with MyTravel – better known for its brands Airtours and Going Places.That deal was supposed to create a European giant, promising £75m-a-year cost savings and a springboard to challenge emerging internet rivals. In reality Thomas Cook was merging with a company that had only made a profit once in the previous six years, and the deal saddled the group with huge debts.The beneficiaries are Ryanair, easyJet and Airbnb, with all of their customers booking online. The losers are package holiday companies shackled to expensive high street chains. Thomas Cook owns about 560 high street outlets.Just one in seven of us now pop into a high street travel agency to buy a holiday, according to travel agent trade body Abta. Those who do tend to be over 65, and in lower socio-economic groups, with less money to spend.Anglo-German group Tui, Thomas Cook’s biggest rival, has suffered from similar trends, issuing several profit warnings during 2019. But it has much smaller debts, owning many of its own hotels and cruise ships, and arguably could see an uplift as it takes on former Thomas Cook customers, at higher prices.The climate crisis has also had an impact. A Europe-wide heatwave in May 2018 reduced holiday demand sharply, as customers delayed holiday decisions while enjoying record temperatures at home. Then in 2019, Thomas Cook said British customers were postponing travel plans for the summer because of worsening uncertainty around Brexit – and the way it has hit sterling’s buying power abroad.Thomas Cook only narrowly survived a near-death experience in 2011. Its debt pile had already reached £1.1bn, and it stayed afloat only after an emergency additional cash injection - but it also meant even more debt to service.Since 2011 Thomas Cook has paid out £1.2bn in interest, which meant that more than a quarter of the money it charged for the 11m holidays it sold every year went into the pockets of lenders.There was – for a couple of years at least – a corporate saviour, in the form of Chinese group Fosun International, run by Guo Guangchang, a billionaire regarded as China’s Warren Buffett.Fosun bought its first stake in Thomas Cook in 2015, as part of a plan to build a global holiday and entertainment conglomerate, having already taken over France’s Club Med and Canada’s Cirque de Soleil.In August Thomas Cook published details of a planned restructure, which included a £450m cash injection from Fosun in return for a majority stake in the group – which also required the banks to write off £1.7bn in debt. Other existing shareholders would be wiped out.It was that deal that fell apart at the weekend. It was not surprising that the axe fell in late September like most tour operators, Thomas Cook enjoys revenue inflows in the first half of the year as holidaymakers book their summer breaks, but sizeable outflows in autumn and winter when flight and hotel arrangements must be paid for.Some yearn for nationalisation. Critics say the cost of rescue flights and compensation may far outweigh the £200m that Thomas Cook needed to survive another day. But the government refused to step in, arguing that, like failed airline Monarch, it was purely a commercial matter at an inidual business and that customers would be protected by the Atol protection scheme and insurance.How different it was 70 years ago. Thomas Cook was considered such a part of the fabric of British life that it was nationalised in 1948, after facing bankruptcy during the second world war. It remained in public hands, as part of British Railways, until 1972. But now it has been destroyed largely by the internet and changing fashions, hastened along by trying to finance an impossible burden of debt."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/925b8940038c7e8af6799ddb87b2e390b52f7999/0_177_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a630f084d0250791b33810ab87720874","title":"organise to resist the radical posters of the paddington printshop","story":"Operating from an old factory in north-west London, John Phillips and the Paddington Printshop revolutionised the promotion of squatters’ rights and housing campaigns throughout the 1970s and 80sJohn Phillips opened the Paddington Printshop in an old taxi-meter factory off the Harrow Road in 1974, and began making event and campaign posters for everybody “from the vicar to the anarchists” – what Phillips describes as the entire “rainbow coalition” of leftwing interests.In addition to promoting such international causes such as the anti-apartheid movement, many of its posters were about local housing issues in this particular corner of west London, including squatters’ rights, housing associations, hostile developers and derelict land.Customers were charged at different rates: squatters simply covered the cost of material, while groups receiving grants were asked to pay a little more. Posters were generally “double crown” – that’s 20” by 30” – and screen-printed in runs of between 150 and 300 before being plastered around nearby streets.“The style was fairly eclectic,” says Phillips. “We wanted to help people express themselves or find a form of expression for the campaign that was appropriate. Many of them hadn’t picked up a pencil since childhood. For the left in those days there were only two colours in their vocabulary – red and black – and many of their images were from the 1930s, so we were trying to open people up to contemporary images.”As well as providing a dash of background colour, the posters helped reshape the landscape of the area. One dramatic example was the creation of Meanwhile Gardens, a playground carved out of derelict land.“That was our friend the artist Jamie McCullough,” says Phillips. “He had this idea you could shape wasteland with a JCB like a sculpture. We made posters, helped set up a charity and found the workforce. Through the studio we had a very wide social network and were able to use that to help projects like Meanwhile. It was intended to be temporary, hence the name.”Another major campaign saw Phillips create the Iron Man – a businessman with the face of a digger. It began in 1986 when Westminster council tried to sell the Walterton and Elgin estates to a private developer. This happened to be the area where the Paddington Printshop was then located, and Phillips worked alongside residents to fight back, creating a range of images to support the campaign.Other posters addressed two related issues – squatters and empty homes. North Kensington had numerous squats. There were dozens in Elgin Avenue, where Piers Corbyn was based, while the 101’ers were named after the squat at 101 Walterton Road.Over in Freston Road, the writer and activist Heathcote Williams helped create the independent republic of Frestonia, which attempted to secede from the UK. Phillips printed posters for squatter benefits for Frestonia for campaigns against a proposed criminal trespass law that people feared would make squatting a criminal rather than civil offence and for a squatters advisory service that offered the squatting community legal advice as well as acting as an underground estate agent, spreading the word about empty properties.Another campaign came at the problem from a different angle. While the squatters were largely white and middle-class, poorer residents, many from black communities, were desperate for secure and clean rented accommodation. Posters called out poor housing conditions, shaming housing associations and councils.“The ‘red cross’ campaign began with people who were on the housing association boards and wanted their organisations to refurbish properties rather than buy to invest,” Phillips says. “They would give the addresses of empty properties to community workers. We’d then spray them with biblical red crosses and use posters to explain what it meant. Then the board members would attend board meeting and say ‘have you seen what’s happening out there…?’ It became a national issue.”The print shop continued to produce posters for the local community – concerts, the Notting Hill carnival and festivals – alongside more radical topics, but community activities tapered off in the 1980s as the sector’s funding dried up.The print shop formally closed in 1991 when Phillips transferred the assets to a new charitable organisation, London Print Studio. Based at 425 Harrow Road, it continues to work on community projects as well as with artists, galleries and educational institutions. Phillips made a poster for Grenfell but otherwise rarely works in that medium today.“There was a strong poster culture then,” he says. “People thought about posters and owned them and understood them. There isn’t a poster culture now. Our posters contributed to campaigns. They indicated to the council and public that these were strong organisations they were up against and they contributed significantly to internal morale.”Posters from Paddington Printshop is published by Four Corners BooksFollow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60065c691b0ba7bfc9cd95a789eaf280effb3e9b/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78974de5e4c181467e738c4f14a13cff 700w","title":"ancient turkish town of hasankeyf begins to disappear under water in pictures","story":"The small town of Hasankeyf, in Turkey’s Kurdish-majority south-east, is doomed to disappear in the coming months after being inhabited for 12,000 years.

Saudi Arabia is accustomed to buying labour that it deems too menial for its citizens, and it extends that philosophy to its army.There is always a poorer country ready to send cannon fodder for the right price. The military assault in Yemen is sometimes referred to as “the Arab coalition”, a respectable term for a Saudi-led group of combatants that, in addition to allies in the Gulf, includes forces from Egypt, Jordan and Morocco, as well as Sudanese child soldiers, whose deaths are handsomely compensated for with cash paid to their families back home. When asked what fighting in Yemen under the command of the Saudis had been like, some returning Sudanese troops said that Saudi military leaders, feeling themselves too precious to advance too close to the frontline, had given clumsy instructions by satellite phones to their hired troops, nudging them in the general direction of hostilities. Where things were too treacherous, Saudi and coalition airforces simply dropped bombs from high-flying planes, inflating civilian casualties. This is how Saudi fights: as remotely as possible, and paying others to die.It is baffling, in the light of last week’s attacks on two Saudi oil facilities, that there is so much speculation about Saudi and Iran going to war. Saudi does not “go to war”: it hires proxies, and depends on US gullibility to continue the lie that it is the regional peacekeeper, and that any threat to the country destabilises the region. The US and Saudi Arabia have repeatedly accused Iran of being behind the attacks, which were claimed by Yemen’s Houthi movement, a group aligned with Iran and fighting the Saudi-led alliance in Yemen’s civil war. The Pentagon has announced that it will be sending hundreds of US troops, in addition to air and missile defence equipment, to Saudi Arabia as a “defensive” move. Why does a country that was the world’s largest arms importer from 2014 to 2018, according to a report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, need so much help? What, then, does a country that is involved in one military campaign, in Yemen, and which appears so vulnerable to attack and in need of constant protection, do with so many weapons? Buying the weapons, rather than deploying them, is the point. These multimillion-dollar purchases maintain commercial relations with western allies from whom it imports arms, and who in return turn a blind eye to Saudi’s human rights abuses, assassinations and kidnappings, because there is too much money at stake. Saudi Arabia’s entire foreign policy model is based on using its wealth to buy friends and silence.And so Saudi must continue to play on US fears about Iran, ensuring that its bodyguard is always “locked and loaded”, as Trump stated in a sabre-rattling tweet after the drone strikes. At the same time, Saudi continues to destabilise the region by meddling in the internal affairs of other Arab countries, passing on arms to other dictatorships in the Middle East and North Africa, and launching aggressive social media intimidation and disinformation campaigns. Even Twitter clamped down on Saudi accounts last week. And still the country is perceived to be a vulnerable innocent, a bulwark against chaos in the Middle East. Bellicose in the extreme, and yet aware that it is highly unlikely to suffer the consequences of its pugnaciousness, Saudi is currently locked in escalating conflicts with Iran, Qatar and Yemen, propping up military regimes in Sudan and Egypt, messily meddling in Lebanon, and continuing to fund random Sunni hardline endeavours all over the world – and generally getting away with it. Saudi will not go to war with Iran, but the US may do so on its behalf. Meanwhile, Saudi looks on – as ever, the indulged and unpunished provocateur of the Middle East."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/121448642e99b755bf4f453a0fb8de077f0149ac/0_127_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=69adc907a6952acf2e33594fde5f4f03","title":"britain common ground hope media brexit division","story":"Media-fuelled Brexit isions have created a culture of mutual loathing. Grassroots initiatives can help bring us together “I’ve given up watching the news,” said the man in the other room. “It’s all lies.”We were both in a hi-fi shop in Bath – me immersed in an arcane conversation about amplifiers, while he asked for help with his internet-enabled flatscreen television. He was sixtysomething, with the look of someone being endlessly annoyed by the world, or what he saw of it. These days, he said, all his information about current affairs came from online videos. What, I wondered, was he watching? Claims of faked bombings in Syria? False warnings about the dangers of vaccines? Or labyrinthine theories about the global cabal intent on stopping Brexit?Here, it seemed, was an example of something self-evident but also endlessly overlooked: the fact that, as our Darwinian economy has pushed various parts of society apart, the most bog-standard technology has even further eroded the common ground that the most basic notions of democracy – and even civilisation – depend on.YouTube, along with the usual social media platforms, is hardly the only problem. Last week Channel 4’s chief executive, Alex Mahon, gave a speech at the Royal Television Society that was focused on the increasing power of such streaming services as Amazon Prime and Netflix. “The global telly of the future will not be – and isn’t being – designed to reflect Britain back to itself, to bring the nation together at particular moments, to inform and educate a particular society or to care about promoting any kind of social cohesion,” she said. Put the kinds of media together, and things look bleak: if we’re not careful, people will soon be watching hopelessly partisan outlets for questionable “news”. Meanwhile, politicians will rejoice in the fact that the traditional media they often encourage their supporters to loathe – with its insistence on long interviews, and something approaching proper scrutiny – will at last be only a marginal part of the political game.As evidenced by the Tories’ frantic electioneering on Facebook, the supposedly looming election looks set to mark another big step into this new world. Meanwhile, as these changes gather pace, some people in the established media already seem so terrified that they have reduced their old obligations to report, explain and enlighten. Instead of giving a sense of what is actually going on in the world, too much current affairs broadcasting now consists of online agitators yelling at each other in person, while some high-profile presenters regularly join the crowd of belligerents. So long as some kind of balance is maintained, the veneer of what used to be called public service broadcasting might be just about sustained. Up close, it is nothing of the kind.Which brings us to Brexit. The idea that the referendum of 2016 could have settled the questions it was designed to answer – not just about our membership of the EU, but also what kind of country we collectively wished to be – is now so laughable as to seem completely absurd. Clearly, it did the absolute reverse: thanks to our polarising mediascape and the UK’s awful inequalities and imbalances, it simply hardened the ision between a broadly liberal constituency and a coalition of people from both post-industrial places and more wealthy areas who have a more conservative, nationalistic view of the world – and then gave each camp a word to describe itself. Three years on, the gap between hardcore leavers and remainers is still widening. If there is any hope, it lies with the weary millions who sit somewhere in the middle, but they still seem too disengaged to make their voices heard.“Bringing the country back together” is the political cliche of 2019. But in the midst of all the polarised noise, just about every mainstream political response to the Brexit crisis looks like it will either further our isions, or leave things much as they are. The Tories’ embrace of the headless politics of no deal, coupled with the picking of fights clearly designed to show they mean it, is by far the most egregious example. By way of a mirror-image, the Liberal Democrats’ new belief in ignoring the referendum result simply encourages the most partisan remainers to rejoice in ision and self-righteousness. Labour’s belated offer of a second referendum – with, if Jeremy Corbyn gets his way, the party’s position to be decided by a “special conference” some time after the election – is probably the best thing on offer. But does anyone seriously think that another referendum campaign and a public vote would really settle the furies that Brexit has kicked up? In the absence of a no-deal option Nigel Farage and the Brexit party, using their online expertise, alongside Tory Brexiteers, would decry the whole thing as illegitimate. And whatever the result, the losing side would hardly be likely to go quiet.There are flashes of hope, nonetheless. Travelling around, I see them in the nitty-gritty community initiatives that bring people together, and cut across the idea that we are all hopelessly estranged in the new breed of town and parish councils that want nothing to do with ideological war, and spend their time patiently making improvements to places in the droves of people who are unfamiliar with the latest Twitter controversy, and are keener to talk about their yearning for community and security. In that same spirit, we need more programmes like the BBC Two documentary series The Mighty Redcar, and less like Question Time. A lot of us need a renewed willingness to see things from the other side’s perspective, and rediscover the common humanity and acceptance of compromise that so often seems to be lacking from everyday politics. One obvious example: if you have stopped talking to a friend or relative because they voted leave, it is probably time you gave them a call. You could maybe have a conversation about whether – in the midst of all this chaos and strife – something like Theresa May’s original withdrawal agreement would really be that bad.Perhaps, as some of Labour’s more devout supporters think, a Corbyn-led government might successfully get to grips with Britain’s basic problems and start to heal our wounds. Although, judging by the events of the weekend, putting those people in charge might threaten to add even more ision and acrimony to the helping we have already.If there is even the faintest chance of some kind of collective pushback against our growing culture of mutual loathing, it needs to begin with recognition of how it is sustained. When I talk to people with the most passionate political opinions, I often have the feeling of moving between different universes. One question is always obligatory: where do you get your information? In response, more and more people reach for their phones, open YouTube, Facebook or Twitter and show a tweet or meme that has reaffirmed their prejudices and added to all those northern Californian fortunes.In 2017 Mark Zuckerberg said his company’s mission was to “give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together”. Even in an age of such rampant absurdity, that is surely among the most ridiculous things anyone has ever said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea17a7aefe0ee7bbc5a3dc04bd68be7464a3dbec/1255_0_4745_2847/master/4745.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1690c14abcc1401d9ea89b4512305f7","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of bored","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘bored’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘bored’.Share your photos of what bored means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 25 September at 10am.

And it followed Rayner’s announcement that Labour would overhaul school inspections in England by abolishing Ofsted, a proposal that received a mixed welcome by teachers and prompted accusations of lowering standards by its opponents.Sunday’s controversial step on private schools, which would represent a existential threat to their dominance of the most influential roles in the establishment, was greeted enthusiastically by the Abolish Eton campaign, which has pushed the issue up the party’s agenda.Holly Rigby, a campaign organiser and state school teacher said: “This is a really positive moment for the Labour party because it’s the strongest commitment that the party has made to deal with the problem of private schools in a very long time. It’s a really radical commitment as well … This is a really big victory for the left.”But Julie Robinson, the chief executive of the Independent Schools Council, which represents about 1,000 private schools in England including Eton, said Labour’s vote was an attack on the rights of parents.“Tearing down excellent schools does not improve our education system. The repercussions would be irreversible and far-reaching, damaging educational opportunities and limiting life chances. Moreover, Labour’s plan would breach the European Convention on Human Rights on the right to choose education,” Robinson said.Rayner said she backed the efforts, and said that a new social justice commission would be tasked with integrating private schools into the state system.“Our very first budget will immediately close the tax loopholes used by elite private schools and use that money to improve the lives of all children,” Rayner said.Labour also set out a major shake up of Ofsted, with Rayner telling conference delegates in Brighton: “Schools will no longer be reduced to a one-word grade or subjected to a system that hounds teachers from the classroom.”Instead Rayner promised “a new system of peer review will deliver school improvement led by the experts in our schools who can achieve more working together for the common good”.The survey also found little support among teachers for Ofsted in its current form. Mary Bousted, the co-head of the National Education Union, gave Labour’s plans a forceful endorsement, saying Ofsted was unfit for its purpose. “Teachers and school leaders know from bitter experience that too many Ofsted inspectors have neither the knowledge or professional experience to come to accurate judgements of schools,” she said.But Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, accused Labour of pursuing dogma that would leave children at greater risk.“Labour are putting ideology before the education of our children. Parents will be rightly fearful of Corbyn’s plans to abolish independent inspections, scrap Sats and destroy academies and free schools. Labour would weaken discipline, lower standards and reduce choice and information for parents,” Williamson said in response to the Ofsted announcement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64010ecbea26f4033fa0272c9507290162db7542/0_0_3800_2280/master/3800.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f288877976db3f5af2adb2fecece24ae","title":"judy garland biopic movie renee zellweger","story":"A new biopic sees Renée Zellweger star as Judy Garland, an actor who revolutionised LGBT fandomThere’s a touching scene in the new movie Judy (as in Garland), when the legendary trouper, played by Renée Zellweger, meets two gay fans after her London show and invites herself back to theirs for dinner. After a comically disastrous meal, the tone turns melancholy, as Garland laments her unhappy life and her hosts reflect on theirs, as closeted partners in pre-legalisation 1960s Britain. It’s a little moment of solidarity that gets to the heart of Garland’s gay appeal.Judy Garland didn’t simply tick the boxes for “gay icon”, she created those boxes: child stardom, tragic life, big showtunes, drag-friendly stage persona, addictions, comebacks, having sung Over the Rainbow. Not to mention her unfortunate habit of marrying men who turned out to prefer other men (weirdly, her daughter Liza Minnelli did the same). But as that scene in Judy underscores, it was a different era.Even in her lifetime, Garland’s gay following was remarked upon, often in sneering and homophobic ways. “She has the power that homosexuals would like to have, and they attempt to attain it by idolising her,” a psychiatrist helpfully explained in a Time magazine article in 1967, which observed how many of Garland’s fans were “boys in tight trousers”. When a TV interviewer later brought up the article, Garland defended her fans: “I’ve been misquoted and rather brutally treated by the press but I’ll be damned if I like to have my audience mistreated.”Has it become easier to attain gay icon status today? Maybe you only need to tick a few of those boxes, rather than going the full Garland. Cultivating a gay fanbase can be a shrewd career move for a straight performer: just ask Kylie, or Taylor Swift. Or Renée Zellweger, who attended this July’s Pride parade in London, where she unveiled a new trailer for Judy. Is that solidarity or opportunism?One key difference, perhaps, is that it is now possible to have gay icons who are actually gay themselves. But while we reward actors (often straight ones) for portraying gay icons on the screen, LGBTQ performers are still punished for their sexuality by the industry. Just this month we have had Cara Delevingne revealing that Harvey Weinstein once told her: “You will never make it in this industry as a gay woman – get a beard.” And Kristen Stewart saying she was told she might get a Marvel movie if she didn’t hold hands publicly with her girlfriend so much. Many a modern LGBTQ actor has told a similar story: Ellen Page, Rupert Everett, Ezra Miller and Sarah Paulson to name a few.As with Judy Garland, that cherished “icon” status is often bound up with suffering. It is recognition not just for being fabulous, but for having paid a price. We’re not over that rainbow yet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44c85845ea0d39fdfbcedec8fbe1b5092def5e5f/0_3382_6192_3715/master/6192.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6644ed7cb3667c84420d4e5fa81c98f6","title":"observer food monthly 20 best easy autumn recipes","story":"Anna Jones’s apple and pear crisp and Claudia Roden’s tagliatelle – our favourite recipes for when the nights draw inOf an occasional Sunday evening, Dad would make the most delicious mushrooms on toast. Well, actually, he didn’t make toast rather, he would make the most delicious, perfect squares of immaculately fried bread. It seems obvious when you think about it, for however well-toasted is a slice of bread – even the most accommodating of crusty sourdough – it will, inevitably, begin to slightly sog about halfway through munching. But a nicely thick slice of fried bread will hold its own until the last mouthful.

Bbut she did fry the bread. . … though possibly not as well as did her son. His trick was to lightly spread each surface with a smear of good dripping, then fry it on each side in a dry frying pan until super-crisp. His mushrooms were always button, cut in half, stewed in butter, a dusting of flour added and then milk stirred in until a smooth, thick-ish sauce was achieved if there was some cream (or top-of-milk) in the fridge, a spoonful or two of that to finish. I have always believed he wanted to recreate that can of Chesswood’s but simply because our mother would never have countenanced such slovenly convenience, he made them his own.Shall we upgrade a little?

After an hour, remove the chicken, place it on an ovenproof dish and return to the oven to crisp the skin.Meanwhile, sieve the juices from the pot and reduce on the hob until syrupy, then reserve to serve with the roasted bird.Thanks to Fine Food Specialist for sourcing the quincesThis is everything I want in an autumn pudding.

Toss them with the maple syrup in a roasting tray and cover the tray with foil. Roast for 15 minutes in the hot oven, then remove the foil and roast for a further 10 minutes until the edges catch and caramelise.Meanwhile, roughly chop 50g of the prunes and all the figs, finely chop the ginger, and place the whole lot into the bottom of a 24cm round (or equivalently sized) baking dish. Grate over the lemon zest and add the juice of ½ the lemon, add the vanilla and spices and mix everything together. Cover the dish with a clean tea towel and leave to one side.Make the topping by rubbing the oats, almonds, butter, sugar, flour and salt together with your fingers. It will feel wetter than a crumble topping and you’ll be left with larger pieces of butter, but you should have a very rough crumbly dough after about 4 minutes. Chop the remaining prunes roughly and mix them through too.When your apples are ready, mix them with the fruit and spices in the baking dish, then sprinkle over the topping. Bake in the oven for 25 minutes, until deep golden.I serve mine with some Greek or coconut yogurt, whipped with a little vanilla and honey.From The Modern Cook’s Year: Over 250 vibrant vegetable recipes to see you through the seasons by Anna Jones (Fourth Estate, £26)Piedmontese tagliatelle, called tajarin, with butter and parmesan are one of the best ways to enjoy a white truffle because they do not interfere with its sensational aroma. The Piedmontese white truffles are the most prized and extremely expensive. They must be used very fresh as they lose their aroma at an accelerating pace – their season is between the end of September and mid January – or preserved in jars or tins, which are not quite as scented as fresh ones.Serves 4white truffle 1 small unsalted butter 125gparmesan 40g, grated salt and freshly ground black peppernutmeg a grating tagliatelle 300g, or fettuccineTruffles are generally exported already cleaned. If you need to clean your white truffle, scrub it with a stiff brush and rub it with a moist cloth. Melt the butter and add the grated parmesan and a little salt, pepper and nutmeg. Boil the tagliatelle or fettuccine until al dente, drain quickly and serve immediately, tossed with the melted butter mixture. Shave a little white truffle over each serving with a mandolin or a potato peeler.Variation Black summer truffles from Umbria are relatively cheap – you can buy them fresh in season from October to March – and they are available preserved in jars in some British supermarkets. Their flavour is not as sensational as that of white truffles but it is distinctive and delicate. For 2 small portions of Umbrian tagliatelle con tartufi nerri, cook 100g tagliatelle and prepare the sauce at the same time: bring to the boil 200ml double cream with a few drops of truffle oil (to taste), 2 tablespoons freshly grated parmesan, a little salt and a finely grated small black truffle. When the tagliatelle are al dente, drain and mix them in the pan with the truffle sauce.From The Food of Italy by Claudia Roden (Square Peg, £30)Za’atar is a Palestinian spice mix made from wild thyme, sesame and sumac that has an affinity with sweet root vegetables. Here it is used to make crunchy, tangy croutons to adorn an aromatic soup of roasted butternut squash and spiced lentils. Roasting the squash intensifies its flavour and sweetness, and gives the soup a glorious silky texture that perfectly contrasts with the crispy croutons.Serves 4butternut squash 1kg, peeled, deseeded and cut into 3cm pieceslight olive oilonions 2, finely choppedgarlic 4 cloves, crushedcumin seeds ¾ tsp coriander seeds ¾ tsp ground cinnamon ½ tsp red lentils 160g, rinsedvegetable or chicken stock 750ml lemon juice of ½sea salt and freshly ground black pepperFor the toppingsstale bread 2 slices (I like to use sourdough for taste and texture)za’atar 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oilparsley or coriander leaves choppedPreheat the oven to 200Cgas mark 6.Place the butternut squash on a baking tray and drizzle with light olive oil. Toss the chunks so they are evenly coated in the oil, then roast for 20-30 minutes, until they are soft.Heat 3 tablespoons light olive oil in a large saucepan, add the onions and fry for 10 minutes over a medium heat. Add the garlic, reduce the heat and cook for another few minutes.Meanwhile, toast the cumin and coriander seeds by stirring them in a dry pan over a low heat for a minute until their aromas are released. Grind the seeds in a mortar and pestle or a spice grinder, then add them and the cinnamon to the saucepan with the softened onions. Fry the spices for a few minutes.Add the lentils and 1 litre of just-boiled water. Cover and simmer the soup for 10 minutes.Once the lentils have softened, add the squash, stock, lemon juice, 1 teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon pepper. Leave to simmer for another 10 minutes.Once the lentils are fully cooked, take the pan off the heat and blend the soup with a hand-held blender. Taste and adjust the seasoning to your preference.To make the croutons, roughly chop the bread into 3cm chunks. Heat 3 tablespoons light olive oil in a frying pan and, once it is very hot, add the bread and sprinkle over the za’atar. Fry the bread, stirring frequently, until it is toasted and crunchy. Place the croutons on some kitchen paper to soak up any excess oil. To serve, ladle the soup into warmed bowls, top with the croutons and finish with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a sprinkling of chopped herbs.From Zaitoun: Recipes and Stories from the Palestinian Kitchen by Yasmin Khan (Bloomsbury, £26)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e479ceeb53dd0a6ae62db90d44da4972498046b/413_0_3549_2129/master/3549.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=861b1dab5d64d838e2c975a5a90d9e12","title":"bernardo silva benjamin mendy twitter post manchester city fa","story":"The Football Association is looking into a tweet Bernardo Silva posted in reference to his team-mate Benjamin Mendy on Sunday.Silva captioned a photo on Twitter believed to be of Mendy as a child next to an offensive image on Sunday with the caption: “Guess who?” The image was of the logo for the Spanish confectionery company Conguitos.

At the same time Chelsea might also have taken a point.Sad to say this fine, slightly chancy line was decided by something else besides these moments of skill tipped one way, albeit not decided, by another key intervention from football’s own flawed deus ex machina.Yes: it’s VAR! And with all due apologies. Here it comes, the radioactive cloud currently coating the Premier League in its toxic lustre, that tinge of sporting death that is ill-conceived, badly applied VAR. Every system needs time to find its rhythms.This is complex, fast-evolving stuff, enacted on the hoof, and in a sport that excites furious, unceasing disagreement like no other human activity. But there is a problem here with refinement and with the limits of the technology. For the second time in two days a pivotal Premier League goal was ruled out by another of those problematic reviews. It is something that needs to be fixed.Once again this came with the double-jeopardy punishment of a goal conceded at the other end while the crowd, the players and the manager still seemed to be absorbing the gut punch of all that short-lived elation.This is an issue for players and coaches to resolve and work on: goal celebrations must now be guarded. They must come with an instant recovery time, a professionalism that means no more punching the air, no more touchline sprints, no more unalloyed joy. Like the sound of that? Well, it’s coming.Here’s how it happened. Liverpool had begun like a train at a muggy, clammy Stamford Bridge. The opening goal was a moment of jaw-drop, Alexander-Arnold running on to Mo Salah’s backheel and producing that sublime finish.Chelsea pressed back and thought they had equalised on 27 minutes, César Azpilicueta tapping home after a scramble in the goalmouth. VAR said otherwise. Mason Mount’s toe was decreed to have been offside in the build-up, his ankle having strayed across a line drawn by the VAR as Willian passed the ball down the left flank.Stop. Rewind. Delete. Swallow all that emotion. And within two minutes Liverpool were 2-0 up though Firmino, another superbly worked goal (and some slack marking) that the post-VAR lull should not diminish. But still. Two days, two interventions, two problems.It seems fairly obvious that Serge Aurier’s goal at Leicester on Saturday should have stood. The technology is not good enough to decree with absolute certainty whether Son Heung-min’s armpit was two millimetres offside at the precise moment (whenever that was) the ball was passed, as captured between frames by an elevated TV camera.Drawing a best-guess straight line is not accuracy, consistency, or whatever it is we expect. There is only a pretence of academic rigour here. Understanding and acknowledging a margin for error, incorporating uncertainty is a part of being precise. This is simply bad science.Fast forward 24 hours and Mount’s foot was, arguably, slightly more offside than Son’s armpit. But only arguably, and based on a line that there is no evidence we can actually trust. A middle-aged man playing with a light pen is not the Large Hadron Collider.Plus, of course, what is offside actually for? Firstly to stop the game from losing its shape, dissolving into a cross between Aussie Rules and mass goal-hanging. And secondly, in its finer margins, to stop players cheating by pushing this enforced line and gaining an advantage.In this case there was no advantage to Mount in having a toe, arguably, beyond the line of a player 20 yards away. It didn’t cause the game to lose its shape. It was offside because a man with a pen drew a pointlessly certain line.Most people have by now “backed a horse” in this race and are intent on arguing it to the line either way. The idea of being pro or anti VAR has its ideological, even generational edge. Suggest this isn’t currently working and you risk becoming a Proper Football Man crying into his Charles Hughes coaching manual about the death of My Day When Things Were Good.And yes, there is a paradox to complaining about discussion of VAR, on a page that discusses VAR at great (and no doubt) tedious length. But the sport is unavoidably affected by all this. There is a price to pay here for the most precious part of the spectacle, the miracle of the moment, the goal, the shared experience. Is it worth paying?

That N’Golo Kanté is an exceptional footballer is no revelation but there is still something remarkable about the fact that the best holding midfielder in the world has become a totemic Roy of the Rovers figure at Chelsea. There he is darting across his own box to stifle a Liverpool attack. There he is slipping a pass in to the edge of the box and looking for a return. And there he is, drifting in from the right and finding the top corner with an ungainly but nonetheless precise finish. He is their alpha and their omega, their beginning and their end. He is all things to all men and by that means he might save some games – but not this one.Kanté was exceptional against Liverpool, in the second half a blur, the force driving Chelsea forward. Only one Chelsea player made more tackles than him, only one more interceptions than him, only one had more shots than him and nobody completed more dribbles than him. He has, against expectations, transformed himself into a complete midfielder.But seeing him play like that it is impossible not to feel a certain ambivalence. Why is he having to do this? Ultimately, for all that it fits football’s love of narrative and its continuing obsession with iniduals, Roy of the Rovers football is for comics. Steven Gerrard pulled off more implausible feats than was reasonable and gave defining performances in the finals of the FA Cup and Champions League but, as his time at Liverpool showed, that is no way to mount a consistent challenge in the league.Chelsea had a supremely gifted holding midfielder, somebody who had been instrumental to two title wins with two different sides and had then lifted the World Cup, but opted to bring in a very different player who operated in his position to satisfy the demands of Maurizio Sarri. The result has been Kanté operating in a more advanced position that has forced him to learn new tricks.Profoundly gifted and diligent as he is, he has. He may have skewed one chance wide from the edge of the box on Sunday but he then scored with a little scuttle in-field and precise shot into the top corner. But, remarkable as that strike was, it was only his 15th league goal in a career now in its eighth season of regular senior football.Since Chelsea signed Jorginho their transfer ban has made it harder for them to rectify the situation. And so the issue persists: Jorginho, frail and neat, playing his cerebral passes and looking a little bewildered by the tumult around him, Kanté charging forward rather than controlling the area just in front of the defensive line as he used to.With Kanté in the side from the start for only the third time this season, Chelsea looked a little more secure than they have done, less vulnerable to attacks through that central area. But still, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that fielding him and Jorginho together creates needless complications.That Liverpool’s two goals here came from free-kicks, following the concession to a free-kick against Valencia last Tuesday makes defending from set-plays a specific and immediate concern. The first was a ferocious drive from Trent Alexander-Arnold but it was noticeable that Jorginho, whose job was to charge down the taker after it had been laid off, ended up making himself as small as possible. Defending, it is fair to say, does not come naturally to him.To criticise Frank Lampard for that is perhaps a little unfair. The issues of personnel pre-date him and are a result of Chelsea’s piecemeal approach to recruitment. But conceding 16 goals in eight games this season is a problem that requires urgent attention.Kanté is clearly a large part of the solution but he cannot be all the solution. An all-round performance such as he produced on Sunday, particularly in the second half, is a paradoxical kind of excellence. On the one hand a display as remorseless and intelligent as that must be admired on the other the fact that it was necessary, perhaps even that it was possible, speaks of profound structural deficiencies."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41029d46e08649378211d90812c5914831e7e326/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e35e9855efd0af9fd67a9dbd534fb24","title":"premier league 10 talking points from the weekends action","story":"Solskjær’s diplomacy masks United problems, De Bruyne in the ascendancy and Xhaka’s poor form gives Emery a tough choiceUnai Emery is yet to find the right balance for his midfield but the claim of his de facto captain, Granit Xhaka, to be part of it is looking decidedly tenuous. First things first: the Switzerland international is a good player who cares tremendously and does not deserve anything like the negative reception he received upon his substitution against Aston Villa after 72 minutes. But his replacements, Lucas Torreira and the outstanding youngster Joe Willock, helped turbo-charge Arsenal’s comeback while Mattéo Guendouzi played the second half like a man possessed. Xhaka, by contrast, looked hesitant and off the pace. He is nowhere near automatic selection territory on this season’s form and Emery, who has delayed formally announcing Arsenal’s next club captain, may have a tough decision to make. Nick AmesThere has been no shortage of praise showered on Virgil van Dijk since his arrival from Southampton, and the Dutchman has of course been transformational, but Liverpool’s standout defender during the early stages of this season has been the man playing next to him. Joël Matip was the best player on the pitch at Stamford Bridge, ensuring that Tammy Abraham’s rich vein of goalscoring form came to an abrupt halt, and is playing with a calm and poise unrecognisable from his first couple of seasons at Anfield, when Liverpool’s defence often resembled a comedy troupe. The Cameroonian has certainly had the last laugh, having established himself as central part of the ision’s best defence and helping keep a clean sheet in a triumphant Champions League final. Quite where this leaves the hugely promising Joe Gomez, though, is another question. Alex HessOle Gunnar Solskjær went for the carrot rather than the stick. In the wake of Manchester United’s 2-0 loss at West Ham, which came about after a dreadfully passive performance, the manager suggested his team had merely been unlucky to come down on the wrong side of the finest of margins. Solskjær would have been within his rights to read the riot act but that has not been his style since he took on the job. The initial transformation he effected after succeeding José Mourinho was built on injecting positivity. Yet behind the scenes, it would have been a surprise if Solskjær had not given the players a dressing-down. He has that in him and it was easy to read into his decision to send them out early for the second half. What is clear is that if Solskjær truly believes United were let down only by their decision-making, the club have problems. David HytnerChris Wilder wins the comedy Yorkshireman of the week award. The Blades manager thought his side were poor in possession at Goodison, and admitted he was berating his players until he was interrupted by a defender who could not believe what he was hearing. “Phil Jagielka chipped in: ‘Gaffer, we’ve just won at Everton,’” Wilder said. “He put it into perspective, so I ended up telling them they should go out and have a beer and not go home disappointed. I didn’t mean to be over-critical, it’s just the mardy-arse Yorkshireman in me. We are not much fun at times. It’s a great feeling when you win any game of football, but I just felt if we play like that away from home for the rest of the season it is unlikely we will get anything.” Wilder is probably right. They will not meet opponents as accommodating as Everton every week. Paul WilsonCan a team scoring eight goals finish a match with disappointment? With five minutes left, and Manchester United’s 24-year-old Premier League record of 9-0 against Ipswich to surpass, Kevin De Bruyne brilliantly smashed home the eighth but another goal would not come. Instead, with Leroy Sané and Aymeric Laporte out for the long term, there was satisfaction the club’s key midfielder was looking in full working order. Two years ago this month, it was the Belgian conducting the orchestra in a 6-0 win at Watford that was probably the best performance of Pep Guardiola’s first Premier League title-winning season. And it was De Bruyne who set the tone and tempo on Saturday, starting with the cross for David Silva to open the scoring after 52 seconds. Watford’s hopes of a first victory over City since 1989 met a sudden end. There was worse – much worse – to follow. John BrewinOne of Brendan Rodgers’s characteristics as a coach is his willingness to tinker with the make-up of his attacking unit, not for reasons of rotation but so as best to exploit what he perceives as the vulnerabilities of the opposition. That can mean changes of shape, but this season for Leicester it has tended to be more about switching personnel within that system. Three times, James Maddison has been used on the left Saturday was the third time he has been used through the centre, a role he seemed to relish. His winner was fitting reward for an all-round performance in which Tottenham looked vulnerable to pretty much every Leicester attack. The presence of Jamie Vardy means defences are wary of exposing themselves to his pace by pushing too high, and that gives Leicester’s creators a fraction more room in which to operate. Maddison exploited it brilliantly. Jonathan WilsonRalph Hasenhüttl maintained he had no concerns about Southampton’s home form but the statistics paint a bleak picture. Bournemouth’s away win means that Southampton have won only 15 of their last 60 league matches at St Mary’s. Or, to put it another way, they have averaged fewer than five victories a season at home over the past three years. At the risk of stating the obvious, that puts huge pressure on them to keep picking up the sort of results on the road that have seen them win at Brighton and Sheffield United already this season. Hasenhüttl said he takes comfort from the chances that have been created at St Mary’s but the truth is that their most dangerous player on Friday was a midfielder – James Ward-Prowse. Moussa Djenepo’s return from injury will help but Che Adams and Danny Ings – one goal between them so far – need to come good. Stuart JamesBurnley rather flew under the radar as pre-season previews mulled over who might be among the Premier League’s “best of the rest” this term, as the prospects of Wolves, West Ham, Everton and others were talked up, but their performances this calendar year suggest a Europa League challenge is well within range. They showcased the best of themselves in a neat display against Norwich, playing with a tenacity and purpose their opponents lacked. And Chris Wood’s partnership with Ashley Barnes up front is a force to reckon with, with the New Zealander finally getting the goals his performances have merited to see off Daniel Farke’s side. Proper striker’s goals too – a powerful set-piece header and a lovely near-post flick from a tricky angle. On their day they remain one of the best sides around at punishing defensive flimsiness. Tom DaviesBefore Sunday’s game at Selhurst Park, Roy Hodgson had expressed sympathy with Wolves, blaming “the cruelty of fate” for a winless run that has not reflected the team’s performances. In the end, it was the Palace manager left cursing his luck after the visitors snatched a point, Diogo Jota scoring with virtually the last kick of the game. Hodgson cannot feel too hard done by - Palace dominated the second half, but were distinctly second best in the first. It had looked like Wolves would see another promising display end in demoralising defeat, but perhaps their luck has finally changed. You might also argue Wolves made their own luck. Jota showed great persistence and composure to profit from Joel Ward’s late slip, lifting morale before another busy week.

Now, salsa helps me feel more confident – and less isolatedOn a recent trip back to Havana, where I lived for three years, my Spanish teacher told me she thought Cuban music had saved my life. We had been talking, as usual, about the passion that had gripped me in recent years. I had previously dismissed salsa dancing as a marker of a midlife crisis and yet here I was, doing it into the small hours, becoming that cliche. But I had given little thought to the changes that had taken place along the way.I moved to Havana at the end of 2011 for my wife’s work and I was increasingly beset by feelings of failure. A few years earlier, I had entered my 40s and thought that I had finally found my purpose through writing. With my first book behind me, I began work on a memoir of youth. But rather than release me from the grip of the past, it enmeshed me further in negativity and self-criticism. Nothing I wrote pleased me, probably because the subject was myself. Cuba’s sun, rum and palm trees were no medicine. My wife thinks I was in the grip of depression. Reluctantly I have come to accept that she is probably right.Not having children – which perhaps compounded the sense of meaninglessness – left me with time to wander suburban Havana streets. Beneath the blazing sun, I fretted a lot about writing and produced very little. As I walked, I would sometimes be drawn by the music from neighbourhood parties. Peering through cactus hedges, I would see people dancing in their yards, perhaps a grandfather teaching a child. The scenes were touching, yet made me sad.I like to think that what I saw on those aimless, sweat-soaked walks sowed the seeds of my future passion. But I might well have continued to live a danceless life had my wife not started salsa classes. Two years into our time in Cuba I decided to join her, thinking that if I didn’t dance in Havana, I never would.I headed for that first class like I was going for root canal treatment. The only kind of dancing I had done before was the pogo. In my younger years, I would be the one glowering on the edge of dancefloors gripping a pint. Now a 6ft 3in grey-haired Yorkshireman, I was not well set up for salsa. My early steps were big and cumbersome. “Dance as if nobody is watching” is the standard advice to beginners: I danced as if the whole world was not only watching, but judging and laughing.Thankfully, all of that is behind me. Improvement came slowly, not just through classes but through many hours of dancing with all kinds of people and countless live concerts where the music began to flood my tired soul. It came from watching Cubans dance – less the flashy young ones who make a living from it, more the ordinary social dancers in faded venues off the tourist track. I studied the elderly veterans who had actually created the dance around the time of Castro’s revolution. It felt magical sharing the floor where it all began, participating in a great tradition.To change is tough, and for me self-doubt and depression are always lurking. People try to mend themselves in different ways, but the introspection of my memoir project had burned me out. It had been a brutal form of self-therapy, with no professional for protection. Still, I never expected that dance, rather than words, would be my cure. It has helped me out of my isolation, and my own head, connecting me with worlds far from my own.Knowing my way around a dancefloor and leading – in Cuban salsa the man is in that role – has given me back some sense of confidence, if only for a few, fleeting minutes at a time. Dancing to live music in Havana has also brought me joy, elation even, of the kind I haven’t felt through music since my teenage years. Though I live far away now, I return when I can to recapture that mood.My Spanish teacher is probably right: Cuban music did save me. On Havana’s rutted dance floors, I learned to move through the world in a different way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/954b2e13bbfca750f9ff963e005aabddb68917d1/0_181_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63aaa1db6f7c8341048523983f2783f6","title":"six ways to stay healthy when youre stressed","story":"Keeping on top of your mental health in today’s taxing world can be tough.

Afterwards, they are gaunt, grey and lined. It is like watching an accelerated version of ageing, and a reminder of how stress corrodes the human body.The fact is, stress kills. Prolonged stress has been linked to heart disease, depression and diabetes. But how can you stay healthy when you are stressed? We asked some experts.The salty-sweet smack of snack foods is often the only thing that gets many of us through stressful times. But the crisps you inhale as a deadline looms will make you feel rotten in the long term.“When we’re overwhelmed, it’s easy to reach for a quick fix in the form of sugar-rich food and drink,” says Azmina Govindji, a registered dietitian and a member of the British Dietetic Association. “This gives you an instant spike in serotonin, the body’s feelgood chemical, but it won’t last – and neither will the fast rise in your blood glucose levels, which also gives you a temporary high.” Instead, opt for complex carbohydrates such as porridge or wholegrain bread, which will give you the energy you need to face a difficult day.Taking 10 minutes to eat lunch away from your desk will reduce stress levels and prevent unhealthy snacking. “Eat mindfully,” Govindji urges. “Get away from your desk, chew your food slowly and savour the flavours.”According to research from the American Psychological Association, a third of Americans reach for high-fat, high-calorie foods when stressed. “To avoid this, plan your meals to give you structure and control.” It is unrealistic to expect people to meal-prep during periods of high stress, but a very easy meal plan of porridge and berries for breakfast, a wholegrain sandwich for lunch and vegetable pasta or fish with potatoes and broccoli for dinner is achievable and healthy.Many of us are guilty of an all-or-nothing mentality when it comes to fitness.

However, exercise is a powerful natural stress-reliever that will flood your body with feelgood endorphins.To motivate yourself, the personal trainer Maiken Skoie Brustad advises you to “remember how good you feel after you train. After exercise, you’ll always feel better.”If you can’t afford to visit a gym, or have responsibilities that keep you at home, there are plenty of free home-based workouts that can be squeezed into a few minutes. “Write down a cardio circuit of five exercises – three high-intensity exercises, such as running on the spot or squat jumps, and then two ab exercises such as planks or crunches – stick a timer on for 45 seconds and do each exercise for two rounds.”Don’t feel guilty about taking time out to exercise. “You have to be strict with yourself,” Brustad says. “Say: ‘OK, on Tuesday I will clear an hour out of my schedule,’ and train no matter what. When you’re training, focus on why you’re there. It shouldn’t be a treat to give yourself time to train. It should be a necessary thing for healthy human beings.”It is not normal to exist in a state of perpetual stress. If you feel you are approaching burnout, your first port of call should be your GP. “We all have stress in our lives,” says Dr Zoe Norris, a GP, “but the definition of anxiety as a disease is different from stress.” If patients come to her complaining of stress, she will ask them whether they have been having palpitations, panic attacks or long-term sleep disturbances. These could all indicatebe indicators that they were struggling with an anxiety disorder.Even if your stress does not meet the clinical threshold for an anxiety disorder, it is a good idea to be mindful of your stress levels. “Almost every part of the body is affected by experiencing constant stress,” Norris warns. “We are not designed for it as humans.”Develop coping mechanisms. “Put into place protective factors to reduce the impact stress is having on you,” Norris says. Exercise, reading or socialising with friends are all levellers. “If you don’t have these coping mechanisms, what happens is that you develop bad coping mechanisms, such as drinking coffee to stay awake, then wine to help you sleep.”Some stress is unavoidable: a relative dying, for instance. But if your stress is work-related, Norris encourages her patients to speak to their boss. “If their employers aren’t accommodating, they may come to the conclusion they need to find somewhere else to work.”Stress is a trigger for self-destructive behaviour, such as smoking or drinking too much. “Lots of patients are keen on detoxes or Dry January, but sustained lifestyle changes are better in the long term.”When you are stressed, your sleep often suffers. But staying up late in order to tackle a growing to-do list is counterproductive. “If you are suffering from poor sleep, that will make your stress levels higher,” says Dr Guy Leschziner, a neurologist and the author of The Nocturnal Brain. “Getting as much sleep as possible when you’re feeling overwhelmed will help to manage your stress.”What about sleeping pills? “They’re a double-edged sword,” Leschziner says. He explains that they can be helpful as a short-term solution, when someone is under acute stress. “If your GP prescribes you a short course of sleeping tablets, for a maximum of two weeks, they can be helpful. People can get to a crunch point where they don’t sleep at all and they can end up in a nervous breakdown situation.” But you can’t rely on pills as a long-term solution to stress. “It’s easy to get on a slippery slope. It’s better to resolve your sleep issues by dealing with the underlying source of stress.” Cognitive behavioural therapy can also help address your anxiety and improve the quality of your sleep.“If you feel overwhelmed, it’s usually a combination of work and home-life factors,” says Andrew Kinder, an occupational psychologist and a member of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy.Develop your support structures. “Look at your relationships,” says Kinder. “Who are your potential allies? It may be family or friends. When people open up, they’re often overwhelmed by how much support is available to them.”Problem-solving approaches will mitigate extreme stress. If you are worried about debt, for example, tackle it head-on. “Get out the brown envelopes, open them up, start talking with your creditor and negotiate. That will give you more hope than just sitting on it and knowing that it’s festering in the background.”We live in a society that fetishises overwork, whether it is the side hustle you balance on top of your full-time job or the toxic culture of presenteeism that increasingly blights British offices. “Ask yourself the question: what do you really care about?” suggests Prof Josh Cohen, the author of Not Working: Why We Have to Stop.Strip your workload down to the essentials. “Excessive workloads are one of the main sources of stress,” Cohen says. Many things that we do in the workplace to endear ourselves to our bosses or appear more proactive than our colleagues are basically pointless. “There’s so much that’s just window dressing, where you’re being seen to do something.” Stop doing that and your stress levels may reduce.To avoid burnout, remember you don’t have to spend every hour in productive or fruitful labour. Sometimes, it is good to just do nothing at all. “Resist a permanent state of task orientation. There are other dimensions of life, and selfhood, that are worth believing in. Reducing yourself to the sum of what you do and identifying yourself so fully with your work won’t do your work any good in the long term. You’ll just end up resenting it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54995ce91bee2973aaa3f23b52be4633a0f0a373/0_583_5577_3346/master/5577.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10c7cb06b9e4556d3ec2eb7200700053","title":"knitwear that blends seamlessly into the background in pictures","story":"Photographer Joseph Ford and knitting guru Nina Dodd have collaborated to create bespoke jumpers for people, humans and even fruit that are incorporated into their surroundings in painstaking detail.

We are looking at properties less than £500,000 and the intention is for me to be the sole name on the mortgage. We are currently mortgage free.

It means I’ve had to spend £60 on two cards.Various other parents have had the same issue, so I assume those behind the railcard are making a fortune.  DL, by emailThe new 16-17 card is very welcome and long overdue, not least as it helps end the crazy situation that led to under-18s having to pay full-price, peak-time fares to get to schoolcollege. However, whoever designed the new card appears to have done it in the most user-unfriendly way possible. Frankly, it’s a complete dog’s dinner, that only the UK rail industrycivil servants could devise.Firstly there are all those who, like you, bought the old young person’s railcard, only to discover that the new one is much better and the old one is non-refundable.The Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which is behind the cards, offered a £5 discount or vouchers for those in your shoes – but only to those who bought the 16-25 card in July or August. Those who bought one in June, or before that, just have to suck it up and pay out twice.The extra discount will probably make it worth buying the new card, but it will still leave a sour taste.Secondly, the even more bonkers aspect of the new card is the fact that it discriminates against those who turn 18 early in the academic year. It can be used for four months after the student’s 18th birthday – but only if you buy a season ticket.So if your son or daughter is unlucky enough to turn 18 today, they can only get the discounted season ticket until 21 January. After that, it’s back to paying full fares for the rest of the year, or buying the old railcard again – for another £30. Many students at college only have lessons for three days a week, so a season ticket won’t be worth it.The RDG blamed the 18 age limit on the Department for Transport, which sets the rules. In any sane world, the railcard would simply be offered to all those aged 16-18 at school or sixth form college – until they leave.

It was Hunter’s first solo album after years of collaborating with the 2000s freak-folk mainstay Devendra Banhart. The album contained short songs (mostly hovering around the two-minute mark) that were haunting and wistful, with muddled vocals and warped instrumentation, and earned Hunter glowing reviews and a proper spot in the then blossoming world of blog-approved indie music.Blank Unstaring Heirs of Doom ends with an exclamation point, a surprising stylistic shift in the form of a pop song called K, which is based around a video game-like electronic loop, interwoven with ghostly vocal “ahs” and twangs of guitar. The lyrics are a blend of mundane lightness and hints at darkness: “I’d love to see you Saturday afternoon  I’d spin you out and show you what you’re worth  I’d love to hold your backbone in my hands  I’d be your favorite cartoon.” The song now feels prescient, a glimpse of the themes and sounds that permeate The Competition, the fourth album from Lower Dens, Hunter’s band with drummer Nate Nelson, which formed in 2009.While on the surface, Hunter’s early songs may appear to be more intimate and confessional by nature of their genre’s styling, he says the pop songs on The Competition are his most honest yet. “I spent most of my life hiding from myself,” said Hunter, on the phone from Los Angeles, where he moved from Baltimore on Thanksgiving day in 2018 (though he still spends a lot of time there). “I’ve tried to limit myself” with past albums, Hunter said. I wanted to push myself to write songs that felt a little less restrictive.”Hunter is more nervous about releasing this album than he ever has been with anything before. “I wanted to risk more vulnerability. I feel like I got to that place.”Hunter was assigned female at birth. In a 2015 essay for Cosmopolitan, he described telling his parents he was a boy when he was three or four years old, the fifth child in a family of eight kids, and their dismissal of it: “It wasn’t until I was an adult that I realized there was more to that conversation than my childish fancy.” He identifies as transmasculine, which he explains as identifying more as a man on some days and more as a woman on others. “It’s not more toward one side of the binary or the other.”The Competition was mostly written over a period of three years, in bursts of inspiration and creativity that were bordered by difficult periods that necessitated breaks from music to cope with mental health issues. For him, transitioning was bound up in those issues. “When I was a kid I did express my gender identity and it didn’t go over very well,” Hunter said. “That stuff has colored my whole life.”The album also interweaves his personal experiences with politics. (The press release calls it “a pop album that is politically urgent”.) Hunter says writing the first single, Young Republicans, “felt politically risky”. In the video for the song, directed by Raul Gonzo, Hunter acts as a narrator, singing in a glittering black bomber jacket as a bleak, Twin Peaks-esque montage plays out. A blond woman suns herself while glaring at detectives investigating a crime. A man in a white tennis outfit glares at a woman repairing his television. The whole thing ends with a group of preppy people in red suits pledging to the American flag before feasting on Hunter, who is lying face-up on a dining table with his torso sliced open. He used to follow the news closely but had to take a break in the Trump era, so he follows journalists he respects instead: “And I worry that they’re just losing their minds.”The song sounds like a crisp 80s dance pop hit, with all the requisite electronic synths, bleeps and bloops, but with an eeriness that’s unsettling, lyrics about people who “just don’t fit in” and a world that’s burning. Stylistically, the whole album is a giant leap away from the Heirs of Doom era (with the exception of K), and from the first Lower Dens album, 2010’s Twin-Hand Movement (NPR described Lower Dens at the time as “a blissful swarm of feedback”). As a child, Hunter listened to mini-cassettes via headphones with a Fisher-Price Pocket Rocker, escaping into pop songs and a world where he imagined anything was possible. For this album, he says, he wanted to recreate that feeling: “I wanted to write songs that might have the potential to do that.” He says the ideal way to listen to it would be with headphones, to get the feeling of not being in a physical space (whereas his older, more lo-fi recordings could be described as all about physical space, with the echoes and reverb of wherever they were recorded ingrained in the songs).Hunter has experimented with a progression of musical styles over the last 14 years, and The Competition is the latest iteration of that, but thankfully the core elements of his singular songwriting are still always present – the unusual chord shifts, the serene vocals, the way Hunter invites listeners to settle into a song and become transfixed by it (the best example of this might be the gorgeous song Brains, from their 2012 album Nootropics), the sense of hopefulness that’s always present, even if it’s nearly imperceptible.“I love the textures they use in their production and the songwriting is always heartfelt,” said :3LON (Elon Battle), a Baltimore electronic musician who appears on four songs on The Competition. “I love working with artists that push the boundaries of societal norms.” :3LON lends a vocal complexity to I Drive, a song Hunter says is about feeling rejected by his family, “leaving behind obligations to people who don’t love or care about you, being with and about people who do. It’s a feeling so strong it’s driving me. That’s the driving I’m doing.”While Hunter views The Competition as an escape, at the same time he hopes its deeply confessional nature might serve as a beacon for others struggling with their own realities: “Anguish is how we start looking for other people to connect to.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/576c48c7a2df97278856f95f9ad93d420b20f9d4/0_148_4170_2502/master/4170.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f46a732f1e266de7cfc9ffbe9bedfc00","title":"where did it all go wrong for david cameron","story":"As the former PM publishes his memoirs, Patrick Wintour tells Anushka Asthana that Cameron’s pursuit of austerity and decision to call an EU referendum sowed the seeds of his demise.

Both options will now be voted on by delegates, along with the official national executive position, leaving open the possibility that competing motions could pass and cause further confusion over the party’s Brexit policy.The pro-remain motion reads: “Labour must reflect the overwhelming view of its members and votes, who want to stay in the EU. Labour will therefore campaign energetically for a public vote and to stay in the EU in that referendum, while recognising the rights of those members who want to argue another view.”Those close to the leadership had hoped that Corbyn’s clear statement of his position would put pressure on supportive delegates to agree a Brexit policy motion that does not contradict his view. However, party activists at the “compositing” meeting on Sunday night showed their appetite for defying the leadership over the issue of Brexit, with the aim of forcing a remain stance into the next election manifesto.Corbyn explained he was in favour of negotiating a Labour Brexit deal before letting the party decide how it would campaign in a second referendum in an interview on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show.When asked if it was in Britain’s long-term interests to remain in the EU, the Labour leader suggested a Labour Brexit deal could be preferable in some circumstances: “It depends on the agreement you have with the European Union outside.”The new position caused a fresh revolt among several shadow ministers and pro-remain activists, adding to the febrile mood at the Brighton conference following an abortive attempt by Jon Lansman, the Momentum chair, to abolish Tom Watson’s job as deputy leader and the resignation of Corbyn’s key policy aide, Andrew Fisher.Clive Lewis, a shadow Treasury minister and supporter of Corbyn, said the leadership had been “hijacked” and was taking power away from members.Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, also made clear her unhappiness with the position, saying Labour risked getting stuck in a “crusher” between leave and remain with the “walls coming in” unless it picks a side before an election. She said a new direction in favour of remain needed to be decided by activists at this conference, not in a future one after an election.Another shadow cabinet minister involved in election campaign planning told the  that his position has changed and he now believes Labour needs to campaign to remain, because of the risk of voters moving to a revitalised Lib Dem party.Many of Corbyn’s allies on the left also believe the party needs to take pick a side on Brexit before the election. Laura Parker, Momentum’s national coordinator, said Corbyn must decide on Labour’s Brexit this week, not after a general election.“We have to decide at this conference. The one we have come to, the one we have travelled across the country to come to, not at some putative further conference which is presumably in the mythical land with that fucking table with all our options on it,” she said.The issue has been causing serious tensions within Corbyn’s own team. It is understood Fisher, who resigned citing a lack of “professionalism, competence and human decency” in the Labour leader’s team, has been arguing that the party’s policy of trying to appeal to both sides over Brexit was no longer working and was electorally problematic.He tweeted several supportive policy statements on Sunday, indicating he was still backing Corbyn’s project overall and sources confirmed he would stay on to write the manifesto at the next election.Ahead of Monday’s debate, pro-remain activists were increasingly hopeful that their motion would pass, potentially with the help of some trade unions. The collective union position is the same as Corbyn’s stance, but senior union sources said Unison was considering breaking ranks.Michael Chessum, of Another Europe is Possible, said his group had been “utterly determined” to take a remain position to conference floor and urged delegates not to see it as a test of loyalty to Corbyn.“There will be an attempt to turn this into a loyalty test. But those proposing these motions are by and large people, like me, who have spent years fighting for the left inside Labour and backing Corbyn,” he said.However, Len McCluskey, the general secretary of Unite, said it would be a “loyalty test” as he said any shadow cabinet ministers openly advocating a pro-remain position should get behind the leadership or “step aside”.The second day of conference was dominated by the row over Brexit, but many anti-Corbyn MPs were also exercised by the move earlier in the week to abolish Watson’s post as deputy leader. This was abandoned on Saturday after an intervention from Corbyn, but MPs on the centrist wing of the party were up in arms about the move against him.Several suggested on their WhatsApp group that Watson should challenge Corbyn for the leadership or lead a public split of Labour MPs, regardless of the country potentially being very close to a general election.Watson is understood to have dismissed the idea that this was time for a breakaway but the deputy leader arrived at the party’s conference earlier than expected in order to fight any further attempts on his position.Two shadow cabinet ministers told the  they believed the bid to oust Watson was related to concerns within the Labour leadership about Corbyn’s position if he were to lose an election and stand down, with the deputy leader potentially becoming the most powerful elected person in the party.Watson was among those on the NEC who declined to support the statement on Brexit, which is also expected to be put to a vote on the conference floor.Watson said: “I have no doubt that Jeremy’s supporters on the NEC will endorse any statement he proposes. However, without the NEC having met to debate over it, we risk giving an imperfect document to conference, and the document not being given the weight it deserves by delegates.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc9c829ee172e0c3a0b84d032010e03ff9c18780/642_289_1793_1076/master/1793.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31d13837d33fbd4da868ea539ef0031a","title":"health cover for retired britons in eu to last six months in no deal brexit","story":"Government pledges £150m for those not covered by reciprocal arrangements if UK crashes outThe government has pledged £150m to temporarily cover the healthcare costs of 180,000 British nationals living in the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit.The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said workers posted to the bloc, plus pensioners and students, who can currently have their healthcare funded by the UK under existing reciprocal arrangements, would continue to be covered for six months after a crash out.The government will also pay the treatment costs of UK tourists if they began their holiday before the UK leaves the EU.“Protecting the healthcare rights of UK nationals is a priority of this government,” said Hancock.However, the move was met with anger by campaign groups. Sue Wilson, chair of Bremain in Spain, the country where the largest cohort of pensioners live, said: “They keep making these announcements and they seem to think they will provide reassurance. But they are time-limited and therefore have the opposite effect – people will ask what happens after six months.“What we need is reassurance that our rights do not change regardless. That is what the leave campaign promised, that’s what Michael Gove promised and it’s clear every time they make one of these statements that is not the case.”Jeremy Morgan, vice-chair of British in Europe, said the government’s plea to Britons to sort out healthcare if the NHS cover disappears was “another massive let down” for UK pensioners in the EU.“The government is urging them to ‘act now to secure access to healthcare’ as if it were as simple as ordering coffee in a restaurant,” he said.Earlier this year, the government pledged to cover the costs of healthcare for up to 12 months for all British citizens in the EU who had started treatment before exit day. The new pledge will extend healthcare costs for new conditions and treatments that begin afterwards.An estimated 1 million Britons live in the EU, but the majority are earners and pay into EU member state health systems through tax or a combination of tax and insurance, so should remain covered in the event of no deal.The government announcement covers Britons in the bloc who are retired, students, employees of UK companies or on holiday when Brexit happens.Visitors who fall ill or have accidents on holiday or on short stays in the EU are currently covered by the European health insurance card, but this will no longer be valid in a no-deal scenario.Also invalidated by a crash out would be the S1 reciprocal healthcare scheme used by an estimated 180,000 pensioners who paid their taxes in the UK but decided to retire elsewhere in the bloc, apart from Ireland where existing arrangements would continue.The offer by the government in March to cover costs for just one year for treatment agreed or started before exit day prompted fury, with some Britons in the EU questioning what would happen if they fell sick after the UK left the union.One Briton, retired to France, claimed at the time it was discrimination. “Why should I be treated any differently from any other retired government servant living in the UK?”Questions remain unanswered about what will happen in the longer term to those who opted to retire abroad in the knowledge that reciprocal arrangements applied throughout the EU as part of EU membership if there is no deal.The government has proposed continuing the reciprocal arrangement until the end of December 2020 with all EU member states, but no bilateral deals can be signed until the outcome of Brexit negotiations is known."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/141a2e1aaa91c00f752f4673ff248a5abe3c82b8/0_179_5378_3227/master/5378.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98e8ee4065a4efe07f1342f3946b51e6","title":"can you solve it maths on the back of an envelope","story":"Stationery puzzles to get your brain movingToday, we’re pushing the envelope.1) A piece of paper is folded to make a shape that looks a bit like the back of an envelope, illustrated below.

Can you draw all the lines this image without taking your pencil off the paper, and without re-tracing or crossing over one of the lines you’ve already drawn?4) Can you draw the image of the folded envelope from question (2) in the same way?Today’s puzzles were devised by the maths writer Rob Eastaway in a nod to his latest book, Maths on the Back of an Envelope, a joyful primer about the lost art of calculating without a calculator. His book full of insightful tips on how to work things out quickly and sensibly, including a guide to arithmetical rules of thumb and a discussion of the importance of estimation. It’s full of anecdotes too. For example, he writes that back in the 1970s, in the pre-pocket calculator era, cornflakes packets used to display the following mnemonic:A litre of water’s a pint and three-quarters.How useful! Can anyone think of a good mnemonic that does the conversion the other way round (1 pint  568ml)?A copy of Maths on the Back of an Envelope to the entry Rob and I deem the best.

She was 24. A type 1 diabetic, Louis, who did not have health insurance coverage, couldn’t afford the cost of her insulin doses and pay her rent. She chose to skip doses in order to pay her rent.In 1922 Frederick Banting and Charles Best, the Canadian scientists who discovered insulin, sold their patent to the University of Toronto for $1, hoping it would be a cure for diabetes. Today a vial of insulin – which will last 28 days once opened – costs about $300 in the US.Black, Hiic and Asian adults have been hit hardest by escalating prices. They are more likely to have diabetes than white adults and are less likely to be insured. One in four diabetes patients ration their insulin, according to a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.“People are literally dying over $300 like my sister did. It shouldn’t have to be like that. People shouldn’t have to choose between medications or shelter. That’s the most outrageous decision for somebody to have to make, yet people are doing it daily,” Jazmine Baldwin, Louis’s sister, told the .“She was a wonderful person and now people don’t get to experience that any more. There’s no telling what she could have done, how many lives she could have touched, and now no one will know because of a $300 insulin bill.” Her family is still struggling to cover the funeral expenses, and have set up a GoFundMe for support.Price gouging of insulin and other barriers to accessing it are symptomatic of America’s broken healthcare system, diabetes advocates argue, and the resulting deaths and struggles of those with diabetes demonstrate the need for systemic reforms.“There is a lot of monopoly power, asymmetry of knowledge and power, and as a result you have sky-high prices across American healthcare, in particular the pharmaceutical sector,” said Dr Vikas Saini, president of the Lown Institute and co-chair of Right Care Alliance, a grassroots organization focused on reforming the US healthcare system to put patients before profits. The group often organizes protests against the dominant insulin manufacturers in the US, Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi.“This is an entire ecosystem of profiteering. We’re going to need systemic fixes and that means people are going to have to organize and mobilize,” added Dr Saini.Between 2012 to 2016, the average cost of insulin in the United States nearly doubled to $5,705 per year for iniduals with type 1 diabetes. Production costs for a vial of insulin are estimated to cost around $5 while pharmaceutical companies charge as high as $540 per vial and Americans are dying as a result of being unable to afford it in addition to the expensive costs of medical care, and supplies such as syringes and glucose monitors.Some 1.25 million Americans are currently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, an illness where people fail to produce insulin to regulate their blood sugar levels. That number is estimated to grow to 5 million by 2050.Iniduals with type 1 diabetes require several daily insulin doses, while those with type 2 diabetes require varying dosages. Iniduals with type 2 diabetes, the most common form of diabetes, are able to produce some of their own insulin, but are unable to rely on it to control blood sugar levels.On Christmas Day in 2018, Meaghan Carter passed away in Dayton, Ohio, at the age of 47 after struggling for six months to afford insulin in the wake of losing her job with health insurance coverage. Carter was working part-time jobs as a nurse and waiting for her last paycheck that was deposited on 26 December as she was set to begin a new job with health insurance the week after Christmas.“I want people to know that we miss Meaghan every day. Not a day goes by we don’t think about her. We wish we could talk to her. The pharmaceutical companies are the reason she’s not here,” said Mindi Patterson of Dayton, Ohio, Carter’s sister-in-law. Patterson’s two sons and husband also have type 1 diabetes. “The pharmaceutical companies murdered Meaghan. Meaghan did everything she could and managed for six months.”High costs in the US often push those with type 1 diabetes to purchase insulin in Canada and other countries or to buy on the black market, where insulin can be purchased for a fraction of the cost.“The cost of insulin when I was first diagnosed in 1991 was around $20,” said Quinn Nystrom, a Type 1 diabetic from Minnesota. Around five to six years ago, Nystrom began struggling with insulin costs despite having health insurance coverage under her employer.“I remember having to pay a couple hundred dollars out of pocket. I thought it was a clerical error,” added Nystrom. “As it continued to hike up, it affected me personally by having to put my prescription meds on credit cards, having family bail me out just so I could afford my insulin supplies, and I’ve also utilized the black market.”Deidre Waxman, a type 1 diabetic in Michigan, regularly purchases her insulin in Canada, where a prescription is not required for purchase, and often sends insulin to other diabetics around the US who struggle with affordability and access. Waxman said there was a simple solution to the crisis: a switch to a single-payer healthcare system financed by the government would solve the issues with the American healthcare system plaguing people with diabetes.“If you look at the US Veterans Administration healthcare system, you will see that is socialized medicine. For the same exact insulin I pay $700 a month, veterans pay either zero or $8,” she said. “That’s what socialized medicine could help us with among many other things, but without the ability to negotiate prices, big pharma will always have us over a barrel.”Earlier this year, Lija Greenseid of Minnesota organized “Caravan to Canada”, a campaign of type 1 diabetics and their families traveling to Canada as a group to purchase insulin and raise awareness around it’s soaring cost in the US. Greenseid has a 13-year-old daughter with type 1 diabetes and has travelled to several countries around the world, where she purchased insulin over the counter and at a fraction of the cost it is sold for in the United States. She has paid around $50 for a box of five insulin pens that cost as much as $700 in the United States.“It should be a source of shame that we have a healthcare system that is extremely high quality for those who can access and afford it, but many have much worse healthcare because of the cost and complexities compared to other countries with different forms of healthcare systems,” said Greenseid. “In the United States the barriers cause harm and they are only there because the complex system is what allows everybody to make money to the detriment of patients.”Greenseid and other diabetes advocates are currently pushing for legislation in Minnesota and on the federal level to lower insulin costs and hold pharmaceutical companies accountable for price gouging.In Minnesota, the Alec Smith Emergency Insulin Act would create a program to provide emergency insulin to diabetics unable to afford insulin. The bill was held up in the most recent state legislative session over concerns about whether taxpayers of pharmaceutical companies would fund the program. The bill is named after the son of Nicole Smith-Holt, who passed away in 2017 at the age of 26 due to rationing insulin.“Alec had a zest for life. He was interested, active, fun-loving. He was a hard-working young man and he wanted nothing more than to live a healthy, active life. But the Pharma companies took his life at a very young age,” said Smith-Holt. “They priced him out of his life. They made it so unaffordable that he did not have a choice and could not afford the product created for him to live. It’s frustrating to know there are no laws in place to prevent these pharma companies from doing this.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be377c88793d97b9628d07e5424f62fb6cd06ffa/0_105_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a910f3360176b21164179aa34569d79c","title":"people england living unsuitable housing","story":"Research shows people in need outnumber those on social waiting lists by two to oneMore than 8 million people, equivalent to the population of London, are living in unsuitable housing in England, according to analysis suggesting the scale of the housing crisis could be far worse than officially estimated.Research by Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh suggests the lives of one in eight people in England are now negatively affected by years of fast-rising prices and missed house-building targets.The research shows that 3.6 million people are living in overcrowded homes, 2.5 million cannot properly afford where they live, the same number again are living with parents or relatives against their wishes and almost 1.4 million are living in poor or substandard conditions, according to the study commissioned by the National Housing Federation (NHF), which represents social landlords.It adds up to almost twice the number of people currently considered to be in need of housing on official waiting lists.The needy include couples forced to cohabit despite a relationship breakdown and “boomerang” adults who return to their parents because they cannot afford to buy or rent or have been made homeless. The NHF said England needed 340,000 new homes a year to tackle the problem, but the last time that had happened was in 1968 during Harold Wilson’s premiership. In the year to March 2019, 169,770 new homes were built in England.“Today’s research reveals the full enormity of the housing crisis,” said Kate Henderson, the chief executive of the NHF. “It is the single biggest domestic issue we face. From Cornwall to Cumbria, millions of people are being pushed into debt and poverty because rent is too expensive, children can’t study because they have no space in their overcrowded homes, and many older or disabled people are struggling to move around their own home because it’s unsuitable.”Campaigners are struggling to keep housing high on political agendas before a likely general election. Town hall leaders said the research showed that new powers and funding for councils to build more social housing should be included in next month’s Queen’s speech. But hopes are modest that Boris Johnson’s government will be radical after he listed housing far beneath other domestic priorities in his first speech as prime minister.The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government responded that housing was a priority and said: “Last year we built more homes than in all but one of the last 31 years.” However that was only true for England, and across the UK the latest figures for 2017-18 show that eight years since 1987 had higher output.Only one in six new homes being built are affordable homes for rent, despite it being the market sector the majority of analysts believe is in most need of urgent supply.The ministry said 2,440 council houses had been built between 2010-11 and 2017-18, an increase on the New Labour output but a drop in the ocean compared to the NHF’s estimate that 90,000 new council homes are needed every year for the next decade to help end the crisis.A housing ministry spokesperson said: “Since 2010 we’ve delivered 430,000 affordable homes and to protect renters we’ve cracked down on rogue landlords, banned unfair fees and capped deposits, saving at least £240m a year – helping to ensure access to safe and secure housing for millions.”Responding for Labour, the former housing minister John Healey said that “deep cuts to housing investment since 2010 mean the country is now building 30,000 fewer social rented homes each year than we were with Labour.”He claimed a Labour government would build a million low-cost homes over ten years, “give renters the rights they deserve and end rough sleeping within five years”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9cf822b6afc571010e85680a328c0e6d92f84a20/0_36_4960_2976/master/4960.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c970ec6492bc380c529646c9cce05b6d","title":"wales v georgia rugby world cup live","story":"Courtesy of World Rugby, here’s a Twitter video feature previewing the Welsh campaign.Martyn Williams is excited, and says there will be plenty of people calling in sick in Wales today ...In the ITV Studio today we have Gareth Anscombe, cruelly denied a chance to play at this tournament by injury, along with two previous captains: Sam Warburton and Gareth Thomas.

Sixteen years, three free-market presidents and numerous international trade deals later, Nabisco successfully shuttered the plant for good, laying off about 350 workers and leaving behind a hulking brick monument to the Pennsylvania city’s storied industrial past.Today, the old factory building has been transformed into a shiny testament to Pittsburgh’s future: the luxuriously renovated Bakery Square is home to hundreds of Google employees, assembly lines and industrial ovens replaced with cubicles, meeting rooms and an indoor bamboo garden, the only hint of the manufacturing past in a few tasteful design flourishes.On Tuesday, Google’s Pittsburgh office could experience a striking return to Pittsburgh’s industrial roots when a group of about 90 analysts will hold an election to decide whether to form a union with the United Steelworkers (USW). The workers, who are employed by the Indian outsourcing firm HCL America but work on Google projects at Google’s offices, are just a tiny fraction of the legions of temps, vendors and contractors (TVCs) who make up an enormous “shadow” workforce at Google, outnumbering direct Google employees approximately 135,000 to 115,000.If their campaign is successful, they will become what is believed to be the first group of professional tech workers to unionize in the US since a wave of workplace activism began to roil the industry in the wake of Donald Trump’s election.In some ways, these workers are marginal to the broader tech industry. They live and work far from its center of gravity in Silicon Valley, and their actual employer is not exactly a household name. But they also sit at the center of urgent questions about the future of a tech-driven economy.Pittsburgh, the quintessential post-industrial city that lost half its population after the US steel industry collapsed in the 1980s, has enjoyed a tech-fueled renaissance in recent years as major companies including Google, Uber, Apple and Facebook opened offices there. The benefits of that economic rebirth have been distributed unevenly, community activists say, in part due to the industry’s reliance on huge numbers of contractors – from Uber drivers to Google’s TVCs – and preference to offer direct employment to as few people as possible.But as much as the tech industry has transformed Pittsburgh, it’s possible that Pittsburgh could transform the tech industry. After all, this is the city that gave birth to both the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations, which eventually merged to form the AFL-CIO, the country’s largest federation of unions, as well as the USW. That a campaign to challenge the severe power imbalance between subcontracted tech workers and one of the most powerful corporations in the world should emerge here is only in keeping with historical precedent.“In the 1930s, our union was created when there was a small group of workers who said, ‘No more,’” said Maria Somma, the organizing director for the USW. “It was when they were courageous enough to do that that it allowed the rest of the sector to unionize.”Somma joined the USW from a nurse’s union 18 years ago, when the USW set its sights on organizing workers from new industries, including healthcare, education and, now, tech. At her office in the USW’s downtown Pittsburgh headquarters, a large poster celebrates the union’s recent success in organizing the 300 librarians and other staff of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh system with the slogan, “Hahahaha, suck it Andrew Carnegie! We won!” beside a crossed-out photo of the 19th century steel magnate’s face.“The HCL workers are the first group that’s daring enough – understanding the precarity of their situation – to say we’ve got to take a step,” she said. “That to me is unbelievably brave. You want to see working class heroes in today’s modern world, look at them.”In Pittsburgh, technology and labor have always been inextricably linked. It was the Bessamer converter – a furnace used to create steel in what’s known as the Bessamer process – and other technological innovations that revolutionized the steel industry, turning Carnegie’s Homestead steel mill, located just a few miles upriver from Pittsburgh, into a kind of late-19th-century Google, with the most advanced tech creating the most extraordinary wealth, as well as severe inequality and labor strife.Homestead was “the most modern mill in the country,’’ explained Rosemary Trump, a retired labor leader, on a recent trip to the historic site. The mill itself no longer exists, shuttered in 1986 along with most of the other steel mills that once lined the Monongahela river and replaced with a shopping mall and housing development.But the red brick pump house, which once supplied the factory with water from the river, still stands as a monument to the bloody history of the 1892 Homestead strike, in which thousands of striking workers faced off with hundreds of Pinkerton agents (a private police force used by industrialist to control workers) sent to take control of the mill by Carnegie’s agent, Henry Clay Frick. The resulting gun battle left seven strikers and three Pinkertons dead.The Battle of Homestead was the result of “a radical transformation of technology that completely changed the relationship between workers and owners,” said Charlie McCollester, a retired labor activist and historian. Before the invention of the Bessamer process, a small group of highly skilled workers known as puddlers were essential to the process of turning iron into steel. After Henry Bessamer’s innovation, McCollester explained, “The equipment was in charge. The workers became ‘hands’ and had much less control.’” Meanwhile, productivity exploded, with mills going from producing 100 pounds of steel at a time to 100 tons.“We see an analogy with IT for young people,” McCollester said as we drove through Homestead. The town’s economic recovery is evident, though shaky on one street we pass a crumbling former municipal building where the labor leader Mary Harris “Mother” Jones was jailed for supporting a strike in 1919, as well as an imposing old bank building that was recently converted into a recreational axe throwing gym. “We are facing as much of a shift now.”Indeed, the HCL contractors are perfect examples of how technology is affecting not just blue collar but professionals as well. The five HCL workers interviewed by the  were all college educated and most were professionally fluent in multiple languages. Their work is complex, technical and, according to one Google Pittsburgh employee who spoke to the  on condition of anonymity because she was not authorized to speak to the media, “crucial to our actual business”.Comparisons between today’s tech billionaires and the robber barons of the Gilded Age are practically cliche, but they resonate for a reason, especially in Pittsburgh where Carnegie’s legacy as a union buster is as present as the libraries, universities and cultural institutions he funded.“Carnegie was the richest man of his time,” McCollester said. “He gave away his money, but it was on his terms, to things he wanted, while the people who worked for him were living in poverty.”The richest man of this time, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, has complained that “the only way” he can come up with to spend his incredible wealth is to fund space travel. Meanwhile, on 12 September, Amazon-owned Whole Foods confirmed that it was cutting medical benefits for nearly 2,000 part-time workers.In Pittsburgh, Amazon’s high-end grocery chain has been embroiled in controversy over plans to open a store in a development near Google’s offices in East Liberty – a historically African American neighborhood that is gentrifying rapidly. The Whole Foods is slated for a lot that was cleared for development by the mass eviction of about 200 residents, many of them elderly and low-income.“The high paying jobs go largely to white people who aren’t from Pittsburgh, like the six-figure traditional coder jobs that people envision when they think of the tech industry,” Wallach Hanson said, adding that local people of color and women are largely relegated to lower wage service sector roles.“They try to sell it as this new economy, but the reality is for workers it’s still the same. Corporations are still coming into our city and making incredible profits while creating massive inequality. The world can change so much and yet it can remain the same.”Despite the potential historical resonance, the goals of the HCL contractors are decidedly modest.“I didn’t go into this really trying to shake the structure of work in the technology industry,” said Renata Nelson, a member of the organizing committee. “I just want myself and my coworkers to be happy and feel secure in our workplace.”The union drive began in early 2019 when one HCL contractor, Ben Gwin, contacted the USW to see if the union could help with his frustrations with his employer. The idea of unionization found fertile ground among workers who were surrounded every day by reminders of how much better Googlers had it than they did. (“It’s like there’s a party happening and some people have to watch it and not come in,” one Pittsburgh Googler told the  of the disparate treatment).Low pay, stingy time off, a lack of responsiveness from management and a constant sense of precarity were common concerns among the HCL workers who spoke to the . “There’s no guarantee that from one Monday to the next we will have a job,” said Josh Borden, who has worked for HCL for three and a half years. “It feels like being on the edge of a cliff all the time.”“From the time I was hired until now, me and my colleagues have been asking for certain things, like a couple extra vacation days, a better healthcare plan, more pay sometimes,” said another HCL worker, Johanne Rokholt. “The answer is always, ‘We’re doing as much as we can … You are lucky and you should feel grateful.’ It’s a one-sided conversation and I would like to see it be a dialogue.”Several of the HCL contractors also expressed frustration with the two-tiered system that allows them to work on Google projects with Google employees in Google’s offices, but doesn’t provide them with the pay or security that direct employees earn.“I’ve been here five years,” said Gabrielle Norton-Moore, who has been at Google Pittsburgh since before HCL got its contract there and says she often feels like a “peasant” at work. “I’ve put in the loyalty and the time and the energy and everything, and it’s just like, there’s no reward at the end of the tunnel.”The union effort is being closely watched by Googlers, many of whom have participated in their own workplace activism in recent years, including the November 2018 walkout over the company’s handling of sexual harassment.A Google software engineer who has worked in the Pittsburgh office for nearly 10 years, Todd Derr, said that he “fully supports” the unionization effort. “I consider everyone who works in the office (and the whole company) to be co-workers, regardless of who technically employs them.”When the HCL workers went public with their union drive, some Googlers published a letter of support and compiled a slide deck of memes with messages of support. After HCL began an anti-union campaign, Googlers published a petition calling on Google to sign a “neutrality agreement”, urging them to condemn the “use of union-busting consultants” by HCL.“Google must commit to a fair election, free of interference, and oppose unfair interference by their business partner, HCL,” one of the Googlers involved with the petition told the . “They must commit to maintain their contract with HCL, without regard for whether or not those employees vote to unionize.”Jenn Kaiser, a spokeswoman for Google, said in a statement: “We work with lots of partners, many of which have unionized workforces, and many of which don’t. As with all our partners, whether HCL’s employees unionize or not is between them and their employer.”Meenakshi Benjwal, HCL’s head of external communications, said in a statement: “We respect our employees legal right to decide whether or not they want to be represented by a union and are dedicated to fostering an inclusive and open office culture for all of our team members at HCL.”The Pittsburgh Googler who spoke on condition of anonymity said that she was excited by the union drive.“Pittsburgh’s the right city for it,” she added. “We’re an industrial city and there’s a whole history of unionization here … Pittsburgh is positioning itself for moving from the steel industry to more of the tech industry and medical industry.

The show was nominated for 32 awards – the most for any single season of television ever – and had already won 10 Creative Arts Emmys last week. Game of Thrones took home the night’s final prize for outstanding drama series and a best supporting actor nod for American star Peter Dinklage – bringing its total to 12 awards and breaking its own 2015 record for the most awards given to a series – but was otherwise shut out of the telecast.Instead, Fleabag emerged as the night’s big winner, upstaging Veep, HBO’s other Emmys mainstay in its final season, and last year’s darling The Marvelous Mrs Maisel. Fleabag, which originated as Waller-Bridge’s one-woman show at the Edinburgh festival fringe, took home the awards for outstanding writing, best comedy series and best directing. Waller-Bridge also claimed lead actress in a comedy series – a surprise win over Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who would have become the most decorated Emmys performer of all time had she won a ninth award for her role as Selina Meyer on Veep.Waller-Bridge, who began her third acceptance speech by saying “This is just getting ridculous”, was the crest of what amounted to a British wave at the Emmys, with wins for several stars: Ben Whishaw (A Very English Scandal) won for outstanding supporting actor in a limited series, while Jodie Comer (Killing Eve) apologized to her Liverpudlian parents for not inviting them because she “didn’t think it was my time” in her speech for lead actress in a drama series. Chernobyl, HBO and Sky Television’s brutal, critically acclaimed limited series on the 1986 nuclear disaster, won for best outstanding writing, best directing and limited series. John Oliver won his fourth consecutive Emmy for best variety series for Last Week Tonight, and Jesse Armstrong took home best drama writing for HBO’s upstart Succession. Black Mirror’s choose-your-own-adventure flick Bandersnatch also won for best television movie.In a hostless awards show packed with more awards than anything else, perhaps the most stirring moment of the night was Michelle Williams’ speech for outstanding lead actress in a limited series (FosseVerdon), in which she heralded gender pay equity. “My bosses never presumed to know better than I did about what I needed in order to do my job and honor Gwen Verdon,” said Williams, now an outspoken activist for gender pay equity following the revelation – to herself and the public – that she was paid significantly less than costar Mark Wahlberg in the movie All the Money in the World. “The next time a woman, and especially a woman of color – because she stands to make 52 cents on the dollar compared to her white male counterpart – tells you what she needs in order to do her job, listen to her,” Williams said to some tears from the audience.The night’s other highlight was an inspiring win for Jharrel Jerome as lead actor in a limited series for When They See Us, Ava DuVernay’s Netflix series on the wrongly convicted Central Park Five that was otherwise shut out of awards by Chernobyl. “This is for the men we know as the exonerated five,” Jerome said as the real Central Park Five, now exonerated, raised their fists in solidarity.Representation and tolerance were also the themes of speeches by Billy Porter (Pose), who took home the prize for lead actor in a drama series – “The category is love, y’all, love!” he shouted – and Patricia Arquette (The Act), who won outstanding supporting actress in a limited series. Arquette dedicated the award to her sister Alexis, a trans woman who died in 2016, and urged an end to discrimination of trans people. “Give them jobs. Let’s get rid of this bias that we have everywhere,” she said.Outside of the British winners, other highlights of the evening included two nods to The Marvelous Mrs Maisel – Tony Shalhoub and Alex Borstein for supporting actor and actress in a comedy series, respectively – and an underdog win for Ozark’s Julia Garner as outstanding supporting actress, besting Daenerys Targaryen herself, Emilia Clarke.Game of Thrones still got its recognition, however, as a portion of its massive cast and crew took the stage for the night’s biggest honor. Given all the fire and ice, dragons and long shoots, “it is amazing that all of you are still alive”, said co-showrunner DB Weiss. “I can’t believe we finished it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34abaf28bbe487f3d7568764ff13b82e927cf54c/0_85_3569_2142/master/3569.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bfd3568f41635c7e779d832142754ac5","title":"today the world belongs to fleabag for once the emmys didnt mess up","story":"In a rarity for these awards, all the winners actually deserved it – which made Game of Thrones’ final triumph after a night of sustained losses feel hollow• Emmys 2019: Fleabag and Game of Thrones win big at Brit-dominated awards• Emmys 2019: best of the ceremony, fashion and red carpet – in picturesGod, it’s weird to watch the Emmys not screw everything up, isn’t it? For decades now, we’ve been conditioned to expect the worst from the ceremony. The patter would be hacky and ill-advised (hello Sofia Vergara on a rotating plinth). The jury would giddily fling awards at movie stars, however mediocre, who deigned to dip their toes into the low-rent world of television. Modern Family would win things. It’s usually such a mess.So last night was strange. For the most part, the awards went to people who actually deserved them. Fleabag won. Barry won. Succession won. Killing Eve won. Ben Whishaw won. Chernobyl won. All the shows you wanted to win, but assumed wouldn’t because they were slightly more challenging than the usual Emmys fare, all won.But let’s start with Game of Thrones, which stormed into the Emmys trailing dozens of nominations behind it, and very nearly came away empty-handed. Four of its stars were nominated for best supporting actress, and all of them lost to Ozark. Three directors were nominated for best direction, and all of them lost to Ozark. Peter Dinklage at least deserved his best dramatic supporting actor win, because he did more than anyone to root this dog’s dinner of a season in some form of humanity. But after a long night of sustained losses, Game of Thrones’ eventual best drama victory felt a little hollow.Much more deserved was all the attention won by Fleabag, which took home lead comedy actress (over Catherine O’Hara!), comedy writing, comedy directing and comedy series. A sweep like this – while once again hinting at the possibility that Emmy voters only watch one comedy a year – is a terrific achievement that is thoroughly deserved and just about validates this publication’s decision to write three separate headlines about Fleabag every single day. I’d question the directing award, because it won against a Barry episode that qualified as an actual work of art. But let’s not quibble too much. Today the world belongs to Phoebe Waller-Bridge, and I can’t wait to see what she does next.The success of Chernobyl continues to fascinate. Not because it doesn’t deserve the attention – my god, it deserves all the attention in the world – but because Craig Mazin won for his writing. Mazin, you’ll remember, wrote The Hangover. If Joker wins big at the Oscars next year, as is predicted, it’s odd to think that the two most critically acclaimed works of the year will have their roots in a film where Ed Helms drugs Mike Tyson’s tiger with Rohypnol.If nothing else, Bandersnatch’s win helped to classify what it actually was. It won best television movie, despite not being on television or being a movie. It’s useful to have this level of categorisation because, if interactive dramas really take off, it prevents the Emmys from having to create a category called Best Bandersnatch.This being the Emmys, there were snubs. Of course there were snubs. Pretty much any time The Marvellous Mrs Maisel wins anything, it’s a snub. This year its awards were confined to the supporting and guest comedy performer categories, with Alex Borstein and Tony Shaloub winning. But they did so at the expense of Henry Winkler, Stephen Root and Anthony Carrigan from Barry, and Fleabag’s Olivia Colman, GLOW’s Betty Gilpin and The Good Place’s D’Arcy Carden who wasn’t even nominated in the first place. For the most part, the Emmys did well this year. But man, when it gets things wrong it really gets things wrong.But, really, the night belonged to the giant back-handed compliment paid to Game of Thrones. Sure, you’re the biggest show of all time. Sure, you changed television forever. But never forget this: you’re no Ozark."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/713b39b9b8b3f3de9a10780f00cfd5e2a095df48/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=432a30c5437413540adb58efa50e9fad","title":"ilhan omar joe biden iowa peoples presidential forum","story":"At the Iowa People’s Presidential Forum on Saturday, organisers hoped to serve up an antidote to the Polk County Steak Fry, an event a few miles down the road that drew 17 Democratic presidential candidates to deliver stump speeches and pose for selfies with 12,000 attendees.The people’s forum, organized by a collective of grassroots groups, aimed to push progressive policy initiatives. It hosted four candidates, including Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, frontrunners in the state that will hold the first nomination ballot on 3 February next year.Perhaps the most notable absence was that of Joe Biden, the former vice-president who Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement Action, the forum organiser, declined to invite after his campaign failed to respond to a questionnaire.Biden, a centrist in a field increasingly dominated by progressive ideas, has dropped behind Warren in the polls in Iowa for the first time.To a number of speakers at the forum, his absence spoke volumes.The Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar, one of four new members of the House of Representatives racially abused by Donald Trump, gave the keynote speech. She demanded “a president who realises we are not just fighting for one election, we are fighting for the very soul of our democracy and what society we want to become”.Asked by the  if Biden could be that candidate, Omar was less than optimistic.“There are few people who fit into the kind of progress that we all want to see in this country,” Omar said. “And I would say he is not one of them.“I think it has been very clear to many of the people who have been creating the kind of movement that is exciting generations, that we want somebody who really has a plan that is going to tackle a lot of the systematic challenges that we have, and he doesn’t.”Asked about Biden’s absence, former housing secretary and presidential hopeful Julián Castro told the : “I’ll just say that if we’re going to win this election in 2020, it’s going to be because we excite people, and we can’t excite them if we don’t show up for them.”Like the other candidates who attended, Castro was pushed by questioners from Iowa and other midwestern states on subjects including Medicare for All, immigration reform and the creation of a “Homes Guarantee” – an initiative that would create 12m new housing units supported by federal rent control to combat a growing housing crisis.Tiana Caldwell, an organiser with Kansas City Tenants in Action, told Castro she was evicted from her home last year and forced into housing with overflowing sewage, which she was also forced to leave, meaning she was homeless for six months.“Why are we forced to live like this in the wealthiest country in history?” she asked. “I can’t take it anymore. I need a homes guarantee.”Castro accepted there were differences between his affordable housing plan to create 3m new homes and the “Homes Guarantee”. He told the audience of around 2,000: “I don’t want to sugar coat that, but I believe that mine is the most ambitious plan that any candidate has put forward.”Warren was also pushed on the Homes Guarantee but declined to endorse it, pushing her plan to invest $500bn over the next decade in affordable housing.Of the four candidates who appeared, only Sanders has endorsed a plan for federal rent control.The senator from Vermont invited the  to observe an intimate meeting with a group of workers from the Fight for $15 group.Kelly Osborne, a McDonald’s worker from Cedar Rapids, told him how her hours had been cut, making a small pay rise from $8.25 to $10 an hour essentially irrelevant. As he listened, Sanders’ smile disappeared.The senator, a longtime backer of the fight for a $15 minimum wage, first met the 44-year-old earlier this year, as he took part in a strike with other fast food workers. He appeared disgusted.“Jesus Christ,” he muttered under his breath.“I’m not making any more money than I was before,” Osborne said, “and I’m working just as hard.”Sanders replied: “There is no end to the greed. Every time you think you hear a new low, then it gets lower.”No candidate was as warmly received as Sanders, who was given standing ovations as he answered questions from community leaders. Among a progressive audience there was little evidence that he was slipping, as the most recent polls suggest.The South Bend, Indiana, mayor, Pete Buttigieg, drew perhaps the most lukewarm response. As he responded to a question about Medicare expansion, which he supports while advocating for a private insurance option, he met with chants of “Medicare for All”. Organisers intervened to quieten the crowd.The questioner, Sameena Mustafa of Seniors in Action in Chicago, asked a follow-up.“A market-driven approach has meant that 40,000 people die a year without healthcare, that a $6 vile of insulin is being sold for $300,” she said. “We know as president you will be commander-in-chief. Will you be the healer-in-chief?”“You can count on it,” Buttigieg said.Mustafa did not seem convinced."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af4fe62004fd97b211b9020e03a7b1142e0e1fd3/0_148_4693_2816/master/4693.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c253fba65ee04de4722e23dfcb86500a","title":"thousands of indian americans expected at modi rally in houston","story":"Deafening drums marked the entrance of Donald Trump and Indian prime minister Narendra Modi as they clasped hands and walked across the stage in a packed Texas stadium on Sunday, sending a message of unity between the world’s two largest democracies despite trade tensions.Trump highlighted the growth of US exports to India, the billions of dollars spent by India on US-made defense equipment and joint military exercises with New Delhi.“India has never invested in the United States like it is doing today,” he said, adding that “we’re doing the same thing in India.”The president also discussed border security, an important campaign issue for Texas, which shares a border with Mexico.“We are taking unprecedented action to secure our southern border and stop illegal immigration,” Trump said.About 50,000 Indian Americans attended the “Howdy Modi!” rally in Houston, where the crowd chanted “Modi! Modi! Modi!” as he took the stage to introduce Trump as “my friend, a friend of India, a great American president”. Modi even used Trump’s political slogan to say the president had a strong resolve to “make America great again.”“When I met him for the first time, he said to me ‘India has a true friend in the White House,’” Modi said. “Mr President, this morning in Houston, you can hear the heartbeat of this great partnership in this celebration of the world’s two largest democracies.”The event had the feel of one of Trump’s campaign rallies, complete with a packed venue and a roaring crowd, and Trump treated it that way at times. He ticked off his accomplishments in office, highlighted a drop in the unemployment rate among Indian Americans and extolled their contributions to the US as he pitched for their vote in a Republican state Democrats have visions of winning next year.Trump said Modi invited him to the rally – one of the largest US gatherings of the Indian diaspora in history – when they met last month in France, and Trump seemed to explain his decision to attend by saying: “I love India.”Earlier this year, Modi won the biggest reelection India has seen in years and his support for Trump could help the president at the polls next year. The two are to meet Tuesday on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.Trump is also scheduled to meet this week with Pakistani leader Imran Khan, who recently solicited his help mediating the Pakistan-India conflict over Kashmir. India’s government has stripped the disputed Himalayan region of its semi-autonomy and launched a security crackdown last month.Trump said US-India bonds are expanding despite tensions over India’s trade surplus with the US. In June, the US canceled special trade privileges that had allowed India to export certain goods with lower tariffs. India responded by slapping tariffs on more than two dozen US goods.The US and India are discussing ways to negotiate at least a partial trade deal, which would let the president score a victory as he campaigns for re-election. A partial deal could include Washington reinstating India’s special tariff status in exchange for concessions related to access to Indian markets, possibly in dairy and medical devices. Other issues are thwarting efforts to sign a larger trade deal.In an address in Hindi to “my family”, Modi briefly mentioned the trade talks and expressed hope that an announcement can be made while he and Trump participate in the UN gathering.Modi said that while Trump has called himself a “tough negotiator”, he has learned a few things from Trump about the art of making deals. After the speeches, Modi asked Trump to walk hand-in-hand around the perimeter of the stadium floor, looking up to the stands of cheering fans.After the Houston event, Trump flew to Ohio, a key state in the 2020 presidential race. He and Australian prime minister Scott Morrison were to mark the opening of an Australian-owned Pratt Industries plant in Wapakoneta. Trump hosted Morrison and his wife, Jenny, on a state visit last week.In Texas, Trump was briefed on recent storm flooding in the south-eastern part of the state when he stopped at a US coast guard station. Authorities blame the storm for at least five deaths."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3361439d402414a22deeea5a8d1fd9355c0b656b/643_834_2499_1499/master/2499.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=615526c3abeb318056f257287cc11201","title":"israel boost for netanyahu as three arab politicians refuse to back rival","story":"Israeli president tasked with choosing candidate to form Israel’s next government after inconclusive electionBenjamin Netanyahu’s chances of being chosen to form Israel’s next government appear to have improved after three politicians from the country’s Arab minority made clear they would not endorse his rival.On Sunday, an alliance of Arab parliamentarians who largely represent Palestinian citizens of Israel announced they would endorse ex-military general Benny Gantz.Support from the Joint List, which won 13 seats in Tuesday’s polls and made the bloc the third-largest force in the 120-seat Knesset, put Gantz slightly in front of Netanyahu. He had 57 recommendations, two ahead of the incumbent prime minister.However, Israel’s president Reuven Rivlin, who is tasked after an election with picking a candidate to form a government, said on Monday morning that three Arab politicians from the Palestinian nationalist Balad party had abstained.He confirmed the recommendations from the Joint List would account for only 10 endorsements, putting Netanyahu ahead by one recommendation.Rivlin, whose role is usually ceremonial, is not obliged to pick Netanyahu. He can choose any candidate he believes has the best chance of forming a government. Usually, the decision is clear, and often goes to the leader of the largest party, but the muddied election result has created an impasse.The president has also suggested that since neither Netanyahu or Gantz have a majority of 61 seats that they form a unity government together. He may summon the two men for talks before next Wednesday’s deadline to choose a candidate.Netanyahu has backed that idea, although he has been coy about who would lead. Gantz has ruled out serving with Netanyahu, who is facing the prospect of three corruption indictments.The Israeli PM is embroiled in four cases involving allegations of bribery and misconduct. He denies wrongdoing in every instance.Case 1000\u0026nbspis an investigation into gifts received on a regular basis by Netanyahu and his family from two wealthy businessmen, including cigars and pink champagne.Case 2000\u0026nbspis examining whether Netanyahu behaved improperly during a taped conversation with a newspaper publisher in which he appeared to try to negotiate more sympathetic coverage in return for lowering the circulation of a rival paper.Case 3000\u0026nbspis an inquiry into alleged kickbacks in a deal to buy German submarines. Netanyahu is not a suspect, but he was closely involved in the deal and the case has ensnared members of his inner circle.\u0026nbspCase 4000, the most serious,\u0026nbspinvolves allegations that Netanyahu offered incentives to the Israeli telecoms company Bezeq in exchange for positive stories in an online news website it owns, Walla.If they do not join together, the president has the power to choose either, who will then have up to six weeks to form a majority government. If that person fails, Rivlin could then ask a second candidate.That scenario played out in May after Netanyahu failed to cobble together a coalition following a similar election result. But rather than give the opposition a chance to forge a government, he instead pushed to dissolve the Knesset, triggering repeat elections and giving himself another chance.Many fear a third election will be called in the current stalemate continues. Israel’s apparent kingmaker, the far-right ultranationalist Avigdor Lieberman, has said he will not back either and also called for a unity government.Sunday’s endorsement of Gantz by Arab parties, while not giving him a clear lead, broke an almost-three-decade policy of not supporting an Israeli leader while the occupation in the Palestinians territories continues.The last time Arab parties backed a candidate was in 1992, when they  suported Yitzhak Rabin, who went on to sign the Oslo accords with the Palestinians. Palestinian citizens of Israel, or Arab Israelis, make up close to a fifth of the 9 million population.Leaders in the group made clear they were not backing Gantz, who led a devastating 2014 war on Gaza, but instead attempting to topple Netanyahu, whose election campaign focused on demonising Arab Palestinian citizens and who pushed for a law they say made them second-class citizens.“We have become illegitimate in Israeli politics in the Netanyahu era,” the leader of the Joint List, Ayman Odeh, told Rivlin when informing him of the endorsement. “We are this time recommending Benny Gantz to form the next government.”The prominent Arab parliament member Ahmad Tibi added: “History is done: we’ll do what is needed to bring down Netanyahu.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26583788c3bb041dfb3fc0a1d35446442ae17b0b/1425_660_5163_3098/master/5163.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e56b197c9e36e4a11089fa88a3a6a225","title":"monday briefing thomas cook goes bust stranding thousands","story":"Huge repatriation gets underway … Corbyn facing Brexit revolt at conference … Three Emmys for Phoebe Waller-BridgeGood morning briefers.

The programme that started life as her one-woman show in Edinburgh was judged best comedy series, and she also won for best writing and best actress, the latter a surprise win ahead of much-tipped Julia Louis-Dreyfus for Veep.

First, he played down speculation that he might make a breakthrough on Brexit this week when he holds a series of meetings with European leaders also attending the summit. He claimed that EU leaders might not “necessarily have an attachment to the backstop”, but conceded there were still “gaps and difficulties”.

The report says current plans would lead to a rise in average global temperatures of between 2.9C and 3.4C by 2100. Severe heatwaves, record-breaking wildfires, declining sea ice and glaciers, cyclones, floods and drought, have all hit sooner and harder than predicted a decade ago, it says, and the period 2014-19 has been the warmest five-year-period on record. UN secretary general António Guterres, who presides over the climate action summit this week, says “we have no time to lose”.Housing crisis – An estimated 8.4 million people are living in unsuitable housing, making them more likely to experience homelessness, serious debt and poor health . A survey of 40,000 people for the National Housing Federation estimated that 3.6 million are living in an overcrowded home, 2.5 million are unable to afford their rent or mortgage and 2.5 million cannot afford to move out of house shares or their parents’ house. Another study today shows that the number of empty houses in Britain increased by almost 11,000 to 216,000 last year.In the weeks leading up to the war in Iraq, Katharine Gun exposed a US plot to spy on the UN in leaks published in the Observer.

The Swedish diplomat had by that time saved an estimated 30,000 Hungarian Jews from the Nazi deaths camps but it has never been established exactly how, when or where he perished. This week his nieces are travelling to Stockholm to demand “specific answers to specific questions” after what they believe has been a decades-long coverup. “His story is unfinished – the mystery must be resolved.

He deserves for us to know what happened to him. His story is unfinished – the mystery must be resolved. There are still so many closed doors, and we must have help in opening them.”No formal, official announcement has ever been made about the fate of Wallenberg, often called Sweden’s Schindler, who has become an honorary citizen of four countries and the subject of countless books and films since vanishing in early 1945 into the the Soviet prison system, where he is presumed to have died.Together with historians, the diplomat’s closest family have for decades wrestled with Soviet, and subsequently Russian, authorities, who they are now certain have withheld crucial information and, at times, actively misled researchers.But they have also faced a largely inert Swedish government that, they say, has since the end of the war displayed an understandable but acutely frustrating reluctance to do anything to antagonise its powerful eastern near neighbour.Susanne Berger is an American historian who acted as consultant to the Swedish-Russian working group that investigated Wallenberg’s fate from 1995 to 2005 and has since founded a research initiative that bears his name.She said: “We know for sure that the Russian side has important information it hasn’t released. But Sweden does not push hard enough to obtain that material.” Berger will accompany Von Dardel-Dupuy to Stockholm on 25 September to meet foreign ministry officials and MPs. She said: “We understand the pressures: we know it has to act with circumspection. But it could do far more.”The former Swedish prime minister, Göran Persson (in office from 1996 to 2006) apologised unreservedly for his country’s inertia over the case in 2001, noting that as long as there was “no unequivocal evidence of what happened to Wallenberg – and this is still the case – it cannot be said he is dead”.But, Berger observed, in practice little has changed since then. She said Von Dardel-Dupuy would hand Swedish officials a letter formally asking them to submit an official request to Russian authorities for access to 10 key documents or files that researchers knew existed, and were “crucial to the investigation of Wallenberg’s fate”.Berger said the demand went to the heart of the current dispute with Swedish authorities. She said: “Rather than act itself, Sweden places the onus of finding the truth on the shoulders of researchers and Wallenberg’s family – when it is quite clear that without official support this will always be an impossible task.”Raoul Wallenberg was 31 when, in July 1944, he volunteered to travel as a diplomat to Hungary as part of a US-funded effort to protect the 200,000 Jews still living in Budapest. More than 400,000 outside the capital had already been transported to Nazi death camps.He recruited 350 volunteers, rented 32 safe houses covered by diplomatic immunity, organised vital supplies of food and clothing, and issued thousands of “letters of protection”, official-looking documents that had no legal authority but were widely accepted by Hungarian and German officials, often with the aid of a bribe.Just six months after he arrived, however, Wallenberg – a member of the wealthy Swedish family of industrialists and bankers – himself became a victim. Invited to the Soviet military HQ in eastern Hungary, he was arrested and taken to Moscow.His family have never received an official explanation for his detention, although suspicions he was also spying for the Americans, and his connections with some senior German politicians – he negotiated his humanitarian mission with, among others, Adolf Eichmann – have been suggested.Worse, his family do not know for sure what happened to him afterwards. In 1957, Moscow produced a document dated 17 July 1947. It was signed by the governor of the Lubyanka prison infirmary, claiming Wallenberg had died that night of a heart attack and that his body had been cremated.Since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, however, Russian officials have also said – without evidence, and claiming variously that he was poisoned and shot – that the diplomat was summarily executed in 1947. Unconfirmed reports that Wallenberg was still alive continued to surface until the late 1980s.Over the decades, the uncertainty has taken its toll on Wallenberg’s family. His mother, Maj, and stepfather, Fredrik von Dardel (his father died before he was born), devoted the rest of their lives to trying to discover the fate of their son, finally killing themselves two days apart in 1979.Their son, Guy von Dardel, the diplomat’s late half-brother, a particle physicist who helped establish Cern, sat on numerous commissions and travelled more than 50 times to Moscow, examining what records he could and compiling a 50,000-page dossier – but without ever uncovering any conclusive proof.His daughters, Marie and Louise, now in their 60s, have also campaigned tirelessly, convinced the mystery could be solved within a year if Berger, her colleague Vadim Birstein and other Wallenberg experts had access to the relevant documents.Among the classified records to which the historians want access are Soviet files on Willy Rodel, a German diplomat and Soviet informer who shared a cell with Wallenberg, and files that could help explain four days between Wallenberg’s transfer from Lefortovo prison to Lubyanka when his whereabouts are unknown.The researchers are also keen to see Red army – as opposed to military counter-intelligence – files relating to Wallenberg, as well as interviews with the diplomat’s colleagues and Soviet intelligence reports on the wider Wallenberg family and its often controversial business interests.But their main interest, said Birstein, a historian who was a member of the first international commission on Wallenberg in 1990, is in the records of prisoner No 7, a still unidentified prisoner who they know was interrogated, together with Wallenberg’s driver, for more than 16 hours on 23 July 1947.If, as researchers firmly believe, prisoner No 7 was actually Wallenberg, that means the diplomat was still alive six days after his official date of death. “It’s absolutely unclear why they are still refusing to release this material,” said Birstein. “We know these records exist – so what do they have to hide?”After a formal request by Von Dardel-Dupuy in 2018, Sweden last month belatedly released 40,000 pages of its own Wallenberg archives dating mainly from 1970 to 2018 – meaning a total of 170,000 pages are now available in Stockholm.Margot Wallström, the foreign minister who has since resigned, said at the time that it was “important to keep Wallenberg’s memory alive”.She added: “His civic courage inspires us, and is much needed in today’s world. The government will continue to support the work of trying to get clarity on his destiny.”Berger said that was not really good enough. She said: “There’s a gulf between the words and the action. Seventy-five years after Raoul Wallenberg risked his life in Budapest, the question is no longer when the truth will be known, but why neither side seems to have the political will to reveal it.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Ex junior minister lost her Cork North Central seat in 2016 general electionIncident happened at Tinnycahill, Clar at about 8pm on Sunday nightCountries urged to increase ambition to tackle emission at action summitDetectives believe same gang behind three incidents in four nights in Cork and KerryAnti-immigrant activists trying to dominate and exploit local debates on direct provisionBlaze at Matt Talbot centre in Ballyfermot has curtailed support programmesFunding sought for scheme that will not require offenders to talk about crimeIn bid to retain staff Government expected to review status quoCampaigners say vulnerable pupils excluded from education through short school daysChildren\u0026rsquos Rights Alliance says greater support from schools and communities neededContainer inside which businessman was tortured is believed to have been identifiedFrequent train commuters report serious overcrowding, anti-social behaviourFianna F\u0026aacuteil pledges to end two-tier pay system for hospital consultants appointed since 2012 if it leads the next governmentThe Disappeared: \u0026lsquoImpossible to describe continuing pain of another search ending\u0026rsquoLeo Varadkar to announce move at UN General Assembly on MondayNew website Peaktime.ie will enable rail users to check for less crowded trainsKey skills include teamwork, problem-solving and adaptabilityWith more formal education than any previous generation, today\u0026rsquos graduates are tech savvy and ambitiousEven the rain turned up to witness the green monster Schmidt\u0026rsquos defensive set-up has becomeUSI president questions global rankings as provost warns student numbers may be cut"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4026783.1569181619!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"corbyn faces revolt as pressure mounts over brexit stance","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLabour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn at the party’s annual conference in Brighton, on Sunday.   Photograph: Daniel  Leal-OlivasAFPGetty ImagesBritish Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn is facing a revolt over Brexit at his party’s annual conference in Brighton amid growing pressure on Labour to campaign for the United Kingdom to stay in the European Union. Calling for a second referendum and a Labour Remain campaign, shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said policy must be “thrashed out” this week at the conference ahead of an imminent general election.However, Mr Corbyn and Labour’s National Executive Committee (NEC) wants to delay a decision until after a general election is held, fearing the loss of Brexit-supporting Labour voters.The NEC voted by 16 to 10 in favour of a statement calling for a Labour government to negotiate a new withdrawal agreement within three months and to put it to a referendum within six months.ReferendumA special conference would decide what position the party should take in the referendum, which would be a choice between remaining in the EU or backing an exit deal but a no-deal Brexit would not be an option.Labour’s debate over Brexit comes as British prime minister Boris Johnson prepares to meet some EU leaders, including Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, at the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Mr Johnson has been talking up the likelihood of a deal. However, foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Sunday that a Northern Ireland-only solution to the Border could not go beyond the agrifood sector.Such moves would go beyond the Good Friday agreement which everyone “wants to preserve”, said Mr Raab. “Fundamentally that’s democratically wrong.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Victoria JonesPA WireJeremy Corbyn has dismissed speculation that he is planning to step down as Labour leader, after some of his allies launched a botched attempt to abolish the post of deputy leader, which is held by one of his critics, Tom Watson. Mr Corbyn said he was not aware of the move against Mr Watson but backed a proposal that could see the deputy leader blocked from becoming acting leader if the leader steps down.The furore over the deputy leadership overshadowed the start of Labour’s annual conference in Brighton, which is expected to be the last before the next general election. Mr Corbyn suffered a major blow on Sunday morning when it emerged that one of his top advisers, Andrew Fisher, had resigned following clashes with other members of the leader’s inner circle.Mr Fisher, who was the main author of Labour’s 2017 manifesto, said in a public statement that he was stepping down because the demands of his job meant he could not spend enough time with his family. But in a message sent to colleagues last week and leaked to the Sunday Times, Mr Fisher blamed the “lack of professionalism, competence and human decency” of Mr Corbyn’s team.He said he no longer had faith that the party could win the next election and criticised the leaders’ office’s preparations for the party conference.“Tens of thousands of pounds have been spent on focus groups and polling for this and there is no end-product, just a blizzard of lies and excuses,” he is quoted as saying.Mr Corbyn said he had spoken to Mr Fisher and he praised his contribution to the party since 2015. He rejected speculation that the move against Mr Watson was part of a plan to prepare the way for his own departure as leader.Private schools“I’m taking the party into the general election. I’m taking the party into the general election to end austerity, to bring forward policies that bring about a better standard of living and better opportunities for people all across this country. I’m enjoying doing that, I’m campaigning all the time,” Mr Corbyn told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show.The conference on Sunday backed a motion committing the party to abolishing private schools in Britain, starting with the withdrawal of their charitable status for tax purposes. It means Labour’s next manifesto will commit the party to ensuring that universities admit the same proportion of private school students as in the wider population (currently 7 per cent) and that “endowments, investments and properties held by private schools to be redistributed democratically and fairly across the country’s educational institutions”.The motion notes that 65 per cent of senior judges, 52 per cent of junior ministers and 44 per cent of newspaper columnists in Britain went to private schools.“The ongoing existence of private schools is incompatible with Labour’s pledge to promote social justice, not social mobility in education. Labour is opposed to hierarchy, elitism and selection in education. Private schools reflect and reinforce class inequality in wider society,” it says."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4026788.1569181325!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"labour conference in brighton off to shambolic start","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Labour’s   deputy leader Tom Watson at the  party conference in Brighton. Photograph: Daniel Leal-OlivasAFPGetty ImagesEven by the frenzied standard of contemporary British politics, Labour’s annual conference in Brighton has got off to a startlingly shambolic start. The bungled attempt to abolish Tom Watson’s post of deputy leader contrived to weaken the position of everyone involved.Momentum founder Jon Lansman, who led the plot, looked foolish when Jeremy Corbyn pulled the plug on it. Corbyn looked gormless when he told Andrew Marr he had known nothing about it – “I’m not all-seeing and all-knowing: I’d love to be.” And although Watson survived an alternative to Lansman’s motion will effectively block his path to becoming acting leader if Corbyn steps down.Hostilities between Watson and Corbyn’s circle are nothing new, but the resignation of Andrew Fisher highlights the isions among the leader’s supporters. A key adviser since Corbyn won the Labour leadership in 2015, Fisher was the architect of the party’s 2017 general election platform of Keynesian social democracy which proved popular with voters.Fisher’s unhappiness centred on the culture within Corbyn’s office and what he described as its lack of professionalism. Many more of the Labour leader’s allies are frustrated with his approach to Brexit, where he is resisting pressure to commit the party to keeping Britain in the EU.Delegates were preparing to work through the night in an attempt to agree on a composite motion that would replace dozens of Brexit motions from constituencies. But the trade unions, which control half the votes at conference, will ram through Corbyn’s preferred position unless a compromise is found. General electionCorbyn wants to postpone a decision on whether to back remaining in the EU until after a general election, a Labour government to negotiate a new withdrawal agreement within three months and to put it to a referendum within six months. A special conference would decide what position the party should take in the referendum, which would be a choice between remaining in the EU or backing an exit deal, but a no-deal Brexit would not be an option.Labour’s isions over Brexit and infighting at the top are likely to overshadow domestic policy announcements at the conference. But the party’s commitment to dramatically expand universal benefits on the model of the National Health Service could form the heart of its campaign against Boris Johnson at the next election.Such ambitious policies to transform society, along with eye-catching initiatives like the abolition of private schools, could help Labour to move the focus of the next election away from Brexit to more promising terrain.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Video: The White House\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDonald Trump outside the White House on Sunday. Democrats haven’t been able to get him on obstruction of justice. But maybe this time they’ll finally bring him down.  Photograph: Alastair PikeAFPGetty ImagesEveryone here is keyed up for the Big One. The One that’s going to finally bring Donald Trump down.As soon as the news broke Wednesday night in the Washington Post that a whistleblower had accused the president of making some sort of nefarious “promise” during a call to a foreign leader, the hive erupted.Democrats haven’t been able to get Trump on paying off a porn star to protect his campaign. They haven’t been able to get him on being a Russian agent. They haven’t been able to get him on obstruction of justice. But maybe this time. Maybe this was the One where all would decide that they wanted impeachment, that the president’s behaviour was so outrageous that they couldn’t imagine this sleazy business guy sitting in the Oval Office playing a tinpot dictator in a tinfoil hat for another second.Maybe this was the One that would finally move Republicans to turn on the Grendel who is terrorising the village and gulping down their party. Certainly, Trump himself didn’t think so. As the capital was going into overdrive-freak-out mode Friday night trying to flesh out the whistleblower story, the president was busy tweeting about a children’s book by a Fox News host: “Buy this Book – great for the kids!”WhistleblowerIf House Democrats can ever get their paws on the whistleblower, maybe they can make up for the judiciary committee’s performance with Corey Lewandowski this past week, which left many wondering if these hearings designed to pry Trump out of office are just making Democrats look foolish.They certainly provide an ample platform for Trump loyalists to rail against their favourite deep state foils. When failed presidential candidate Eric Swalwell tried to get Lewandowski to read a message Trump had dictated to him, the witness nastily referred to the Democrat as “President Swalwell” and told him to read the message himself.The internecine strains between the impeach-now Nadler crowd and the get-him-out-in-2020 Pelosi crew grew more bitter. Politico reported that in a closed-door meeting, House speaker Nancy Pelosi shocked lawmakers and aides by harshly criticising the House judiciary committee staffers for propelling the impeachment effort far beyond where the Democratic caucus stands. “And you can feel free to leak this,” Pelosi said acidly.In an interview with NPR, she said she hadn’t changed her mind on impeachment, but she does think Congress should pass new laws so future presidents can be indicted. She said everyone had now seen what the founding fathers could not imagine: a president blatantly abusing the constitution he has sworn to protect.Above the lawTrump has certainly been working hard to prove Pelosi right that presidents should not ever be above the law. By Friday night, while Trump was readying for a state dinner with his ultraconservative pal from down under, Australian prime minister Scott Morrison, the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times were reporting that the secret whistleblower complaint involved this: Trump repeatedly pressured President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine – about eight times, the Journal said – to work with Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s loony personal lawyer, to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden.Giuliani has been pushing a story about the former vice-president and his son, who had ties to a Ukrainian oligarch. After a fair bit of babbling on Chris Cuomo’s CNN show, Giuliani spit out some truth, that he asked Ukrainians to look into the Bidens.Later he tweeted: “A President telling a Pres-elect of a well known corrupt country he better investigate corruption that affects US is doing his job.” Crooked Donald thinks he can create a Crooked Joe narrative just like he created a Crooked Hillary one. Which is it, Donald: Crooked or Sleepy?Escaped the nooseSo just consider this: Around the same time that Trump escaped the noose after Robert Mueller’s tepid testimony, sliding away from charges that he colluded with a foreign country to interfere in our election, he began arm-twisting another foreign country to interfere in our election. “Questions have emerged,” the Times said, “about whether Mr Trump’s push for an inquiry into the Bidens was behind a weeks-long White House hold on military aid for Ukraine.The United States suspended the military aid to Ukraine in early July, according to a former American official.” So the president is under suspicion of making like Nixon and abusing power to go after his enemies, saying it would be a shame if anything happened to that military aid that you want because you don’t dig up some dirt on the son of my political rival.Pelosi’s acerbic statementThe administration kept the whistleblower’s complaint from Congress, even though Congress has the legal authority to know what this urgent complaint is about. Pelosi issued an acerbic statement on Friday, noting that Joseph Maguire, acting director of national intelligence, was violating the law by refusing to disclose the complaint to Congress.“If the president has done what has been alleged, then he is stepping into a dangerous minefield with serious repercussions for his administration and our democracy,” she said. Trump is literally acting like an international mobster. Roy Cohn would be so proud. So is this the Big One? We don’t know because so much has come before. But if it is? Now that would be big.Read more about the Donald Trump administration"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons september 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraph matt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Brexit latest news: Key NEC meeting on Brexit has been cancelled as Labour\u0026#39s shadow chancellor backs remainComment: At last we know what Jeremy Corbyn thinks of Brexit: whatever Labour members tell him to thinkThomas Cook collapse: Misery across Europe as stranded Britons wait for repatriationLondon theatre: the best plays and shows on nowUN General Assembly 2019: Four things to watch out forAutumn Equinox 2019: The science behind the changing seasonsOperation Matterhorn: Everything Thomas Cook customers abroad need to know  When and where will the Duke and Duchess of Sussex be on their 2019 South Africa Royal Tour? Supreme Court prorogation appeal: What could the judges decide and when will the verdict be released?

Australia were all out for 284 after Steve Smith frustrated the hosts with a total of 144. He helped drag his side from 122-8The institute also found that since the 2016 vote to leave the EU most employers have focused on retaining existing EU staff, rather than on planning for immigration restrictions.Very few employers are ready for the end of free movement and restrictions on immigration in just over a year. Worse still, many seem both daunted and alarmed by the range of restrictions planned and the costs they are likely to incur,” said Gerwyn Davies, senior labour market adviser for the CIPD.“It seems inevitable that the rate of inflow of EU citizens into the UK from 2021 will fall compared with recent years,” he added.The CIPD urged the government to bring in immigration restrictions gradually to give firms more time to adjust and to avoid harming UK competitiveness.It recommended introducing a two-year visa system for unskilled workers and making an exception for some jobs with labour shortages by lowering the proposed £30,000 salary requirement for foreign workers.One engineering firm in Scotland told the CIPD that the average salary of a skilled manufacturing worker is £28,000. “That’s a significant issue for us,” the employer said.The British Chambers of Commerce also highlighted lingering gaps in government guidance on the status of EU migrants despite the fast-approaching Brexit deadline of 31 October.“The implications of unclear government advice, and gaps in the system, could be costly for businesses that may feel they need to access professional help,” the group said on Friday.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Australia were all out for 284 after Steve Smith frustrated the hosts with a total of 144. He helped drag his side from 122-8The institute also found that since the 2016 vote to leave the EU most employers have focused on retaining existing EU staff, rather than on planning for immigration restrictions.Very few employers are ready for the end of free movement and restrictions on immigration in just over a year. Worse still, many seem both daunted and alarmed by the range of restrictions planned and the costs they are likely to incur,” said Gerwyn Davies, senior labour market adviser for the CIPD.“It seems inevitable that the rate of inflow of EU citizens into the UK from 2021 will fall compared with recent years,” he added.The CIPD urged the government to bring in immigration restrictions gradually to give firms more time to adjust and to avoid harming UK competitiveness.It recommended introducing a two-year visa system for unskilled workers and making an exception for some jobs with labour shortages by lowering the proposed £30,000 salary requirement for foreign workers.One engineering firm in Scotland told the CIPD that the average salary of a skilled manufacturing worker is £28,000. “That’s a significant issue for us,” the employer said.The British Chambers of Commerce also highlighted lingering gaps in government guidance on the status of EU migrants despite the fast-approaching Brexit deadline of 31 October.“The implications of unclear government advice, and gaps in the system, could be costly for businesses that may feel they need to access professional help,” the group said on Friday.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That includes new features like improved multi-tasking, a re-designed home screen and more.When the new iPhone update arrivesThis is the first year that Apple has split the operating systems for iPhone and iPad into separate releases, with the latter being referred to as iPadOS. That has presumably allowed the company to more easily stagger the different releases.And it will not be until 30 September that Apple TV gets its own software update, too. That update, named tvOS 13, will bring support for multiple users as well as the ability to use Xbox and PS4 controllers with Apple\u0027s set-top box.Apple presumably could not delay the release of iOS 13 for iPhones in the same way as the Apple TV and iPad because the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro will be released this week, and they needed a stable version of the new software to ship on them.The company did unveil a new iPad at its September event, when the new iPhones were shown off, but that device will not ship until 30 September.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Months ago, that was the date that a college student typed into a joke Facebook event, before writing the words that would go on to make it become a day of angst for the US military and residents who live near Area 51.Next to that date, a bored young man called Matty Roberts writes an event description that would propel the page to viral fame.“Storm Area 51, They Can’t Stop All of Us,” it read.Now that the day has arrived, the mission to “storm Area 51” looks very different than it did during that moment of excited viral fame. It went from an online joke, to something that prompted action from both the US military and Facebook, to a potential disaster for the people who are intending to turn up after all.The event began as a joke. That much was clear from the description, which referenced an anime character and suggested people would be able to outrun bullets.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month - August 2019 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.When stars like the Sun grow advanced in age, they expand and glow red.

Lets see them aliens.”The page developed in the same comedic manner, playing host to a variety of jokes and memes that sarcastically riffed on aliens and the secrets of the government.Storm Area 51 event could be disaster, locals fearBut it very quickly became very serious indeed. As interest in the Facebook page grew, so did anxiety that some people might really try to break into the base – and US Air Force spokesperson\u0026nbspLaura McAndrews\u0026nbspwas one of a number of officials who\u0026nbspgave a stern warning to anyone who did.Ms McAndrews added: “The US Air Force always stands ready to protect America and its assets”.Last month, the event disappeared from Facebook. It wasn’t clear exactly why, and at the point it was removed more than two million people had indicated they would take part.It was particularly frustrating for organiser Mr Roberts because he had attempted to parlay the interest into a real event: the equally ill-fated Alienstock. Rather than raiding Area 51, that woud be a festival devoted to the culture that surrounds it, attempting to harness people’s interest in the moment into something organised and profitable, rather than potentially lethal.There are now three different major events planned, with a number of others likely. It’s not clear how many people will be arriving in Nevada to take part in them.Two of the main ones are now called Alienstock, after some confusion and disagreement between the people organising them. One will happen in Las Vegas, and appears to be something like a more traditional EDM festival the other is taking place in the tiny town of Rachel, Nevada, in the heart of Area 51-country.It’s that event in particular that has led locals to “prepare for the worst”. Rachel is a tiny town, with a population of around 54, which is only about twice the number of musical acts advertised as performing at the event.Last month, the town’s official website posted a warning indicating that the event has a “high potential to get ugly”. The town and the harsh desert that surrounds it has few places for anyone to stay, is subject to wildly fluctuating temperatures, is home to dangerous animals and the local area has no internet,\u0026nbspphone signal or credit card facilities.Those warnings are still continuing as the weekend begins. This week, local Joerg Arnu said that people did not know what they were getting themselves in for.“Those that know what to expect camping in the desert are going to have a good time,” Arnu said. “Those who are looking for a big party are going to be disappointed.”He predicts people showing up in the desert in shorts and flip-flops.“That doesn’t protect you against critters, snakes and scorpions,” Arnu said. “It will get cold at night. They’re not going to find what they’re looking for, and they are going to get angry.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Sixty-nine per cent said it was either “completely unclear” or “fairly unclear”, while just 15 per cent thought it was clear.In a sign that 2017 Labour voters risk\u0026nbspabandoning the party over Brexit, 58 per cent of this group said the party’s policy was not clear, compared to 30 per cent who thought it was.Created with Sketch.Brexit and climate protests at Labour party conference: In pictures Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn walks past anti-Brexit campaigner on the second day of the party conference in BrightonA protester holds a sign mocking Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s Brexit stance at the party conference in BrightonActivists from anti-climate change movement Extinction Rebellion march on the Labour conference in BrightonDelegates take part in an informal vote on Labour\u0027s Brexitr stance at the party conference in BrightonShadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry leads a march in support of a second referendum on BrexitAnti-Brexit protesters take part in a People\u0027s Vote rally during the Labour party conference in BrightonExtinction RebelliActivists from anti-climate change movement Extinction Rebellion march on the Labour conference in BrightononExtinction Rebellion activists march on the Labour conference in BrightonA delegate arrives carrying a briefing from the Labour Representation Committee to the Labour party conference in BrightonProminent anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray protests on Brighton beach during the Labour party conferenceAnti-Brexit protesters take part in a People\u0027s Vote rally during the Labour party conference in BrightonActivists raise a banner calling for the Labour party to restore the original Clause 4 of its constitution, which would pledge the party to nationalising all industryLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn walks past anti-Brexit campaigner on the second day of the party conference in BrightonA protester holds a sign mocking Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s Brexit stance at the party conference in BrightonActivists from anti-climate change movement Extinction Rebellion march on the Labour conference in BrightonDelegates take part in an informal vote on Labour\u0027s Brexitr stance at the party conference in BrightonShadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry leads a march in support of a second referendum on BrexitAnti-Brexit protesters take part in a People\u0027s Vote rally during the Labour party conference in BrightonExtinction RebelliActivists from anti-climate change movement Extinction Rebellion march on the Labour conference in BrightononExtinction Rebellion activists march on the Labour conference in BrightonA delegate arrives carrying a briefing from the Labour Representation Committee to the Labour party conference in BrightonProminent anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray protests on Brighton beach during the Labour party conferenceAnti-Brexit protesters take part in a People\u0027s Vote rally during the Labour party conference in BrightonActivists raise a banner calling for the Labour party to restore the original Clause 4 of its constitution, which would pledge the party to nationalising all industryThose who want Mr Corbyn to pledge that a Labour government would keep Britain in the EU have warned that the party risks\u0026nbsplosing significant support to the Liberal Democrats and SNP unless it takes a firmer stance against Brexit.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It found that only 27 per cent of Remain backers support\u0026nbspthe position he has taken, while 46 per cent say they disagree with it.The figures among all voters are even worse for the Labour leader, with 55 per cent saying they disagreed with his position compared to just 16 per cent who support it.People who voted Labour in 2017 are also more likely to be unhappy with Mr Corbyn’s strategy, with 39 per cent against and 32 per cent in favour.However, Mr Corbyn is likely to be buoyed by support from people who say they plan to vote Labour at the next election. Six out of every 10\u0026nbspcurrent Labour supporters back his position, while only 18 per cent disagree.Chris Curtis, YouGov’s political research manager, said: “New YouGov polling demonstrates how Corbyn has fallen out of favour with not just the wider public at large but his own voters too, as a majority of 2017 Labour backers now think it’s time for him to stand down.“The task now for the Labour leader, with an election seemingly imminent, is to win back these voters if he is to stand any chance of emulating his 2017 success.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

We want to lift the overall standard, not bring everyone down to the same level.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But I can say today, that our very first Budget will immediately close the tax loopholes used by elite private schools, and use that money to improve the lives of all children.”The news was welcomed by anti-private school campaigners.Holly Rigby, from the Abolish Eton campaign, said: “We are delighted that Labour has committed to integrating all\u0026nbspprivate\u0026nbspschools\u0026nbspinto the state sector and that it will feature in the next manifesto.”She added: “We will dismantle systems of privilege and inequality and build a society that works for the millions and not the millionaires.”But the Independent Schools Council (ISC) warned Labour that the policy would be a “vote loser”.Citing a ComRes survey for the organisation, Barnaby Lenon, chair of the\u0026nbspISC\u0026nbspchair and a former headmaster of Harrow, said:\u0026nbsp“t’s not something that people are thinking is going to be especially helpful. The main thing they want to do is improve state schools, which is what we all want.“If you look at the proportions that are less likely to vote for a party abolishing independent schools or are neutral, the figure ranges between 62 and 77 per cent across all regions and it ranges from 64 to 75 per cent across all age groups.

If\u0026nbsppassed, the text would become\u0026nbspofficial party policy.The change would\u0026nbspextend the right to vote in general elections to anyone with residency rights in the UK, regardless of their nationality. Currently only British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens are allowed to vote in general elections. Other foreign\u0026nbspnationals living in Britain can vote only in local elections and European elections.The proposal\u0026nbspwill be debated at the Labour conference in Brighton after being quietly included\u0026nbspin a motion that says a Labour government should maintain and extend freedom of movement even if Britain leaves the EU, including by opposing any new immigration system based on migrants\u0027 income\u0026nbspor skills.\u0026nbspThe text says that, if Labour wins the next\u0026nbspelection, it will extend equal rights to vote to all UK residents.Labour votes to abolish private schools at party conferenceIt also says that a Labour government would close all detention centres and scrap all Hostile Environment measures, including restrictions on migrants\u0027 access to the NHS and welfare payments.Extending the voting franchise would likely have a\u0026nbspmajor impact if it was implemented before any second Brexit referendum and applied to the subsequent poll,\u0026nbspwith the 3 million EU citizens living in the UK easily enough to swing any vote heavily towards Remain. In the 2016 referendum, only people with the right to vote in UK general elections were allowed to vote.It would also be likely\u0026nbspto deliver millions more votes for pro-EU and pro-immigration parties in future general elections.The move has been co-ordinated by the Labour Campaign for Free Movement and is expected to be approved by conference delegates when it is put to a vote on Monday.A statement\u0026nbspaccompanying the motion, signed by Labour MPs, trade unionists and representatives of EU citizens in the UK, said it was fundamentally wrong that millions of people living in the UK are currently denied the right to vote.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

suggested attendees “all meet up” to “see them aliens” at the base which conspiracy theorists claim holds evidence of extraterrestrials.The event page was later shut down following condemnation from

One person starts something and it infects everybody with positivity. Anything can happen if you give people a place to be.The entertainment kicked off weekend events that also feature a gathering Friday and Saturday at the Alien Research Centre souvenir store in Hiko.Owner George Harris said it would focus on music, movies and talks about extraterrestrial lore.Authorities reported no serious incidents related to the festivals, which were\u0026nbspscheduled to last until Sunday.Hiko and Rachel are about a 45-minute drive apart on a state road dubbed the Extraterrestrial Highway, and a two-hour drive from Las Vegas.Michael Ian Borer, a University of Nevada, Las Vegas, sociologist who researches pop culture and paranormal activity, called the festivities sparked by the internet joke a perfect blend of interest in aliens and the supernatural, government conspiracies, and the desire to know what we don\u0027t know.YouTuber sentenced to jail after attempting to film Area 51People desire to be part of something, to be ahead of the curve, he said. Area 51 is a place where normal, ordinary citizens can\u0027t go. When you tell people they can\u0027t do something, they just want to do it more.Eric Holt, the Lincoln County emergency manager, said he believed authorities could handle 30,000 visitors at the two events. Still, neighbours braced for trouble after more than two million people responded to the Storm Area 51 Facebook post weeks ago.Those that know what to expect camping in the desert are going to have a good time, said Joerg Arnu, a Rachel resident who can see the festival grounds from his home.Those who show up in shorts and flip-flops will find no protection against critters, snakes and scorpions, he warned.It will get cold at night.

It was eating our chickens and rabbits.Name: Champ ChampyLocation: Lake Champlain, USA and CanadaAppearance: Massive water snakeNessie isnt the only lake-based monster to capture the imagination of terried locals.Champ or Champy is a giant monster said to swim beneath the surface of Lake Champlain, which is split between New York, Vermont and Quebec.Over  sightings have been made of Champ, with the first recorded in .A sailor named Captain Crum said he saw an enormous serpentine monster which he reckoned to be around  feet long with three teeth and eyes the colour of peeled onions.He added that the creature had a belt of red around its neck and a white star on its forehead.P.T. Barnum, the historical figure played by Hugh Jackman in The Greatest Showman, even offered a reward to whoever brought him the monster.Interest in the lake snake exploded in  when Sandra Mansi snapped a picture of a huge creature sticking out of the water, and dozens of other images supposedly of Champ have been captured since.In , an article was published in a peer-reviewed scientic journal describing the discovery of sound measurements in the lake consistent with killer and beluga whales — neither of which are known to live in Lake Champlain.Name: Underwater panther MishipeshuLocation: Michipicoten Island and Great Lakes, CanadaAppearance: Scaly lynx with a spiked spineThe underwater panther or Mishipeshu is one of the most important mythical beings to the indigenous peoples of the Northeastern Woodlands around the Great Lakes in the USA and Canada.It has the head and claws of a giant Lynx-like cat, but has scales all over its body and has sharp spikes along its tail and back.The underwater panther is known for guarding huge copper reserves in the Great Lakes, with the copper on Michipicoten Island considered especially sacred property of the beast.A seventeenth century missionary called Claude Dablon told a tale of four Ojibwe people all being ripped apart by the underwater panther for taking its precious metal.Name: RompoLocation: Africa and IndiaAppearance: Skeletal body with the arms of a badger and the legs of a bearRompo is one of the strangest mythical creatures reported anywhere in the world.Its thought to have the head of a hare but with human ears on top a of a skeleton-like body, dragging itself around with the arms of a badger and the legs of a bear.Most disturbing of all, it only feeds on human corpses, making a soft low noise as it does so.When it finds a body, witnesses claim it circles the dead person several times before it begins feasting.Its also claimed that the Rompos skin changes colour, turning green when it moves among bushes and trees.Although sceptics think the Rompo is actually an old world porcupine, encounters with the beast have been logged in both India and across Africa.Name: Jersey Devil Leeds DevilLocation: New Jersey, USAAppearance: Goat-headed flying beast with hooves and the wings of a batThe Jersey Devil or Leeds Devil is a terrying bat-winged kangeroo-like creature with the head of a goat and cloven hooves.Its said that the devil moves quickly and cries with a high-pitched blood-curdling scream.The legend of the Jersey Devil began in , when New Jersey resident Jane Leeds cursed the baby in her womb when she found out she was pregnant for the thirteenth time.Then, on the stormy night when the child was born, it changed rapidly from a normal baby into a nightmare creature with a forked tail.Witnesses present at the horric event claimed the devil child screamed and growled before flying up the chimney and off into the woods.And then  years later, in , hundreds of sightings were reported in local newspapers about sightings and attacks of the Jersey Devil.Cops say they shot at it without effect and schools were closed in the Delaware Valley because of the widespread fear and panic.At the time, vigilante groups even took up arms to rid their communities of the beast.The fearsome legend lives on in the terrying -storey Jersey Devil rollercoaster set to open at Six Flags in New Jersey next year."},{"url":null,"title":"sleeps days until christmas countdown","story":"Before long, we get to rip our presents open and catch up with family, so lets take a look at how we can get set for the festive season in time for Santa.While the UK hasnt woken up to widespread snow on Christmas morning since , some forecasters have hinted that following recent unpredictable weather conditions there may be a snowy Christmas on its way.And Christmas wouldnt be Christmas without a trip to the pantomime -

Corbyn hasn’t committed to either side. In an interview yesterday, he refused to answer the question EIGHT TIMES.So, we are in the absurd position of a man running to be Prime Minister not being able to say where he would stand on the biggest issue facing the country in decades.Little wonder that more than three quarters of voters are dissatisfied with his performance.Corbyn is betting that he can quarantine the issue of Brexit. His strategy is to offer a second referendum then fight a general election on classic Left Right lines.The problem with this plan is that British politics is so dominated by Brexit that you HAVE to have an answer on that before you can talk about anything .Is Jeremy Corbyn really intending to spend the entire election campaign refusing to say how he would vote in the referendum he is calling for Corbyn’s equivocation is a particular problem, given the clarity in the other parties’ positions.The Lib Dem conference agreed this week thatthe party won a majority in a general election — stop sniggering at the back — they would simply revoke Article .This clear policy is helping them scoop up more and more Remainer votes. One poll this week had them overtaking Labour and pulling in support from more than  per cent of those who backed Remain in .If the Lib Dems get anywhere near this level of support in a general election, then Labour will lose seats to BOTH the Lib Dems and the Tories.As one gleeful Cabinet minister points out, the Lib Dem position “shines a spot-light on Labour’s ambiguity”.Many in the Shadow Cabinet are worried about Corbyn’s refusal to say where he stands. Many of them want Labour to state clearly that it is the party of Remain.Expect an effort at next week’s Labour conference to change the party’s position to make it clear that as a party Labour WILL IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES campaign for Remain in a second referendum.The other problem with Corbyn’s position is that it means this whole debate will just drag on. Another negotiation with Brussels followed by another referendum would take at least six months, and maybe more.This isn’t going to be popular with an electorate that wants this issue resolved so the country can move on and start addressing the domestic issues voters care about most.At the last election, Corbyn managed to skilfully straddle the Brexit ide.He hoovered up the votes of Remainers but with a manesto that promised to respect the referendum result, held on to heavily Leave-supporting seats too.It will be far harder,not impossible, for Corbyn to pull off that trick again. The danger for him is that his fence-sitting ends up alienating both groups.AT his book launch, David Cameron told the assembled guests that he had tried to avoid writing too much about scandals in the memoir.But he did remember when a Tory peer got caught up in an SM sting early in his leadership.It was put to him that he should remove the whip, to which Cameron replied: “Shouldn’t we take the handcuffs off too ”“WHAT was he thinking ’ one loyal, long-time supporter of David Cameron declared to me after the former PM revealed how he had worked behind the scenes to get the Queen to make an intervention in the Scottish independence referendum.The Palace is understandably cross about the revelation, which undermines the Queen’s political neutrality.One Whitehall source tells me the Palace are “apoplectic” about it and can’t understand why a former Prime Minister would break such an important confidence in such a pre-meditated way.Belatedly, Cameron seems to have realised the trouble he’s caused – refusing to answer further questions on it for TV.But as someone who has worked for three Tory leaders tells me: “It is one of the weirdest unforced errors I have ever seen.”As part of efforts to deal with this problem, Operation Anson has been launched. This week, the team involved arrested  people on suspicion of involvement in this activity after targeting  marinas and harbours.The test of this surge in enforcement activity will be whether it stamps out this vile trade before more people perish in the Channel.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is not clear who runs it, but it also operates two websites: globalclimatestrike.net and peoplesdemands.org.On the latter, it publishes what passes as its manesto. Read it, and it becomes very clear what lies behind the climate strikes.It is really the anti-capitalist movement — the lot who used to demand an end to globalisation — in green disguise.Astonishingly, it opposes not just nuclear energy but also “mega hydro” , biofuels and carbon capture and storage.These are all technologies central to the Government’s ambition to cut UK carbon emissions to net zero by .Yet FridaysfortheFuture wants the world to move to zero carbon energy by  —  years earlier.How on Earth does it expect to achieve that  It wants humanity toto living in pre-industrial conditions.And it wants to “support non-market approaches to climate action”.In other words, it wants some kind of primitive socialist society.The trouble is thatwe went back to living in pre-industrial conditions we would very rapidly end up with pre-industrial levels of hunger, disease and child mortality.There is another way to tackle climate change, which is to invest in renewable energy and other low-carbon tech through a liberal, market economy to build a proper energy infrastructure.Children are right to be concerned about the planet, but they might care to take a closer look at the  ideology behind their climate strikes. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We were promised that we would.But a half-hearted and incompetent strategy from Theresa May, alongside a well-funded, relentless campaign to undermine the referendum and the Government’s negotiating position, has left us still in the EU after three years of drt and doom-mongering.Matters have been made worse by Speaker John Bercow’s bias, which has brought Parliament into disrepute.But in response, Jeremy Corbyn is in danger of adopting a still more absurd and tragic position, urged by senior figures Emily Thornberry and John McDonnell.To renegotiate a deal, to put it to yet another referendum, and then to campaign against that deal and in favour of remaining in the EU after all.What a self-defeating proposition.

He quit Labour to be an independent MP in February over the “culture of extremism and intolerance” created by Mr Corbyn.Today Mr Austin launches cross-party campaign group Mainstream, aimed at combating extremism in public le.He said: “I grew up listening to my father, a Holocaust refugee, warning of the dangers of prejudice and hatred.“I joined Labour as a teenager and campaigned for it all my adult le.“But the party of today is not the one I grew up in.“Under Jeremy Corbyn it has been poisoned by a culture of extremism and intolerance. It is the responsibility of everyone who opposes extremism in all its forms to stand up against this destructive force.”The poll found  per cent are proud of Britain’s history over the past  years, with  per cent “ashamed”.Only  per cent believe in retaining the monarchy while  per cent want a republic.Twenty per cent would be “happy” or “proud” to sing the anthem but half would be “bored, embarrassed or angry”.More members,  per cent, blame the Government for the atrocities of the Troubles than blame Republican terrorists like the IRA .Just  per cent think groups like al-Qaeda are the most to blame for Islamist terrorist attacks in the UK. A total of  per cent think the UK and its allies are most to blame, while  per cent blame both sides equally.Meanwhile  per cent support using strikes to overthrow a Conservative government.A huge  per cent agree with getting rid of Britain’s nuclear weapons. Almost half,  per cent, want to abolish our country’s borders.A total of  per cent support new laws limiting who owns national newspapers. And  per cent say a Labour government should take more control of broadcast media.We stand up to extremism, racism and prejudice. That’s the British way.Sun readers expect their government to defend their country abroad, maintain their security at home and keep their streets safe. They certainly don’t expect a party which might be in power in just a few weeks to tear itself to pieces in the way Labour has done in the last  hours.Tom Watson has given the party he loves decades of service. But because the extremists who now control Labour don’t trust him to bow to all of their demands, they tried to abolish his job while he was at home looking after his son.Mainstream is a new campaign to stand up for these values and warn people of the dangers of extremism.We will promote respectable and responsible politics wherever we can, and we will oppose extremism - wherever it comes from.We’ll oppose extremism on the far left or the hard right, and today we are highlighting the impact of a government led by Jeremy Corbyn and the hard left.I thought I knew how badly Jeremy Corbyn had poisoned the Labour Party.I quit after  years as a member to shine a spotlight on the extremism and racism.But even I was shocked by this new poll showing what Labour members now actually think.Under Corbyn, half say they would be bored, embarrassed or angryasked to sing the National Anthem.Just  per cent are proud of our country’s history. Almost three times as many are ashamed.More than six out of ten want to abolish the monarchy and more of them blame the British Government and our brave army than the IRA and other republican terrorists for the violent troubles in Northern Ireland.Almost half want to abolish our country’s borders and nearly seven out of ten members think it would be ok for trade unions to hold a general strike to remove a Conservative Government.More than half either blame the media or Jeremy Corbyn’s political opponents for the allegations of racism against Jewish people instead of the members responsible or the leadership that has allowed it to happen.Sixty-nine per cent of Labour members now blame Western Governments instead of Terrorist groups like Al Qaeda and ISIS for Islamist terrorist attacks on the streets of Britain or think they are equally to blame as groups like Al Qaeda or ISIS!You would never have got results like that under previous Labour leaders, but the Labour Party led by Jeremy Corbyn and the hard left is completely outside Britain’s mainstream political traditions. They can’t be trusted to uphold our country’s values or safeguard the institutions on which our democracy depends.Corbyn’s supporters claim he is ing the party to its socialist roots, but it’s just not true.Clement Attlee’s great post-war government established the NHS and the Welfare State, but he was a proud British patriot who set up NATO, insisted on Britain having nuclear weapons and booted communists out of the party.There are still decent people in the Labour Party, fighting for common-sense, but good MPs have been targeted, smeared or driven out and all sorts of people from the fringes of politics have joined to support Jeremy Corbyn.All this explains why we are setting up Mainstream, a new campaign - led by a group of people from dferent political backgrounds – to encourage ato respectable and responsible politics, and to banish extremism from British politics once and for all.To lead Britain, you must love this country, but Jeremy Corbyn is the opposite of a patriot. He could not be trusted with our national security or to defend our country. At every available opportunity, he has backed Britain’s enemies, whether that’s the IRA at the height of the Troubles or groups like Hamas and Hezbollah.No previous Labour leadership would have supported dictatorships in Cuba or Venezuela or have sided with the Russian dictator’s line on Ukraine or when his killers used chemical weapons to bring death to Salisbury. The hard-left think that wealth is the problem and the people who create it the enemy. A government led by Jeremy Corbyn would see John McDonnell in the Treasury, but our economy has never before been run by someone who says he wants to overthrow capitalism or says Marx, Lenin and Trotsky are his most signicant influences.Jeremy Corbyn surrounds himself and works with people from the far-left fringes of politics and they could not be trusted to respect and uphold the independence of our civil service, the impartiality and fairness of our broadcasters or the freedom of the press.It is a disgrace that he and the people around him have allowed a party with a fine tradition of fighting for fairness and equality to be poisoned by racism against Jewish people.Under Corbyn, mainstream ideas are being replaced by views that are wildly out of step with the views of the general public. Extremism is rearing its way back into the public discourse in a way that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago.We encourage everyone who wants to support our country’s mainstream values in political and public le to join us. The left-wing grassroots body — set up just weeks after Corbyn won his  leadership contest — now has , members. It was based on the Syriza movement in Greece and Podemos in Spain, both of which  also fought against austerity measures.Cambridge graduate Lansman, , tried to run the party machine last year by mounting a failed bid to replace  out- going Iain McNicol as general secretary.

sacked 28 years","story":"Robert Lockyer, who was based at the Ashford Delivery Office in Kent, had been tasked with dropping off a parcel to a high street bank by pm.The veteran postie says he arrived at the branch at .pm, but that is was .pm by the time the parcel was signed for because he had to wait in the queue with regular customers.Items under special delivery, of which Mr Lockyer successfully delivered around , over the course of his career, are guaranteed to arrive between am and pm the following day.A disciplinary meeting in October  saw Lockyer accused of gross misconduct over the incident, which had occurred the previous month, Kent Live reported.John Peter, delivery officer manager at Mr Lockyers branch, accused him of continual failure to follow correct procedures.Lockyer appealed the decision, but it was upheld at an employment tribunal in July.The tribunal heard Mr Lockyers performance at work had not been entirely satisfactory and that it was clear from the evidence that the claimant was a challenging employee.Independent casework manager Sue Knight-Smith said: To suggest the dismissal was for being one minute late was not a true reflection of what actually happened.She said Mr Lockyer was aware of bank protocols but chose to ignore the noon PDA alert and left the delivery until the last moment.The case dismissed after Mr Lockyer withdrew claims for unpaid wages and redundancy pay.The tribunal heard that Lockyer had been given a serious warning in May of last year after failing to secure his vehicle.Three months later, he received a dismissal penalty, suspended for  months, for failing to obtain a signature for a delivery.At the time of the second incident, he was told going forward any breach of standards will lead to your dismissal”.Mr Peter said that a late delivery would usually result in a penalty valid for one or two years, but that Mr Lockyers dismissal was justied because of his record.After the hearing, Mr Lockyer said in a statement he was “bitterly upset” at the “harsh” treatment he had received.“I can’t believe what has happened to me – all I wanted to do was to do my job, he said.“I really hope the union can make this right.I just want to get back to work.”Mark Baulch, outdoor secretary of the Communication Workers Union, said Mr Lockyers case was probably one of the most outrageous dismissals by Royal Mail and Tribunal verdict I’ve ever heard about.“Make no mistake, this union is appealing this decision legally and, in the meantime, we’ll also be taking up this case with the company at the highest possible level, he said.The delay is obviously due to the unusual procedure of the bank itself in telling our member to queue alongside the other bank customers.“How on earth our member could be considered to be at fault here is completely beyond me – this is why the culture within the workplace must change, once and for all."},{"url":null,"title":"man sacked premier inn losing bus pass journey","story":"Ashely Saint, , was dismissed after failing to make the .-mile trip from his home to a West Bromwich branch of the hotel giant for three shts last month.The former housekeeper, who is on universal credit, has hit out at his former employer, saying he had been unable to afford a new bus fare.“My we, Rosie, usually buys a monthly bus pass for me just so I can make it to work – it even takes priority over food and bills,” he told BirminghamLive.He said problems first arose when he went into town on Friday August  - ahead of a sht that Sunday - and accidentally left his pass on the bus.When I found out I lost my pass I rang the station to find outanyone had handed it in but it was closed over the weekend, he said.I literally couldn’t afford a ticket and I was waiting for my pass to arrive.”Mr Saint said he missed three days of work before his pass was ed to him on Tuesday August , but did not contact his work because he was not due in again until the following Friday.On arriving for that sht, he was asked to attend a one-on-one meeting with the hotels head of staff and two further disciplinary hearings, and was subsequently fired.A spokesperson for Premier Inn said: It is inappropriate to comment on inidual cases.In general terms, any decision taken in the course of employment is never taken lightly and made only after following the relevant process.But a letter written by Premier Inn management and published by BirminghamLive highlighted inconsistencies in Mr Saints version of events, and said it was a coincidence that Mr Saint had earlier requested holiday for the days he missed.Ashley did have a letter from the bus station when they sent his bus pass back to him, it reads.I do believe he had left it on the bus.But it goes on: When it came to making other arrangement to get to work, his actions and behaviours show that there was a lack of effort made.There was a clear display that he seemed to be ok with not going into work and having time off, that also coincidentally, coincided with his holiday he had requested that had been declined.This I do believe was a coincidence.It adds: [Ashely] did not report his absence accurately or fully when he contacted his place of work.He has conflicting recollections of what happened, there does not seem to be a clear line of events.When management tried to contact him he was unreachable due to the fact he had changed his mobile number and not informed his manager. The letter concludes that Ashley had been heard saying he intended to hand in his resignation, had had previous issues with attendance, and had displayed a negative attitude to his work and managers.Mr Saint has said he is appealing against the decision to sack him."},{"url":null,"title":"iran rouhani

more security would come for our region.”He promised to unveil a regional peace plan at this weeks upcoming high-level meetings at the United Nations.The US alleges Iran carried out the September  attack on the worlds largest oil processor and an oil field in Saudi Arabia.While Yemens Iranian-allied Houthi rebels claimed the assault, Saudi Arabia says it was unquestionably sponsored by Iran.For its part, Iran denies being responsible and has warned any retaliatory attack targeting it will result in an all-out war.Thats as it has begun enriching uranium beyond the terms of its  nuclear deal with world powers, which the U.S. unilaterally withdrew from over a year earlier.Rouhani said Iran was willing to extend the hand of friendship and brotherhood to Persian Gulf nations and was even ready to forgive their past mistakes.Those who want to link the regions incidents to the Islamic Republic of Iran are lying like their past lies that have been revealed, the president said.If they are

Id describe it as exactly the same as being held hostage, Mr Farmer said.Critics said the Government appeared to have learned nothing since the Monarch collapse in .Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said today it was the Conservatives ideological bias against state intervention that prevented the Government acting.Pilots union Balpa yesterday: Thomas Cook is at the last chance saloon today and decisions about staff and passengers are being taken in secret.Its a much bigger scale than Monarch.There is a real risk thatthe worst comes to the worst proper arrangements may not be in place for the repatriation programme and staff are still working while not knowingthey have a job or will even get paid for this month.Although a deal had been largely agreed, an additional facility requested in the last few days of negotiations presented a challenge that ultimately proved insurmountable.“It is a matter of profound regret to me and the rest of the board that we were not successful.I would like to apologise to our millions of customers, and thousands of employees, suppliers and partners who have supported us for many years.Despite huge uncertainty over recent weeks, our teams continued to put customers first, showing why Thomas Cook is one of the best-loved brands in travel.“Generations of customers entrusted their family holiday to Thomas Cook because our people kept our customers at the heart of the business and maintained our founder’s spirit of innovation.“This marks a deeply sad day for the company which pioneered package holidays and made travel possible for millions of people around the world.”"},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy corbyn brexit remain labour conference leadership","story":"The leftie Labour boss is getting ready for an almighty showdown at the partys annual conference in Brighton today over whether to fully back Remain or not.Mr Corbyn wants yet another fudge on Brexit - kicking the decision into the long grass for after an election.Yesterday he refused nine times to say how he or Labour would campaign in a second referendum, and would only say that the party would decide it later on.But senior Labour figures including Sir Keir Starmer, John McDonnell and Emily Thornberry are fighting tooth and nail to try and force the party into backing Remain no matter what.The Shadow Foreign Secretary Ms Thornberry warned yesterday that Labour could lose a THIRD of its entire vote to the Lib Dems and Greens in a future election.Members and union delegates will vote this evening on at least three dferent Brexit motions - and will decide whether to back all of them or none.One motion says Labour will campaign energetically for a public vote and to stay in the EU for that referendum - and is favoured by pro Remain members who want Britain to stay in the EU.The other is a Brexit waffle motion which backs Mr Corbyns plan, adding they will campaign for a public vote in line with the policy set out at out  conference.It doesnt commit to anything specically concrete on when to make a decision on leaving the EU.A third motion from Labours top National Executive Committeeis a similar fudge, pledging to decide the Brexit position at a special conference later on.By the end of the day all three motions could pass in a titanic battle for the soul of the party.Unions Unite and GMB have come out for Mr Corbyns Brexit fudge plan - which could save his skin tonight.GMB leader Tim Roache said earlier: What we’re saying is, we negotiate a deal, then we assess whether it’s better than what we already have.But Unison said this morning they would OPPOSE the NECs motion - in a huge break with tradition which could tip the balance towards Remain.They will vote for the pro-Remain motion instead, which could force the party into backing Remain in ALL circumstances, and leave Mr Corbyn red-faced.The dramatic move puts the vote on a kne edge tonight and plunges the party into further chaos.Momentum boss Jon Lansman blasted: I’m incredibly disappointed with the process by which today’s NEC statement on Brexit was produced. There was no meeting, no discussion, no consultation with the membership.The unfolding war in Labour came as:There will be some who think we can get adeal, but there will be others like myself who think you cannot get a better deal than Remain.Yesterday Mr Corbyn vowed to respect whatever the party decides today.If the Labour boss loses tonight it would be a huge blow to his authority as leader - and puts him on a collision course with the rest of his pro-Remain party.Whatever members vote for will likely go into the partys next election manesto.But Andrew Gwynne Shadow Communities Secretary told Radio s Westminster Hour last night that the shadow cabinet have been told by Jeremy Corbyn that they can campaign as they want on Brexit in a future referendum - just like in the  EU vote.Meanwhile MPs were openly threatening another leadership challenge as rumours swirled around that Mr Corbyn could be forced to quit.Yesterday the Labour boss said he had no plans to stand down and would lead the party into the next election - serving a whole five yearshe wins.It comes the day after his policy chief Andrew Fisher announced his plans to quit his role - in a huge blow to Mr Corbyn.The man who wrote Labours last manesto said he would resign this year, with a blast on the blizzard of lies in the party and attacking senior figures close to the leftie boss."},{"url":null,"title":"thomas cook staff jobs travel bust flights","story":"Touching images show employees hugging each other in floods of tears as the UKs oldest airline went under after  years.The company’s , employees, including , in the UK, have been made redundant.Hundreds of weeping members of staff were seen heading into headquarters in Peterborough for a am meeting.The Lynch Wood offices employ around , Thomas Cook staff - with all of them now out of a job.Some employees have been posting on social media after the UK Civil Aviation Authorityannounced this morning that the company had “ceased trading with immediate effect.”One wrote: Officially unemployed.

Speaking to reporters during his flight to New York for the summit, Mr Johnson also pledged to challenge President Rouhani to release jailed British mum Nazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe when the pair meet face-to-face in the sidelines of the summit. The UK Government has now attributed the recent attacks on Saudi oil facilities with “a high degree of probability.” On Friday the Pentagon announced the US will send additional troops to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.    Yemen-based Houthi rebels, who are locked in a war with Saudi Arabia, have claimed responsibility for the attacks, which sent global oil prices soaring. But a Senior UK Government Official said last night their claim of responsibility was “implausible” because of the sophistication and range of the weapons used in the attack. Iran has denied responsibility. Mr Johnson said: “Clearly the dficulty is how do we organise a response - what is the way forward - and we’ll be working with our American and European Friends to construct a response that tries to de-escalate tensions in the gulf region.” He wouldn’t rule out military action, but said it would only happen at the request of Saudi Arabia or the US.    He said: “On what kind of action we can take, you will have seen that the Americans are proposing to do more to help to defend SA and we will be following that. “If we are asked by the Saudis or the Americans to have a role then we would consider in what way we could be useful.“ Ms Zaghari-Ratclfe, , was arrested in  while in the country visiting family. She was sentenced to five years in prison after being accused of spying, which she strongly denies.

Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell slammed the government for failing to bail out the beleagured firm because of ideological bias.He said that a Labour government would have stepped in and he was disappointed that ministers had chosen not to act. It comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson dismissed a bailout as a moral hazard in the case of future such commercial dficulties that companies face. Mr McDonnell also called for the companyaposs bosses to to repay bonuses, said: Too right. Thomas Cook executives raked in more than £ million over the last five years, despite long term fears about the operator.Peter Fankhauser, the chief executive, took home £. million since he took over in , including a £.m bonus in .  Mr McDonnell said: I think they need to really examine their own consciences about how theyaposve brought this about and how they themselves have exploited the situation, he told BBC radio. The company had asked the government for a bailout of up to £m which was refused. Ministers have now admitted repatriating British holidaymakers could cost £m but Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said that any bailout could have left the taxpayer out of pocket but ultimately prove futile. John McDonnell told the BBC: When this crisis first started I said to the government they should interveneonly to stabilise the situation while a real plan for the future of the company could be addressed.He added:  I’m worried for the holidaymakers I really feel for them but also , people will lose their jobs over this and I just think the government should have been willing to do more intervene, stabilise the situation, then allow a longer term plan to develop.   “This company once was in public ownership and as a result of privatisation it’s had real problems over the years I think because of issues around management and the lack of long-term planning.He said the government hasn’t stepped in because of political rather than practical reasons telling Sky it was because of ideological bias. McDonnell said any government money would have had to have been with “strings attached”. He disputed the “scale” of intervention needed and insisted the government could have given the company a “breathing space” by stepping in. But Transport Secretary Grant Shapps refuted the suggestion that a breathing space was all that was needed. Asked why the government didn’t step in, he said: “I heard John McDonnell say that he won’t have been in possession of all the facts as we have been over the last few weeks as this has been unfolding.The problem for Thomas Cook is they have a £.bn debt and really haven’t moved with the times in terms of the way people are booking holidays so the problem was there wasn’t really a sustainable company there putting aside of course that governments don’t usually invest in travel companies it’s not a strategic part of the economy.They were actually asking for up to £m and not only would it have taken that money but in the end I fear the taxpayer would have lost that money and we’d be in exactly the same position as we are today.I would have dearly loved to see Thomas Cook saved it just actually wasn’t a practical way forward repatriating people is the right way to go.The move to get holidaymakers home has been dubbed the aposlargest repatriation effort in British historyapos The travel firm has entered compulsory liquidation after last-minute talks to save the company failed, resulting in all Thomas Cook flights and holidays being cancelled.

Mr Hancockaposs comments do match recent reports on Thomas Cook, which have stressed the firm had been hit by high debt levels, online rivals and geopolitical uncertainty. However, he did not mention that Thomas Cook itself also warned uncertainty around Brexit was hitting bookings industry-wide four months ago. In a statement announcing a loss of more than £bn on May , the firm said: In the UK, the political uncertainty related to Brexit over recent months has led to softer demand for summer holidays across the industry.  While our booking position remains ahead of the capacity reductions in the tour operator, the trading backdrop remains highly competitive, leading to increased levels of promotional activity. We have seen no tangible change to booking patterns in recent weeks since the announcement of a delay to Brexit, although we will shortly start to lap a weaker comparative period. It added: The prolonged heatwave last summer and high prices in the Canaries reduced customer demand for winter sun, particularly in the Nordic region, while there is now little doubt that the Brexit process has led many UK customers to delay their holiday plans for this summer. The Civil Aviation Authority is leading a £m repatriation effort for , stranded Brits using more than  planes after the -year-old firm collapsed overnight.   The package holiday giant needed another £m on top of a £m package it had already agreed, to see it through the winter months. Health Secretary Matt Hancock was askedBrexit was a factor on LBC Radio by host Nick Ferrari.He replied: No. I donapost think thereaposs any Brexit connection. We just heard... about the long term problems Thomas Cook has had as a business. Itaposs the sort of business that in the last century we used to use all the time - I remember booking one of my first holidays that I every booked through Thomas Cook. Now I just go straight to the internet.    Lots of companies have been disrupted by the internet. I think the big disruption from the internet is bigger than Brexit. I think itaposs the biggest thing happening over our generation, and weaposve got to make sure every part of le is as prepared as possible for that, including the health service which Iaposm responsible for. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps added: The company had enormous debts of £. billion. The world had changed in terms of the way people book holidays and all these things over a very long period of time had caught Thomas Cook out.

I was five and my mum, Can, told me and my brother Tam we were going on holiday, but as she hugged us goodbye, she began to sob so much her whole body was shaking. I gripped my little brother’s hand as I watched the tiny village grow smaller in the rear view window. Like many Vietnamese children, we were adopted by an Australian family. It was a scary, lonely and confusing time, and I missed my birth family horribly. ‘When am I going home ’ I’d ask again and again in Vietnamese, but no one would answer me because they didn’t understand. I’d ask after my birth mother so often that my new parents told me she had died. I cried myself to sleep every night until I was eight or nine. My adoptive family were dysal and home le was tough. At , my adoptive mother died.    After that, I was going through my adoptive father’s filing cabinet and I found an old letter, with a Vietnamese postmark. I felt elated as I realised it was from my birth mum. Straight away, I wrote a long letter to the address she had given, explaining who I was and askingCan was alive. Soon after, I got a simple fax back, saying, ‘Mother still alive, very happy to hear from you.’ My heart soared as I read her words. For the next few years, I exchanged letters with her and was thrilled to finally have contact with her. But as time went on, the correspondence became overwhelming and she started to demand money. At only , it was far too much for me to take in and I stopped responding, tearing up the letters and trying to move on with my le.    It wasn’t until many years later that I felt ready to try contact again. It was , I was  and hadn’t seen my birth family for nearly  years. But I booked a flight to Vietnam and resolved to meet my mother. I tracked down a family friend in my home city, Can Tho. Within  minutes, my mum was on her way over, and I waited nervously for her arrival. I recognised her face immediately as she bounded towards me, sobbing. Bawling her eyes out, she looked just like she did when I left. I held her tight. ‘You came back,’ she kept repeating. Taking me to see the rest of my relatives in Phong Dien, the entire village turned up to welcome me home. Seeing their faces, fragmented memories of my early childhood in Vietnam came flooding back and I realised I couldn’t leave again.  I moved to Vietnam permanently, buying a house and inviting Can to live with me. I got to know the family members I’d left behind, and was even financially supporting many of them. I never questioned that this was my family. I had no reason to ever doubt it. I adopted my two beautul boys, Daniel and Sam in , but the cracks started to show. Mum began hassling me over money and when she became strangely jealous of my sons. So after four years of living with me, Mum moved out and we put some distance between us. Our relationship deteriorated until we no longer spoke. Fourteen years after myto Vietnam, I was working out at my local gym when my phone began to ring on repeat. I put my phone on silent and carried on, until I received a strange message: ‘Ho Thi Ich is your real mother’. As soon as I got home, my phone started to ring again. I knew something wasn’t right, so I handed it over to my cousin. When my cousin hung up, she was in shock and just said, ‘You’re not my cousin… and Can’s not your mum.’  My head was spinning – it didn’t make sense. I rang my aunt right away and bombarded her with questions, asking hershe ever saw Can pregnant with me. When my aunt said no, my cousin called Can and coaxed a confession, telling her I was going to do a DNA test. Finally, Can confessed. Forty-eight years earlier, she had taken me from my real birth parents. She was a friend of my real mother, Ho Thi Ich, who had fallen gravely ill during childbirth. Ho Thi Ich, a widow with two other children, had nearly died. Offering to help, Can had nursed me. But when Ho Thi Ich recovered and asked after her child, no one could tell her where she’d gone. Can had run away with me. I cried for three days — not because she wasn’t my mother, but because of the lies and deception. My entire world came crashing down. Everything I thought I knew was a lie. For the past  years, this woman had deceived me, and I was desperate to meet my real mum.

With children of a similar age, they would share their problems over dinner and celebrate special occasions together. So when Diane’s -year-old son Robert dropped out of uni, Nina was concerned too. She had known Robert since he was  and believed him to be a hard worker, as he was always taking on part-time jobs as a teen. By this time, Nina was running her own successful estate agency with  employees. She had worked hard to build up her business from scratch, and it was booming. ‘Robert was clever and reliable, so I offered him a job as a trainee letting agent,’ says Nina. ‘Diane was thrilled and Robert was so grateful – I even bought him a smart new suit, so he’d look the part.’ Nina took Robert under her wing and trained him up herself.    Robert called Nina his ‘second mum’, and he was also close to her husband Rob, regularly going on bike rides together at the weekend. Within a few years, Nina promoted Robert to lettings manager. Nina trusted him implicitly: he would be responsible for collecting money from renters and landlords, and delivering large sums of money to the bank. ‘I was proud of Robert for turning his le around,’ says Nina. ‘He had a great rapport with clients and was savvy with money, saving up for fancy holidays. aposHe also liked to go to betting shops and the races with his dad, but it wasn’t my place to judge how he spent his wages.’ But gradually Nina began to notice strange discrepancies in the company’s accounts. Although her agency was doing well and taking on new clients, profits stayed the same.    Her confused accountants investigated, but couldn’t find the cause and assured Nina that everything was in order. During this time, Robert got engaged to his pregnant girlfriend Rachael and began planning a huge wedding. He also bought two houses. Robert was living a comfortable le, regularly receiving packages at work as he bought the latest gadgets. Then, in , Nina was given devastating news: HM Revenue  Customs told her she owed £, in taxes. Nina was horried – she had never been in debt in her le, and none of her clients or landlords were missing any money. Her accountants had repeatedly looked into the company’s finances, but everything seemed to be in order. Nina asked her trusted employee Robert, who said it must be a mistake. Nina was given just three months to pay the bill. Terried of damaging her company’s reputation and risking her employees’ jobs, she quickly scrabbled the money together by remortgaging some properties she had invested in and dipping into her pension.  Desperate to get to the bottom of where the money was going, Nina hired an expensive firm of forensic accountants to investigate, a process that would take months as they went over the books with a fine-tooth comb. Meanwhile, Robert got married in a decadent country house hotel, and of course Nina and Robert were there to support the man they treated like a second son. It wasn’t until August , a year after HMRC had saddled her with the bill, that her forensic accountants finally got to the bottom of where the money had been going. Robert had been manipulating the system to swindle cash from Nina for years. Robert had been skimming a percentage from the rental and management fees and pocketing the cash. At first, Nina refused to believe it, telling the accountants that Robert was like family. She took Robert aside again for a private chat, but he denied any knowledge of where the missing money could be. Desperate for the truth, Nina and her husband Rob spent days going through CCTV footage from the office. They made an awful discovery, watching in horror as they saw Robert at his desk with huge wads of cash he had collected from tenants. He picked up a bundle of cash, kissed it, stuffed it into his bag and walked out of the office. Nina’s whole world fell apart.  ‘I couldn’t escape the image of him kissing the money and piling it into his suit pocket,’ she says. ‘The suit I lovingly bought him, enabling him to be smart and professional when representing my business. ‘I couldn’t forget the sight of him putting white envelopes full of my money into his lunch bag, and swinging the bag around when he was leaving for the day, knowing it was full of stolen cash.’ Nina and Rob realised what had been happening: Robert had been collecting rent from the tenants and giving them receipts, then paying the landlords the rent they were owed. But he hadn’t been taking all the money he collected to the bank, instead keeping a percentage to fund his opulent lestyle. It was a huge blow. ‘I grew my business from the little savings I had,’ Nina says. ‘I sacriced spending quality time with our four children, my elderly mother and family for holidays and days off, as I worked every hour possible.’ Immediately, Nina called a disciplinary meeting with Robert and confronted him.  Nina sobbed as she showed him the evidence, and he coldly admitted she had inadvertently paid for the wedding and the houses. Robert didn’t apologise or attempt to explain his actions, but instead had the cheek to ask Nina for a reference as she kicked him out. Straight away, Nina and Rob called the police and reported Robert for theft. When Nina told Diane, she broke down in tears and said, ‘It can’t be true.’ In October , police interviewed Robert, but he refused to answer questions. Desperate for justice, Nina and Rob paid £, of their own money to gather more evidence against Robert, hiring more forensic accountants and computer specialists. Investigators uncovered shocking new information: Robert had a serious gambling problem and had squandered £, in one month alone. Seven months later, police interviewed Robert once more, this time armed with evidence from Nina’s team of investigators, which suggested he had stolen more than £,, although Robert only admitted taking £,. ‘The personal betrayal has caused me enormous emotional damage,’ says Nina. ‘This experience has been devastating.

The victim now hopes to raise awareness of how easily drink spiking can happen. The woman, who is in her s and from Llandudno, Wales, agreed to go out for dinner with the man she matched with on Tinder after speaking to him for a few days. She was surprised the man, who had told her he was six years older than her, looked much older in person than the pictures on his profile, but decided to continue with the date During the dinner, they both had soft drinks with their food, and the woman left her drink on the table while she went to the toilet and also allowed him to go to the bar for her, the Daily Post reports . She said: I really wanted to give him a chance and, honestly, it felt too awkward to leave when we had only just met.    All through the dinner, he sat very close to me. I just tried to slowly edge down the booth and put some distance between us. He didnapost really talk much, which was weird. When I wasnapost talking, there was just silence between us. It was an awkward date, but my gut didnapost tell me I was in danger. I donapost really drink a lot anyway, plus it was a weekday, so I stuck to the soft drinks. I didnapost think twice about him going up to the bar to get my drink, or leaving it on the table with him while I went to the bathroom. He seemed a little odd but harmless. There was no point I felt unsafe or at risk, until all of a sudden I was. The woman said that, towards the end of the dinner, she began to feel strange, so she decided to end the date early and go home. All of a sudden, I just felt wrong, she said. Thataposs the best way I can describe it. I said I wasnapost feeling well and he offered to walk me home. I thought he was being nice. I suddenly felt so tired, like my eyes weighed a ton. I was fighting to keep them open. When we got to my door, I tried to say goodnight and turn away, but he grabbed my wrist and told me to stay and talk longer. I told him I didnapost feel well but he still didnapost let go. I started to panic, and I told him to let go of me and tried to pull my wrist from him. Eventually, he let go and tried to make a joke about me overreacting. I turned and got inside as fast as I could, but I didnapost make it far.

The betting company has accepted a flurry of bets in the last week on Kate being pregnant after she made several public appearances. Kate, , was snapped with a new hairdo while taking Princess Charlotte to her first day at school two weeks ago - which led to pregnancy rumours online. She also touched up her hair up seven weeks before she announced she was pregant with Prince George and shortly before revealing she was going to give birth to Princess Charlotte. Body language expert Judi James told Daily Star Online: “Like a lot of women Kate does tend to change her hair when she is pregnant, although not dramatically.    “The new style and colour she emerged with when she took George and Charlotte to school did look like one of her glossiest and most fashionable looks to date. “But then she did say she’d had it done for the school run, and it could have been aimed at giving her an emotional lt as Charlotte left home for school for the first time.” Judi also said that another sign Kate is pregnant is that she was pictured touching her belly during her visit to the school. “Kate did meet a lot of small children and one baby in particular recently and it wasn’t hard to describe her teeth-baring, dimple-creating smile of utter delight as she stroked the baby’s head and chatted to the children as broodiness,” she said. “She also touched her belly, which is a common gesture of protection from women in the early stages of pregnancy. “However this is a gesture that Kate uses a lot, pregnant or not, so tends to be less than reliable as a clue. She did look broody but she appears besotted with youngest child Louis and the baby she met could just have reminded her of him.”    Celebrity stylist Jay Birmingham told Fabulous Digital: “Kate’s new colour has brightened her complexion and the use of lighter pieces throughout the top of her hair and around her face add dimension and give the illusion of thicker hair. The signs have forced Ladbrokes to pull the plug on all bets on Kate having a baby in . Alex Apati of Ladbrokes told the Star: Royal fans reckon Kate is showing early signs of a potential pregnancy. Weaposve welcomed two royal babies into the world in as many years and punters are seemingly confident Kate will make it three in three. “Weaposve taken a flurry of bets across the country in shop over the last week or so following recent royal appearances from the Duchess of Cambridge.

The doctor had suggested she collect a repeat prescription of the tablets there but the pharmacist wouldnapost help her.He wouldnapost even give his reason for refusing to give the emergency supply to me - maybe he did have a good reason but heaposs not got a leg to stand on by not speaking to me, Maggie told Daily Record today.The occupational therapist visited the Boots branch in Edinburgh city centre earlier this month and initially found shop assistants to be very unhelpful.    She said: I went in and explained to the shop assistant,I could speak to the pharmacist about getting this emergency one monthaposs supply. She was really quite tight-lipped and not that accommodating or friendly and said she would ask the pharmacist - she came back and told me, aposHe says no.apos I told her this is what my GP is advising me to do - so she went back to speak to him again then came back and told me, aposNo, sorryapos. The vibe I was getting was that his refusal was specically to do with what I was asking for. That he didnapost want to give it to me. He looked up when I came in then refused to come out and speak to me. Thereaposs a private consulting room and that option wasnapost offered to me.    Maggie went to another two pharmacies, both with female pharmacists who she said would have been happy to provide the medication, but didnapost have any in stock. She was then served in another Boots by a female pharmacist who she said treated her with respect and dignity before prescribing her the emergency supply. Maggie, who works at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, said: I am most concerned this extremely negative experience appears to have been the result of a misogynistic attitude.  I am a strong and independent -year-old inidual with a thick skin and I found this humiliating - I can only imagine how a young or more vulnerable woman would be made to feel in these circumstances. It seemed that he really didnapost have that right to refuse me. Emma Ritch, executive director of Scottish feminist organisation Engender, said: Many people reading this will be shocked to learn that it is still seen as perfectly acceptable for pharmacists to withhold prescribed medication from patients based on their personal moral beliefs. Although guidelines require pharmacists to offer assistance to customers in finding an alternate provider, this clearly didnapost happen in this instance. This is not an isolated incident and it raises huge questions about access to contraception for disabled women, women with caring responsibilities, women in rural areas, women experiencing poverty, and other women who are not easily able to travel to multiple pharmacies to get hold of a prescribed medication.

The Brits waved European Union, Spanish and British flags and held banners reading Theyaposre trying to make us leave the EU and Take back control: My grandkidsapos future. They are worried they will lose free access to Spanish healthcare, currently assured by the EU, as Britain crashes out of the bloc, possibly without a deal. Protesters hit out at the Conservative Government, with Tamara Essex, a -year-old from Dorset, saying: Spain is doing everything it can to protect us. The UK government has forgotten us. She said Spain had done more for Britons living in the country than the UK Government.    During Sundayaposs demonstration the Brits marched through the streets of Malaga, a port city on southern Spain’s Costa del Sol, to register their concerns about their uncertain status ahead of the October  deadline. Spain is home to around , Britons and is the most popular European retirement destination for UK residents, with around a third of them aged over . Among foreign nationals, they are by far the biggest users of Spainaposs state-funded universal healthcare system.  Together with Portugal, the Iberian peninsula accounts for almost a quarter of all Britons living in Europe, according to the UN. Michael Soffe, a -year-old businessman who has lived in Malaga for  years, said: We feel really forgotten here in Spain. Many here are pensioners - will they lose their healthcare overnight, for example  Acting Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, who could be replaced following November elections, has sought to reassure Britons living in Spain, promising to protect their rights after Brexit.  Brexit Minister Stephen Barclay visited Spain last week to discuss the exit with Spanish officials and hear from groups representing Britons in Spain. The British Government is in talks with Spain about protecting access to healthcare, he said. A spokesman for the Department for Exiting the European Unionsaid on Sunday: The Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay held productive discussions with groups representing the British community in Spain while in Madrid last week and made clear that protecting the rights of both UK nationals in the EU and EU citizens in the UK is a key priority for this government.But we cannot protect the rights of UK nationals unilaterally.We have made an unequivocal guarantee to EU citizens now living and working among us that their rights will be protected and that they can continue to live here as they do today."},{"url":null,"title":"inside meghan markle harrys 1200","story":"NewsInside Meghan Markle and Harrys £,-a-night hotel for friends Rome weddingPrince Harry and Meghan Markle are understood to have spent two nights at the five-star Hotel Vilon in Italys capital city for fashion designer Misha Nonoos weddingShareCommentsByBradley JollyOnline journalist:,  SEP Updated:,  SEP Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video look-luxury-hotel-harry-meghan-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:\"\"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Palace sources said Harry and Meghan want to “hit the ground running”. They will focus on key issues of their global charity work including the environment, conservation, education and women’s rights.    Harry will travel alone to Botswana on Wednesday and visit a project run there by his charity Sentebale on Thursday. He will then make a “poignant” trip to Angola surveying vital work by the Halo Trust, which was supported by his mother Princess Diana. In Malawi, he will pay tribute to a British soldier killed by an elephant during anti-poaching operations. The Duchess will stay in Cape Town with Archie and take on several engagements including meeting female entrepreneurs working in technology. The family will be reunited in Johannesburg next week and fly home.    Courtiers hope the trip will be a success and go some way to replacing the goodwill that has been questioned in recent months following a barrage of controversies. Eco warriors Harry and Meghan have been heavily criticised for preaching about saving the planet while flying on gas-guzzling private jets for several holidays and excursions. They took four private jets in just  days while speaking about the dangers of climate change, leading to charges of hypocrisy. One senior palace source said: “This tour will see the Duke and Duchess go back to basics, using their profile in the right way to highlight causes they are both passionate about.” Harry will travel to Angola on Friday to survey vital work being done in the region by the Halo Trust and visit an orthopaedic hospital which is to be named in her honour after a massive upgrade. Photographs of the late Princess visiting a de-mining site and meeting mine victims became iconic and powerful images in support of her campaign to create a global mine ban – which came to fruition in the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention that same year.    The Huambo Orthopaedic Centre, visited by Diana in , aims to become Angola’s national centre of excellence in orthopaedic care. A senior Palace source said: “This is all about wanting to fulfil his mother’s legacy.” Harry, , will also visit a working de-mining field outside the southern city of Dirico. He will remotely detonate a mine and meet members of the community and make a speech about the importance of continuing de-mining. A palace spokesperson described the Angola trip as a “signicant and poignant” journey as the Duke pays homage to the anti-landmine work of his mother Diana, Princess of Wales.

While the world has watched in horror as the Amazon burns, we could be unwitting contributors to the crisis. Some of our most popular supermarkets are selling beef from a meat company which has been associated with illegal deforestation of the Amazon. Brazilian company JBS – which has been fined millions of dollars for buying cattle raised on ­deforested land are supplying the UK. Campaigner Alasdair Cameron said: “As well as failing its own forests, the UK is contributing to deforestation overseas.    “We might watch in horror as the Amazon burns, but too little attention is paid to the consumption which is driving the destruction.” The Amazon rainforest has been ravaged in recent weeks by more than , devastating wildfires, according to the last count from the National ­Institute for Space Research. In July, the rate of deforestation hit its highest in a decade. Official figures from Brazil showed that , sq km of the rainforest was destroyed between August  and July  – that’s equivalent to roughly five times the size of London. JBS was fined .millionin  for buying cattle raised on ­illegally deforested land between  and . And according to a report from The Bureau of ­Investigative Journalism, it is ­continuing to sell cattle raised on deforested land.    However, the meat supplier has denied this is the case. Last year, the UK imported , tonnes of corned beef, % of which came from Brazil, with nearly half supplied by JBS. But this scandal goes way beyond beef products, with hundreds of thousands of hectares of land in Brazil used to produce soy for UK animal feed.

Between them, his parents Ed Stafford and Laura Bingham hold the Guinness World Record for being the first to walk theof the Amazon River, in  shattering days, and have completed the world’s first descent of the Essequibo River in Guyana, South America.And he’s named after the great Sir Ranulph Fiennes , for whom death-defying expeditions are just another day at the office.So it’s perhaps no surprise two year-old Ran’s explorer parents are starting him on the road to adventure early.Earlier this year they took on the perilous task of going completely off-grid with their baby, on an uninhabited island for a month.   Surviving a holiday with a toddler is an achievement in any family, but this first big trip really was packed with risk. Yet, while they may face criticism for stranding themselves on a desert island as part of a TV survival experiment, the couple believe there’s just as much danger at home in the UK. Ed, , says: “Having Ran with us meant that I never relaxed and was bloody exhausted because we were constantly keeping an eye on a child. “I’m used to putting my own comfort aside for these programmes but I wasn’t prepared for Ran to be uncomfortable or crying. “I didn’t know how we were going to do it at first and make sure Ran didn’t do anything really really dangerous. I had this vision of making Ran a harness out of vines and I even read about a Japanese tribe where, when women are working, they bury their kids up to the neck in soil.  “But you quickly realise that it was as simple as being more present and aware. Yes, you might be getting on with other stuff but you need to always be watching your child. “Ran got a lot of mum and dad time, so he thrived with that. He also didn’t know to be scared or that he was part of an experiment. “There was one point where we were walking along the beach and it was getting a bit dark and Laura and I were worried because we weren’t back at camp. But Ran was just on my shoulders singing and completely oblivious to the potential dangers. “There are always dangerous things that could happen but you mitigate the risks as much as possible. You know,you’re really unlucky you could just as much come a cropper in Chiswick.” And with the terrying rise in kne crime, Laura adds: “You could get stabbed in the park.”    Ed and Laura decided to take part in the Discovery TV show, Man Woman Child Wild to challenge the ways that they were living and how they were parenting their young son. Laura, , says: “We wanted to inspire families to take more risks with their children, get out of their comfort zone and expose them to more things. We were at an indoor play centre recently and some of the kids got stuck on some tiny ladders because they were too scared to go up or down, but Ran was going head first down a big slide.” Ed adds: “When we had Ran everyone was saying you need to have this buggy and this type of dummy and this type of formula and you have to ask - does it really need to be this complicated  Surely there is a more natural and wholesome way of bringing a child into this world, where they don’t have access to screens and stuff like that. For the challenge, the family travelled to the remote Merak island in Indonesia. They packed just a few knives, bananas and the clothes on their backs. It meant finding a safe area of land to build a house, fishing for food and making sure they had a steady stream of fresh water flowing into their camp - all while looking after a -month-old child.    They were completely alone and filmed the full series themselves. And things got off to a rocky start - with arguments, a tropical storm and Laura falling ill from drinking unclean water. Laura says: “We had a huge tf before we left and I thought that the trip was going to go awfully and we’d disagree on everything. “We had another small argument on day one, when Ed criticised my filming. It was quite funny because I went to storm off and literally got ft away and realised that I couldn’t go anywhere. So we came back together, sat on a rock and figured it out. “We realised that arguments weren’t a luxury that we could afford. At home you can have an argument and go off in dferent directions and be moody and not talk for the rest of the day. But on the island, you have a child, you’ve got to stay safe and find food and shelter. We couldn’t allow ourselves the luxury of going off in a huff.”And even the weather seemed conspire against them.Ed says: “We’d been warned a couple of days before the trip that storms had hit the island and I was told to make sure that I built a shelter very quickly. We had a rudimentary shelter but it didn’t have any walls or anything so we were being buffeted by the storm - it was pretty hairy.”    And Laura explains: “I knew it was going to be an uncomfortable night, curled up in a little square where the rain couldn’t hit us. I thought, ‘is this what this whole experience is going to be ’” But soon they settled into a happy routine on the island - and found there were huge benefits to there being no access to modern technology. Ed says: “Ran massively progressed from not being in front of screens. There’s a demeanour that he has after coming off a screen,” Ed says. “He’s a little bit restless and a little bit dficult. Whereas on the island the only way we had to distract him was by digging a hole in the sand and putting hermit crabs in there for him to play with. “But when he came away from that he was engaged and bright and happy.” And Ed and Laura say that they are now hyper-aware about how screen time and social media could affect their son in the future. Ed says: “We are more aware that screen time is something that needs to be managed.There’s been Facebook suicides and things like that and it’s not to be underestimated."},{"url":null,"title":"student earns 40000 year social","story":"NewsStudent earns £, a year as social media influencer posting between classesTia Christofi, of Melbourne, Australia, has over , followers on Instagram and more than , subscribers on YouTubeShareCommentsByNiamh CavanaghBrendan McFadden:,  SEP NewsTia has been signed by several sports apparel brands \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

This area is also very popular with families who picnic on the flat land beside the river. Haylodge Park has always been a well-manicured park and this is what makes it such a beautul place to visit and use.He questioned whether the plans had been ldquoproperly thought through given that such meadows require upkeep and maintenance.He added: ldquoThese proposals seek to change the very nature of Haylodge Park which is central to recreational le in Peebles.ldquoThe intention to increase bioersity is a noble one, but where needs to be carefully considered.ldquoThe areas identied are heavily used, particularly along the waterrsquos edge and, in my view, should not change. I recognise that others may have a dferent view and hope thatthey do they let us know what they think.SBC leader Shona Haslamis supportive of the plans, she said: ldquoThe way that we manage our green spaces is a hot topic at the moment but one that requires reflection and a reassessment of how we view these essential parts of our town.ldquoOur knowledge of bioersity has increased hugely in the past few years and we are all very aware of the challenges that we are facing with regards climate change.ldquoWe all have to do our bit to ensure that our wildle has the space that it needs, balanced with ensuring that our public spaces remain popular and useable.ldquoWe are all very used to carefully manicured paths, but actually how wildle-friendly are they  Or are they actually sterile green spaces that, while pretty, are not actually doing anything much good ,params: .pushldquoBy leaving the grass and wildflowers to grow we are creating valuable habitats for our wildle, we are protecting our river banks.ldquoWouldnrsquot it be amazing to see otter families back in that stretch of the river as we have seen in other stretches  It also helps to limit access to the river without the need for unsightly fencing.Councillor Haslam said a mown path would ensure everyone could still enjoy the space and walk along the riverside.ldquoWe cannot continue to do what we have always done and expect a dferent result. We have to look at new ways of improving our public spaces, for the benefit of all, including our wildle.Councillor Stuart Bellsaid he welcomed the introduction of bioersity but warned that the council must be wary of making changes simply to save money.He added: ldquoIrsquove seen the introduction of bioersity areas in other parts of the Borders and these do need on-going and specialist care and attention or they just become an unsightly mess of weeds.I trust that the councilrsquos neighbourhood services team have the skills to manage the changes."},{"url":null,"title":"pet-week","story":"This weeks Pet Of The Week, from Borders Pet Rescue, is a bonded pair of rabbits called Mfy and Boo.The charity told us: \"Mfy is a seven-year-old neutered brown girl and Boo is a two-year-old black and white boy.

This occurs when cats come in contact with chemicals such as fuels, lubricants and some solvents.Usually, self-grooming causes the cat to ingest the toxin, or in some cases they inhale it which can cause a severe pneumonia.The toxin can cause problems throughout the body and on the skin too.When Jonny had examined Tikka, he immediately sent her to our Tranent surgery for blood tests and intravenous fluids as she was dehydrated.Fortunately, Tikkarsquos blood tests were normal so she did not have kidney damage.She tolerated her fluid therapy well and was soon looking much happier however several areas of her skin had become red and she was losing hair especially on her front legs.Tikka did not want to eat or drink. She was given analgesics, antibiotics and soothing cream was applied to her skin.Our nursing staff ensured she was as comfortable as possible and as she was not eating by herself, they fed her via a feeding tube several times a day.Her skin became red and thickened and some areas sloughed off.She had to have cream applied frequently to the damaged skin, just asshe had suffered burns.Tikka was finally well enough to go home where Mrs Taylor continued to treat her skin. Tikka started eating well again and is improving daily. Her fur is regrowing and soon she will have her beautul coat again.Now Mrs Taylor was very vigilant and realised she had to do something to help Tikka immediately.If you suspect your cat may have had contact with petroleum-based substances, please contact your vet as soon as possible.Often the first sign you may have is your pet smells of petrol or diesel.There may be vomiting or diarrhoea. They may actually be dizzy or confused or showing other neurological problems such as staggering and trembling. There may be respiratory signs such as coughing or wheezingthey have inhaled the chemical.Do not try to make your pet vomit as this can exacerbate the toxicity.The first thing you should do is try to remove the chemical from the fur.In many cases, it is best to bring your pet straight to your vets as soon as possible. The nursing staff at veterinary practices are well trained in dealing with intoxication emergencies.With petroleum products there are three main areas where the body can be affected: l The internal organs especially the kidneys, so your vet will want to blood sample your pet to check for any damage to the kidneys or other organsl The respiratory system can be affected especiallythe toxin is inhaled. This often happensthe patient vomits then inhales some resulting in a very severe pneumonia. Your vet may wish to take x-rays to check for this.l The animalrsquos skin can also be affected. The petroleum products sit on the fur then soaks through to the skin where they are held in contact by the fur. This causes them to act as a caustic substance, damaging the skin and hair follicles. Often the first sign before the skin damage is seen is hair loss due to the follicle damage.The treatment for these causes is supportive at all times. There are no specic antidotes. Intravenous fluids are administered, this helps overcome dehydration and helps eliminate toxins from the body.Analgesics are given to help keep pain from damaged skin and internal organs to a minimum.Antibiotics are given, as damaged skin is very prone to secondary infection and they are always givenpneumonia is present. Skin treatment has to be intense to keep infection to a minimum and encourage damaged skin to recover.Thankfully Tikka has made an excellent recovery, thanks to Mrs Taylorrsquos quick thinking and the intense nursing care given by the nursing team at Dunedin Vets."},{"url":null,"title":"tim-39-s-tales-magic-real-39-s-around-us","story":"Of course, in stories magic is very real a frog or beast can transform into a prince, dragons and witches can fly, animals can talk, wishes can be granted by faeries and spells cast by wizards.

Itrsquos just that we have stopped noticing the magic that is real.In our world, a frog may not turn into a prince with a kiss, but a caterpillar turns into a butterfly, a tadpole into a frog.And such magic is all around us. Leaves change colour with the seasons, magic transformation is everywhere. Animals do talk, any dog lover will tell us that.Have you ever seen a hare and made eye contact and felt the connection or watched a squirrel hide nuts, and then come up to you asking for more Walk in a wood, or by a riverbank, or just sit in your garden or a park and the magic is all around you. We watched wood pigeons nest in a small elder tree outside our front window over the summer. Two eggs hatched and we watched as they were fed and finally flew the nest. It was, truly, magic.The magic all around us is still vast, and we could all make our own list the sound of birdsong, watching a butterfly flutter, a spiderrsquos web decorated with dew, the glimpse of a deer in a wood, the mist wrapped mountains, a red sparkling cloud during sunset, a wee beastie under a rock as it scampers for cover, the whisper of an ancient tree and the sweet smell of a wood.But I believe that sadly too many of us donrsquot notice real magic anymore.And when we donrsquot notice something we donrsquot feel connected to it, so we donrsquot care about it. And when we donrsquot care about it we donrsquot protect or value it.And when we donrsquot value it, we canrsquot feel the wonder and sense of awe it creates. And so we trash it, ignore and neglect it, exploit it. And we forget we are part of this magic that we are sons and daughters of nature too. And so we disconnect ourselves from what can truly make us feel happy, and instead drug ourselves with the articial magic of our own technology which makes us feel all powerful.But the truth is we are not.Ultimately we rely on the natural environment for our physical and emotional well-being, as much as the creatures we are making extinct.We need nature, it doesnrsquot need us, and eventually it is in control. Asto make this point huge waves hit the rocks of Prestonpans in a storm not so long ago, drenching the nearby houses in a display of naturersquos power. It was scary but also spectacular.In  such a storm was believed to have been the result of magic conjured by the ldquoNorth Berwick Witches.That storm, like the recent one, was indeed magic, conjured by nature, which can whip up a whirlwind more effectively than any wizard or witch.Magic is real.

I walked through woods to primary school.The committee approved the conditions with an added condition which called for the developer to produce details of a footpath link to the south of the strip of land owned by Muirfield Grove residents for approval before building begins.It also added an additional condition asking for a Construction Method Statement to be submitted prior to work beginning amid concerns about access to the site which is through a narrow C-class road and reports of heavy construction vehicles parking off site.A third additional condition, addressing the local authorityrsquos recent pledge to take action against a climate emergency, called for a report on actions taken to reduce carbon emissions on the site to be submitted.Following the meeting, Councillor Findlay, who was the sole member to vote against approving the plans, said: ldquoIam very disappointed with the decision of the planning committee in approving Calarsquos application for detailed planning permission for Saltcoats Field despite the fact that, in my opinion, it falls far short of fulfilling Policy T of the Local Development Plan  in terms of connectivity to the rest of the village.ldquoI am also disappointed that it did not approve of my proposed amendment to delay permission until connectivity issues have been sorted out as, at present, the two proposed pedestrian cycle routes either go over land owned by Gullane residents who have not given their permission to use or via the much longer route through Millennium Wood which is not a safe route to school or for use in low light or nighttime conditions.ldquoIt seems that, once again, members of the planning committee have ignored the wishes of the local community, the community council and their own planning

He was in Scotland mainly to play golf and try whisky, he told me. I was trying to convince him Scotland had many other things to offer and we got onto the issue of Scotlandrsquos landscape. He seemed interested in how our land was used, and he told me that back home he owned a ranch, which included a medium-sized forest of native trees.I remember saying ldquowow, thatrsquos so special, but he shook his head, saying: ldquoSpecial  No, not really, a stupid law means the forest is worthless.I was a bit confused, so I asked him what he meant. ldquoTherersquos a preservation order on it, which means that part of my land is unproductive, he said.I realised at this point that although we were having the same conversation about land, we were having dferent understandings of it.He shook his head sadly and said: ldquoItrsquos just a waste of good timber.That kind of ended our conversation. I didnrsquot try to persuade him to think dferently, I felt that I wasnrsquot in a position to do that since he was a paying customer and my tip could have been at stake.That conversation was nearly  years ago. And yet his comment ldquoitrsquos just a waste of good timber has stuck with me ever since. The reason for this was the mindset it revealed. I found it depressing that he could not see the value of something so precious because it would make him no financial profit.As my kids get geared up for the school climate strike this week, I realise now this mindset is one which has to be challenged. When I look back, I am ashamed of myself that I did not have the courage to speak out to the man, simply because I needed his tip.There are many parts of the climate crisis, but one truth within the debate is trees are our le. I have seen one calculation that each human breathes in the oxygen produced by around eight trees. So count the number in your family and those you love and multiply by eight. That is the number of trees needed to help your family and loved ones breathe. For sure, trees arenrsquot the only source of the oxygen we breathe, but they are a signicant part of it, and they hold tons of carbon. Surely that alone is lsquoprofitrsquo enough.But while the riches of woodland go way beyond that of timber profit, I understand that environmental destruction is linked to poverty as well as greed. We need to challenge both. But we will never do thiswe are made to be too afraid to speak out, either because we fear those who wield financial power over us, or the ridicule of others who as yet donrsquot get it.In a storytelling session last week for a P class in an East Lothian primary school, I told the tale of the king who wanted to touch the moon. He always gets his way because people are afraid of him, so the forest in his kingdom is cut down to make a tower of wooden boxes to the moon. But he is impatient and foolish, and falls from the tower, and the boxes all get smashed. The forest has been destroyed for the kingrsquos failed vanity project, while his people remain poor and still afraid of him.One of the girls in the class put her hand up then said: ldquoBut we need trees to live. Later she told me: ldquoThey should get rid of the kinghe doesnrsquot change his bad ways.Many of our young people get it. Itrsquos their future. We can all make our own small personal contribution, but to save our childrenrsquos future, courage is needed to speak out, for adults too.Never again will I remain silent, for either reward or fear of ridicule.

Wood denounced the councilrsquos decision to block the parades as ldquostupid. This seems harsh, although the immediate backlash does show this cautionary step backfired. As Wood commented in a newspaper article, outright bans simply allow resentment to fester and violence to erupt where.Explosions of sectarian aggression and abuse are an obvious outrage, but even entirely peaceful religious marches through Glasgow are a blot on the cityrsquos reputation. Whenever a Grand Orange Lodge goes past, banging drums, playing flutes and waving banners, I feel I have stepped back three centuries. In theory, Orange marches are harmless and legitimate expressions of faith and historical commemoration. In practice, in the west of the country at least, they are the unlit end of a fuse that doesnrsquot take much to ignite. Everyone knows these are potentially inflammatory occasions, and a marching season that passes without incident is the very definition of a miracle.As is all too evident, sectarian prejudice is alive and well. Those who say it is nearly extinct are either optimists or judge todayrsquos level of confrontation against a much bloodier and more ignorant past. By that measure, certainly, things are considerably better than they were even as recently as when I joined this newspaper when on my first day a new colleague commented on the arrival of yet another Protestant. Anti-discrimination laws have helped promote more enlightened attitudes, but even without this statutory inducement to scrupulous fairness, the majority of us these days make no distinction between Catholic and Protestant,indeed we even notice it at all.:Faith no more  Have catholic schools had their day, asks Kevin McKennaThe country has come a long way since the Church of Scotlandrsquos disgraceful and virulent anti-Catholicism in the s, and the barefaced discrimination and hurtful jibes Catholics of all ranks endured. No wonder separate schools were considered necessary. Yet while levels of abuse and discrimination are dramatically lower than before, in some quarters hoary old grievances and antediluvian attitudes continue to smoulder.You could argue that the answer is education: an ongoing challenging of closed minds that will eventually lead to a state where nobody cares what religion other people follow. It is Tom Woodrsquos contention, however, that in order to eradicate sectarianism we need to abolish Catholic schools. These, he believes, are the root of the problem.With some reluctance, I have to agree their time is up. This, despite knowing that endorsing this view would appear to be rejecting the liberal values that I consider essential for a fair and well-run country. If parents wish to send their children to a school whose principles are guided by the Catholic faith ndash or any other for that matter ndash surely they should be allowed that choice  By all accounts, the education students receive in Catholic schools is impressive, and in some cases so enviable that lapsed members of the church appear to have a Damascene reawakening in order to get their offspring into the classroom.Yet the existence of this archaic system of schooling is tangible evidence of a problem that refuses to wither. From early childhood, separate schools reinforce the idea of dference, segregation and distinction. Whatever side of that school fence you walk, you are made aware from Primary One onwards of the concept of Them and Us.Therersquos another distasteful aspect of segregated schools too. Richard Dawkinsrsquos new book, Outgrowing God, which is aimed at young readers, tries to help ldquobreak the cycle of indoctrination. That word will be offensive to those who think they are doing their best by their children in instructing them in their own religious beliefs and culture, be they Catholic, Protestant, Muslim or Jew. But, even when done with the best intentions, sending a child to a school affiliated to a church is a form of intellectual and emotional programming. It represents the opposite of liberal values.:Catholic schools are rated higher by inspectorsFor as long as it is possible to put a child through a denominational education, society is tacitly acknowledging the power of religion to define who people are. In an age when the state is increasingly non-religious in its decision-making, in order to maintain strict neutrality and equality, it makes no sense. When single-sex institutions are frowned upon as out-dated, when discrimination based on ethnicity, background or sexual orientation is considered abhorrent, it seems odd that this particular expression of dference is allowed to continue. Onlysectarianism were unheard of, rather than a persistent blight, would it ndash just about ndash be acceptable.Back in the real world, the existence of educational pigeon-holes like these means there is little hope of religious bigotry being eradicated. Those on either side of the school gates live in an environment that allows this shameful stain on our country to persist, and even flourish. Initiatives to raise awareness or to banish deep-rooted prejudices can never be wholly successful so long as the public statement of religious identity is allowed such a state-sanctioned .This is not to attack faith itself. What iniduals choose to believe, and the ways in which they introduce children to their religion or creed at home, is their business. Nor should schools cease to teach pupils about world religions, or to help them understand the huge cultural influence that Christianity, both Catholic and Protestant, has exerted on countless aspects of our lives, for good and ill.Complete integration, however, should be the goal. The building blocks of society must mirror the kind of world we want future generations to inherit. No matter how you look at it, denominational schools have become an anomaly. If sectarianism is to become a thing of the past, then so should they."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-finance-secretary-pressure-boost-funding-39-filthy-39-glasgow","story":"The GMB will use a meeting with Mackay to make a special case for Scotlandrsquos largest city to get more cash, which could include a demand for hundreds of millions of pounds.Union organiser Rhea Wolfson said: ldquoWe will use this opportunity to ask the Finance Minister for interventions that tackle the chronic decline of Glasgow and the unique challenges itrsquos facing over the next few years.Pressure on council budgets has been particularly acute in Glasgow, which critics say has lost out on around poundm since .The councilrsquos botched handling of the poundm equal pay row has also hit the city in the pocket.In order to meet the bill, the local authority has taken out loans against assets such as the Emirates Arena and Scotstoun Stadium and committed to making repayments over the next few decades.Further equal pay claims could land the council with another liability.City Property Glasgow, a wholly owned subsidiary of the council, agreed a poundm, -year loan deal with Canada Le Investments.

Interestingly, wardrobing decreases with age:  per cent of  to -year-olds polled admitted doing it, compared with six per cent of people aged over .To be honest, wardrobing sounds like a lot of hard work with very little tangible reward.

No more studio bound interviews across a desk begone the politician standing in front of a bog standard garden trellis. But going out of a controlled environment has its risks, as The Andrew Marr Show demonstrated.: Corbyn calls for recallMarr is a ldquobig window show, the window in question containing a live shot of the Thames. Through it we can see the subdued bustle of a Sunday morning in London, trains going to and from Waterloo, boats chugging through the water at sightseeing speed. There is no sound, because that would interfere with what is being said, which is, after all, why we are all here on a Sunday morning.Marr took the window idea to Brighton, which seemed at first like a smart move. We could see a pier, lots of expensive flats along the waterside , and a beach complete with strollers and joggers. The problem was what we could hear. Ladies and gentlemen, all the way from London, it was the artist known as Shouting Man.Shouting Man, with his trademark ldquoStop Brexit bellow, can be heard in the background to almost every interview on Westminsterrsquos College Green. He is not the same as Glockenspiel Man, Liberty Bell Man, Drum Man, or any of the other characters who like to express their political opinions through the medium of music.Shouting Man gave viewers a brief burst from his limited repertoire, then went quiet for a bit. He might have been having a cup of tea and a bacon roll, he could have been doing an interview , or a researcher had popped down to plead with him. But soon he was back, in full flow. Marr and Corbyn were determined to ignore him, but it was a struggle, for them as much for the viewer.: Cameron cites frustration with SalmondMarr ploughed on, asking the Labour leader about attempts to oust Tom Watson as his deputy. Corbyn said he knew there were to be discussions but was not aware a motion was being put forward. ldquoIrsquom not all seeing and all knowing. Irsquod love to be.What about the departure of a key aide, Andrew Fisher, as reported in the Sunday Times  He was said to have walked out claiming Corbyn could not win a General Election, and accusing his leadership team of a ldquolack of professionalism, competence and decency. That was all fine, too, said Corbyn. Why, they had enjoyed a cup of coffee together that morning. He even tried a joke, saying of Mr Fisher: ldquoWe do frequently argue ... about football. He supports Spurs. Stand-ups everywhere relax: you are never going to lose a gig to Jezza the Joker.Attempts were made to discover which side Mr Corbyn would be on in any referendum on a Labour-negotiated Brexit deal, all to no avail. As for his staying a full term as PM, the answer was a spirited ldquoof course.Ridge on Sunday opted to set up shop in the exhibitors section of The Brighton Centre. Nestled next to the information counter and a Labour Party merchandise stall. Passersby stopped now and then for a look before wandering off. Unlike with Marr, the setting added atmosphere without interruption.Ridge went for iety over big names, with a line-up that included Unite general secretary Len McCluskey, who dismissed as ldquofake news claims that he had been behind efforts to ousts Tom Watson. To make up for the Corbyn-sized hole in the show, Ridge had been busy where in the week, bagging interviews with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, and the previously shy and retiring David Cameron who, now he has his memoirs to flog, is everywhere.: Macwhirter on Labours Brexit policyOn the former PM asking for the Queenrsquos support during the Scottish independence referendum campaign, he replied: ldquoIrsquove said all I want to say so you can ask me questions but Irsquom going to say very, very little. Ridge reminded him that he had spoken about his conversations with the Queen on not one but two occasions. First, when he was overheard saying the monarch ldquopurred on learning No had won, and second in a BBC documentary when he had asked the Palaceshe could give some sort of indication, half an eyebrow raise, to indicate her support for Scotland staying in the Union.Any conversation on the latter was not with the Queen, said Mr Cameron, but between his aides and her aides.

This is because four fths of Scotland’s carbon footprint is generated through the heat and energy required to grow, make, process, transport and provide materials that are often tossed aside at the end of their le.Only by considering how to make products with less reliance on raw materials, and by remaking items at the end of their original le into goods that can be used time and again, will businesses be able to signicantly reduce global emissions.Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, who launched the organisation’s corporate plan before an auduence of business leaders last week, said: “We must radically change the way we think about and consume our goods and materials, and we must do that now.” “Too many businesses assume that reducing the cost to the planet means increasing costs for them. “But as we have and will continue to make clear, the opportunities are plentul, with massive savings to be made. “The current way of working cannot continue in the years ahead and successfully adopting a circular economy approach is the only long-term option.”Everything has value and in a circular economy nothing should be wasted. In simple terms, it can be explained as ‘make, use, remake’ as opposed to ‘make, use, dispose’. The ultimate goal is to maintain and improve our quality of le, while simultaneously reducing our material consumption and, by extension, our impact on the planet.Mr Gulland added: “Many Scottish firms are already leading the way, with our help, changing how they design and trade goods to keep materials in use for as long as possible to maximise their value. “Successful circular economy enterprises range from refurbishing computers and upcycling furniture to producing sustainable animal feed using waste generated by our world-famous whisky industry.”data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.kincardineshireobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Felicitasis just one of the many children supported by Marys Meals.\"   is just one of the many children supported by Marys Meals.\"  Throw a Porridge Party for Mary’s MealsviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.kincardineshireobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Left to right - Fiona Cooper, treasurer, Katrina Suer, chair, and Catherine Houston, vice-chair\"  Scouts plea for hut renovation support viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"KINC | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"KINC | Article Teaser\"Zero Waste Scotland estimates that the circular economy would save Scottish businesses collectively at least £ billion every year through benefits including the creation of longer-lasting relationships with customers, as firms switch from a model centred on simply selling products to providing products as services.

This year Orkney boasts seven venues — some of which are participating for the first time,As far as local people are concerned, Doors Open Days is about getting into buildings for free and seeing things that you don#t often see. If buildings are usually charging an entrance fee they can take part by offering to open for free,The event benefits the organisations or venues by attracting more visitors. It helps them by becoming more involved in the community, as a volunteer or a visitor, and enhancing appreciation of local architecture and local heritage.The seven venues taking part in Orkney all have free entry.

He said: #We want to thank our residents for doing a great job in increasing the amount of metals they recycle at the kerbside.#However, we want to take that even further now by focusing on foil. I was amazed to learn that an average household can expect to use  foil trays and  metres of foil wrap each year.#The good news is that recycling a tonne of aluminium saves nine tonnes of C emissions and four tonnes of bauxite, the raw material from which aluminium is made. And aluminium can be recycled indefinitely.“So it’s clear that each household converted to foil recycling really does make a dference environmentally. The council also gets a goodfor metals recycling, which helps offset the costs of all our waste disposal activities in Orkney.“But we know from speaking to the public that some people are unaware they can recycle foil in Orkney, or aren’t aware of the benefits. That’s why, with Alupro’s help again, we’ll be highlighting foil recycling during Recycling Week and beyond.”As part of awareness-raising, the council will be installing banners provided by Alupro at recycling centres and other public places around Orkney.OIC’s waste team are also featuring facts and figures about foil recycling on the EcoActive Facebook page, and carrying out visits to schools over Recycling Week.In Orkney, householders can put aluminium foil and foil trays in the metal recycling banks at one of the council’s Household Waste Recycling Centres , or into their recycling bin. The advice is to just rinse off food residue and put in your recycling binalongside other metals you can recycle such as food and drink cans and tins, and metal lids and tops from jars and bottles.For smaller pieces of foilit#s best to make a larger ball of foilby scrunching pieces together # it will prevent smaller pieces falling through machinery during the recycling process.For more information about waste and recycling visit the council#s website or email recycling@orkney.gov.uk .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Successful generators still sell the electricity they produce on the wholesale market but receive a #top-up# payment over the course of the -year contract.Changes made to rules which had forbidden all onshore wind projects from competing in the electricity market in  meant projects in the Western Isles, Shetland and Orkney were able to compete.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “The UK is leading the way in the fight against climate change, and it’s great news that millions more homes will be powered by clean energy at record low prices.“Seizing the opportunities of clean energy not only helps to protect our planet, but will also back businesses and boost jobs across the UK.”Though they may have won favour with the government, Hoolan#s two Orkney projects have previously been met with protest from the public and rejection by councillors. More than  protestors took to School Place, last September, when the projects appeared before the OIC planning committee. Though there were no statutory objections to either project, there were  letters of objection and  of support for the Costa project. The Hesta Project, meanwhile, received a total of  objections and nine letters of support.Though councillors elected to reject the wind farms, this decision was later overturned by the Scottish Government. This sparked criticism from former planning chairman, Councillor Owen Tierney, who accused the government of #lacking faith# in the local planning system.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I look forward to the project progressing.”Led by ZeroAvia, developers of hydrogen fuel cell powertrain solutions, HyFlyer will demonstrate a phased approach from battery power to hydrogen power, integrating the new technology aboard a Piper M-class six-seater aircraft which will perform test flights out of Cranfield and Orkney.Project partners Intelligent Energy will optimise its high power fuel cell technology for application in aviation while EMEC Hydrogen, producers of green hydrogen from renewable energy, will supply the hydrogen required for flight tests and develop a mobile refuelling  compatible with the plane.The HyFlyer project will see conventional piston engines in propeller aircraft replaced by electric motors, hydrogen fuel cells and gas storage.If all goes well, ZeroAvia, based in Calornia, are aiming to supply the technology to commercial manufacturers by .Following this demonstration, the next goal then is to power an aircraft, carrying up to  passengers, to travel  miles.According to the Air Transport Action Group, aviation is responsible for  per cent of CO emissions from all transport sources and is one of the fastest growing sources of global emissions.Val Mtakhov, founder and CEO of ZeroAvia, said: “The substantial backing provided by the UK Government underlines the potential that hydrogen holds as a fuel source for commercial aviation and provides signicant validation of ZeroAvia’s approach to zero emission flight.“Our project goal of  NM is equivalent to the distance from London to Edinburgh and will prove that zero emission aviation, powered by hydrogen, can play a key role within the UK and other countries’ transport strategies — enabling net zero targets to be met and improving productivity and regional prosperity.”Richard Ainsworth, Hydrogen Project Specialist at EMEC Hydrogen, said: “HyFlyer is another key step in Orkney’s aim to decarbonise leline transport services for islanded communities.#Hydrogen has the potential to help meet our emission commitments where electrons and batteries can’t.#This project sees us one step closer to meeting our fuel and energy needs from abundant local renewable energy resources using green hydrogen.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

And so surely it is both appropriate and welcome that it seeks to make its expertise and experience available to those trying to save lives in other countries, and supports those efforts where they can “Much of the work the RNLI is doing overseas appears to be targeted at young people and children – helping making the water safer for them # and that is something I would fully support.“As someone who has, from a very early age, helped raise funds for the RNLI, I am proud of its work home and abroad, and I thank every crew member, volunteer, fundraiser and supporter for all their efforts.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

If we don’t, I’m fearful for the result of the general election.”Trade unions polled voters earlier this year on Labour’s current policy of putting a new Brexit deal it negotiates to a referendum, with Remain on the ballot paper but with Labour going into a general election without a clear stance on which option it would campaign for.Across the UK, only . per cent of  Labour voters would stick with the party under those circumstances. The Lib Dems would take  per cent of the  Labour vote, with . per cent going to the Greens, . per cent to the SNP, and . per cent to Plaid Cymru.That compares with  per cent going to the Brexit Party and  per cent to the Conservatives.The figures are even worse in Scotland, where just . per cent of  Labour voters would stick with the party. The SNP would take a fth of Labour’s vote at the last election, with % going to the Lib Dems, % to the Brexit Party, and % to the Conservatives.Ms Thornberry insisted her comments were not part of a leadership bid amid growing speculation about a fresh challenge to Mr Corbyn’s authority.“In a polarised situation like this, it’s absolutely right to keep the country together, which is what a second referendum does in my view, but we’ve got to be honest about who we are - and we’re internationalists and Europeans,” Ms Thornberry added.: Concerns no-deal Brexit could fuel sectarian violence in Scotland “I know that the scottish Labour Party agreed with me, and I know that the Welsh Labour Party agree with me.“There are so many marginal seats in Scotland. I hear the stats and my heart misses a beat, because I was first elected on a majority of .“There are lots of seats that are really marginal on all sides, which is why it’s so important that we are clear.”Ms Thornberry’s intervention follows a call from Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard for the UK party to follow policy set north of the border and in Wales, backing Remain in the event of a second EU referendum.Mr Corbyn is under pressure ahead of a vote of members in Brighton tomorrow, after he said he would “go along with whatever decision the party comes to” at a special conference to decide Labour’s stance in a referendum.Pressure was also heaped on the Labour leader by the London Mayor, Sadiq Khan, who told a fringe event in Brighton: “Staying neutral in the face of the biggest economic and social threat to our country for decades is simply not an option.”Mr Corbyn defended his ‘neutral’ stance and promised a special Labour conference for party members to decide whether to endorse a new Brexit deal his government would negotiate, or back Remaining in the EU.“What we have said is that we would want to hold a consultation, a special conference of our party at the point that we have got this offer from the EU, we’ve got this as a remain - and hopefully reform - option,” he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show.“Because I do think even those that are strongly in favour of remain would recognise the EU needs to have some reforms.”The Labour leader said he would “go along with whatever decision the party comes to” on Brexit, and did not rule out giving Labour MPs a free voteBoris Johnson brings a deal back to the Commons.Mr Corbyn risked angering Labour’s pro-EU membership by suggesting the UK could be better off after Brexit, with the right deal.“Please remember why people voted Leave, why people voted Remain, but also remember there is more that unites all of those people – over austerity, over investment, over education, over housing, over health, over a green industrial revolution – than there is that ides them,” he said.Conservative Party chairman James Cleverly said the comments show Mr Corbyn “can’t lead his own party”.“Jeremy Corbyn this morning refused nine times to sayLabour would support Brexit eventhey negotiated a deal with the EU themselves, showing Labour offer nothing but dither and pointless delay,” Mr Cleverly said. “Jeremy Corbyn can’t lead his own party, let alone the country – he can’t even make up his mind on the most important issue facing the country.“He would delay Brexit until at least  and even longerthe EU demand it – Brussels would be in the driving seat and Corbyn would accept anything from them.”Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Tom Brake, whose party has pledged to revoke Article it forms a majority government, said: “Jeremy Corbyn has once again refused to deny thathe becomes Prime Minister his government will be a Brexit government.“This will be deeply concerning to millions of Labour supporters who want to campaign to stop Brexit and cannot get any clarity from Labour.”©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"euan mccolm brexit policy labour should give its eyeteeth for","story":"To the growing list of senior politicians who appear to have completely lost their minds over Brexit, we must now add the name Emily Thornberry.Labour’s shadow foreign secretary has added considerably to the black farce of the current political crisis with her take on the Liberal Democrats’ announcement that they would, in the unlikely event of them winning the next general election, simply cancel the UK’s departure from the EU. This policy, says Thornberry, shows the Lib Dems are “kind of Taliban”.By any measure, this is an idiotic take. But this is where we are. This is how low Labour has sunk under the pitul leadership of Jeremy Corbyn.Thornberry’s remarks to The House magazine came after Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said thatshe became prime minister before the Brexit deed was done, her government would revoke Article . The Labour frontbencher was not alone in reacting furiously to this position. From across the political spectrum came howls of anger. The Lib Dems were undemocratic, they were prepared to treat the electorate with contempt.For sure, in these ided times, they are plenty of voters ready to lap up these attacks on Swinson. But polls published in the aftermath of the row over the policy showed that others are not quite so furiously angry. One showed the Lib Dems in second place behind Boris Johnson’s Conservative Party while other had them just a point behind Labour.If it was running candidates in the next UK general election, the Taliban would kill for polling results like those.Of course, people who cling to the belief that Brexit will mean a great national liberation are not going to like Swinson’s policy. Of course, they are going to attack it. But it is not, no matter how loudly they screech, undemocratic.In order for the Lib Dems to be able to revoke Article  and stop Brexit in its tracks, the party would have to win a majority at the next general election. Swinson would require a democratic mandate to do what she wants. How depressing that this perfectly obvious fact is ignored by the likes of Thornberry.In Scotland, we have more experience than our neighbours on these islands of living through the aftermath of a binary referendum. We understand how referendums can impact on subsequent voter behaviour. Following the  independence referendum, the SNP received a considerable boost to its electoral fortunes. Anyone who’d voted Yes in the referendum wasn’t about to back Labour or the Conservatives, were they But the nationalists weren’t the only ones to turn the result of the referendum to their advantage. Under Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tories styled themselves the defenders of the Union. While Labour squirmed and wobbled on the constitutional question, Davidson was unequivocal that a vote for her party was a vote to prevent a second independence referendum.In the  Holyrood election, the Conservatives knocked Labour into third place.The Lib Dems’ position on Brexit makes perfect political sense to me.While career-long Eurosceptic Jeremy Corbyn refuses, against the wishes of the majority of his party members, to take a firm anti-Brexit position, Swinson has the space to become the champion of those who believe that departure from the EU will have catastrophic consequences.Prime Minister Boris Johnson is now fighting for Brexit at any cost. He would rather “die in a ditch” than ask the EU to postpone our departure date of  October.Idiots and the terminally naive may believe that such a clear position can be defeated by nuance . It cannot.Brexit dominates our politics and ides the electorate. There is no mileage to be gained by opposition parties in trying to win over those now rallying around Johnson’s No Deal flag. Rather, the prize – the only prize currently on offer – is becoming the leading opponent to Johnson’s Brexit “plan”.Labour is currently bogged down in yet another crisis of its own making. A now abandoned plot to abolish the position of deputy leader in order to punish the current holder of the position, Tom Watson, for daring to speak out about issues such as anti-Semitism and Brexit is yet more proof that Corbyn and his cronies are more interested in leftist sectarianism than they are in providing credible opposition to the Conservative Party.Those Labour members who continue to delude themselves that their leader might be a viable champion for their pro-EU beliefs should seek out online an interview conducted by ITV journalist Joe Pike last week, during which Corbyn refused eight times to answer the simple question of whether he was pro-Leave or pro-Remain.Swinson’s position on Brexit is bluntand, I think, stands a good chance of capturing the mood of a great many voters. Davidson has shown that, when it comes to binary matters, it is best to pick a side and then stick to it.The chances of the Lib Dems ever being in a position to enact this new flagship policy are, it has to be said, slender. Recent polling might have the party neck and neck with Labour but Boris Johnson’s Tories continue to be the clear front-runners with voters.But, given the Lib Dems were all but destroyed by a voter backlash against their five years in coalition government with David Cameron’s Tories, being able to revoke Article  is not the only prize for Swinson. The revitalisation of her party would be quite the achievement.Politicians from left to right may insist that what voters want is for Brexit to be over and done and for MPs toto dealing with the domestic agenda. I wonderthere’s a degree of projection in such remarks.So far as I can see, Brexit shows no sign of becoming less important to the electorate. And while this is so, Swinson is quite right to take a hard Remain position. If ever there was a time to pick a side, it is now.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"lesley riddoch nicola sturgeon s emphasis on democratic process is consistent","story":"Nicola Sturgeon says Scots could hold another referendum to reverse independence,the country changes its mind after voting Yes next time. Is that an own goal, a cunning plan or a statement of the blindingly obvious  The First Minister was speaking in Berlin last week where she collected a media prize as the “voice of reason” on Brexit. She was asked by a Czech reporter: “If the Scottish people decide for independence, could there be [another] referendum in a few years to decide against independence Nicola Sturgeon replied: “Democracy’s not conditional. It’s not for politicians to decide the limits. It’s up to people to decide the future they want. But no country, to my knowledge, that has become independent from the UK… [has] decided to change their minds and go back the way, and I don’t think it is likely that Scotland would do that either.”Quite. Indeed, the First Minister could have gone further. No country that’s become independent anywhere in the world, has gone back to the “mother ship”, cap in hand, pleading for readmission – partly because Mother Ships also move on.So, the prospect of a post-independence wobble here is unlikely, but arises from Scotland’s unique status as the only country to hold an independence referendum yet fail to jump ship. That result and its contested aftermath make it easier to suggest Scots are uniquely incapable of making a big constitutional decision and sticking with it. But devolution is irretrievably in with the bricks, despite needing two referendums to get over the line.And by the time Scotland becomes independent, rUK may very well be grappling with the reality of Brexit, a battered currency, civil unrest over food shortages and problems with medical supplies. Of course, Britain’s Brexit path may be less rocky than predicted and Scotland’s route to independence more dficult. But that’s the point. There are unknowns now on both sides of the equation.So maybe that’s why Nicola Sturgeon was prepared to indulge not smack down or body-swerve the dficult but also fairly irrelevant press conference question about indyref. Once out of the UK, an independent Scotland will be focused and busy – re-joining the EU, establishing a currency, setting up the institutions of a new state, and making decisions about everything from a national anthem to new energy providers and a head of state using citizens’ assemblies and perhaps specic referenda, as never before in the UK. Overturning such a process looks dficult and very unlikely.Nonetheless, the SNP leader’s remarks have infuriated many unionists who raise the prospect of a never-ending cycle of contradictory referendums and accuse Nicola Sturgeon of luring swithering voters with the idea that a Yes vote is easily reversed – like a longer, constitutional version of the -day cooling off period. Some suggest thatshe won Indyref, Nicola Sturgeon would immediately change the rules so a two-thirds majority would be needed to reverse it. Others insist this unexpected turn in the independence debate was crafted simply to distract from rows over hospitals and the Named Person scheme. Perhaps though, this furious response from opponents of independence is a back-handed compliment – angry recognition that the First Minister’s refusal to bind the hands of future voters probably appeals to a Scottish electorate fairly keen on democratic practice and legal process and fairly scunnered with the cheerful disregard for popular sovereignty shown by most unionist parties. Ms Sturgeon’s emphasis on democratic process is consistent, whether it’s a People’s Vote on Brexit or the need for a specic referendum majority – not just an election mandate – to begin negotiations for independence with London. Above all, the First Minister’s willingness to countenance another referendum that might reverse the crowning achievement of her le’s work, puts clear blue water between herself and Jo Swinson who will simply revoke Article  without a referendum, in the unlikely event that she wins power in the next general election. Since the SNP and Lib Dems may soon be fighting it out for Scottish Remain votes, Nicola Sturgeon’s “old fashioned” commitment to democracy at all costs and at any political price, may yet pay idends.And the First Minister’s talk of indyref has another simple merit for independence supporters. By focusing public attention on what might happen after the next referendum, she’s made a legally binding indyref and a Yes victory sound imminent and inevitable. There are also downsides. Opening up the possibility of another referendum after independence invites confusion with the quite separate argument for a confirmatory vote on the deal extracted from London. As far as I understand it, the First Minister is definitely not arguing for that. Nor is she inviting debate on other proposals that would constrain indyref by imposing a two-thirds majority, a turnout threshold or the like. The SNP backs the Venice Commission, a group of constitutional experts which advises the Council of Europe. It opposes the use of anything but a simple majority for important constitutional votes and asks how democracy would be serveda  per cent vote was declared null and void, because it had failed to reach a higher threshold. In such a situation, would the status quo really feel like a “settled will”  The Brexit referendum has of course demonstrated the dficulty of victory by a very narrow margin. But the  Scottish home rule referendum also demonstrated the dficulty of victory by imposed and arbitrary thresholds. What’s needed to carry the day is the active involvement of folk from every part of society – especially those on the vanquished side, something the Scottish Government has accepted far more easily than either recent UK Prime Minister. Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie says SNP supporters will go bananas when they hear the First Minister is lining up Indyref as well as Indyref. I doubt it. There’s been little response so far, even from established critics of the SNP leader.Partly that’s down to discipline. But mostly that’s because independence obviously allows Scots to consider a new form of loose union with the rUK, membership of the Nordic Council, or maybe the halfway house of EFTA in preference to the EU.Such freedom may look scary after centuries of constraint. But it’s a fear mature independent countries hug with relish. ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad ","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree. I would hope local people can support it in any way they can.#The Skye Live festival runs from Thursday th until Saturday th September. Acts on the bill include Niteworks, Elephant Sessions, Lau, Tide Lines and Peat and Diesel as well as DJs Erol Alkan, Optimoand Leon Vynehall.."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/barra-hospital.jpg","title":"consultation events for barra","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineComhairle nan Eilean Siar are to visit Barra next weekfor two consultation events that will help inform a feasibility study into thecreation of a combined school and hospital facility in Castlebay.The proposal caused confusion and anger earlier thisyear, when it was first publicised, as both the comhairle and NHS Western Isleshad already progressed a plan for a new hospital to replace St Brendan’s.

Gareth’s identity was revealed in a News Letter article and the story was picked up by This Morning who invited him and his we Kirsty to appear on the show this morning.Lea also appeared on the show along with her sister Shannon and niece Akeelah, who slept soundly throughout the interview. Gareth Bronte on This MorningIt was to be the first time the family had met Gareth and his we Kirsty in the flesh.It made for an emotional segment on the show as presenters Phil Scholfield and Holly Willoughby introduced the story which was captioned ‘A Random ‘Slice’ Of Birthday Kindness’. Lea explained to Phil and Holly how she had been spurred on by Gareth’s kindness to carry on the good gesture: “I know it wasn’t absolutely the same circumstances, but I just thought I wanted to do a good gesture for somebody  so I paid off the same amount that he’d paid off our cake onto someone ’s. It carries on the story as well.”Gareth and his we Kirsty, who live between Loughbrickland and Rathfriland on the outskirts of Banbridge, were then introduced.Lea Ni Bhriain on This MorningTheir daughter Hannah Stella Bronte was born prematurely on September ,  weighing just two pounds, five and half ounces. Their baby girl lost her brave fight for le after eight days in ICU.Gareth told the show: “In the lead up to what would have been Hannah’s birthday my we and I wanted to do something to mark it. Our little boy Caleb, who is four, came up with the idea of letting a helium balloon go so that it would make its way up to heaven. That was something we had planned.“I’d said to Kirsty I wanted to do something dferent, maybe a little random act of kindness to share a little joy.

Mr Ziada, who is of Palestinian origin, contends that the attack on the family home was a violation of international humanitarian law and constituted a gross violation of internationally recognised human rights principles.Mr Gantz and Mr Eshel claim immunity from the Dutch court and contend that Mr Ziada should have presented his claim in an Israeli court. Mr Gantz is running for office against Benjamin Netanyahu in the Israeli national elections this week.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Eddie said: “The case is historical in that it is the first time a Palestinian has been able to make use of civil litigation on the basis of universal jurisdiction to gain access to justice for war crimes.“The pursuance of the case has been made possible by an online crowdfunder which received widespread support in Ireland from iniduals, trade unions and human rights organisations and prominent people like Senator Frances Black, award-winning filmmaker Seán Murray and musician Mick Blake.

Two of the sculptures from the popular Julia Donaldson-penned Gruffalo tale were completely destroyed after they were set ablaze while others were defaced. Colin Glen Forest Park is home to the unique Trail and has visitors and families from across the city visit daily to see the attraction. Mother-of-two Nicola Marley said that it is “upsetting” for her children when their “favourite character or activity is signicantly damaged or missing” along the Trail.“I participated in a project with the Princes Trust to create a small memorial garden for victims who have lost their lives as a result of mental health issues,” she said. “A lot of hard work and time went into it, many close friends and family of the victims use the garden as a peaceful space to sit and reflect. It is sad that this has now been destroyed too. The park would be a nicer and safer placethe constant vandalism stopped.”Another parent, Janine Belton, spoke of how the Gruffalo Trail “gives the children a wonderful experience and provides them with some learning within nature.” “However, the animal statues have been destroyed, leaving the children confused and sad as they believe that the animals were being ‘hurt’,” she said. Bernadette Devlin, from Colin Sure Start said that vandalism on the Gruffalo Trail was impacting the learning and development of children in the area.“We use that facility a few times a year to bring parents and our children from nought to four age range,” she said.“It promotes the kids’ speech and language, it promotes their social interaction, it helps them learn about their environment and, most of all, it allows them to have fun. It’s local and it’s free of charge, but they are unable to enjoy it as much because of the vandalism of the statues on the Gruffalo Trail. It’s a health and safety issue too because the children like to get their photos taken with the statues, but obviously they can’t do that now. There is one near the entrance and you wouldn’t even be able to identy what it is now.“We just want to make people aware of the impact it’s having on the families who are living in the community.“It’s resource that we’ve had many an enjoyable outing to, and we would like to continue to do that. It has so many benefits for community, butthis vandalism continues we’ll no be able to use it. The safety of the children is paramount to us. We would be very wary of bringing families there because of the vandalism.”Sinn Féin Councillor Séanna Walsh described those behind the destruction as “a handful of disgruntled vandals who are attacking their own community”.“Colin Glen Forest Park is a major asset for this area, the community, council and departments are investing heavily into it and we are looking at a £ million investment package for it,” he said. “The Glider has really opened up the opportunity for people and families to access the park and we have a handful of youngsters who are turning up to try and vandalise it.“The park is set to launch its latest attraction, the toboggan, soon and planning applications are in for zip lines and mountain bike trails. There are big projects planned for the park. We would ask those who behind this vandalism to stay out of it.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"it could pay to back the boks in japan","story":"World rankings are a funny thing. Apparently, Belgium are the top-rated team in world football, ahead of Brazil and the actual world champions France writes our rugby tipster Paddy Tierney.In golf, Englishman Justin Rose moved to world number one ahead of the US Masters despite his one and only major victory coming at the  US Open. With the Rugby World Cup taking centre stage over the coming weeks, it is worth pointing out that Ireland are back to being the top-rated team in the world. That’s Ireland, who are rated as   shots to lt the Webb Ellis Trophy.That’s Ireland who were obliterated - in last month’s warm-up game at Twickenham.It seems back-to-back wins over Wales at Cardf and then Dublin were enough to promote Joe Schmidt’s side back to number one. Yet, Ireland have a painful history at the Rugby World Cup and have failed to make it past the quarter-final stage in eight previous attempts. In , they topped Pool D, but were humbled - by a ravenous Argentina side in the quarters. Their pain was only lessened by the fact that hosts England failed to make it out of Pool A behind Australia and Wales. However, the  winners look a dferent proposition four years on and Eddie Jones’ side are a real threat. They are   to top a Pool C group containing France and Argentina and look set to take on either Wales or Australia, who should finish first and second in Pool D, in the quarters. Pool B looks a shoot-out between world champions New Zealand and South Africa, while Ireland’s opening game against Scotland on Sunday could well determine who tops Pool A. Hosts Japan might have something to say about that and neither side will take them for granted after they caused one of the biggest upsets in the history of the competition by beating South Africa in their opening game of the  World Cup when managed by the aforementioned Jones. Either way, Ireland will face an almighty challenge to better their horrendous World Cup record as they will face either New Zealand or South Africa in the last eight.I think both Ireland and the All Blacks will top their group meaning it will be Scotland versus New Zealand and Ireland against South Africa. While Ireland have proven that they can beat any team in the world on their day, I can’t help but feel like the World Cup arrives  months too late for Schmidt’s men, who seem to thrive when they are written off. The decision to leave Devin Toner at home has ided opinion, while captain Rory Best is now  and will retire after the World Cup. Fitness doubts continue to linger about Johnny Sextonand Keith Earls, while Robbie Henshaw has been ruled out of the Scotland game with a hamstring injury and Ireland look destined for another quarter-final exit with most firms going   on that outcome. Elsewhere, I like the look of Wales at   to top Pool D and I think they’ll end up playing France in the quarter-final. If my predictions are correct, that would leave Warren Gatland’s side taking on South Africa in the last four. Wales are one of the few teams who should match the brute force of the Springboks and I wouldn’t be surprised to see them reaching the decider.That being said, almost every betting preview I’ve read has tipped South Africa as the winner and as much as I hate hopping on the bandwagon, they looked to have assembled one hell of a squad. The other semi-final could be the game of the tournament with world champions New Zealand looking like they are on a collision course with England. Australia could throw a spanner in the works in the quarter-finals, but I’ve a gut feeling fear that England will go very close. Final Prediction Thankfully, their outright odds are   are far too skinny for me to consider the unthinkable, but they may well reach the decider with an England versus South Africa final priced at a tasty-looking  . Back in , the same countries contested the decider in France with South Africa winning - in a cagey affair at the Stade De France and I fancy a repeat of that result at the ,-capacity International Stadium in Yokohama.A certain Bryan Habana was the star of the World Cup  years ago, scoring eight tries and Cheslin Kolbe could be worth a wager in the top-tryscorer market at  . The -year-old winger scored two tries at the weekend as Rassie Erasmus’s side defeated hosts Japan in their final warm-up game -. When you consider that Ireland’s Jacob Stockdale is as low as  , Kolbe looks outstanding value while George North could also be worth an each-way punt at  .

He attended Holy Cross Boys Primary School in the district and is also a past pupil of the old St Gabriel’s school.Leaving school at , Thomas admits that the academic world was not for him and he left home soon after to work in England.“School just wasn’t for me,” he explained.“I wasn’t academic but always fascinated by art and photos in newspapers and magazines such as The Observer and Sunday Times magazines.“I left home at  and went to England. There wasn’t much work here at the time and I just wanted to get away from Belfast with all the conflict going on.“I saw so much trouble and bloodshed on the streets. My community was under siege.“You couldn’t get in or out of Ardoyne without getting checked by British Army or RUC.“I was away for a year and worked in construction on building sites in London. I decided to come back because to be honest, I missed the place.“I didn’t really like London at all. It was far too quiet compared to back home.”Thomas ed to Belfast and turned his attention back to one of his hobbies and interests he had from a young age – photography.“I wanted to pursue a career in photography,” he added.“I went to night school where I learnt the basics but I wanted a job so I could work for the community using photography.“I managed to get an interview with the founder of Andersonstown News in West Belfast, Basil McLaughlin and Máirtín Ó Muilleoir who told me they were starting a new newspaper for North Belfast.“I was familiar with the Andersonstown News and liked the fact that they provided a voice for the community in West Belfast during the Troubles.“My interview was  years ago and I haven’t looked back since.”In  years, Thomas has established himself as a well-known and talented photographer and there wouldn’t be many in North Belfast who haven’t recognised him out and about doing the job he loves.Still, much has changed over the years in North Belfast and in photography.“North Belfast has changed in some ways but many issues remain today like housing and the unfair points system.“Community relations have improved with integrated education but even today, there are still sectarian attacks and peace walls remain up iding communities.“There are still people out there fighting for peace.“As for photography, I started off developing my own black and white images before it moved on to the digital age which takes up a lot less time and I can produce more photos.”Thomas has enjoyed many successes over the years and in , showcased  years of his work in the local media at an exhibition for Féile an Phobail.Back in May of this year, he scooped four awards at the Northern Ireland Press Photographers Awards, including first place in the Inidual Study and Sports Action categories along with a Provincial Merit Award. He has been recognised multiple times over the years in the awards.“It is great to be recognised for the daily work that I do. It is great for the North Belfast News and Belfast Media Group to show we put our best efforts into the product.“It was a proud moment for me and the paper.”Away from his daily working le, Thomas may also be seen on his motorcycle on the road and he also enjoys music. Thomas is also a busy grandad to two grandchildren and has three children – two daughters and a son.Asked for any advice for any budding photographers out there, Thomas would encourage them to join a camera club – the long-running CB Camera Club on the Antrim Road who meet every Thursday night at pm.As for the future, Thomas concluded, “I am content with the job I do now – representing people in the local community.“I am proud of where I am from. I want to see all young people succeed in what they are doing.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38523601.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/_108859437_charlie.jpg","title":"i voted leave on basis of false brexit information says catholic farmer","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Thats what we voted on,\" he said.\"Nothing could be further from the truth.\"I agree % with Charlie. In hindsight, voting to leave was a big mistake.\"While the DUP remain totally opposed to any idea of a backstop, Mr Weir last week criticised the DUP for their stance, a U-turn from comments he made in the partys Westminster election campaign two years ago.\"I dont see a big problem with the backstop. In fact, the backstop would have been good and it would have meant the best of both worlds,\" he said.Mr McAteer agreed, and said his family have been left disillusioned by the political bickering and are now living in fear of what the future holds.\"My family has invested heavily in dairy farming over a number of years and Charlie is right -things dont go right over the next few weeks we could be left facing financial ruin,\" he said.\"I voted to leave, but thats a big regret now. As things progressed I supported Theresa Mays deal to leave, but the EU have stood their ground and dont look like changing unless theres something going on in the sidelines that we dont know about.\"Our family farm pays the bills and were left fearing for the future.\"When I voted to leave, and my family voted the same way, we did without being well informed.\"And what I have watched over the past two years is politicians playing with lives.\"Last week Mr Weir said he wants the backstop despite his support for % of the DUPs policies.Mr McAteer understands why.\"The backstop is the only scenario that will give us a fighting chance. You wouldnt think of driving a car without an insurance policy, but without it thats what well be doing, and the finance wont be there to keep the car on the road. Its that desperate.\"I have to say I felt sorry for Theresa May. And what we have now with Boris Johnson is someone who neither understands nor cares about what farms like ours will be facing.\"But Mr McAteer remains confident something can still be done to assist Northern Ireland farmers.\"I have to keep believing that,\" he said. \"I dont careits called the backstop, or something . I dont care how the DUP try to dress it up, but we need that insurance policy or farms across Northern Ireland will be facing financial meltdown.\"The DUP said the party remains opposed to any idea that will create a barrier between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.\"The DUP does not want to see the UK leave the European Union without a deal, but continues to work towards an agreement allowing a sensible and managed exit,\" a spokesperson said.\"The backstop seeks to facilitate north-south trade, but does so by creating barriers between Northern Ireland and Great Britain where we sell and trade three-quarters of all our goods.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38047661.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/patch.jpg","title":"get ready for the transfer tests with the belfast telegraph and transfertests co uk","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Find out when the exams are and get the advice that the schools give out, but don’t waste your energy following rumours about what the grade is. It’s better to spend your time helping your child.It’s always worth practising. Whatever schools say, it’s worth it. Children can improve their performance by  -% by careful practice.Start earlyyou can, but don’t worryyou haven’t. Ideally it is best to start preparation for the Transfer Test exam at least one year ahead. However, don’t panicyou don’t have that much time even a few weeks can make a dference.Make a simple action plan. However long you’ve got, have a clear, simple strategy. There are two key principles: . Start from your child’s present level of knowledge. . Help your child to learn from their mistakes.Motivation, motivation, motivation! You have to take your child with you on this journey. A simple rewards system can be highly effective.Don’t just practice. There’s a tendency to think that just practising one test after anther will do the trick. It’s far more important to learn from mistakes. Going through the test afterwards with your child and filling in the the gaps in learning is crucial.Stay calm, manage stress, build confidence. Don’t talk about the Transfer test all the time. Use breaks, treats and bite-sized learning sessions to keep things fresh. Be realistic about your child’s potential. Pass or fail, it’s important to try to make this process a positive one.Manage the exam day. Make sure that you have everything ready for the day, that your child tries to get a good night’s sleep, eats breakfast and gets there in good time.How and when to use our testsIt’s best to use them as real exam practice. These tests are mock exams. They are set out in a style as close as possible to the real thing – though the format will y from year to year. It is best to use them as authentic exam experience rather than for general practice. Follow the instructions and advice in the sections before starting the test.What a score means and how to boost itIt is unfortunately impossible to say that a certain score can guarantee a pass in the actual exams. However, we suggest that a score of % would be a standard to aim at. It is important not to present this to your child as a concrete benchmark though, as the best motivator for them is to see the scores going up. Here are some tried and tested tips for improvement.Go over any incorrect answers. Always go over incorrect answers so that your child can see what went wrong. To help with this process, some of our harder Maths questions are explained.Use an action planner inside. This will provide a plan for what to do next when a test has been marked.Improve basic exam technique. Work on improving speed, working efficiently – coming back to trickier questions later – and pacing within the time limit.Improve general English skills. Ensure the foundations are strong enough. Use a range of checklists to help reinforce your child’s English skills.Target what is not fully understood. The secret is not to keep blindly practising but to target the areas of English Maths that your child is weakest in. This is where crucial marks can be picked up.Once your child has completed the papers you can download the corresponding answer sheets here:Answer sheets: Monday rd SeptemberAnswer sheets: Tuesday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Wednesday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Thursday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Friday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Saturday th SeptemberIf you would like to access the answer sheets for the transfer test practice papers from April May , you can access them here.Answer sheets: Monday th AprilAnswer sheets: Tuesday th AprilAnswer sheets: Wednesday st MayAnswer sheets: Thursday nd MayAnswer sheets: Friday rd MayAnswer sheets: Saturday th May"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38519427.ece/e923f/BINARY/courts%20gavel.jpg","title":"jon tonge another divisive week in brexitland and theres no sign of fog clearing","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It ought to be a resignation issue but wont, given the proximity of a general election in late Autumn or early .Amid the noise, bluster and faux outrage, there will be a sizeable number of Labour MPs privately anxious to avoid a resumption of Parliament. Why would they want to be dragged from the fun of a party conference by the Brighton seaside to hear parliamentary arguments played on a repeat loop for the last year  While it is unlikely that the Supreme Court, should it find against the Government, will determine the date Parliament should resume, the pressure for an immediate restoration would be huge. That could take a wrecking ball to the Conservatives gathering in Manchester at the end of this month.In truth, Parliament prorogued is probably as effective as Parliament sitting. MPs wasted the last year voting against all options. The Liberal Democrats have now decided that all options are off now, anyway. They will simply cancel Brexit. This from a party that supported a referendum.Any chance of a deal will owe precious little to Westminster, where posturing and pantomime had long displaced any serious consideration of the issues at stage. Instead, progress will be a product of often fractious but, of late, somewhat more measured exchanges involving the UK and Irish governments, the EU and the DUP.Arlene Fosters party made a signicant concession in accepting all-Ireland - in effect, EU - alignment in agriculture and food, butthat is the limit to the DUPs movement, there is still huge distance to travel. More than % of cross-border trade is in other sectors and the demand for the backstop remains for those aspects.There is a reasonable chance that the backstop is re-labelled as it is politically toxic - but a renaming is not a dispelling. Resolving the issues will require much more moderation and considerable fudging.Assurances might be given to the DUP that any checking of goods travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will be subject to, at most, token checks. A revival of Stormont could be talked up as part of a triple-lock on any EU expansion of regulations covering all-Ireland trade, involving the Westminster and Dublin parliaments and the Northern Ireland Assembly. Some concessions to the technocratic approach to customs and regulations checks offered by the Alternative Arrangements Commission might be forthcoming. The sum of modest parts might be sufficient to claim victory in modying the Withdrawal Agreementor upholding all its principles .The DUP needs a win to take to its own party conference at the end of October, which, like Sinn Feins Ard Fheis three weeks later, might take on the appearance of a pre-election rally. Given the DUPs long-standing opposition to the backstop, the party needs to show how it made a substantial contribution to its modication. Bilateral discussions between Arlene Foster and the Taoiseach indicate that neither party wants to be responsible for a no-deal failure. Leo Varadkar has got most of his electorate onside in the blame game. It might be harder for Arlene Foster at an election, even allowing that the DUPs support has held up perfectly well in the three years since the EU referendum.The endgame will probably not become clear until the European Council meeting in mid-October. It may be autumn but it is neither mellow nor fruitful. Just very misty, with little sign of the fog clearing.Jon Tonge is Professor of Politics at the University of Liverpool.

In addition her mentor, dad James, also works for the same company.She said: \"I live on a small farm at Craigantlet and have grown up around machinery. \"In the past I have also worked on vegetable farms and I currently milk cows at the weekends, so I am not afraid of hard work.\"We have a small five-tonne excavator on the farm and I drive it a lot. \"I often wondered what it would be like to drive the bigger excavators but never had the chance - until now.\"With no real experience in operating the larger machinery, Carrie knew it would be tough finding a job in the industry as not many companies would be willing to take her on.\"Getting that experience required by companies in order for them to employ you is a tough challenge,\" said Carrie. \"I went and took some training courses that qualied me with the excavator licence, enabling me to operate machines at  tonnes above and below.\"This involved both theory training and practical training and means I am qualied to operate machinery on a site.\"With this to hand I started looking around to seeI could get work and was very fortunate that McCormack Demolition was looking for operators and decided to give me a chance.\" Carrie said she \"couldnt be happier\" and that she receives lots of support from her colleagues. \"I work five days a week for McCormack Demolition and still milk cows at the weekends. \"I guess all that experience accumulated on the farm driving tractors and a small excavator has paid off,\" she added.She continued: \"At the moment I am working on a site near Banbridge operating a -tonne JCB JSXD with a pulveriser attachment on the jib.\"This is being used to crush up concrete on the site to remove the metal reinforcing for recycling.\"I absolutely adore driving the big excavators and am very thankful to McCormack Demolition for giving me the opportunity to prove myself.\"Eamon Deery is the contracts manager at McCormack Demolition and was full of praise for Carrie.\"Carrie is a very skilled operator and is very capable of handling even our biggest excavators,\" he said. \"Based on the knowledge of how good she was with machinery, we decided to give her a go and that has worked out well.\"Young people need to be given a chance, otherwise how will they ever gain experience  \"We believe Carrie is the only female operator working for a demolition company in Northern Ireland or in the Republic of Ireland.\"The crew has taken her in well. \"We operate an equal opportunities working environment with zero tolerance to any conflicts within the workforce.\"He added: \"Hopefully this recognition for Carrie will encourage other female operators to come forward to companies.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest updates","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Arabs believe the law codies discrimination.Though the Arab parties are still expected to stay out of Mr Gantz’s future government, their endorsement reflects a growing desire of Israel’s large Arab minority to take a more active role in shaping the country.Writing in The New York Times, Ayman Odeh, the leader of the Joint List, argued that his move should end Mr Netanyahu’s political career and provide a watershed moment for Israel’s Arab minority.“If the centre-left parties of Israel believe that Arab Palestinian citizens have a place in this country, they must accept that we have a place in its politics,” he wrote.“There is no shared future without the full and equal participation of Arab Palestinian citizens.”Mr Netanyahu reacted by saying: “As we warned, the Arab parties that oppose Israel as a Jewish and democratic state and glory terrorists recommended Gantz for prime minister.”"},{"url":null,"title":"iran tells west to leave persian gulf amid heightened tension","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Tragically, Dessie was killed in a car crash in .“Dessie was the best of us. Him and Brendan were the two runners. Dessie was a great runner at school and then at Sparta where he was captain. He was a very popular fella.“As well as being a great runner he was a great captain. He looked after his charges very well.“Brendan and his we both ran for Northern Ireland and were both very good athletes. Dessie ran shorter distances whereas Brendan ran anything from km right through to the marathon.”Harry was somewhat of a late starter when it came to running, his brothers talked him into it at a time he was overweight in the early s. About a year later he competed in his first marathon in Dublin.He was one of the founding members of Foyle Valley Athletics Club in . At the time they were told it wouldn’t survive six months, but  years later it now has approximately  members.It is an “all ability club” with dferent groups meeting weekly at Templemore Sports Complex and in the Waterside. “Anybody who wants to run will get the opportunity butyou don’t want to compete you can join to keep fit. We like people to compete but don’t put anyone under pressure to do so.”“I, to be perfectly frank, wasn’t brought in for my athletic expertise, I’m not saying I was useless but would’ve been average, but that fits into the ethos of the club.”Personal bestDespite his modesty, Harry has run impressive times over the years, recording a sub--hour marathon in Belfast. That is no mean feat, it requires dedicated training, and, on the day you have to run an average of around : per mile across the . mile course.Harry recalled his brother Dessie spurring him on as he neared the finish line that day, sadly, it would be the last time he saw him alive.“It was the st of May  and Dessie was killed ten days later on the th. I hadn’t enough long runs coming into it and at the latter stages I was absolutely out of it, really struggling.“Dessie was there at the  mile mark and, in Belfast I don’t know anybody, but I heard this voice shouting ‘Harry, get your head up out of your chest! You’ve come through  mile in : you can break  hours but you’re going to have to work for it’.“It just gave me enough encouragement to keep going. He came round to see me at the finish line. “He had just moved to Belfast and wanted me to see his new house but I had come with a crowd of boys on a train and said I’d be up in a couple of weeks to spend the weekend, to do a bit of running and play some snooker.“But he was killed ten days later.”Marty Gallaghergoogletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshTwenty years later, Marty Gallagher, a young prodigy of Harry’s, was killed in similarly tragic circumstances.Next month fty members of Foyle Valley will take part in this year’s Dublin marathon in memory of Marty who died after being hit by a car on the Racecourse Road while ing home on Halloween night.Martin was -years-old and it will be his th anniversary this year.Reflecting, Harry said: “Marty Gallagher was a lovely young fella, very modest, unassuming, and comes from such a nice family.“He was a member of the club and would’ve been one of my prodigies when he first came into running, I would’ve nurtured him, but then he got to the stage where he was too quick for me and I couldn’t stay with him. I’d have needed a bike to keep up with him.”Harry has been fortunate to avoid serious injury over the years aside from breaking his ankle in . Doctors warned that without an operation he would have chronic arthritis and would never run again.“You learn to live with the fact that on the long runs you’re going to be in pain. I was lucky to get away with running the Derry marathon this year.”After a more recent x-ray, a doctor warned thathe continued at his present rate he would need a new ankle.“I wear an ankle support and patella support, but you’re not going to let stuff like that stop you,” he added.CamaraderieSpecial club memories include a time when members competed in the All Ireland Marathon Championship in Mallow Co. Cork, in . They won the senior marathon and veteran’s championships.As winners they had the honour of hosting the competition in Derry the following year. It was a very successful event which stands out as one of the clubs highlights.Harry finished second in the veterans team and his brother Brendan competed well in the senior team.Looking back at other fond memories, Harry cited the Walled City Marathon in , which was the first marathon to be held in Derry for many years.“I thoroughly enjoyed it, along with the London marathon, I’ve done four of them, and the Great North Run, which I’ve done twice.“But the club itself, the camaraderie is just unbelievable. It’s a social outlet more than anything . In terms of the people, not just at Foyle Valley but running in general, there are very few people I’ve met through running that I could say I didn’t like, they’re all good hearted, good natured people, and help you in any way they can. They’re gracious in defeat and generous in victory.“Foyle Valley has a great family atmosphere,someone is training for a marathon they will always train with you and help you through. That’s part of the ethos of the club.”Fitness has become an essential component of many people’s lives as experts regularly expound on the benefits to both physical and mental health.Therefore, the emergence of new clubs, and the introduction of couch to k runs, has been “one of the best” things to happen in the city in Harry’s view. “The people behind these clubs love their running and are so friendly. They got people out who never would’ve necessarily been interested in running, and now they’re doing half marathons and marathons - that’s fabulous.”"},{"url":null,"title":"department weighing medical school options","story":"The Department of Health is assessing the cost-effectiveness of locating a Medical School in Derry and said any final decision will require ministerial sign off.The Medical School forms part of Derry’s City Deal proposals and as such the local council is engaging with the UK government to see “ this project would be eligible for UKG funding under the City Deals programme or the Integrated Education Fund.”The Ulster University has been for some time considering the development of a Graduate Entry Medical Schoolto be located in Derry and this project proposal features heavily in the Derry City  Strabane District Council’s economic regeneration plans for the region.With the support of the Local Council the University partners have been engaging with a number of NI Departments in an effort to progress this proposal.A spokesperson for UU confirmed that as part of its latest business case it aims to have its first academic year of enrolments for the GEMS in  .The Northern Ireland Department of Healthis acutely aware of the pressures on the medical workforce across Health and Social Careand its key role in leading the transformation of services set out in Delivering Together.Accordingly, DoH commissioned a Medical School Places Review, led by Professor Keith Gardiner, to determine the optimum number of medical school places that Northern Ireland requires per year. His report, published on  January , raises challenging, long-term, strategic and cross-cutting questions with major financial implications.Amongst other issues, it recommends expanding medical training places by at least  per year, potentially costing up to an additional £m per year when fully implemented. This report is a key consideration of UU in putting forward its proposal for a medical school in Derry.While DoH has been assisting UU in the development of its Outline Business Casefor a Graduate Entry Medical School at Magee Campus, this is separate from any decision on medical student expansion in Northern Ireland. Feedback was provided on  July  to the fourth iteration of the OBC.Any commissioning of additional medical places for Northern Ireland must address comprehensively the full range of available options, with a particular focus on the assessment of value for money and affordability for health and social care, the report says.“For example, rather than simply expanding medical student numbers, it will be important to explore lower-cost measures likely to increase the supply of medics over the short-term and which enhance and maximise the signicant investment currently being made in undergraduate medical education.“DoH is developing a business case to consider these matters.

The door is now wide open for an independent higher education institution for the North West.It provides us with a once-in-a-letime opportunity for the city-region, as long as we are prepared to grasp it. It is now almost  years since the campaign for a Derry university first began.Specically, the report raises a number of questions, which must be answeredwe are to redress what parliamentarians are now referring to as ‘the last-remaining civil rights issue’.These include:What legislation will be necessary to ensure that the new Derry-centred university will transcend both sides of the border, as regards teaching provision, RD, student intake and administration What legislation will be required from Dublin, London and Europe, to ensure revenue funding for a standalone cross-border university in the North West If a HE provider from Southern Ireland, where student fees are lower, were to become a partner in the new NW university, would fees here also be lower Is there any impediment to the National University of Ireland applying for a Charter to establish a university whose main campus is Derry  The report suggests that the institution seeking degree-awarding powers should be ‘physically operating’ in Northern Ireland. Can Derry Strabane Council be the anchor ‘operating’ partner, with NUI as the provider Can an accredited further education provider, such as the North West Regional College, apply for degree-awarding powers  What processes must it complete Derry Strabane Council is applying directly to the United Kingdom Governmentfor funding for a medical school for the North West. What action is council taking as regards applying to ‘UKG’, and other governments, for funding for an independent university for the North West Can Derry Strabane Council now operate its proposed Medical School with a new HE providerat Magee Will central government now increase the MaSN Cap, which restricts the number of HE students in the North, to accommodate the development of a new university in the North West Can central government ensure that the new independent NW university stays viable by ensuring that the minimum cap for the new institution remains permanently at ,  In February , the Department for the Economy, wrote to UU asking for ‘its rationale for locating additional higher education places in the Magee Campus’. Seven months on, UU still had not replied to its most signicant funder.

Alongside that are centres of innovation and excellence in data analyticsand robotics and automationand a Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellence .Julian Smiths report says the proposals to expand Magee had signicant funding consequences from a capital infrastructure perspective, approximately £m, and from a resource funding perspective.The proposal would require Higher Education in NI to be placed on a sustainable footing, comparable with England, from which expansion would take place.According to the report, there would also be, as with any requested expansion or increase to student numbers, resource grant consequences of funding the proposed additional places at UU and NWRC, and associated student support costs, circa £m.\"The £m capital cost was highly indicative and based on an assumed cost per square metre per student.\"The Department for the Economyundertook initial work to determine how it would look at the case,there was an agreement on how the sector as a whole could be sustainably funded, as any expansion in student numbers would not make sense without this in place,\" it said.In February , DfE wrote to, and is awaiting a response from, UU requesting that an update be made to the case, according to the report.DfE asked for a more accurate assessment of capital need, which was \"very theoretical\" in the original proposal and created a signicant cost requirement. It wants a review of the number and subject level mix of additional students required to ensure an underpinning alignment with graduate postgraduate economic need in subject areas proposed.Furthermore, the department requested information around phasing of the project to assessthere are \"more suitable break points\" in the proposal and a potential to scale any expansion both in terms of student numbers and capital development.And sought the \"rationale\" for locating additional higher education places in the Magee Campus, as opposed to other geographical locations with further and more detailed explanation in relation to sub-regional economic benefits.This information will be critical to enabling a strategic approach to HE provision and in feeding into any final business case that might be put forward for this proposal, it concluded.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"magherafelt based actor blown away role movie linked jurassic world franchise","story":"By Cathal McGuiganA Magherafelt-based actor has said he was “blown away” when he learned he had been cast in Battle at Big Rock, a short film thats part of the Jurassic World franchise.Chris Finlaysonplays American biker Greg in the film and aims to build on this role and some experience as an extra to land more acting roles.Battle at Big Rock was posted to Youtube on Sunday and had been viewed more than three million times by Thursday evening. Starring alongside Chris in the film were André Hollandand Natalie Martinez .Scottish-born Chrismoved to Magherafelt in , where he worked as a personal trainer. He said that his acting career really began when the opportunity arose to work as an extra on Game of Thrones.As well as appearing as a member of the Nights Watch in three seasons of the show, hes also featured in Superman drama Krypton and filmed sword-fighting scenes for the film Viking Destiny, which is available on Netflix.He first heard about the Jurassic World role when a friend tagged him on Facebook in a post from Louise Kiely Casting, which gave away very few details about the role.“They were looking for a biker with a flawless American accent. I just thought Id go for it and see what happens,” he said.Chris said that when it came to the day of the audition in Dublin he was “sweating bullets” and almost didnt go through with it.“Just as I was walking up to the door, I sort of freaked out. I went past it and I said to myself I cant do this just because of the nerves, because I wanted it so badly,” he said.“Then I was thinking to myself, youve come this far, you need to do this. I genuinely thought I didnt stand a chance as I knew Id be up against actors with more experience.”“I went and got myself two pints of Guinness, settled my nerves and went back. I was happy when I came out and thought Id done well but I thought it would just be good experience and that I wasnt going to get it.”A few weeks later the casting agent emailed Chris to let him know that the role was his, but he still didnt know exactly what he had been cast in.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I thought it was probably some low-budget thing, but I was happy to get the experience and a few lines. To me, that would be a start at least.”Chris found a few clues about the production by looking up Jurassic World  director Colin Trevorrow on IMDB, but it was only at a costume fitting that he fully realised how big an opportunity he had been given.“They werent even allowed to say it but it was so secret,” he said.“One of the girls said to me that all they tell could me was that it rhymes with schminosaurs and I just knew. I was just blown away because Ive always loved Jurassic Park.”The eight-minute film was filmed in January in Co Wicklow, which means that Chris is happy to finally be able to talk about the role hes had to keep under wraps for months.“The weirdest thing is just seeing my name in the credits. Thats one of the most surreal things,” he said.Chris said that he hopes to find an agent in the near future to help him land more roles. He believes that a talent for accents hes developed from a young age can help him secure some great parts.“Accents have always been something that comes naturally to me. Even when I was only about four or five years old, I would talk to myself in the mirror and try out lots of dferent accents.”This skill came in handy when Chris played redneck biker Greg with an American accent so accurate that the production crew assumed it was his regular speaking voice.“Most of the crew on the set thought I was an American actor,” Chris said.“It wasnt until Id done my first scene and I asked someone what time it was, that they realised I wasnt an American. They couldnt believe it when I said Id just came down from Magherafelt.”"},{"url":null,"title":"ulster university responds questions regarding city deal funds medical school","story":"The Derry News posed a number of questions to Ulster Universityover the continued uncertainty on the establishment of a Medical School at Magee College.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshFirstly, we asked does UU have any update or response regarding the medical school and concerns raised by David Sterling around the need for ongoing funding which UU is not prepared to invest   A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"Following cross-party political and health and social care support in  for Ulster University’s Graduate Entry Medical School, the University has continued to proactively develop the project, working closely with the Department and other relevant partners. Our responses to any remaining clarications within the Graduate Entry Medical School business case were submitted to the Department of Health at the start of July, following prompt and close engagement with the Department and other relevant partners. Our proposed first academic year of projected enrolments outlined within the updated business case is  .“As the Department of Health has previously confirmed that any decision on funding can only be made by Ministers, the University is not actively recruiting medical students as yet for  entry until that decision on funding can be reached.· If funding was confirmed, all other elements of the proposal for our medical undergraduate degree programme have been firmly on track including continued progress with the GMC, clinical placement opportunities and the development of a curriculum to meet the needs of healthcare locally.“We value the continued support of all those who share our vision for medical education and we continue to work with the General Medical Council, St George’s University of London and local clinicians and partners building on our existing leadership in medical and healthcare provision to take forward graduate entry medical education for Northern Ireland.\"What does UU say in response to local councillors representatives who have claimed that UU has neglected the Magee campus for decades and should not be given money as part of the City Deal but should instead invest its own money in Derry   A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"Ulster University continues to invest in the Magee campus, most recently with the state-of-the-art £m teaching block which signals our ambition for higher education in the city, already enhancing campus le and paving the way for enhanced future capacity at Magee.    This and other investment priorities for students have resulted in a very strong performance for the Magee campus across all elements of the  National Student Survey, reflecting the very positive reaction from our students to these recent investments in University le at Magee.  With all four faculties of the University represented on the Magee campus – across health sciences, arts and humanities, business and computing and engineering, we are pushing boundaries and breaking new ground in emerging sectors as a progressive university, shortlisted for the prestigious Times Higher Education University of the Year Award, .“Our contribution to the City Deal opportunity is a signicant step forward in our collective opportunity to realise the full ambitions of this vibrant university city.  Our City Deals proposal will see us apply our expertise to help maximize the city’s potential in this unparalleled opportunity to boost economic growth and prosperity.  In our continued collaboration with industry partners, we look forward to driving innovation in personalised medicine, cognitive analytics, robotics and automation, leading to both new research posts and learning opportunities for additional students.  The proposed riverfront innovation hub will build upon the expertise of our first data analytics Institute, opened in  and headquartered at Magee campus, and which cemented our reputation as a global leader in this field. Also integral to the City Deal remains our commitment to establishing a Graduate Entry Medical School in a bid to address the challenges of a healthcare system at breaking point.   City Deal

across world class research and progressive student learning works hard for the benefit of all in the city region. The City Deal bid has education, innovation, job creation and skills development at its core and each of these priorities are also central to our work across both teaching and research.  We are therefore a natural fit and a committed partner in this ambitious bid.  A continued

Shea Croskery raced through moments later and drove for goal, but saw his effort go wide and Dundrumrsquos relief was palpable.Instead of going eight points behind, Dundrum did well to re-group and points from Aidan Fegan and a second Venney free cut the deficit back to three points.Oran Flanagan sent over the next three points in the second quarter of the game with Glavin doing the same for Dundrum. Garland and Croskery also raised the white flag with their strikes to leave the lsquoFin with a half-time lead of - to -.Fegan got the first point of the second half for Dundrum with three minutes gone and a third free kick of the game was landed by Venney by the end of the third quarter.While the lsquoFin had not yet scored, it wasnrsquot for the want of trying as a few opportunities were missed and Dundrum lsquokeeper Eamon King pulled off a superb double save, the first from Croskery and the follow up from Chris Doran.Oran Flanagan was having a good game and he sent over his fourth point of the match and a superb effort from Shane McCann restored the lsquoFinrsquos four point half-time advantage with ten minutes remaining.Dundrum continued to threaten, but other than two more excellent points from their standout player Kyle Glavin, the lsquoFin defence held strong and kept the dangerous duo of Venney and Fegan scoreless the remainder of the game.Dundrum half forward Fegan was sent to the line after getting a second yellow in the final throes of the game.

The upgrading of the pitch is certainly sustainable financially, given the amount of usage it would get.ldquoWe have lost  teams to other leagues in the past few years and they have all cited poor facilities as their main reason for moving to play in the the Lisburn or South Belfast Leagues, he added.Mr Torney said it was essential that proper facilities were put in place to enable the league to avoid weekly postponements of games.ldquoWe are left every year with a fixture congestion because of postponements and in order to arrest the haemorrhaging of clubs from the league we must address this issue immediately.The league are being supported by South Down MP Chris Hazzard, who has called on Newry, Mourne and Down Council to ldquofinally deliver fit for purpose pitches for the local community in Downpatrick.He continued: ldquoThe current provision of sports pitches at Dunleath Park is nothing short of a disgrace.ldquoDunleath Park is used extensively by the Downpatrick Youth Football League with hundreds of young footballers playing each weekend, but yet againthis week, parts of the pitches have been closed to the public as raw sewage has come to the surface.ldquoIt is an absolute shame that in the shadow of our fantastic new leisure centre here in Downpatrick our local young people are expected to make do with substandard pitches that not only flood for most of the winter months, but are regularly polluted with raw sewage.Mr Hazzard believes that Downpatrick deserves much better treatment.ldquoAs the county town, Downpatrick deserves to have the very best in local sports provision, and that simply isnrsquot the case at the moment.ldquoIt is deeply disappointing that so many of our young footballers are left to travel to Lisburn and Belfast each weekend to play football. That must not be allowed to continue.Mr Hazzard added: ldquoWhilst there is no getting away from the fact that Dunleath Park is in a flood plain area, I would have sympathy with local sports clubs that feel that this is too easily put up as a hurdle to any investment, and that the council should actively consider a range of solutions in order to deliver suitable facilities.ldquoI want to thank those local sports clubs and Downpatrick Youth League representatives who continue to work tirelessly in order to provide local sporting opportunities for our young people and I will now be making representation to senior council management in order to make all their voices heard..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th September 2019 Castlewellan.jpg","title":"Castlewellan forest cycle in the park family event in aid of Knockevin Special School  ","story":"ALL roads lead to Castlewellan Forest Park this Sunday for a special event to raise money for Knockevin Special School in Downpatrick and celebrate the benefits of cycling for everyone.The lsquocycle in the parkrsquo event is being organised by the schoolrsquos Parent Staff Association to raise funds to help purchase new bikes for pupils to help them experience nature and the great outdoors.Sundayrsquos all ability event mdash which runs from am until pm ndash is being billed as a celebration of cycling and will have something for families and special needs adventurers, hard core mountain bikers, club riders, children and young people.The event is being hosted by the Kilmegan Velo Cycling Club with its chairman, Sean Warnock, inviting all cyclists to make their way to the forest park for the event.He said: ldquoThe aim is to get families and friends to experience cycling in a safe setting but full of adventure and we have events for all abilities.ldquoThere will be family trail quests, agility skills for kids, a full time-trial on the red trails, special needs bikes and a Sunday club fuel stop.

Title deeds, usually the easiest of documents to trace, have become impossible to track down.Three people are laying claim to the pier alone and a legal row is pending about whether a contract was broken over the sale of pier some time ago.Against this backcloth, Down council official have been trying to bring the harbour into public ownership since the publication of the Governmentrsquos cash-help promise in July . Before then they had already spent four years attempting to trace owners.This week councillors decided to end their six-year search and apply for vesting mdash a statutory power which enables a Government department to buy land compulsorily, despite the wishes of the owner.But they were warned by council administrative officer, Mr Owen OrsquoConnor, that it would be a dficult vesting order and he could not guarantee that the whole of the inner bay of Killough would be acquired before December.The last-ditch attempt to beat the deadline was sparked off by Downpatrick councillor, Mr John Ritchie, who has been trying to push the council into buying the harbour since . On Monday he was clearly angry that time was running out.POLITICS mdash A suggestion that South Down MP, Enoch Powell, should accompany a Down council deputation to Stormont was kicked out by SDLP councillors this week.The suggestion was surprisingly made by industry minister, Mr Giles Shaw, who has agreed to meet a council deputation to discuss industrial affairs in Down district.In a letter to councillors, Mr Shaw suggested that Mr Powell should be advised of the meeting and,convenient, should accompany the council delegation.SDLP councillor, Mr Eddie McGrady, described the ministerrsquos decision as ldquoodd and said he had never come across anything like it before in his  years in government affairs.He thought the minister was ldquousurping the councilrsquos decision to form its own deputation and he believed the motive behind the suggestion was not altogether altruistic.He told councillors: ldquoWhat is happening is that a new precedent is being proposed to us. A corporate body has almost been directed to include a political representative on its deputation.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ministers have attacked our independent judges. The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Their free dog welfare workshops, delivered as part of the Charity’s ‘Be Dog Smart’ campaign, enhance the National Curriculum and seek to provide children between the ages of seven and  years with the knowledge and understanding they need to act responsibly and safely around dogs in their homes and those they may see out and about.Each workshop benefits pupils by involving a pretend dog as its focus, with the aim of developing compassion and consideration for all living beings.Not only do children - whether dog owners or not - learn how to behave safely around dogs, they also learn all about the commitment involved in owning a dog through a creative and interactive learning experience.Last year, Cathy Clyde, Dogs Trust’s NI Education and Community Officer delivered workshops to , children. This year they are on track to improve on this number yet again. With the growing success of the ‘Be Dog Smart’ campaign, Dogs Trust now employs  education and community officers across the UK to provide workshops in their designated regions.Cathy said: “Through debate and discussion, our responsible dog ownership workshops encourage learners to embody important values around dog ownership such choosing the right breed or type of dog for your le style, as well as understanding that dogs are a lelong commitment and not a disposable commodity. I would welcome the opportunity to work with schools in the area and encourage them to get in touch, as pupils really do get a lot out of the workshops as do their dogs.”For more information about ‘Be Dog Smart’ visit www.bedogsmart.org.ukFor more information or to book a ‘Be Dog Smart’ workshop, contact Cathy Clyde on    or email cathy.clyde@dogstrust.org.ukFuneral details for Francis McCarville

A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"new  bedroom boutique hotel planned for belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by John Mulgrew A listed Belfast building could become a new hotel and restaurant as part of wider plans for a £m revamp of the city centre. Tribeca Belfast, formerly Royal Exchange, will see UK developer Castlebrooke redevelop much of the north side of the city centre. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. As part of the revised plans it wants to turn the listed former Assembly Rooms building at the corner of North Street and Waring Street into a new -bedroom hotel, with a restaurant and bars. That would involve knocking down part of the newer extension to the building, including the rear part of the former Northern Bank and the adjacent - North Street to “accommodate the new extension to form the proposed boutique hotel”. “The proposals for the existing building are similar in scope to that which was included as part of the extant approval. It is proposed to conservatively repair the existing historic fabric of the former Northern Bank,” a design statement says. “A key feature of the proposed extension is that the interface with the rearelevation of the existing listed bank building will be improved by setting back the footprint of the proposed extension so that the north west corner of the original building is readable.” The scheme includes the re-use and adaptation of the existing building as well as an extension on the footprint of the existing s extension on North Street. The extension will be set over five floors, with a rooftop bar, while upper floors are set back with metal cladding to the facades to “reduce the overall massing of the building and reflect the roofing materials or upper story treatment of surrounding buildings”. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. This summer the developer ran a fresh public consultation amid revised plans for the scheme, which included signicantly reducing a huge -storey building to around , retaining additional facades and dropping plans for an underground car park.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/da1.jpg","title":"clarity telecom building telecoms from the ground up","story":"Posted on Monday September  by Ulster Business Clarity Telecom helps businesses of all shapes and sizes develop their communications needs from the ground up, and is now rolling out its fast-growing cloud software across the UK and Ireland. Founder and managing director David Whelan speaks to Ulster Business about a business which boasts the right tools for the job David Whelan’s vision and mantra for what is now one of the leading telecoms businesses is clear – telecommunications services are only as good as the foundations on which they are built, with engineering front and centre. He’s the entrepreneur behind Clarity Telecom – a successful Belfast-based full-service telecommunications solutions company with almost  years under its belt, helping develop top-end connectivity – including lines, calls, mobile, broadband and cloud software – for businesses across Ireland and the UK. And for David, telecoms is all about engineering at the core of finding the best comprehensive solution to its customers, having the right tools for the job, and having world class people. For Clarity Telecom, it’s about developing a bespoke system for companies, focusing on engineering from day one. Since its inception in , Clarity Telecom has grown to have a greater engineering capability than any other independent telecommunications company in Northern Ireland, and is now rolling out its leading byphone VoIPsystem throughout the UK and Ireland. David also says through Clarity Telecom and its burgeoning byphone technology, the company could double revenues in the next three years as well as growing its workforce. “The phone network stops at a plug in the wall and from that point on, you have to provide the infrastructure and management,” David says. “What we do is focus on the engineering. It’s all about how well it works and adapts to your business. “By focusing on that we are looking at the way things are being built, and we can then get insights on how we can change and improve things.” Led by engineering, the Clarity team is driving change within the telecoms industry ensuring client infrastructure is fit for purpose and for the future. That starts with assessing a business’s needs, making sure the network is suitable, reviewing the workforce needs and bandwidth requirements. From there, Clarity Telecom can develop a bespoke solution – from cabling, to switching, cloud services, routing and phone systems. Clarity Telecom now has a team of  staff – a third of whom work directly within the engineering side of the business. But that number could grow further still, as the company expands its business across Northern Ireland, and develops its byphone technology. The company developed its subsidiary, Voxbit, in  – specically to design engineering solutions. And through that has come one of its most successful products, byphone. A simple to use VoIP , byphone is a drag and drop system that allows users to configure their own phone set up suited to the exact needs of the organisation and enables a range of analysis tools that can help business owners drive up efficiencies. “In  as VoIP started coming along, I realised that was a signicant opportunity,” David says. “Where the communications industry is going is into the cloud. It’s going from traditional storage within buildings, into something in the cloud. The traditional telephone systems are evolving. “We started making a series of innovations surrounding cloud technology. We realised you can make it simpler – we were asking ourselves, can you make it work without a manual, for example. “If you can, in the same way as Apple’s iPhone made things easier for users, people will start using the services. It’s about making everyone’s le easier. “The end user wants to be able to use the system easily, from managing their telephone number, to having access to voicemail. It’s about the ‘power of simple’. “We now have around  resellers for the byphone system in the UK, and we are looking at trebling or quadrupling those sales,” he said. One of Clarity Telecom’s customers is Mid  East Antrim Borough Council. The firm was tasked with bringing together the complex communication needs of the new ‘super council’ following the amalgamation in . “With bringing three councils together, one of the main problems was having a single phone number that people could call. If you have numerous sites, spread across three council areas, that would involve a lot of rip and replace,” David says. “But we gave them one telephone number and then managed the routing to all those bits of equipment across the council areas.” Hotel giant Andras House – which operates seven hotels and , rooms in Belfast including the Crowne Plaza at Shaw’s Bridge and the new Hampton Hilton – is also another major customer. “Businesses trust us to be able to provide the engineering solutions in order for them to run their companies,” David says. So, why should a business consider Clarity Telecom for its crucial and comprehensive connectivity needs  David says Clarity is all about improving how companies interact with their customers – making it easier, and thus, improving revenue and sales. “As you manage your telephone connections you become better at dealing with your customers – you become more efficient at dealing with them, and they will have a better experience. It’s about improving customer contact. “As a business you are able to do a lot more, such as listening to call recordings, access to statistics and using data which will help manage that contact, as well as saving on costs and making your business more efficient. “What solution depends on your business. That is where we come along. We never put a system in without doing a full engineering visit.” Some of the connectivity includes the ability to connect landline with mobile phones, call forwarding and being able to access voicemails as digital recordings, by phone or computer. “When companies deal with us, they can come along and say ‘this is what we are trying to do’, and we are able to work the engineering and infrastructure, before then providing the services,” David says. “It’s also about fighting against the view that it’s all about price. Yes, you have to be competitive, but you need the right infrastructure. For example,a shop loses connectivity for two days, then they lose two days of sales, simply because they don’t have the back-up for the credit card payment system. “It’s about getting businesses to think about the infrastructure and all of the issues. It’s not just about how cheap you can make a call. It’s about how customers can engage with your business – and we are at the heart of making that happen.” For further information, contact Clarity Telecom on    or visit www.clarityteleView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/glyn_121.jpg","title":"ni business leaders to outline major job creation plan at downing street and westminster","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland industry leaders will outline their plans to create tens of thousands of new jobs to Downing Street, hundreds of MPs and company leaders today as part of a major business delegation visiting London. Trade NI – the new alliance between Hospitality Ulster, Manufacturing NI and Retail NI – is unveiling a -year plan called ‘Vision ’ at a Westminster reception on Wednesday afternoon, as the UK’s political system enters its most volatile period in a generation. With just weeks before the UK is expected to leave the EU, more than  guests are confirmed to attend the event that will be addressed by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Julian Smith MP and the shadow Secretary of State, Tony Lloyd MP. Business leaders are also due to attend a later event at Downing Street, and a lunch at the Irish Embassy. Trade NI’s “transformative economic plan” will set out key policy priorities that have the potential to create , jobs and to make Northern Ireland a high growth economy. In a joint statement, Trade NIs Colin Neill , Stephen Kellyand Glyn Roberts , said: “Northern Ireland is facing a huge challenge as it struggles politically and economically with a growth forecast of around % or below. This is simply not good enough and we can’t sit idly by and let events overtake us. We must break the cycle of limited economic growth.” “Our three organisations represent most of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland. Therefore, a louder voice needs to be heard on their behalf so that they don’t suffer in the wake of the local political issues. We want a reboot of the economic policy of Northern Ireland, in order to benefit our economy and safeguard our growing business community.” “We need to be bold and ambitious about creating % or even % growth over the next few years, but that requires decision makers to be pressed into action and a series of policy and legislative decisions to be taken and driven through. Our local economy and businesses have taken a back seat and we simply cannot afford that situation any longer.” “Our Vision  document sets out a bold new ten-year plan for creating , new jobs and creating a high growth economy. We want to make Northern Ireland the best place in the UK and Ireland to shop, socialise, locate and start a business “The Vision  plan sets out to create a better ing business environment and attract further inward investment that will lead to a revitalised economy taking on the challenge in turbulent times.” “We want to make Northern Ireland an eco-system of innovation.Trade NI is keen to work with all business organisations, chambers of commerce, trade unions and voluntary sector representation to create a new progressive partnership for change in Northern Ireland.” And Kevin Kingston, chief executive of Danske Bank, sponsor of Trade NI’s Westminster reception, said: Danske Bank is proud to be one of the main sponsors of Trade NI’s Westminster reception. Trade NI is seizing the initiative and ensuring that the voice of the local business community is being heard loud and clear at a time of upheaval and uncertainty.” “The vibrancy of the Northern Ireland private sector is imperative to the strength of our economy and we need to ensure that local businesses are protected and well positioned to be able to compete globally in the post-Brexit environment.” Emma Gilthorpe, executive director, Heathrow Expansion, said: “Heathrow is delighted to support the launch of Trade NI, echoing Heathrow’s commitment to connect Northern Ireland to global growth and to share the benefits of an expanded Heathrow with the businesses and communities of Northern Ireland.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/dm11.jpg","title":"tech entrepreneur named catalysts innovation founder","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by Ulster Business A top tech entrepreneur has been named as Catalyst’s Innovation Founder for  by a  of leading judges.
