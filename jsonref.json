It was quite an eye-opener.\u0027The TV project which instigated this embroidery class is an eye-opener all round. Back In Time For School is effectively a big living history lesson. In the BBC show — based on a previous format where families undertook to live in homes from different historical periods — a group of teenage boys and girls are asked to turn back time with their schooling.Over six episodes, the 20 teenagers and four teachers, from schools across the Midlands, follow lessons just as children in the Victorian era would have done, then progress to Edwardian times, and so on, right up to the Nineties.          History lesson: Presenters Sara Cox and Polly Russell are keeping an eye over proceedings over the six episode seriesThe result? We now have a clutch of teenagers — and their teachers — who know what it felt like to walk the corridors in the shoes (and corsets, for the girls) of their great-grandparents, their grandparents and their parents.And what did it feel like? \u0027Uncomfortable,\u0027 says Adelaide, 15, who must be one of the few teens in Britain who has attempted to play tennis wearing a floor-length skirt and, yes, a corset. \u0027I couldn\u0027t breathe, never mind run for the ball,\u0027 she confesses. Her teacher has sympathy. \u0027We all had to wear Victorian dress, too,\u0027 says Sue. \u0027It had an impact in so many ways. When we were trying to sing, we couldn\u0027t take a deep enough breath. I am not sure I realised how restrictive that dress would be.\u0027Mind you, the teenagers were equally appalled to wear the flares and dungarees their ancestors might have worn in the Seventies and Eighties.          Old-school shot: The series was filmed in a Victorian-built school in Coventry, with the decor adjusted as the class moved through the ages\u0027I went home one night and told my mum about this disgusting denim skirt I\u0027d had to wear,\u0027 says Adelaide. \u0027She said \u0027Oh I had one like that.\u0027 \u0027The series was filmed in a Victorian-built school in Coventry, with the decor adjusted as the class moved through the ages. Uniforms, school meals and curriculums refected the era of the time.The first episode sees the boys and girls lining up to go into class. Before they can even enter the classroom, they must undergo \u0027inspection\u0027 of their hands, and behind their ears.Anyone with dirty fingernails is sent to wash them. Everyone is then given a spoonful of \u0027brimstone and treacle\u0027 to set them up for the day. Jamie, 15, dubbed it: \u0027The most disgusting thing I\u0027ve ever tasted.\u0027          Sara Cox will be the new presenter of the BBC Radio 2 Drivetime show, taking over from Simon Mayo and Jo WhileyMind you, the school dinners from that era came a close second.\u0027None of the kids coped well with the fish pie,\u0027 admits Sue. \u0027But what we teachers were astonished at was that there were oysters in it.\u0027Who ever thought of oysters in a school dinner? But they were cheap at the time.\u0027What happened when the tapioca pudding was brought out though? There were howls of: \u0027What is this frogspawn?\u0027 One girl declared it to be \u0027like Coco Pops in sick\u0027. But oddly, one boy, licking his lips, appreciated the fact that he was getting a free school dinner. \u0027It\u0027s better than paying £2.60 for a little panini that is just dry with very little filling,\u0027 he says, summing up his modern canteen experience.This is a glorious series, which flits between funny and downright disturbing. In the Victorian episode, the laughs come with the basics — the pupils trying to cope with ink wells. \u0027What a mess,\u0027 says Sue. \u0027They were covered in it. The desks were covered in it. They had an ink monitor who would go round filling up the tiny pots, and, of course, everywhere was swimming in it.\u0027Not much writing got done, the teenagers admit. \u0027I literally couldn\u0027t. I could not get a single word written,\u0027 says Adelaide.In the programme, one boy can\u0027t write anything for reasons other than lack of experience with a quill. He has his left hand tied behind his back, in keeping with the thinking of the time that being left handed meant one was closer to the devil.          This is a glorious series, which flits between funny and downright disturbing. In the Victorian episode, the laughs come with the basics — the pupils trying to cope with ink wellsMany of the children had not even heard of this nonsensical idea. \u0027It was completely alien to them,\u0027 says Sue. \u0027As it should be.\u0027So what were they actually learning in school in Victorian times?This is where the shocks come. The sexism is extraordinary. For starters, Sue — who in real life is the headteacher of a school in the Midlands — was not allowed to take the head teacher role, because the head teacher had to be a man. If these were sexist times, then they were also racist. In history, the children learn about the dominance of the British Empire. This is, in parts a stirring experience, one that gives them the chance to dress up and be in a triumphant march.\u0027There was a parade to celebrate Empire Day, and that was quite affecting for me because I had a grandmother who was born in 1904,\u0027 says Sue. \u0027You realise that we are talking about quite recent history.\u0027          Polly Elisabeth Russell is a food historian and curator at the British Library with responsibility for research on social science and food.This makes the more unpalatable parts all the more shocking. In one class, the pupils are asked to copy \u0027facts\u0027 the teacher writes on the board. The paragraph refers to Aborigines as \u0027savages\u0027, explaining that efforts have been made to \u0027tame\u0027 them, but unsuccessfully.It is racism literally writ large on the board, and the reaction of the pupils is one of stunned silence. \u0027I mean I knew that people had racist attitudes, but still. This is what they were taught, as fact,\u0027 says Adelaide.This is particularly apalling for the non-white teenagers, whose faces register the horror. One girl voices the reality many are thinking — that her own great-grandparents would have been taught that someone who had skin like hers should be thought of as a savage.Remarkably, perhaps, Adelaide says the lesson was helpful. \u0027I\u0027m almost grateful to have seen it written like that,\u0027 she says. \u0027It was shocking, but it made me realise how things were then, and why that racism was allowed to spread.\u0027Sue admits there was a lot of unease on the part of the teachers. \u0027That lesson on Empire will live with me for ever,\u0027 she says.\u0027It was horrible, horrendous. And as a teacher you are standing there thinking, \u0027I feel very uncomfortable about delivering this\u0027, but at the same time you know you have to be authentic. We can\u0027t rewrite history. This is what was being taught at the time, and it\u0027s important that we look at it and recognise the bits that are totally unpalatable to us now.\u0027Sue says there are lessons she learned about teaching, and how the curriculum has always been politicised. \u0027The boys were learning to shoot because of the Boer War not going as well as it might, and because of concerns about the Empire crumbling.          Sue says there are lessons she learned about teaching, and how the curriculum has always been politicised\u0027Even though I\u0027ve been in education for so long, I never stopped to think to what extent what we deliver in the classroom is dictated by national concerns.\u0027 There were certain eras that everyone involved agrees are best consigned to history. The Seventies episode sees the school turn into a \u0027free school\u0027 with liberal ideas about education. \u0027That did not work,\u0027 says Sue. \u0027Classes were optional and the children could choose whether they wanted to attend. It was a disaster.\u0027Interestingly, the pupils hated this decade, too. \u0027At first we thought \u0027Oh great, we don\u0027t have to go\u0027, but actually it was a nightmare because we were all bored, and it was a bit chaotic,\u0027 admits Jamie. Sue found the Eighties quite odd. \u0027That was when I was at school, so it was like stepping back into my own life. But it was also weird. And it was the era of the teachers\u0027 strikes. I hadn\u0027t thought of them from the teachers\u0027 point of view when I was at school.\u0027Technological advances are lived during the programme, rather than studied. The children watch the moon landings on huge TVs wheeled into the classroom. In the Eighties clunky computers appear.  These two mugshots reveal the Victorian crooks and child criminals who were locked up in jail on Christmas Day 146 years ago. Agnes Rose Flowers (left) was convicted of stealing a shirt worth two shillings six pence on the 16th December, 1872 while John Powers, 15, was convicted of stealing fabric The lack of their own handheld devices, though, throws up fascinating reactions. To be authentic, all devices — phones, iPads, laptops — were banned.Yet, the pupils seem to have thrived on it. \u0027It was one of the best parts,\u0027 says Adelaide. \u0027At first it was weird, but not being able to be on social media was actually quite liberating. It made the making friends part quite interesting. We\u0027d get chatting to people because we liked talking to them. It didn\u0027t really matter how many likes they had on Instagram.\u0027Sue says that if there is one thing she will take from the experiment it is that old-fashioned communication trumps everything — and some enforced communal acts that were routine in previous times, compulsory school dinners among them, provided a much healthier environment.\u0027I think it brought home just how much the technology has created a 24-hour society that it is very difficult to actually turn off from,\u0027 says Sue. \u0027This did make me ask: \u0027What are we teaching our children about the balance of life?\u0027 \u0027She concludes: \u0027I do think we have things so much better now, and yet I think we have to be mindful of the fact that, in the future, somebody might look back on this time and say \u0027Goodness me, what were they thinking?\u0027 \u0027Back In Time For School, is on at 8pm tomorrow, on BBC2."},{"url":null,"title":"Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt says UK not underestimate strength Brexit","story":"    Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt will give a speech in Singapore today where he will say the UK should not underestimate its strength after Brexit.

Paul Thomas has made readers laugh at The Spectator, Private Eye, the Sunday Times, Punch Magazine, The Independent, Daily Telegraph and The Guardian\u0027Mac is an institution, utterly consistent and also a really friendly and kind man,\u0027 says Paul. \u0027It is an honour even to try to fill his enormous shoes.\u0027If anyone is qualified to do so, it is this man, with his detailed, witty and mischievous creations which brilliantly puncture pomposity and pretensions and skewer the extravagances and absurdities of life without ever stooping to cruelty or bullying.As with any topical cartoonist, he will never be off duty. Because ideas, for a cartoonist, are like jewels, or truffles even, to be foraged for, rootled out and hunted down, from newspapers, TV, radio, magazines, Parliament, and put to paper before their potency evaporatesSo Paul\u0027s life is immersed in current affairs. He wakes to Radio 4\u0027s Today programme, goes to bed listening to The World Tonight and leaves the BBC World Service playing by his bedside all night. \u0027This means I tend to find myself drifting in and out of very weird dreams about Theresa May and Brexit red lines!\u0027 he says.At least once during the night, he\u0027ll wake to jot down his thoughts — \u0027some garbled nonsense, often\u0027, either on a scrap of paper, envelope or mobile phone — to be deciphered in the morning.

As a boy growing up in Radlett, Herts, he was constantly scribbling, copying Nicholas Garland cartoons from his ironmonger father\u0027s Daily Telegraph and penning caricatures of his teachers.From the age of 11, he sent his work to Punch and Private Eye, and finally hit the mark with a cartoon inspired by an appearance by the Tory Ted Heath at a public meeting he attended with his father (a Conservative councillor) which was published by the local paper, the Borehamwood Post, when he was just 14.Paul wasn\u0027t paid for the drawing and he is at pains to point out that his father was friends with the paper\u0027s editor. But it was clearly good enough to go in. \u0027It was quite big, too,\u0027 he says, still glowing at the mention. \u0027On the back page!\u0027          During his stint at the Daily Express, he won the Cartoon Arts Trust\u0027s Cartoonist of the yearAfter that, he was drawing constantly — but mainly faces, always starting with the nose or eyes — \u0027you measure everything proportionately from there\u0027.After school, he did a foundation course at art college in St Albans before spending three years at Camberwell School of Art.He felt there was no market for cartoons, so he specialised in wood engraving (a form of illustration that is tiny, detailed and painstaking) but continued to scribble on the side, often rather rude cartoons of fellow students or send-ups of their end-of-year degree work. After graduation, he (unsuccessfully) toured numerous magazine offices before securing his first job at the Radio Times and, later, The Spectator.While many cartoonists focus solely on politics, Paul has more hinterland. An obsessive twitcher, he loves to draw birds.He is incredibly knowledgeable about all things ornithological and has just completed A Tabloid History Of Birdwatching, described by comedian Bill Bailey as \u0027an hilarious Who\u0027s Who of the twitcherati\u0027 through the ages.For Paul, 57, as for all cartoonists, the original idea is always the difficult part, while the execution — the drawing itself is, he says, \u0027like falling off a log\u0027.Each day, he\u0027ll prepare six drafts from which the editor will choose one for the next day\u0027s paper.Inevitably, as in any creative field, things sometimes don\u0027t go smoothly.\u0027Of course, some days you are funnier than others,\u0027 he says. \u0027But the nearer you get to the deadline, the adrenaline kicks in and there\u0027s always something there.\u0027The final version will take up to five hours to complete.As the cycle of news moves on, his cast of characters constantly changes.He adored drawing the singer Michael Jackson, but there\u0027s not much call for Jacko any more.Or the Queen\u0027s beloved corgis. \u0027All gone now.\u0027 Paul says. \u0027So sad. I used to love drawing them.\u0027Instead, he\u0027s had to brush up on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, the Duchess of Sussex and the wide-ranging cast of pro- and anti-Brexit politicians.\u0027Brexit is very good for a cartoonist — it just keeps on giving, but I\u0027m totally aware that people do get a bit bored of it.\u0027And with that, Paul grabs a pen and spends all of eight seconds penning another face — messy-haired, tired-looking, rather too craggy and lined around the mouth for comfort.

Rifaat has four wives and is believed to still be married to all of them.The case is revealed in a 37-page court ruling by the Home Office\u0027s Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC). The commission\u0027s rules state the woman and her children cannot be named.          She is the fourth wife of the dictator\u0027s uncle Rifaat al-Assad and her two sons have also been allowed to live in the UK. He is also known as the \u0027Butcher of Hama\u0027 after heading an elite force that slaughtered up to 40,000 Syrians in 1982.The family had lodged an appeal after being denied British citizenship. However the court rejected their claim, citing it \u0027would have an adverse impact on the UK\u0027s international relations\u0027.The judgment states the woman, nicknamed \u0027LA\u0027 in the document, first came to the UK in 2006 and was given \u0027entry clearance as an investor\u0027.She claimed to be \u0027investing in bonds, hedge funds etc\u0027 and one of her sons was educated at a leading London public school.Syria\u0027s conflict had escalated to a full-blown civil war by 2012, with President Assad bombing the city of Aleppo - earning him censure from the United Nations.The Home Office told the wife when turning down her citizenship application the UK has a vital role at the UN in \u0027securing resolutions that condemn regime activity against civilians\u0027.The SIAC ruling states: \u0027You are the wife of Rifaat al-Assad the uncle of President Bashar Al-Assad of Syria.\u0027Although widely reported as estranged from Bashar Al-Assad, Rifaat is the brother of Hafez Al-Assad (the late former president of Syria). Rifaat was a well-known and prominent member of his brother\u0027s regime during the 1970s and 1980s - a regime that is widely held to have committed crimes against humanity.\u0027Although it is not possible to assess the exact nature of your current relationship with Bashar Al-Assad and the Syrian regime, it is noted that the regime has become inextricably linked over the last few decades with the extended Assad family.\u0027\u0027In light of the above the Home Secretary has determined that to grant you a certificate of naturalisation would have an adverse impact on the UK\u0027s international relations and therefore it would not be in the public interest to grant you British Citizenship.\u0027 Rifaat was the head of Syria\u0027s Defense Companies paramilitary force in the 1970s and 80s. He oversaw the quashing of a Sunni insurrection in the city of Hama that earned him his \u0027Butcher\u0027 nickname, killing between 10,000 and 40,000 people.He was officially Syria\u0027s vice president until 1998, 14 years after he escaped the country after failing to overthrow his brother.

Previous emperors including his father had been treated as semi-ine.The palace, surrounded by stone walls and mossy moats, is opened to the public twice a year -- on the emperor\u0027s birthday and the second day of New Year -- for the royal family to greet well-wishers.In a rare emotional address to mark his 85th birthday last month, Akihito pointed to the \u0027countless lives\u0027 lost in the war.\u0027It gives me deep comfort that the Heisei Era (his reign) is coming to an end, free of war in Japan,\u0027 he said in a press statement.Akihito has used his speeches and travels to express his strong pacifist views, which are sharply at odds with the aggressive expansionism Japan pursued under his father\u0027s rule.The emperor has also worked to bring the royal household closer to the people and frequently visited the disadvantaged and families hit by natural disasters. "},{"url":null,"title":"Taiwan reunification China inevitable Xi","story":"President Xi Jinping said Taiwan\u0027s unification with China was \u0027inevitable\u0027\u0027We make no promise to give up the use of military force and reserve the option of taking all necessary means\u0027 against Taiwanese separatist activities and \u0027outside forces\u0027 that interfere with reunification, he said.In his speech, Xi described unification under a \u0027one country, two systems\u0027 approach that would \u0027safeguard the interests and well-being of Taiwanese compatriots\u0027.Taiwan considers itself a sovereign state, with its own currency, political and judicial systems, but has never declared formal independence from the mainland.Relations have been strained for the past two years since the election of President Tsai Ing-wen, who has refused to acknowledge Beijing\u0027s stance that the island is part of \u0027one China\u0027.On Tuesday, Tsai warned Beijing that Taiwan\u0027s people would never give up the kind of freedoms unseen on the authoritarian mainland.Beijing \u0027must respect the insistence of 23 million people for freedom and democracy\u0027 and \u0027must use peaceful and equal terms to handle our differences\u0027, she said.Though Xi\u0027s speech takes a strong stance against Taiwanese separatists and pushes for reunification, it is aimed mostly at domestic audiences, analysts say.  Taiwan\u0027s President Tsai Ing-wen has called on Beijing to respect \u0027freedom and democracy\u0027\u0027It\u0027s rather empty and doesn\u0027t have any new points except that cross-strait unification would not affect the interests of other countries,\u0027 said Fan Shih-ping, political analyst at National Taiwan Normal University, adding that Xi\u0027s words may also be intended for the US, which views Taiwan as part of its Indo-Pacific strategy.In 2018, the US sent multiple ships through the Taiwan Strait -- which China considers its territory but the US and others see as international waters open to all -- infuriating Beijing.Washington also remains Taipei\u0027s most powerful unofficial ally and its main arms supplier despite switching diplomatic recognition to Beijing in 1979.Xi\u0027s speech is likely to be \u0027very poorly received,\u0027 by the US, said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a professor at Hong Kong Baptist University, who studies Chinese foreign policy.To accommodate differences in Taiwan\u0027s political system and civil society, China has proposed adopting the \u0027one country, two systems\u0027 policy, which was implemented in Hong Kong after the British handed the city back to China in 1997.But some say the erosion of civil liberties in Hong Kong sets a negative precedent for Taiwan.\u0027They (China) are gobbling up Hong Kong, not just politically but culturally and economically too\u0027, Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy Hong Kong lawmaker, told AFP.\u0027It\u0027s so obvious that they\u0027re trying to assimilate Hong Kong into wider mainland China in every way. How would any Taiwanese think that\u0027s going to work for them?\u0027Others believed Taiwanese could slowly come on board.\u0027People\u0027s heart won\u0027t change in one day, but I think one country, two systems is a way to do it. The unification might take one, two, or even three more generations to achieve,\u0027 said a 55-year old construction worker in Hong Kong who gave his surname as Lam.  Mid-term polls in 2018 delivered a massive defeat to Tsai\u0027s DPP, which has taken a hard line on relations with BeijingLast October, tens of thousands of Taiwan independence campaigners took to the streets in the first large-scale protest calling for an outright independence vote since the island first became a democracy more than 20 years ago.But some in Taiwan say worsening relations with Beijing have harmed business, as cuts to pensions and a reduction in public holidays compound frustrations over a stagnant economy where salaries have not kept up with the rise in cost of living.Last year, Taiwan\u0027s ruling party suffered a massive defeat in mid-term polls, causing Tsai to resign as leader of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, while the main opposition Kuomintang, which oversaw an unprecedented thaw with Beijing before Tsai took office in 2016, made gains.Beijing has adopted a multi-pronged approach to diminish Taiwan\u0027s presence on the international stage in recent years, including blocking it from global forums and poaching its dwindling number of official diplomatic allies."},{"url":null,"title":"Temperatures plunge low 6C overnight","story":"    Surfers in the morning sun at Tynemouth beach on the North East coast today          A solitary daffodil blooms on a roundabout near the Long Walk in Windsor, Berkshire, this morningThis is where the temperature suddenly rises high up in the stratosphere, between six and 30 miles above the North Pole, and it can result in a chain reaction that leads to very cold conditions from eastern Europe and Russia. Today, the mercury is not expected to climb far above 0C (32F) throughout the day in many areas and is due to remain in single figures celsius across the country. Brrrrrrring on 2019!

These are the most basic packages offered by energy companies, and tend to apply if you haven’t shopped around for a better deal.Crucially, it won’t cap someone’s total bill – it only limits the price a supplier can charge per kWh of electricity and gas used. It has initially been set at £1,137 a year for a dual-fuel customer who uses a typical amount of gas and electricity and pays by direct debit. Ofgem will update the cap in April and October every year to reflect the latest estimated costs of supplying gas and electricity.No – if you are eligible, you don’t need to do anything. Ofgem said the cap would give 11 million customers a fairer deal.Your bills will fall if you are on a poor-value standard variable or default deal, because suppliers must cut their prices to the level of, or below, the cap. But the amount you pay also depends on how much gas or electricity you use – if you use more energy, your bill will go up. Many commentators predict that in February Ofgem will announce an increase in the level of the cap to take effect on 1 April. With wholesale prices having risen significantly in recent months, people on standard and default tariffs could be hit with an increase.Citizens Advice said that while people on default tariffs would now pay a fairer price for their energy, “they will still be better off if they shop around”. Comparethemarket said that on average, customers who switched paid £921 a year on a dual-fuel fixed tariff – £216 less than the cap level.No, it’s due to end by 2023. Ofgem said that by then it expected other reforms and advances, such as faster switching times and smart meters, to bring about easier and fairer access to better deals. “It will be up to the government to consider if the market is working well enough for the cap to be removed,” it added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e42c99ca3289e61c97739fc90d876970ec453e41/0_13_2985_1791/master/2985.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b24e10fb1bc43ca0fe91460f2da093f0","title":"tell us how would a no deal brexit impact your business","story":"What issues do you anticipate for your business or sector should the UK leave the EU without a deal?Government ministers released a batch of papers in September warning of the risks of leaving the European Union without a deal.Impact papers stressed some of the day-to-day effects after Theresa May chaired a special meeting of the cabinet focused on how a no-deal outcome could be handled.We would like to hear from you if you work in a sector you think may be affected by a no-deal Brexit and to find out what the potential impact would mean for you.Tell us a little about what you do and how your reading of the situation means your business or sector could be affected in our encrypted form below.

But only the big players have the muscle to surviveImagine a shopper in an electronics store. Look, there’s a Fitbit display, with its “activity bands” which measure your steps and show details. Or, more pricey, its Versa smartwatch. Perhaps to save money, just buy the activity band? But wait … just over there are some generic activity bands, and they’re cheaper. Maybe save some money with those.Move along a bit, and there are GoPro cameras. But once again, there are some slightly cheaper models beside them not well-known brands, but a camera is a camera, surely? Further along, there’s a Parrot drone. Next to those is a Sonos speaker, which works with Amazon’s Alexa. But beside it is a cheaper Amazon Echo, and a voice-controlled Google Home, and a Siri-enabled Apple HomePod. Why would you go with the smaller brand, faced with those offerings from tech’s behemoths? Or, at the previous displays, why not just buy the cheaper models?That’s the challenge for many consumer electronics firms. Not how to make things, or how to distribute them and get them in front of potential buyers. It’s how to make a profit. Out of Fitbit, GoPro, Parrot and Sonos – each operating in different parts of the consumer electronics business – only the latter made an operating profit in the last financial quarter, and all four have made a cumulative operating loss so far this year.That, together with the rise of a gigantic electronic manufacturing capability in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, about an hour’s drive north of Hong Kong, has made the modern hardware business one where only those with huge reserves of capital and brand recognition can hope to thrive. Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Samsung, and Sony can probably rely on their brand name after that, it’s survival of the fittest.So is it already game over for GoPro and the rest? None is a newcomer. GoPro was founded in 2002 by Nick Woodman, who wanted to capture better pictures of a surfing trip to Australia it came to market in June 2014. Sonos was also founded in 2002, focusing on multi-room high-quality sound, and came to the market earlier in 2018. Fitbit was set up in March 2007, and joined the stock market in June 2015. Parrot is the oldest of them all, founded in 1994 and has made many consumer electronics products, including a voice-recognition system (in 1995) and a Bluetooth-based hands-free kit for cars in 2000.Fitbit is struggling to move away from fitness bands – simple devices that record steps and calories burnt – where low-cost Chinese products are swamping the market. It is trying to shift into smartwatches, which are higher-priced, have more uses and generate higher customer loyalty. But it’s not easy in the first nine months of the year it sold 8.4m fitness bands – and 2.8m smartwatches. The opportunity is there: Fitbit has 25m users who pay a subscription to its services, and could be future smartwatch buyers. But in the most recent quarter it made a $200m (£157m) operating loss on sales of $940m and over the past eight quarters it has made a net loss of $624m. Its shares, which hit $47 soon after its IPO in 2015, are now $4.97.GoPro has managed to stabilise its unit sales, at about 1m per quarter, but profitability has remained elusive. So it is trying to encourage owners on to a subscription offering, at $5 per month so far 185,000 have signed up, generating about $11.1m a year. That’s about the same revenue as selling an extra 44,000 cameras – but the profit on subscriptions, as with software, is far higher than on the hardware. Its shares are currently at $4.24, down from $87 in 2014.“It’s harder for any company that focuses mainly on hardware to survive in the long term,” says Francisco Jeronimo, a smartphone analyst for the research group IDC. “But the big problem for many of these companies is that there isn’t a strong incentive to keep buying them. I might buy a GoPro, but I don’t need it on a daily basis if I have a smartphone. Same with Parrot – it’s a very niche segment. These companies were so eager to get to an IPO that they took advantage of the hype around their category, but haven’t been able to reinvent themselves, and they need to do that to keep alive.”The risk for such companies is that they are consigned to the virtual, or real, cupboard under the stairs to gather dust, while smartphone capability expands to take on functions that once needed a separate device.Yet it’s never been easier to make and sell hardware. Crowdfunding sites such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo provide easy ways to find early adopters who will stake money on entrepreneurs with unproven designs, which can then be realised in Shenzhen. The Pebble smartwatch raised $10.3m as a Kickstarter project in 2012, then its biggest-ever fundraising it topped that in 2015, raising $20.3m for a newer model. Yet in December 2016 it announced it would close, citing financial trouble. (Fitbit bought its intellectual property – essentially, the smartwatch software – for $23m.) “Crowdfunding sites are great for attracting early adopters, but the majority of consumers don’t go there,” says Jeronimo. “It misleads companies into thinking their category is going to explode.”Even while it tried to expand beyond those early adopters, Pebble’s problem (which is now also Fitbit’s problem) was that Apple launched its own smartwatch in 2015, and quickly became the largest smartwatch maker. Sonos, similarly, found that a market it once had to itself – multi-room speakers streaming music and radio from the internet – turned into a jostling match with Amazon in 2014, followed by Google and most recently, Apple. Suddenly, everyone is making a “smart speaker”, and Sonos’s hardware-only model has come into sharp focus because it doesn’t have a native voice assistant (it is adding Amazon’s Alexa and Google’s ‘OK Google’).The ability for the big players to squash smaller players isn’t unique to hardware Facebook has tried to do it to rivals such as Snapchat. But in hardware, firms such as Sonos find themselves assaulted by both the big brands and the unheard-of ones leveraging Shenzhen and Amazon’s distribution.Sonos’s response has been to insist that people will move upmarket, to its better sound quality. It is also looking for collaborations, most notably with Ikea, whose fruits are promised in 2019. Patrick Spence, the Sonos CEO, is confident he can rely on the existing Sonos user base of 20m devices across 7.4m households.The squeeze on smaller hardware players has played out before, in PCs and smartphones. In the mid-1990s, the PC market was dominated by American companies such as IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Dell, Gateway, Apple, Compaq, NCR, Packard Bell and Zenith. As manufacturing costs in the US rose, they shifted production to Taiwan, South Korea and, gradually, China – only to be usurped by local rivals using that manufacturing expertise and building international distribution networks. Now, only Dell, HP and Apple remain the three other biggest PC makers are Acer and Asus, of Taiwan, and China’s Lenovo."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b780700e7fee46566d1da299426b4ab0ff693d36/0_1099_1499_899/master/1499.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e50e78ca8a236a939a2d5acac35348a8","title":"cathay pacific blunder offers huge discounts on first class tickets","story":"Airline promises to honour the sales – ‘We do not want to go back on our promise’It was the New Year’s Eve travel sale that appeared to be too good to be true: business and first-class flights on Cathay Pacific from Vietnam to New York for $675 (£534), rather than the standard $16,000.It turned out to be a ticketing error, but the airline promised to honour the sale. “Happy 2019 all, and to those who bought our good – VERY good surprise ‘special’ on New Year’s Day,” the Hong Kong-based carrier tweeted on Wednesday. “Yes – we made a mistake, but we look forward to welcoming you onboard with your ticket issued. Hope this will make your 2019 ‘special’ too!”The flight offer was picked up on New Year’s Eve by Gary Leff, a travel blogger, who wrote: “Oh my goodness this is an amazing fare.“You can fly from Vietnam – the cheapest fares originate in Da Nang, but other cities work as well – to Cathay Pacific’s US gateways starting at $675.”Leff warned his readers not to book any additional travel or hotels around the deal, as he suspected Cathay “might get seller’s remorse” and not honour the fares. “I’d wait a few days after buying additional travel or making additional non-refundable plans around the fare,” he said.But when Cathay became aware of the mistake, the airline said it would stand by the fares. “We do not want to go back on our promise to our customers,” it said. “We made a mistake but we look forward to welcoming you onboard with your ticket issued.”The airline did not respond to requests for comment about the number of flights sold at the steep discount. Cathay has removed all business and first-class flights for August – the month of the cut-price fares – from its website, but the same flights in September are listed for $16,000.Another blog, One Mile at a Time, saw it was possible to buy first-class flights from Hanoi to Vancouver for $988 return.In a blogpost, it said: “Wow! Hurry, this won’t last.” There were also first-class return flights from Hong Kong to New York offered for $1,450. The price of those flights in September is more than $31,000.The South China Morning Post tracked down 11 passengers who collectively bought 18 first and business-class tickets at the discounted prices. They paid a total of £21,700 for flights that should have cost £540,000.It is not the first time airlines have mistakenly offered premium-class flights at economy prices. Singapore Airlines made the error in 2014, as did Hong Kong Airlines last summer, and both honoured the errors. But in 2015, United Airlines cancelled hundreds of tickets it sold for $100 by mistake. United said it would not honour the fares because the error was caused by a “third-party software provider”.Earlier this year, Cathay had to repaint one of its jets after customers noticed the airline had spelled its name wrong.

It has not been easy but our taste panel customers all love this one, so we have decided to launch it as our contribution to Veganuary.”This year in the UK record numbers of people have signed up to Veganuary and pledged to follow a diet free of animal products for at least a month. The charity’s head of campaigns, Rich Hardy, said that on Sunday alone 14,000 people promised to go vegan for January – a rate of one every six seconds.The new vegan sausage roll will be on sale in 950 of Greggs’s 1,850 UK shops from Thursday, costing £1 – 5p more than the traditional meat version.

Investor sentiment in the US has been dented in recent months by the threat of an escalation of a trade war between the US and China as well as rising borrowing costs and political gridlock in Washington.There are few positive signs for stocks going into 2019 on either side of the Atlantic, according to Jeremy Leach, chief executive at investment firm Managing Partners Group.Key drivers of an equities bear market will be Brexit uncertainty, further tightening of monetary policy on both sides of the Atlantic, political gridlock and trade tensions – all forcing equity values lower in the UK, Europe and the USA.John Lewis’s enjoyed a strong finish to a rollercoaster Christmas trading period banking a bumper sales fortnight as shoppers made a late dash to the shops, writes Zoe Wood.Fashion, beauty and leisure and technology all performed well – although it will be a while yet before the company reveals whether those sales came at the expense of profits if discounting was too heavy.Some nice perspective on the rail fares rises here from Sky’s economics editor, Ed Conway.Consumer price index (CPI) inflation is the most widely used measure of the cost of living.Particularly since the financial crisis wage growth has stagnated, making these above-inflation increases even more painful for commuters.Gold prices have hit a six-month high as the equity sell-off prompts investors to look for safe havens.Spot prices for the yellow metal hit highs of $1,288.66 per ounce on Wednesday, the highest since June 2018.Economists at Swiss investment bank UBS predict that gold’s value could be dented by a rising dollar in the first half of the year thanks to rising US interest rates.However, they added: “as 2019 proceeds, a weaker dollar, higher equity market volatility, and signs that the Fed is nearing the end of its hiking cycle should act as tailwinds for gold.”Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was at Kings Cross station this morning alongside union activists, reiterating his call for the nationalisation of the rail network.Transport secretary Chris Grayling blamed union demands for higher pay for the fare increases. You can find much more detail here:The Brexit stockpiling boost to the manufacturing sector has failed to cheer up currency traders, who have sold off the pound against the US dollar.Much of Britain may have had something of a break from Brexit during the past few days, but “Brexit cannot help but remain the key driving force for sterling” in the next few weeks, with the vote on Prime Minister Theresa May’s deal due in the third week of January, according to Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group.Downing Street still appears hopeful it can get the deal through parliament, despite continued opposition from many Conservative party MPs as well as other opposition parties. Foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt today suggested the deal is still alive after a speech in Singapore. He said:When Theresa May comes back with those reassurances that she has been seeking from the EU that the deal that is on the table is not going to lead to us being permanently trapped in the customs union ... she will find a way to get this deal through parliament. Some more reaction to the UK’s manufacturing PMI data. The main verdict? While the headline may look encouraging, be wary.The marked increase was driven by stockpiling of goods and raw materials in preparation for possible disruption if there is no Brexit deal by 29 March. Stocks built now will have to be run down eventually, potentially lowering demand in future months.Stockpiling is “not necessarily a boon for UK growth”, said James Smith, an economist at ING. He added:He added: “Conditions currently look challenging at home for manufacturers – notably heightened business caution over investment and expenditure on capital goods amid significant uncertainties, particularly Brexit.”Francesco Arcangeli, economist at EEF, the manufacturers’ lobby group, said: “While the headline figure might suggest industry has out its foot on the accelerator at the start of the year, the detail confirms that the rush to stockpile goods ahead of Brexit and the potential disruption from a no-deal scenario is now in full swing.The absence of any New Year joy from the European PMI data also confirms that the near future holds a bumpy ride for UK manufacturers.The firm is one of the first major British retailers to reveal its Christmas performance, at a time when analysts are nervously looking out for more pain on the high street.John Lewis hailed “very strong sales on Christmas Eve and a confident start to clearance sales both online and in shops”, in its latest sales update.The firm had previously reported record sales in the Black Friday week in November.A quick check-up on the FTSE 100 after the manufacturing data beat expectations: the sell-off has slowed slightly, but miners remain under pressure.ITV’s chief financial officer stepped down from the board on new year’s eve.The FTSE 100 broadcaster had announced in June that Ian Griffiths, who also held the role of chief operating officer, would retire within 12 months.Griffiths will leave ITV completely on 31 March 2019.Brexit uncertainty may actually be helping British factories weather slowing global growth – although it is an irony not many major manufacturers would appreciate.Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: “The pick-up in the PMI in December suggests that preparations for Brexit are helping manufacturers to keep their heads above water during the current global slowdown.”However, he noted that the boost now will likely be matched by slower growth later.Factories are stockpiling the raw materials they need for their work as well as the products they sell as they prepare for possible disruption.The overall reading for British manufacturing showed the fastest expansion in six months for the sector. Unsurprisingly, it’s Brexit which is seen as the driving force.Growth in new orders rose to a 10-month high, with inflows from domestic and foreign buyers. IHS Markit said:Manufacturers linked increases in both domestic and overseas demand to clients purchasing to build up safety stocks to mitigate potential Brexit disruption.The stockpiling prompted the second fastest increase in the stocks of finished products held by manufacturers since the survey began in 1992.Although the headline reading is encouraging, IHS Markit reported that the fourth-quarter average reading was the weakest since the third quarter of 2016 (immediately after a certain referendum result was announced).It’s also worth noting that IHS Markit revised up their November reading to 53.6, not 53.1 as previously reported."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/990ac35d4d6f2d2dd162fd4f31dd9ff64a92a923/0_20_640_384/master/640.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7160999bdc8dec6b8ef4b0063855f085","title":"turkey is kosovo controversy over balkan states new central mosque","story":"Pristina badly needs a new mosque – but Turkish attempts to court the young Balkan state with investment and advocacy is making some uneasyIt is six years since Islamic leaders and government officials laid the cornerstone of Pristina’s new central mosque – a slab of stone now hidden beneath weeds in a parking lot.Pulling back the weeds reveals it is covered with bright red graffiti – death threats to Kosovo’s chief mufti, along with the words: “No Turkish mosque or there will be blood.”There has been controversy over the design, including rejection of plans drawn by esteemed architects including Zaha Hadid in favour of a hulking carbon copy of any number of centuries-old, Ottoman-style mosques.But now it seems this spot in the city’s Dardania district will finally get its new mosque. Construction is to begin in spring.“In Europe they don’t have a single village without a church, but here in Kosovo are at least 50 villages without a mosque,” remarks chief mufti Naim Tërnava in his offices near the city’s Imperial Mosque. On Islamic holidays, the throng of worshippers at this Ottoman-era mosque, built in 1461, often spills on to the street outside. Tërnava is taken aback by the heated debate over Pristina’s new mosque – for him, it is a practical necessity, “for the worship of God, and nothing else”.Kosovo is still struggling to carve out a place for itself in a restive part of Europe amid poor economic prospects. The young state needs all the friends it can get.Among its suitors is Turkey, which has made huge investments there and been a firm advocate for its international recognition and eventual accession to Nato and the EU. As the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, put it in a 2013 visit to the country: “Turkey is Kosovo, and Kosovo is Turkey.”Those words resonate in a Turkey whose assertive foreign policy has been characterised as “neo-Ottomanism”. Kosovo plays no small role in Turkey’s imperial history: the Battle of Kosovo in 1389 saw the defeat of the medieval Kingdom of Serbia and the beginning of the Ottoman conquest of south-eastern Europe. The empire went on to rule Kosovo for nearly 500 years, bringing with it Islam and many other cultural influences.A large mosque wouldn’t seem out of place in Pristina, so why the controversy? When the then mayor of Pristina, Isa Mustafa, laid the foundation stone, land had already been donated by the local municipality. Mustafa went on to become Kosovo’s prime minister, a position he held until last year, but the mosque was never built.The city’s Islamic community claims it took a long time to select the winning design and make sure it would “fit the location”. Pristina’s municipal government dragged its feet in approving the mosque, but this year finally granted permission, subject to a construction permit.Opposition to many new mosques across Europe is rooted in fear of Islam, but with 19 of every 20 people here Muslim, resistance to Pristina’s new mosque does not fit neatly into that trend. Some locals resent what they see as a symbol of Turkey’s overbearing influence, while others are suspicious of the creeping return of faith to a secular, post-socialist public space. Among the project’s most vocal opponents are local architects. Even though the public tender stressed the need for an original building, the design chosen is classical Ottoman. The project is being overseen by the Turkish state’s directorate for religious affairs, Diyanet, which has built dozens of other mosques across the Islamic world in recent years, in a move some describe as a key vehicle of Turkey’s power play.“Over 30 designs were submitted just months after the call for designs was made in 2012. Even Zaha Hadid proposed a design,” says the architect Arbër Sadiki. “But before the competition closed, interviews started appearing in the press in which the mufti described what the new mosque would look like.“Designs were supposed to be original, but the chosen one is just a copy of an Ottoman mosque. The decision looks more political than architectural to me. I know amazing architects doing work on contemporary mosques in Turkey. Why can’t we put Pristina on the map with something similar?”Under Josip Tito’s Yugoslavia, Pristina’s old bazaar and many historical buildings in its Ottoman-era downtown were destroyed as part of a modernisation campaign that secularised public space. As a result, explains Sadiki, modern Pristina is mostly a postwar city, and little constructed since the 1970s has been distinctive. Pristina’s most notable building today is its modernist, domed national library, built in 1982.Pristina isn’t the only city in Kosovo where ostentatious Turkish-funded mosque construction has taken place. In Mitrovica, about 20 miles north, clashes in the 2000s led to the city’s ision into southern (Albanian and Muslim) and northern (Serb and Orthodox Christian) halves. The smaller northern district flaunts its Serb identity, with a new Orthodox cathedral and a much-photographed mural proclaiming “Kosovo is Serbia, Crimea is Russia”. The larger southern part of town is festooned with Albanian flags and monuments to fighters from the Kosovo Liberation Army – as well as Kosovo’s largest mosque, which opened in 2014 and is named after the Istanbul district Bayrampaşa that funded its construction. Inside it is a riot of colour and ostentatiously Ottoman.There was no mosque like it in the city before – between 150 and 200 were destroyed in Kosovo during its vicious war of secession from Yugoslavia, many of them simple and modestly designed. For Mitrovica’s Muslims, the Bayrampaşa mosque is a symbol of redemption, if not reconciliation. Back in Pristina there is a sense Turkey has taken advantage of western disinterest to expand its influence in a place Ankara treats like part of its backyard.“People ask: why aren’t western investors coming here? Is it because we are Muslim? The sense is that the only door open to us leads to Turkey – and some want to walk through it.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a0fea09cf4bb421265a60ddb0945435394e2be0/0_1_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=174ffebb1bb764727f9e9fc4204ab911","title":"belarus hope future europe democracy","story":"In a region that saw some of the worst 20th-century horrors, there is a yearning for democracy and dialogueIn December I travelled to Minsk for a seminar with a group of European historians. A few miles outside the capital of Belarus, we visited places where both the Nazis and Stalin’s secret police had committed some of the worst crimes of the 20th century. During those few days, I also spoke with some young locals who offered glimmers of hope as to what a truly united Europe could one day look like.It was the most instructive trip I’ve made in years: a deep e into conflicting European memories, highlighting the difficulty of overcoming stereotypes and ideological narratives, as well as the legacy of the cold war in people’s minds.It may sound odd, but for anyone trying to keep abreast of what Europe means, the best view could arguably be found right there, in those flatlands of marshes, pine trees and spruce, dotted with towns and villages on which the past weighs heavily.Minsk is, of course, outside the European Union, in a nation where a dictator rules, in something of a grey zone between Europe and Russia. Few people in western Europe know about Belarus, let alone have been there. Yet it should be prominent in our consciences. “Belarus was the worst place to be in world war two,” the historian Timothy Snyder once noted. In his book Bloodlands, Snyder recounts how 14 million people were murdered between 1933 and 1945 in an area that stretches from the Baltic sea to the Black sea, with Belarus worst affected: a quarter of its population were killed as a result of both Stalin’s and Hitler’s policies.We ignore much about our continent’s history if we overlook the plight of this region, where the two totalitarian systems converged with horrific consequences – at once plotting together and competing as they laid claim to territory and exterminated those living there, or deported people there to die.Of all the places I’ve visited in Europe, nowhere is that complex history more poignant than in the forests outside Minsk, where three sites of mass carnage, only a few miles apart, are commemorated in very different ways.A fork in the road in Maly Trostenets is where tens of thousands of Jews, many from Germany and Austria, were shot over pits by SS commandos, their corpses later burned. Construction of a monument has recently started there, but strikingly it doesn’t indicate the victims’ names. This is because Belarusian officials are uneasy with commemorating the Holocaust – much as the Soviet authorities were. Instead, on trees nearby, families of victims have placed small yellow posters bearing the details of those who perished.Not far from there, in the forest of Kuropaty, lies a place where Stalin’s men shot thousands during the 1930s. Wooden crosses of Orthodox Christianity have been planted by Belarusian civil groups and opposition activists as a way of honouring the victims. But there again, no names. And there is no official monument at all. The cult of Stalin remains untouched in Belarus, much like it has been restored in Putin’s Russia.And a little further, in Khatyn, is a clearing in the forest where a village once stood. The Nazis massacred its entire population, pushing families into a barn and setting it on fire. They decimated hundreds of villages in Belarus this way. And here the full spectrum of Soviet‑era commemorations is deployed: a monument with names, a museum, tour guides. Khatyn symbolises the persecution of an entire nation – but it is an exclusive emblem, sitting alongside huge omissions. In Belarus the crimes of Stalinism are left largely untold, as are those perpetuated by the Nazis against the Jews.These places should rank prominently in our European minds, yet they don’t. Dealing with the full dimensions of what happened is hard enough for Belarusians dominated by autocracy and propaganda. But it is just as difficult for many of us elsewhere, because we tend to remember the 20th century from a western point of view, not from a fully continental perspective. The iron curtain, which lifted three decades ago, still lingers in our heads.Yet I took back another, much more uplifting message from this trip: young people I met privately shared their hopes of breaking down barriers and connecting with their generation in other parts of Europe. Far from our constant debates about populism, Brexit, Donald Trump and the EU’s struggles, they asked: “What do the young British want? Or the French?” “Do they worry like us about the environment?” “How can we share more with them?”In this part of Europe, which experienced the worst of 20th-century nightmares, I found signs of a positive energy, a striving for the basics of democracy and dialogue. It’s a quest no doubt hampered by a regime that likes to lock up dissidents. All the same, which energy seemed to want to burst out of the cold ground like budding flowers in spring. With crucial tests for Europe looming (not least the Brexit endgame, and European parliament elections in May), it was in Belarus that I found more reasons to hope than to wallow in gloom. I also came back more convinced than ever that Europe’s travails will only be addressed once we show a greater curiosity for other peoples’ memories.The historian Tony Judt once said: “Getting history right can require a new generation coming along.” He added: “There is probably a limit to how much you can break taboos.” It is at a human level, through exchanges, contacts, dialogue, and more awareness of history (especially in the media), that we can bring down some of those walls in our heads. Accepting differences, after shedding light on them, is surely as important to Europe’s future as trade deals or deficit targets. Walking down those frozen forest tracks in Belarus and discussing Europe with young people there felt like the start of a long road – one that holds promises, too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac7fecbd057c777c2a0d4003f4e5a6ba8a4299a5/11_0_3309_1985/master/3309.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2eb3d1cd3213b1bc29601363c80a949","title":"sajid javid bluster channel crossings australia","story":"The home secretary has declared attempts to cross the Channel a ‘major incident’. It’s a crude but effective tacticBritain is in the grip of a crisis. Apparently. Last week the home secretary, Sajid Javid, declared the number of people attempting to cross the Channel a “major incident”, though the numbers don’t support such a claim. But that didn’t deter the newspapers.“Home secretary brings back two Border Force cutters to tackle migrant crisis,” says the . “Sajid Javid recalls two Border Force boats to patrol English Channel amid migrant crisis,” the Evening Standard reports. “Migrant crisis,” the Sun shouts in capitals. “Two Border Force boats redeployed from the Med to patrol the Channel for migrants.” The  joined in: “Migrant crisis: 12 migrants detained at Kent beach ahead of Sajid Javid talks.” And the Times: “Migrant crisis: Sajid Javid sends extra boats to Channel.”Scapegoating people fleeing violence and poverty is an all-too-familiar political sport in Europe and the US. But its wellspring can be found in Australia, and it’s worth joining the dots – there are lessons for the UK government as it flirts with exploiting a “migrant crisis”.Let’s step back to 1901, when the Immigration Restriction Act was passed in Australia. The law formed the basis of the “White Australia” policy, intended to exclude all non-Europeans from immigrating to the country. Support for this policy, in subsequent years, delivered electoral success.In the 1903 election campaign Alfred Deakin, leader of the Protectionist party – and one of the architects of the White Australia policy – argued for the preservation of Australia’s “complexion”: Deakin was elected. Stanley Bruce, in the 1925 federal election, supported White Australia: he was re-elected, with an increased majority.But the policy came under scrutiny after indigenous soldiers defended the nation in the second world war and, after several changes in immigration law since 1947, White Australia was legally ended in 1973. In the following decade the nation’s ethnic and cultural ersity increased, and it suited Australia. Until it didn’t.In 1988, as leader of the Liberal opposition, John Howard called for a curb on Asian immigration. Later he publicly apologised, and admitted in 2002 that he had been wrong. Six months earlier, though, in November 2001, Howard had been re-elected as prime minister, in the wake of 911 – and the Tampa episode.In August 2001, the captain of the Norwegian freighter Tampa defied Canberra’s instruction to stay outside Australian waters with his cargo of 433 asylum seekers who had been rescued from a sinking Indonesian boat, and headed for Australian waters. SAS troops seized control of the ship, and Howard introduced legislation to remove the Tampa and future unwelcome vessels. The opposition Labor leader Kim Beazley, having initially supported the government, opposed the new law and accused Howard of “wedge politics”. The bill was defeated.But the “Pacific solution” was born: islands were cut from the Australian migration zone detention centres were established on Manus Island and Nauru the navy was deployed to intercept vessels carrying asylum seekers. Howard declared: “We will decide who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come.” He was elected for a third term. It was ugly but effective, and supported by the opposition. The die was cast, and it is shaping events today.Fear of immigration worked for the leave campaign in the 2016 Brexit referendum, and now it appears Britain is returning to the theme. On Monday the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, accused the government of exploiting the issue in the lead-up to the parliamentary Brexit vote this month.Still, while the UK government flirts with an old Australian electoral trope, history shows it’s possible to do the right thing. In 1989, while Labor prime minister, Bob Hawke made a tearful promise to allow Chinese students to stay in Australia after the Tiananmen Square massacre. He had not consulted the cabinet. “I was told: ‘You cannot do that, Prime Minister.’ I said to them, ‘I just did. It is done.’”The core principle of the 1951 refugee convention states that “refugees should not be penalised for their illegal entry or stay” and recognises “that the seeking of asylum can require refugees to breach immigration rules”. Desperate people will take desperate measures to secure safety. But an inidual’s dignity is denied when a government resorts to posturing against weak opposition. Amid the political bluff and bluster, it’s easy to lose sight of what’s real.

Extending article 50 now looks like the only responsible way outTheresa May thought her Brexit deal was an offer MPs could not refuse. Not because it would bring our constituents anything useful. Quite the opposite – it will make us poorer, our economy less certain and our outlook less hopeful. Take the prime minister’s Brexit deal or crash out of Europe with no deal at all, she declared.But far from being the Don Corleone of British politics Theresa May is more the emperor with no clothes. Explicitly keeping the option of a no-deal on the table is an act of supreme economic sabotage. It is also delusional. The prime minister has long preferred the support of hard right Brexiteers over more reasonable voices within her party. Now she is seeking the votes she needs by threatening these same Brexiteers with something they actually want – a no-deal Brexit. Her attempt at blackmail is both stupid and venal.Some Tory MPs want a no-deal Brexit because they have rightwing dreams of imperial revival or libertarian utopia – let’s say hello to the monocultural European Research Group. Others simply want May to fail spectacularly so they can claim they would have done better – the famously principled former mayor of London comes to mind. They are not going to be responsive to Theresa May’s threats because for them no deal is better than her bad deal.Despite the pomposity, the pantomime theatrics and the last-minute cop-out, it may be that the prime minister thinks she is doing the responsible thing – I can only hope she watched Rebel Without a Cause over the Christmas break. She is setting us up to be the car whose driver gets his sleeve caught in the door in a drag-racing game of chicken and goes over the cliff. But it is hard to have faith in May’s motives when she has chosen to deliberately run down the clock, causing further cost and chaos. She hopes MPs will quietly vote for her deal, blinded by the oncoming “no-deal” headlights. But in reality her deal won’t withstand the internal contradictions of the Conservative party which cannot support a permanent customs union even though it is essential for our economy.My constituency is in the north east, the only region to export more than it imports. Half of that is to the EU. Companies big and small have sales and supplier links that cross the Channel not once but many times. Throughout the UK, businesses, many with traditional Tory allegiances, are waking up to the fact that their EU connections are not based on one company or one product or one service or one person, but are numerous and interdependent. This web of economic activity cannot be undone in a matter of weeks or even months, and it certainly cannot be replaced by dubious future trade deals with America, Africa, Australia or other distant lands. Our economy demands more.So in reality Theresa May has two responsible choices. She can call an election and give Labour a chance to actually do what she is manifestly incapable of doing, and that is govern. Or she can pursue a deal that actually is in the interests of our country, a customs union that preserves workers’ rights and environmental protections, and ensures there is no hard border on the island of Ireland.But at this late date, after she has wasted two years in a dance of death with extreme Brexiteers, we must recognise the challenge of negotiating a deal that obtains cross-party support before the March deadline. Labour’s conference motion does not reference an article 50 extension but we have acknowledged it may be necessary. More recently Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress which includes representatives of all sides of Brexit, called on the government to suspend article 50. Increasingly it is clear that the options to avoid an economic and social catastrophe are general election, public vote andor article 50 suspension. With each day that passes Theresa May’s inept blackmail makes it harder to do anything responsible without stopping the clock.• Chi Onwurah is the Labour MP for Newcastle Central, and is shadow minister for industrial strategy, science and innovation"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e3d83a464382028b6ca3d105dc3b95dbb64d6b5/0_310_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0db8d63a2ce38f995a2973f5e70683be","title":"theresa may tv licence elderly","story":"The Tories pledged to protect free TV licences for the elderly in their 2017 election manifesto. Now they’re asking the BBC to override itImagine for a second the BBC taking a frail, housebound, elderly pensioner to court for not possessing a TV licence that for years she has had for free. Then imagine fining her £1,000 – the standard penalty – with legal costs on top and if she doesn’t pay or can’t pay, sending her to prison.Unthinkable? In fact, one in every 10 court cases is over non-payment of TV licences. And from next year, millions of people aged over 75 could lose their right to a free TV licence – and, if they don’t pay up, end up being taken to court despite a Conservative election promise they would not have to pay.In a sheepish private message to the BBC a few days after their botched general election campaign of 2017, the Conservatives asked the corporation to simply ignore the fact that Theresa May had made a specific election promise to those millions of pensioners that they would continue to have a free TV licence. The Tories’ manifesto had stated: “We will maintain all other pensioner benefits including free bus passes, eye tests, prescriptions and TV licences, for the duration of this parliament.” The Conservatives told the BBC they had made a mistake by promising free licences until 2022, and insisted the BBC had the power to abandon them in 2020, thus overriding their election pledge. Even now, a year and a half on, the party has not levelled with the British public.In a paper a few weeks ago, the BBC had to admit it might charge all of those not on pension credit a licence fee – and thus restrict the free licence to 900,000 households, which would need to prove their eligibility. They might cut out nearly 2m households where someone from the age of 75 to 79 lives or start charging every one of the 4.5m households with someone over the age of 75.Just to means-test pensioners for their eligibility for free licences raises civil liberties issues. The Department for Work and Pensions would almost certainly have to open up its records to allow BBC officials to access private information on the finances of the over-75s. It would cost £72m simply to administer the system.But there are other very good reasons why the pensioners’ free TV licence should not be abolished. A policy of “taxation without representation” sparked the US war of independence in the 1770s. Since then the convention has been that taxation can be imposed only by the elected representatives of the people.But if the BBC – an unelected body – becomes the taxing authority, it will decide who is to be taxed for the licence fee, and at what rate.For the BBC to now make judgments that only parliament should make about the distribution of income between social groups is indeed taxation without representation.Of course there is a very good reason why the last Labour government and then the Conservatives promised a free licence to all over-75s regardless of income. Support for the welfare state is dependent on us feeling we are “all in this together”: that means combining targeted benefits such as the pension credit (which took 2 million pensioners out of poverty) with universal benefits that cover everyone. The free TV licence Labour introduced in 1999 is one of the few universal benefits available to all very elderly pensioners, and is particularly important given that for millions who live on their own the television is the best antidote to loneliness and isolation.Backed by an Age UK petition, Tom Watson, Labour’s culture spokesman, has made the case that if the BBC needs extra money, the government itself – not the broadcaster – should take responsibility for finding it. To do so is the only fair way of keeping its election promise.• Gordon Brown is the UN special envoy for global education and a former prime minister of the UKThe Age UK petition can be signed here "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43afac3b8f684a27add5c9d7da4dd4d6d93a099b/0_0_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0074001fc6da335820407df4b63269d","title":"us britain msm whilst words 2018 english","story":"Announcing words of the year has become a competitive sport. The season began early in November, with rival dictionary publishers pursuing social media shares and column inches by dubbing some small bit of language the epitome of 2018ish-ness. Those in the know call them WotYs.On my Separated by a Common Language blog, WotYs have a transatlantic twist. Honours are bestowed on expressions that have moved from the US to the UK and vice versa. The vice versa often surprises people – at least those convinced of the virulence of ugly Americanisms.2018’s US-to-UK word of the year is “mainstream media” or MSM. Its UK-to-US counterpart is “whilst”. Both tell stories of how and why words travel to other nations and what happens when they get there.“Wait!” I hear some cry. “Mainstream media is two words! Disqualified!” But I ask: how do you know it’s two words? Because it has a space. How do you know where to put the space? Between the words. The reasoning is circular. When lexicographers consider what to include in dictionaries or WotY lists, they consider pieces of language that need defining – expressions that are more than the sums of their parts.“MSM” is more than the sum of “mainstream” and “media”. Before “media”, “mainstream” takes on connotations of “pre-internet” and “corporate”. The very use of the term (especially abbreviated) conveys what i columnist Mark Wallace calls “a sign of slight nuttiness”. This decades-old term gathered speed in the US in the early 2000s, with 911 and the rise of Fox News. In the UK, MSM has become much more common since 2016, only just meeting my WotY criterion that the word should be established in one country before having significant usage in the other.The UK-to-US WotY is far more established in its home country – dating back to Middle English. English colonists took “whilst” to America, but within a few decades of independence, their progeny had dropped it, favouring the more common and older form “while”. In the 2010s, American language commentators have been noticing “whilst” in the writing of younger Americans – first in university essays, and now on social media.These WotYs give interesting glimpses into the transatlantic word trade. In 12 years of US-to-UK WotY-choosing, I’ve mostly observed adoption of words that bring new meaning or nuance, rather than like-for-like replacement. MSM is such a case, as are bake-off (2014’s WotY), which signals more than a simple baking competition, and Black Friday (2013), which may be an abomination but poses no threat to British words. Everyday British (and non-American) words – the motorways, jumpers and aubergines – rarely budge. Britain borrows words from the US for the same reason it borrows German or Arabic words – to add to the range of meanings that can be expressed concisely in the language.When words change place, meanings often shift too. For instance, 2007’s US-to-UK WotY “cookie” has a British meaning that is far more restricted than its American namesake’s. It had to carve out its own space in a different baking culture. When MSM landed in a different political and media environment, it seemed to shift as well. In recent US usage, MSM mostly signals a rightwing belief in a leftwing bias in allegedly neutral sources. But in the UK environment, MSM is prevalent in the internet commentary of Tommy Robinson and Jeremy Corbyn supporters alike.The “we’ll all talk like Americans soon” myth depends on the belief that the trade in words is unilateral and eastward, US to UK. But the case of “whilst” demonstrates that Americans are exposed to British words enough to use them too. Some UK-to-US WotYs have added new meanings to American English, for instance “vet” (a candidate 2008) or “gap year” (2014). Others, like “ginger” (redhead 2010), “bum” (bottom 2013) and “gutted” (2016), express meanings that already have words in the US. It’s tempting to think of this as the Harry-Potterification of American English, with younger Americans exposed to words that their parents don’t use, and then adopting them – either because they don’t perceive them as foreign or because they have British cultural cachet.Transatlantic WotYs differ from dictionary WotYs in that they are typically less “of the year”. Occasionally a transatlantic word parachutes on to new shores with a splash, but mostly they swim in quietly, building up usage. It’s when people start to complain about them that you know they’ll probably stay for a while.• Lynne Murphy is professor of linguistics at the University of Sussex and author of The Prodigal Tongue: the Love–Hate Relationship between British and American English"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0dd684fce0c78cd150c6cbfd26652e3ec9d4154b/0_197_5927_3558/master/5927.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=acfac18c3e6f5630005070f14fce713b","title":"turning water into wine how did simple h2o become a luxury commodity","story":"From crystal infusions to water sommeliers and even bottling the frequency of rainbows, the top end of town has well and truly cashed in on the world’s most vital resourceOver the last few years, an unusual and conspicuous sight has become commonplace in the cafes and eateries of Sydney’s inner suburbs: Frequency H20 Alkaline Spring Water. The water, which costs AUD$3.30 per 1 litre bottle, proclaims to be infused with the sound, light and literal frequencies of three very abstract “flavours”: Love (528Hz), Lunar (210.42Hz) and Rainbow (430-770THz).Last year, Love became the first Australian water in nearly three decades to place first in the best bottled water category of the prestigious Berkeley Springs International Water Tasting. Its creator, Sturt Hinton (not a typo he’s ironically named after the desert), meets me in his local vegan fish and chip shop. It’s one of 400 stores he personally delivers his product to whenever stocks run low.“It’s about lifting the spirits of the world, you know what I mean? And lifting my spirits,” he says. He was inspired to create Frequency H20 after a lengthy bout of crippling depression. “Just bringing delight to people, and it delivers this promise to consumers through having something so high quality and people can taste it. They can feel the difference. It’s clean, it’s light, they just love it. They love the idea. What a wonderful concept. Beautiful water.”The story of Frequency H20 was enough to pique the interest of Katy Perry (whose management requested it during her recent Witness tour), Paris Hilton (now following @frequencyh2o) and the Veronicas, who share their appreciation online with such vigour they could be unofficial brand ambassadors. Following this year’s Berkeley Springs victory, the Australian government at large even took note, with Austrade selecting it for the official Commonwealth Games showcase. Though he claims to have invested $100,000 in its development, Hinton is unwilling to discuss the unique device he claims he designed (“It’s not like Coke is going to give up their trade secret.”) that produces his water by harnessing “the incredible natural alchemy of energised molecules”. He does acknowledge this nebulous air of naturopathy is central to its appeal. That and the trending but increasingly dubious belief that alkaline water is better for you than regular tap water.In the luxury water business, a free good is repackaged and resold as aspirational. “I think it’s like the most marketable thing ever invented,” Hinton says.The core of this concept of “fine water” might seem like a new phenomenon, but in fact it dates back to the Roman empire, where certain aqueducts were preferred, or even considered ine, and natural carbonated water was imported from Germania in earthen jars. The industrial revolution would literally poison the well, as drinking water became a vector for diseases like typhus and cholera. The rich could afford to have unspoiled water delivered from remote sources poor people simply died until municipal chlorination in the early 20th century helped people live longer.Bottled or otherwise, there are now more people on earth consuming more water than ever before, and climate change just might be contributing to an increasing dearth of it with longer and more intense droughts.The story of water, then, is the story of the world – and the luxury industry is cashing in.Hinton’s frequency-infused industry darlings are just the tip of the iceberg. Some premium waters such as Svalbarði, sold locally for A$115 per 750ml bottle, are literally made from icebergs harvested on expeditions to the Arctic Ocean. Water bottles with crystals in them and crystal-infused water like that of Australia’s Madam Dry (A$49.99 per 12 pack) are trends within a trend, inspired by Instagram’s wilderness of “wellness”, the regimens of Miranda Kerr and there’s that naturopathy again: Madam Dry lists what astrological sign the moon was traveling through when “brewing” commenced. Premium, luxury or fine water has even co-opted much of the wine industry’s terminology – “varietal”, “mouthfeel” “terroir” – as well as introducing some of its own. “Total dissolved solids”, for instance, is a measurement scale unique to understanding why and how a water tastes and even feels the way it does. Water from the Fiji Islands, with its TDS of 222, is said to be smooth and velvety. Water like Vichy Catalan from Spain, with its TDS of 3054, is said to be extremely salty and complex.The phenomenon isn’t particularly new. In 2005, “water sommelier” Martin Riese caught the attention of the media when he created a water menu at Berlin’s First Floor restaurant after a guest complained about the taste of the water on offer. By 2008 he’d published Die Welt des Wassers (The World of Water) in 2010 he was certified by the German water trade association and in 2013 he landed in Los Angeles, after receiving an O-1 visa for his “extraordinary knowledge of water”.As the country’s first certified water sommelier, he launched a 45-page water menu at Ray’s \u0026amp Stark Bar. Two days later, he was a national curiosity, covered on Good Morning America, Fox News and CNN, and even interviewed by television science presenter Bill Nye. He opened a $100,000 bottle of water for a tasting with Diplo and 2Chainz. He appeared on late night host Conan O’Brien’s show in September 2013.“Pretty much every day, I have people rolling their eyes when they hear the words ‘water sommelier,’ and when I even tell them that I can match water to food, more eye-rolling starts,” Reiss says. But, he stresses, he is driven by a loftier goal. “I want to give value to water. When people understand that water is not just water, they might rethink their use of water.“Here in America, people do not even know anymore where the water is coming from. They think that a purified water is the same as spring water. Purified water finds mostly its origin in the municipal water system, so it’s actually tap water, which is already processed then filtered and with very small amounts of minerals added. The end product is a highly processed beverage from a factory. On the other hand, you have waters which are coming from a natural occurring source, like a spring, glacial, aquifer and so on. These waters are barely treated and you can actually taste the water’s origin. In wine terms, you would call it terroir.”There had been five schools around the world where it was possible to become a certified water sommelier: two in Germany (one being the prestigious and original Doemens), one in Italy, one in China and one in South Korea. On 1 August last year, Riese established a sixth in the United States with his business partner and Fine Water Society founder, Michael Mascha. They recently certified their first water sommelier in Myanmar after three months of online courses, a verbal examination and a final project.Mascha says most people in the industry would consider him an early catalyst for what the market now considers fine water. His own origin story has a familiar flavour: like Hinton, water saved him. In 2002, he says, his doctor told him “you can live or continue drinking alcohol”. He founded the Fine Water Society that same year, a sprawling, invite-only index of fine water from around the world that serves to define, explain and promote the ever-swelling industry.“The water we are drinking is actually older than our planet,” Mascha says – and that in-built cosmic intrigue lends itself to all kinds of stories.“We see a lot of claims around water. Microstructured, wetter, smaller molecules, alkalinity, frequency … those are all marketing messages created as there is no other story to tell,” he says. “There is no source or history to the water. It comes from a factory and the stories are made up to confuse.“Michael Pollan, a USA-based food writer, famously believes: ‘When it says “healthy” on the package, it is probably not.’ Great water,” Mascha continues, “comes from unspoiled sources and they are usually remote.”Jamal Qureshi’s Svalbarði water, for instance, is made of ice gathered from the glaciers in Kongsfjorden, part of the titular Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard. That A$115 bottle might seem exorbitant to the layperson but it is far from the most expensive fine water on the market. That honour goes to Acqua di Cristallo Tributo a Modigliani, a bottle of which sold for the jawdropping sum of £39,357 for 750ml in 2010, making it the most expensive bottle of water in the world according to Guinness, thanks in no small part to the bottle itself being 24-carat gold. Svalbarði, meanwhile, has drawn an incredible amount of attention to itself with a fable of production the envy of any winemaker.Qureshi stumbled over the Svalbard region when he was young and travelling obtaining water from it is “an extreme logistical and cost challenge” which he saw as marketing potential for a “brand that stands out to consumers”.“Having a bottle that could match the story and be worth a purchase almost in and of itself was also critical. People have a ‘wow’ moment when they see it. Then when they see pictures of the ice gathering it is always a second ‘wow’ moment.”Qureshi, who holds regular water tastings, explains that as with anything we put in our mouths, smell, taste and feel are vital. “Proper water should generally not have smell, which tends to be a sign of taint that is not good. Odourless is best. Mouthfeel is the other major component. From super light, airy, and smooth like Svalbarði, to creamy textures, to very mineral-heavy waters that start to almost have a tangible, ‘solid’ feel in the mouth. Carbonation obviously has a huge impact on mouthfeel as well, from very gentle bubbles to big and bold ones.”Qureshi sees a social responsibility in his work too.“We aren’t gathering sea ice,” he says of Svalbarði. “The icebergs are carved off of freshwater glaciers. Obviously we are gathering them from the sea and as such we are constantly reminded of the problems of rising sea levels and plastic pollution in particular.” Because of the latter, they use glass bottles because of the former, they are carbon neutral, and are “now going carbon negative, so that each bottle will help actually preserve a piece of the Arctic ice cap.”Qureshi recently moved his family from the States to Svalbard, close to where the whales now sing more deeply to hear each other over the noise of melting icebergs. “Living in Svalbard these issues have become very personal. I walk on the beach here in the middle-of-nowhere Arctic and pass by discarded plastic fishing nets that have washed in from the middle of the Atlantic. We live daily with freakishly warm temperatures, for this part of the world anyway, and I watch how the glacier fronts are retreating. I talk to old-timers and see their pictures of how the fjords used to freeze and no one could get a ship in here for five months in the winter. Now the local fjord hasn’t frozen in a decade and it rained this past January when it should have been -20C.”Water sommelier Reise also sees himself as an advocate for a vital resource. “By promoting fine water, I hope I can do my part to protect areas around the world and open people’s mind that water is so much more than just a commodity.” He cites his involvement with Viva Con Agua, a charity in Hamburg that seeks to improve drinking water in developing nations. “I fight for people who don’t have access to clean and safe drinking water. I hope I can spark conversations with my water menu about the topic of water in general. The more we know about water the more we will protect it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db21e32b21d991b77c9523cb16b3af884e2f9876/0_324_4928_2956/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0816bf11de5b13fe47cec689e9f3b80","title":"national parks shutdown impact joshua tree yosemite yellowstone","story":"Human feces, overflowing garbage and damaging behavior reported as staff hampered over busy holiday period Human feces, overflowing garbage, illegal off-roading, fights over camping spots and other damaging behavior in fragile areas are beginning to overwhelm some of the American west’s most popular national parks, as a partial government shutdown left the areas open to visitors but with few staff on duty.Camping will be suspended in Joshua Tree national park, California, from Wednesday because of the chaos.“It’s a free-for-all,” Dakota Snider, 24, who lives and works in Yosemite Valley, in northern California, said , as Yosemite national park officials announced closings of some minimally supervised campgrounds and public areas within the park that are overwhelmed.“It’s so heartbreaking. There is more trash and human waste and disregard for the rules than I’ve seen in my four years living here,” Snider said.The 11th day of the partial government shutdown, amid rows over federal funding and immigration issues, has forced furloughs of hundreds of thousands of federal government employees. This has left many parks without most of the rangers and others who staff campgrounds, enforce rules and otherwise keep parks running.Unlike shutdowns in some previous administrations, the Trump administration was leaving parks open to visitors despite the staff furloughs, said John Garder, the senior budget director of the not-for-profit National Parks Conservation Association.“We’re afraid that we’re going to start seeing significant damage to the natural resources in parks and potentially to historic and other cultural artifacts,” Garder said. “We’re concerned there’ll be impacts to visitors’ safety.”Spokespeople with the interior department did not respond to requests for comment.Jeremy Barnum, a National Park Service spokesman, had said as the shutdown took hold that “national parks will remain as accessible as possible while still following all applicable laws and procedures.” In practice, that has meant many park toilets were closed or filled to overflowing and acutely unable to deal with the larger crowds entering over the holiday period and taking advantage of the fact that many fees are not being charged during the shutdown. Campers at Joshua Tree national park in southern California’s deserts were reporting squabbles as different visitors laid claims to sites, with no rangers on hand to adjudicate, said Ethan Feltges, who operates the Coyote Corner gift shop outside Joshua Tree. Now all camping facilities in the park will be shut from noon on Wednesday, the authorities announced.Feltges and other business owners around Joshua Tree had stepped into the gap as much as possible, hauling trailers into the park to empty overflowing trash bins and sweeping and stocking restrooms that were still open, Feltges said.“The whole community has come together,” Feltges said. “Everyone loves the park. And there’s a lot of businesses that actually need the park.”Most visitors were being respectful of the desert wilderness and park facilities, Joshua Tree’s superintendent, David Smith, said in a statement.But some are seizing on the shortage of park staffers to drive off road illegally and otherwise damage the park, as well as relieving themselves in the open, a park statement said. Joshua Tree said it would begin closing some campgrounds for all but day use. Meanwhile, some visitors have strung Christmas lights in the protected Joshua trees, many of which are hundreds of years old, the Los Angeles Times reported.At Yosemite, Snider, the local resident, said crowds of visitors were driving into the park to take advantage of free admission, with only a few park rangers working and a limited number of restrooms open.Visitors were allowing their dogs to run off-leash in an area rich with bears and other wildlife, and scattering bags of garbage along the roads, Snider said.“You’re looking at Yosemite Falls and in front of you is plastic bottles and trash bags,” he said.In Yellowstone national park, private companies have picked up some of the maintenance normally done by federal workers. The contractors that operate park tours by snowmobile, buses and vans are grooming trails, hauling trash and replacing toilet paper at pit toilets and restrooms along their routes. The park is known for its geysers and delicate hot springs that are already notoriously vulnerable to human interference, as are Yellowstone’s bison, bears and other protected animals that have increasingly been threatened by humans getting too close.Nearly all roads inside Yellowstone are normally closed for winter, meaning most visitors at this time of the year access park attractions like the gigantic Old Faithful geyser or the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone valley using guides. Those guides are splitting the cost of grooming the trails used by their vehicles to keep their operations going, said Travis Watt, the general manager of See Yellowstone Alpen Guides based in West Yellowstone, Montana.Arches national park in Utah is closed because the federal shutdown means there no funds for snowplows and the roads are impassible, while Zion park further south has scaled back operations.There are reports of roads blocked by uncleared ice and trash causing three-hour tailbacks in Sequoia national park in California."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf6faa86ac791450bc87bb83e0d8aecad9abef16/649_1245_5143_3086/master/5143.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00cd703fb138d496639f74e53a064a54","title":"the stigmatised art of tattooing in japan in pictures","story":"The country’s ban on tattoos was lifted in 1948, but suspicion and their association with yakuza mobsters continues.

The film is Mary Queen of Scots, which stars Saoirse Ronan in the title role directing it has wrought many changes for the 42-year-old, Salford-born Rourke – not least exchanging the familiar embrace of a 250-seat theatre for a drenched Scottish hillside. “I’d be trying to direct more actors than you can even fit into the Donmar while it rained horizontally into my ear. I remember feeling that there had to be a German compound noun for that feeling when fewer Highland cattle than you had booked actually turn up.”The film follows the relationship between the Scottish queen and Elizabeth I, played by Margot Robbie. This is well-worked dramatic territory, and Rourke’s film is full of the exquisite costumes, dramatic battle scenes and eye-catching locations one associates with historical films, including occasional bursts of over-the-top period campery for good measure, such as David Tennant’s lavishly bearded John Knox who rails furiously against the unnatural spectacle of a woman on the throne. That “whore of Babylon”, he thunders, that “false Queen”.In other ways, though, the film is startlingly unconventional. For a start, Rourke has imported from British theatre a principle still unfamiliar in cinema: colour-blind casting. Bess of Hardwick, for example, is played by Gemma Chan, while Thomas Randolph, Elizabeth’s agent at Mary’s court, is portrayed by Adrian Lester. This has not gone down well in certain quarters. “I sometimes feel,” says Rourke, “that people’s reaction to a person of colour in a film is more an index of their prejudices than about having a real issue with authenticity.”And anyway, she says, turning a story into a film is already an exercise in make-believe. “Representation is an act of the imagination. Margot Robbie is Australian. Saoirse Ronan is Irish. Jack Lowden is Scottish and is playing an English person, which was probably the weirdest thing for people on set.”Lester, she adds, was an obvious first choice to play a shrewd diplomatic go-between. “Adrian was Peter Brook’s Hamlet. He knows more about this period in history, because of his depth of experience as a classical actor, than anyone else did on that set, except for perhaps Simon Russell Beale, who turned up one day to read Mary’s death warrant. Because of his exquisite finesse and subtlety as an actor, he is better equipped to play an ambassador than anyone else I can think of. Why would you not harness that talent and knowledge?”The other departure from convention reflects Rourke’s feminist eye. Her film is based on My Heart Is My Own, a biography of Mary by Cambridge history don John Guy that attempts to rescue the Scottish Catholic queen from some of the more lurid claims made about her, some promoted by the English Protestant court.“What’s happened to Mary is that she’s got a bit stuck in Tate Britain,” says Rourke. “She’s a bit like one of those pre-Raphaelite paintings, of which I’m not a great fan, where she is kind of a prone victim who has either just been killed or is ready for sex. She has become either a femme fatale governed by sexual appetites, or someone who is too wilful to be competent. Elizabeth is usually set up as a counterpoint, portrayed as iron-willed, calculating. I don’t think any of those things are quite true.”Rourke attempts to present a more subtle story, not just about “strong women”, but about two people who were also “gigantically vulnerable, sometimes confused about what to do, trying to work out what the political landscape was, fighting for the rights of their own bodies – stuff that we do now that is sometimes missing from those narratives.”The film has much to say about bodies: about the queens’ different calculations about marriage and producing an heir about the violence done to women by men about sexual pleasure about physical closeness between women friends about clothing as a projection of power and desirability. When I last saw Rourke, several months previously, she had been arguing with producers over the edit. She wanted to include scenes that showed Mary having her period, and another that showed her being given oral sex.“I was fighting for a period in a period movie,” she says. “Those were instructive discussions about how honest we were being about women’s bodies and what they do, women’s pleasure and what that is, and a queen’s body as a political canvas. I felt that was something I hadn’t seen before, that I just really wanted to show. There are not many of us who know what it feels like to be a crowned head of Europe – but what we do know is what it’s like to fight for the rights of our bodies.”She got her way in the end: the scenes are still there. “We need to show this stuff. It does need normalising. A journalist asked me how hard it was to shoot the scene where Mary has her period, and my answer was, ‘Not hard at all!’ There were six women in that room, and it was probably the thing that just most easily staged itself. But it does continue to freak some people out.”As for the cunnilingus scene, Rourke did not employ an intimacy director – a safeguarding role increasingly being discussed in the performing arts. Rather, she worked with the choreographer Wayne McGregor, who was movement director for the film. “I don’t think I’ve ever done a sex scene without a movement director, without treating it as a piece of choreography,” she says. “I hope the sex scenes feel truthful and alive. To think in a language of movement helps remove embarrassment, discomfort or shame.”Rourke is still in a tiny minority as a woman director in the mainstream film industry. But she is optimistic that this will change – and quickly. She was in her mid-30s when she became artistic director of the Donmar in 2012. “My experience in theatre is that the door opened a crack and let a few of us in – and people just kept flowing through. It’s important that this film succeeds, not because I am desperate for it to succeed, but so they will let a few more women through. That is the pressure I feel.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c8ec05be4720bdd402acf10b21c25b7abe7333a/0_98_4580_2748/master/4580.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1842916b122133f86aed85cb09d49555","title":"cardiff craig bellamy complaint investigate","story":"Cardiff City are investigating a complaint made against their Under-18s coach Craig Bellamy.The Daily Mail reported that the parents of a young English footballer have complained to the Premier League club about Bellamy’s behaviour towards their son, who has since left the club.The Cardiff manager, Neil Warnock, speaking after Cardiff’s 3-0 defeat to Tottenham on New Year’s Day, said that the club’s hierarchy were looking into it.“Ken Choo, the chief exec, is dealing with this,” Warnock said. “It’s not in my remit.

Against this background, we have decided to accept an extremely lucrative bid by Chelsea, given the low contract maturity.“Christian Pulisic is a character perfect player. I am sure that in the coming months he will do everything in his power to bring his high quality to the team and to achieve his sporting goals with his teammates at Borussia Dortmund.”Speaking to Chelsea’s website, Pulisic said it was “a privilege to have signed for such a legendary club and I look forward to working hard towards being a contributor to their team of world class players”.He becomes the most expensive American player in history, with Chelsea director Marina Granovskaia stating her delight to have signed “one of Europe’s most sought-after young players”.“Christian has shown his quality during a fantastic spell in Germany and at just 20, we believe he has the potential to become an important Chelsea player for many years to come,” she said. “We look forward to welcoming him to Stamford Bridge in the summer and wish him and Dortmund every success for the remainder of the season.’"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3dfc5a5afb7a8e6d418e792dea4031738702b5aa/0_2_1960_1176/master/1960.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7f1ef52113d723444662fc8dfa9ca4e","title":"secure speedy and at scale how to ensure your futures bright in the cloud","story":"Cloud technology has huge potential to grow businesses, but for data security and success, planning and staff involvement are as important as the telecoms infrastructure that drives itRadical advances in technology have come thick and fast in recent decades, but few have promised to revolutionise the way we work to the same extent as cloud computing.Offering the promise of unlimited data storage and fathomless virtual workspaces, the cloud is certain to remain a central component of our work systems, even as other tech advances are embraced by industry in the future.According to the CIO Tech Poll: Tech Priorities 2018 study, cloud spending is now a major priority for IT leaders. The report found that, after predictive analytics and business continuity recovery, they anticipate their biggest funding outlays will be on public and hybrid cloud systems.Take-up of cloud technology varies by industry, with discrete manufacturing forecast to spend the most – $19.7bn (£15bn) – by the end of this year, followed by professional services –$18.1bn (£14bn) – and banking – $16.7bn (£13bn) – according to International Data Corporation.The impact of this growth on jobs also varies by industry. The World Economic Forum (pdf) predicts that sectors such as business, financial operations and sales will see employment growth until 2020, as a direct result of cloud tech, while other sectors, such as office administration, will see negative growth.“With all new technology trends, you’ll see a scale of adoption with larger – typically more risk-averse – companies at the one end and smaller, more agile companies at the other,” says Gary Walker, chief information officer at AXELOS.Walker says that, in his experience, most industries are now considering some sort of cloud service, but the type and nature of its adoption differs by requirement and budget.These cloud configurations range from infrastructure as a service (IaaS) – a form of cloud computing that provides virtualised computing resources over the internet – to PaaS, a platform-based service that allows users to develop, run and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure. There’s also software as a service (SaaS), a software distribution model in which a third-party provider hosts applications and makes them available to users over the internet.Hybrid cloud is also widely utilised, combining on-premise, private cloud and third-party, public cloud services with orchestration between the two platforms. Walker says this is often favoured by firms taking their first steps with cloud computing: “This approach can take more upfront planning, but offers a quicker route to cloud adoption, allowing companies to deliver big benefits at the outset of cloud adoption to win over those holding the purse strings.”Information challengesAs with all technological advances of scope, though, there are potential roadblocks to the growth of cloud technology – the biggest of which is, arguably, security.But Mark Hill, chief information officer at technology recruitment firm Frank Recruitment Group, believes many of these fears may be unfounded. “While some of these concerns have been valid,” he says, “a lot of it is based on myth. Modern clouds, operated by big global providers, are by far the most secure platforms for data for the majority of organisations.”He argues that it’s actually control of data, rather than keeping it from the reach of external and unscrupulous hands, that is the real issue.“When you adopt the cloud, you are handing over both the car and the car keys, and while you can mitigate the risk, this is something that many traditional IT folks still find hard to accept.“A much more legitimate security concern is data residency and conflicting global privacy laws, but while the growing number of regional data centres around the world is helping to combat this, it is still often a challenge to overcome.”A company’s existing IT workforce is central to maintaining the sanctity of this data, but, he adds: “These people often don’t have the modern cloud skills, or willingness to change. They see the cloud as a threat, rather than as an opportunity.”A modern workforceSo securing this buy-in from a workforce is key when it comes to adopting cloud tech. The size and scope of a business can determine how difficult that is to achieve, Walker says.“Smaller organisations tend to be more accepting of large amounts of change, although their tolerance for continual change can be lower than in larger organisations,” he says.“That said, I’ve seen, in the past five years, organisations in highly regulated sectors that are now actively pushing transformational, digital-led change.“Many of these organisations have seen the success of small, agile, often wholly digital organisations, and are seeking to mimic the success in their own companies.”The futureFor the cloud to continue evolving at pace, the adoption of faster data transmission speeds, via tech such as 5G, is hugely important.“It is the fundamental ingredient that will allow companies to enrich the user experience for end users and deliver the next generation of cloud-hosted platforms,” Walker says.He adds that while telecoms infrastructure used to be considered a “luxury”, it is now as essential to corporations and iniduals as access to water and electricity.“Mobile telecoms infrastructure,” he says, “is also helping to drive the move to always-on, always-connected equipment that allows for more efficient delivery of services – delivery of a service to an end user at the right time and place, automatically.”But he warned that despite the drive to expand such technology, it remained essential for the implementation of such new tech to be supported by the right processes.“Companies should always remember that the technology that underpins their agile innovation drive and cloud adoption, and which facilitates mobile working, always needs to be carefully and rigorously architected, designed and executed in a disciplined fashion.”To find out more about IT best practice for supporting cloud success, visit built on ITIL"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4851acee64704a233a3c8bcf883a4b1fb51ef798/0_101_2290_1374/master/2290.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f786d269cc94d1630cabf227e8a4e792","title":"follow your passion and change your life","story":"Some students, like Jamie Harding, choose to study what they think is a sensible course for their career. But when Harding realised his true love was the creative arts, he switched courses – and never looked backJamie Harding, 28, has been passionate about film and photography ever since he picked up his grandfather’s camera at six years old. Despite this, when he was choosing a university degree he felt he ought to opt for a traditional subject, and chose English literature with philosophy. However, it wasn’t long before he realised he needed to follow his passion. One year in, he switched courses to study creative media at Bath Spa University. “The uni let me change, which was nice,” he says. “In creative media you can do anything, so I decided to study photography and graphic design.”Students like Harding are sometimes put off studying a subject they’re passionate about because they think another may be more sensible. But choosing a degree closely linked to what you love can be good for your future career, as well as being more personally satisfying.Harding has now graduated and is a self-employed cinematographer. He loves his work. “It’s so exciting that there’s always a jump coming,” he says. “So I’m doing a TV pilot next month and that’s a new experience. Obviously film is terribly stressful, but you get to be smug about your work afterwards, which is really nice,” he says, laughing.Without the creative media course, Harding says he wouldn’t have been able to get where he is now. “One hundred percent it’s helped me to get work,” he says. “My work is 10 times better than when I started on the course.”Following your passion doesn’t mean that you will be taking the less career-focused option.Perhaps you dream of setting up a dance studio and want to study business, management and dance. Or maybe you’re interested in a career in commercial music, criminology, or international development and education.Another reason to pick a course you’re passionate about is that you’ll probably be better at it, Harding says. As you’ll be challenged and stretched intellectually, doing something that you love motivates you to stick in when the going gets tough.Once you’ve picked a course, it may be worth looking into the university’s scholarship programme. For example, students who enrol at Bath Spa University in September 2019 have the opportunity to secure £750 in their first year. There are three ways to qualify: by achieving better than predicted grades by displaying outstanding talent in the creative or performing arts or by achieving exceptional results of at least AAB at A-level, or the equivalent.Harding also discovered that the university offered plenty of advice and assistance in turning his course into a vocation he learned the practical side of becoming a creative professional, such as how to do taxes and set up a business. “I felt thoroughly prepared when I left,” he says. He met people at university with whom he still works regularly today. “Uni is a good way of making contacts and growing your voice,” he says. “If I didn’t go, I wouldn’t have the contacts I have now, which basically pay my rent. You can also use the university’s kit for free,” he says. “And you have three years to make films without having to pay for things like insurance.”Harding has no doubts he made the right decision to switch courses to one he was passionate about. “English and philosophy was fun, but I didn’t have an endgame with them,” he says. “Changing direction was the right thing for me – I have zero regrets.”For more information, visit bathspa.ac.uk"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3318994f724b574ee48a01cfaf4202d5f9c7b299/0_34_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b91ba024cc71993216c3ec641337fd55","title":"have you or your partner recently given birth share your experiences with us","story":"We’d like to hear about your physical and mental recovery after birthMost parents will tell you that nothing prepares you for the arrival of your first child.

Here are your stories and picturesAfter a classic London renting situation, where my partner and I had to live with a leak just above the bed for a month, we finally got the savings together to get a shoebox of our own. No leaks yet, thankfully. It was on the first or second day, while we were eating on the floor over a sheet (with a bit of wine in tumblers), and were laughing and looking out of the window, surrounded by an endless pile of boxes and bags, that I felt a sense of calm I had never experienced before.Lying on my swing seat in my garden, the sun shining and a gentle breeze through the leaves of the birch tree above me. My swing seat was the best purchase I ever made: I’m on holiday whenever I sit on it. Whatever my mood, it answers to it, whether I’m happy or sad, elated or exhausted, with friends or on my own, for breakfast, dinner, lunch or tea. It is the best thing.In the middle of a small barn, in May 2012 at the end of 48 hours of lambing, while sitting on a low hay bale the only human in a barn full of sheep. I am no farmer, and in that barn I was no more than a nursery maid. Sheep mums being mums and lambs being lambs. The nursery had a rhythm: when the skipping and eating stopped, there was a calm that absorbed me. At that moment, life was good, and I was a part of it. I was one of the flock.Social media has some great benefits, but it can easily become mentally and emotionally burdensome. So, when we went to Havana in Cuba we made the decision to stay in a casa particular, essentially a private home, that had no access to the internet, a phone signal or any of the other trappings of modern life. For two days, in a small farming town called Viñales, we truly switched off. In the months since, I have deleted my Facebook account, closed email accounts and use my phone only for keeping in contact with close family and friends.In the minute after my second daughter’s head had crowned. The midwives were chatting, laughing and taking care of everything. It would soon be just me and my baby, in a secluded newborn ward, where I could just breathe and see the changing light through the window. No criticisms, no complaints, no office politics, no prioritising other people’s moods, no factoring in bills to pay, no existing for others. Only this most real thing that we were still doing together. This was the start of our conversation, the one that will continue all our lives.Sitting on Pentire Head, near Polzeath, north Cornwall, on a sunny October day in 2013. Tucked out of the wind, feeling the sun on my face and listening to the waves crashing against the cliffs below. The sea was almost turquoise and I felt a moment of complete calm all was well with the world.In July 2016, I tagged along for a day on my friend Ralph’s fishing boat, hauling lobster and crab pots for him around the Eastern Isles of the Isles of Scilly. The best bit was halfway through the day, when we were sitting there on the water in the sun, a mile out to sea, eating our cheese and pickle sandwiches, drinking a flask of tea, and lobbing the crusts and the odd bit of crab bait to curious fulmars that had joined us. Marvellous.An afternoon in hospital in Montélimar in 2009, after having had all four wisdom teeth removed. They had been growing horizontally and should have come out when I was a teen. One day, at 40 years old, with my first ever real toothache, I was told by a dentist that they had to come out straight away. I was waking up from the anaesthetic and staring out of the window at the intense blue sky, watching huge clouds of steam floating up from the nearby nuclear power station. I am self-employed with two children, and moments like that are incredibly rare. For once, I was without a care in the world.I had been having relationship difficulties for some years, and one day snuck away to visit my daughter at university. It was the first time in a long time that I felt free. I didn’t have to watch what I said or did, as I knew my daughter loved me unconditionally. Every minute was precious: we talked, laughed, ate out, shopped and hugged. That day was my first taste of what our life could be if I had the courage to leave, which eventually I did.My first ever wild swim as an adult was September 2012 in a tarn in North Yorkshire, hunting for a friend’s lost mobile phone. However, I didn’t embrace the joys of intentional outdoor swimming until October 2017, and I’ve been addicted ever since. The impact of the water meant I could think of nothing else but what was happening to my body: the numbing of the fingers, the sense of needing to gulp air but attempting to slow myself down to regulate my breathing. The sense of foreboding that I woke up with that morning has gradually faded, and has been replaced with a sense of wonder at immersing myself in the elements.September 2016, lying on a sunlounger at night on the terrace of a hotel on a hill outside Fiskardo, Cephalonia, with my husband, Richard. Every night, we would sit there and look at the beautiful sky, with no light pollution, and watch the shooting stars. We did this for an hour, chatting or sometimes just staying silent. Sadly, Richard died suddenly from a heart attack the following April. Perhaps understandably, I haven’t felt as relaxed since as I did on that holiday.It was a bright, clear day in September in a sleepy part of northern France, and I had stopped with my family at a lake. The water was gloriously cold, and I felt alive. Treading water, I turned to look at my family on the empty beach, waving and laughing at me, and I felt absolute contentment at being somewhere so beautiful with the people I love most in the world. The sunlight created an almost perfect reflection of the surrounding arc of trees and I realised that I was miraculously happy.Being off-grid with no phone, no people, no food, books or noise (other than the occasional breeze and a few flies) in Rub’ al-Khali – AKA the Empty Quarter – one of the most beautiful, harsh and huge deserts in the world. Every year, I get dropped off deep in the desert and stay alone for three days, with enough water and shade to survive, and without any expectations on me or my time. There is no experience like it that has this level of silence and peace.Walking the Camino de Santiago in September to mark the end of four years of study. Two girlfriends and I walked the Camino Inglés, and the freedom from anything else other than the walk each day was incredibly liberating. Every morning, we convened at 8am, had breakfast and set off, walking steadily to our destination, pausing occasionally to take in different sights and appreciate the landscape as it unfolded before us. The feeling of release from our cares was amazing, and we are already planning our next walk, along the Portuguese coastal path.I recently started an oil-painting course. The first week was landscapes, and I spent three chilly hours in a field painting the view. It was the most relaxed and carefree I had felt in a long, long time. My painting was pretty dreadful, but it didn’t matter: I had tried something new and felt proud of myself.In October, I went on a school trip to the Turkish resort of Kusadasi. After a long day of studying, my friends and I were free for the night and went swimming together. Maybe it was the lack of adult supervision, the scent of the sea or the general comfort I had from being with my friends that made me feel so relaxed. We were as free as a bunch of 16-year-olds on a school trip could be, which isn’t much, but at least I felt as if I could do what I wanted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3367bd99fb5519f379348f89b90e71fd40c8379/1090_737_5241_3145/master/5241.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aefc31e73236fa45b23ef56550365a47","title":"how to get better at dating anything that doesnt involve late nights and alcohol is good","story":"After 18 months on the scene, I’m struggling to get anywhere. Can a love coach show me how it’s done?I once made the mistake of going on a Tinder date with an aspiring comedian. By the time our main courses arrived he had shared his full sexual history, including a graphic description of a foursome with some travellers he had met on a couchsurfing site. I had always assumed these were meant for people who needed a cheap place to stay, but apparently at least one doubles as a hook-up app for casual-sex enthusiasts who hate hotel room charges. Eventually, after a long speech on female independence, he told me that he only paid for dinner when the girl was “very attractive”, so I plotted my escape while we split the bill. I thought he would be happy to call it a night, but no such luck. As I scrambled to find an emergency Uber, he grabbed hold of my foot, asking if he could lick my “sexy” toes all night. I declined his offer and spent my journey home wondering if it’s possible to shower your own skin off.There have been plenty of other disappointing dates over the years, including Andy the monosyllabic advertising consultant, Will the food thief who wouldn’t let me finish a sentence, and a Greek racist who would only eat white dairy products. Other encounters have felt more like the icebreaker at a banking conference than the start of a Romeo and Juliet remake.We all know a bad workman blames his tools, so I decide to speak to my friends about my dating patterns. Never ones to hold back, they tell me that I am too judgmental, writing off good men for all the wrong reasons. Instead of giving someone a chance, I’ll leave after the first date because he can’t use apostrophes or doesn’t turn my stomach into a butterfly-filled frenzy of passion. They also tell me I’m too forgiving of narcissists and commitment-phobes, willing to make excuses for “complicated” blokes who frequently lose the ability to send text messages.Persia Lawson, dating coach and author of The Inner Fix, says that if you are repeatedly drawn to emotionally unavailable people, it is probably a defence mechanism. “People say they’re looking for a committed relationship, but when an available person comes along, they dismiss them due to lack of ‘spark’,” she explains. “In reality, they’re terrified of real commitment. There’s a sadomasochistic pleasure that comes with dating emotionally unavailable men.”As a dreamy flibbertigibbet who grew up with Disney movies as her primary source of spiritual guidance, it is tempting to wait for a prince to climb my hair and carry me off to an all-you-can-eat cheese restaurant. But instead of going 100mph or avoiding people who don’t take your breath away the second you meet, Persia recommends taking it slow. “Try rotational dating, where you meet different people for coffee, walks or a trip to the cinema or a museum. Anything that doesn’t involve late nights and alcohol is good, as drinking can influence your dating decisions in an unhealthy way and give you false confidence.”Her advice makes perfect sense. You wouldn’t expect to develop a close friendship overnight, so why do we expect so much from the people we date? Some of the best and most solid relationships develop over time, without instant infatuation to cloud your judgment.According to Lawson, it’s also important to be honest and avoid playing games. Provided you don’t turn up to a first date with wedding dress patterns and a list of possible names for your as-yet-unconceived child, there’s no reason you can’t be upfront about what you want.But when you have spent 15 years chasing players who have the emotional intelligence of a toothbrush, how do you change your ways and start choosing better men? Lawson says that rather than looking for the person I fancy the most, I should focus on shared values. “You need to have standards for yourself, but don’t be unrealistic or superficial. It doesn’t matter if a man isn’t three inches taller than you or a woman isn’t a certain weight. You can have preferences, but focusing on them too much is part of love avoidance and you keep people out by having strict specifications. The only thing you need to ask is how your date makes you feel about yourself as person. Do you feel comfortable? Do you share the same values? Do you want the same things?”Taking Lawson’s advice, I refresh my dating profile on Bumble and get swiping. After exchanging messages with a web developer called James, we agree to meet after work at a local pub. There will be booze involved, but I have set myself a deadline to come home at 9pm and finish some work. This also doubles as the perfect escape plan in case he turns out to be a homicidal maniac who collects human hair in jam jars. Although I have zero expectations, the date is a success and it is the most comfortable I have felt with a man in months. He is laid-back and has a good sense of humour, the kind of guy you could introduce to your friends without having to get them drunk first. When we say goodnight, he’s reserved and polite, a stark contrast to the men who have kissed me, declared their undying passion and then disappeared into the sunset in a cloud of sexy cologne. There was no instant chemistry, but we exchange a few messages the next day and he’s keen for us to have dinner together when we’re both free.In the meantime I arrange a coffee date with Luke, who works in advertising. Within the hour it’s clear that, while he’s a perfectly nice guy, there’s very little common ground and we don’t share the same sense of humour. I’m grateful I took Lawson’s advice to arrange a coffee date rather than dinner or drinks, where we might feel compelled to spend longer in each other’s company. We exchange a few messages afterwards, but it soon fizzles out.After a second successful date with James at an Indian restaurant, I arrange to meet up with an actor outside the V\u0026ampA museum. Usually I would be wary of flamboyant men, but he seems chatty and outgoing, totally different from the dry-humoured type of guy I usually go out with. I’m not sure if I fancy him, but I’m so impressed by his encyclopedic knowledge of Britney Spears albums that I am up for another date.The next week, James and I enjoy a few more PG get-togethers, before agreeing to meet up at the London Wetland Centre to see the otters. To his credit, he doesn’t complain when I insist we queue up in the cold for a good view at feeding time, and we spend the rest of the day sharing newly acquired trivia about mustelids. He also gets bonus points for not pretending to be with someone else when I jump up and down, squealing: “Look how cute the otters are!”I don’t know if my refreshed approach to dating will lead to happily ever after, but keeping an open mind is helping me to enjoy the process again. For now I’m ready to forget the fairytale myth and enjoy online dating for what it is: a chance to meet interesting people and explore new parts of town.

The world’s largest entertainment group is banking on its content clout to help make its relatively late entry into the market a success. The AT\u0026ampT-owned WarnerMedia is also prepping a service that will include content from HBO, Turner and the Warner Bros film studio. WarnerMedia has not been as combative as Disney in pulling content from Netflix. But Netflix’s willingness to pay $100m (£78m) to keep Friends for one more year – at which point WarnerMedia will have to decide whether to keep it exclusively for its own service – highlights the value of crowd-pulling content and the problems Netflix could face if media companies reassess their content strategies. Netflix previously paid $30m a year for Friends, which has proven one of its biggest hits globally.“Netflix is facing increased competition from some of its previous content suppliers,” said Richard Broughton, an analyst at Ampere Analysis. “Despite its major focus on original content the company is still hugely reliant on licensed content for subscribers and that carries risks.”Netflix will also be looking over its shoulder at Apple, which is widely expected to launch a global streaming service this year.Netflix built its reputation and audiences from expensive dramas, such as The Crown. It has recently started to focus on cheaper, yet popular, unscripted shows – snapping up the Channel 4 reality show The Circle to make it in multiple markets – with the Netflix CEO Reed Hastings highlighting the value of such fare. “Unscripted television has always been a hugely profitable sector,” says Lucas Green, head of content at Banijay Group, maker of shows including Survivor, Temptation Island and Wife Swap. “Drama has always got the headlines and red carpet treatment. Yet gameshows, quiz, reality TV, dating, baking and talent shows are highly returnable, faster to produce, more cost efficient and therefore lower risk. ”The company has been very bullish on the prospects of the Asia-Pacific region, particularly India. But Netflix’s pricing makes it a premium service compared with pay-TV and streaming rivals in many of these new markets and it may have to cut prices – meaning it will need more subscribers. Which rival will be the biggest threat to Netflix? Broughton reckons it is Amazon: “If I had to put my money somewhere it would have to be on Amazon. New players like Disney and WarnerMedia will need a lot of time and marketing to break into households, and who else will want to licence content to them? Amazon has the deepest pockets. Its catalogue is by far the largest, even if a lot of the content is quite old, and it has been exploring sports rights and other areas other players aren’t. ”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d272b80e3d728e8f8989318fc012fee6831ed98d/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa9ab1115183e9065c612528052d4c44","title":"what would you like us to cover in 2019 share your thoughts","story":"We want to know what you hope to make space for next year and what you would like to see us cover Last year we published a piece detailing readers’ hopes for 2018’s  coverage, from continuing the fight against fossil fuel disinvestment to “making space for all things vegan”.We now want to hear what you would like us to report on in 2019.

A further tweet stated: “Just so in 2019 you know where I stand.”He affirmed, “From now on I’m performing with my mutherfucking hat on,” in reference to the Make America Great Again hat associated with Trump’s presidential campaign that he frequently wore in 2018. In December, Pusha T – whose 2018 album Daytona was produced by West – told The Daily Show that West had stopped wearing the hat. Pusha T has described the accessory as “this generation’s Ku Klux hood”.West explained his attraction to the Maga hat: “One of my favorite of many things about what the Trump hat represents to me is that people can’t tell me what to do because I’m black.”In late October, West – stung by ultra-conservative commentator Candace Owens falsely claiming he had described the logo for her “Blexit” campaign designed to deter black Americans from voting Democrat – said: “My eyes are now wide open and now realize I’ve been used to spread messages I don’t believe in. I am distancing myself from politics and completely focusing on being creative!!!”In a tweet stating “2024”, West seemed to allude to his previously discussed ambitions to run for president. In early October, West met with Trump in the Oval Office and monologued about race relations, tax breaks, criminal justice and mental health and described the Maga hat as a “Superman cape”.West also deleted a series of tweets aimed at Drake, with whom he is feuding. One tweet called out the Canadian rapper for following his wife, Kim Kardashian West, on Instagram. Drake appears to have unfollowed the reality star.Last month, Snoop Dogg criticised West’s social media outbursts: “He acting a plum damn fool,” the rapper said in a video posted to Instagram."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ec863e9d6fad0875225a5ddd3bd3c29983d5d6b/0_0_4134_2481/master/4134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a61501640363e675f0a29c00cc696125","title":"corbyn tells may to strike new brexit deal labour can back","story":"Labour leader says PM should return to Brussels to secure deal with full customs unionJeremy Corbyn has said his priority is to vote down Theresa May’s Brexit deal and secure a new deal with the EU, a day after it was revealed an overwhelming majority of party members want the Labour leader to back a second referendum.Corbyn said Labour’s Brexit policy was “sequential” and suggested no decision could be made about backing a second referendum until parliament voted down the deal on offer. MPs are expected to hold the delayed vote on the deal in the second week of January.The Labour leader said May should return to Brussels to find a deal Labour could support once her version was voted down, including a full customs union.“What we will do is vote against having no deal, we’ll vote against Theresa May’s deal at that point she should go back to Brussels and say this is not acceptable to Britain and renegotiate a customs union, form a customs union with the European Union to secure trade,” he said.MPs are due to vote on the negotiated withdrawal agreement as well as a political declaration on the future relationship, which is not legally binding. Negotiations for any future permanent customs union with the EU would be likely to form part of the next stage of talks, once UK has agreed the terms to leave in March. The party’s policy is that there is a priority to force a general election and only afterwards a second referendum could be considered. Corbyn and several of his closest allies have been both publicly and privately sceptical of the policy and the Labour leader has said the party would pursue a Brexit deal even if it won a snap general election.“The issue of another referendum was of course one of the options, but that was very much after the votes have taken place in parliament,” Corbyn said on Wednesday.“We haven’t yet had a vote and I think the government really should be ashamed of itself. This vote has been delayed and delayed and delayed. This government is just trying to run down the clock and create a sense of fear between either no deal or May’s deal.”MPs are due to return to the debate on May’s negotiated withdrawal agreement after they return to Parliament on Monday.May has said she is seeking further legal reassurances from EU leaders about the permanence of the backstop agreement, which would keep the whole UK in a single customs territory with the EU until both sides agree on an alternative solution to prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland.The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, who is in Singapore, said May would will find a way to get her Brexit deal approved by parliament“When Theresa May comes back with those reassurances that she has been seeking from the EU that the deal that is on the table is not going to lead to us being permanently trapped in the customs union … she will find a way to get this deal through parliament,” Hunt said during a question-and-answer session following a speech in Singapore.Asked about the prospect of holding a second referendum on the deal, Hunt said it would be damaging to democracy and the social consequences of not leaving the EU would be “devastating”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3dd164fb226513f5f773a26d9df076062e0b57b6/0_429_4800_2879/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58b57a339ae6fbc134a9716198ab3d64","title":"grayling no deal brexit ferry contract company seaborne freight no ships","story":"Transport secretary says Seaborne Freight’s £13.8m deal is support for new UK businessChris Grayling has defended his decision to award a £13.8m contract to charter extra ferries to a “start-up” company that has no ships, as part of no-deal Brexit preparations.The transport secretary said he would “make no apologies for supporting a new British business” after widespread criticism of the award of the contract to the British firm Seaborne Freight, which has never previously operated a similar service.“It’s a new start-up business, government is supporting new British business and there is nothing wrong with that,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.“We have looked very carefully at this business, we have put in place a tight contract that makes sure they can deliver for us. I don’t see any problem with supporting a new British business.”He said the firm would be ready to deliver services from April and had been “looked at very carefully by a team of civil servants who have done due diligence on the company and reached a view they can deliver”.The contract is one of three agreements worth a total of £107.7m signed by the government to help ease congestion at Dover by securing extra lorry capacity in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Seaborne hopes to operate freight ferries from Ramsgate from late March, beginning with two ships and increasing to four by the end of the summer.The local Conservative councillor Paul Messenger was the first to raise concern in public about awarding such a lucrative contract to a firm with no prior experience. “It has no ships and no trading history so how can due diligence be done?” he told the BBC.He said the company had not moved “a single truck in their entire history … I don’t understand the logic of that”.Grayling dismissed the criticism on Wednesday, saying: “I am not quite sure what an inidual Conservative councillor would be able to tell us.”He said the Department for Transport was confident the ferries would run by April. “We haven’t plucked this out of thin air,” he said.Seaborne was established two years ago with the aim of running freight ferries between Ramsgate and Ostend in Belgium. The company said it had been financed initially by shareholders to source suitable vessels and make arrangements with ports as well as building the infrastructure and crewing the vessels.“It was intended to start the service in mid-February but this has now been delayed until late March for operational reasons,” the firm said in a statement earlier this week.MPs are due to debate and then vote on Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement after they return to parliament on Monday, amid warnings that there could be a no-deal Brexit – or no Brexit at all – if it fails to win their backing.The prime minister is under pressure to win fresh concessions from Brussels to allow the deal to get through the Commons, after the December vote was pulled in the face of almost certain defeat.The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, told Today MPs could get “absolutely everything we want” from May’s Brexit deal.“We have a clear opportunity to leave the EU on 29 March,” he said. “It has the vast majority of things that people wanted, not absolutely everything. The question is, can we turn this into something that gives us absolutely everything we wanted, and I believe we can.“There will be some tough negotiations to follow in the years ahead but I think getting this clearer language on the backstop will help to get it through parliament.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/400ffc94d826c63d0310f9ad679a54d7aece67ec/1393_692_4470_2682/master/4470.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb04d35cf0b2df387574d5260afb8b5a","title":"most labour members believe corbyn should back second brexit vote","story":"Official Labour policy is that a second referendum could potentially be considered if there is not a general election. However, Corbyn is publicly lukewarm on the idea, and prompted dismay among some party activists last month by saying he expected Brexit to happen even if Labour won a snap election.Corbyn is facing intense pressure from some in the party to change course, with one pro-remain party group pushing for a motion that Labour would guarantee a referendum if there was a general election.The study, part of the Party Members Project led by Prof Tim Bale of Queen Mary University of London, found that while Labour members still strongly supported their leader overall, they appear both distanced from his views on Brexit and, for some, sceptical about his motives on the subject.The findings “increase the pressure on Labour’s leader to get off the fence”, Bale said. “If Jeremy Corbyn genuinely believes, as he has repeatedly claimed, that the Labour party’s policy should reflect the wishes of its members rather than just its leaders, then he arguably has a funny way of showing it – at least when it comes to Brexit,” he said.Bale said Corbyn “does need to think carefully about whether his ambiguity on the issue is quite as cunningly clever as many commentators seem to believe”.He added: “It is because, if Corbyn carries on like this, then Labour risks losing some of the members on whom it’s relying to give it the activist edge over the Conservatives at the next general election.”A Labour spokesman said: “As unanimously agreed at Labour party conference, if Theresa May’s botched Brexit deal is voted down in parliament then a general election should be called. In line with the policy agreed at conference, if the Conservatives block a general election then we will keep all options on the table, including the option of campaigning for a public vote.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e915410f33fbd730e58450925c11b1fa3e3f35d/178_231_3226_1935/master/3226.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=570d83d4df0698cca0ea3756b0373880","title":"people crossing channel not genuine asylum seekers javid","story":"Home secretary questions whether migrants are genuine asylum seekers as charities criticise harsh languageSajid Javid has questioned whether migrants using boats to cross the Channel are genuine asylum seekers, as refugee charities urged the home secretary to use more compassionate language.The home secretary has already faced criticism for describing those making the perilous journey as illegal migrants. Speaking on a visit to Dover, Javid questioned why people making the journey had not sought asylum in the first safe country they entered.“A question has to be asked: if you are a genuine asylum seeker why have you not sought asylum in the first safe country that you arrived in?” he said. “Because France is not a country where anyone would argue it is not safe in any way whatsoever, and if you are genuine then why not seek asylum in your first safe country?”Javid also appeared to suggest asylum seekers should be deterred from making the crossing by making it harder to gain asylum, a right enshrined in international law.“Also, if you do somehow make it to the UK, we will do everything we can to make sure that you are often not successful because we need to break that link, and to break that link means we can save more lives,” he said.In recent days, the home secretary has repeatedly referred to people making the Channel crossing as “illegal” migrants, though it is not against the law to seek asylum.Earlier this week, Javid told Sky News: “Our job here is to make sure this doesn’t turn into a new route for ever-increased illegal migration, so I want to stop it now as much as I possibly can.” Asked about his use of the term “illegal migration”, Javid skirted the question.Paul Hook, the head of campaigns at Refugee Action, said the home secretary’s words needed to be more compassionate.“These are people first and foremost and they deserve a humanitarian response,” he said. “We need an approach built on compassion and we hope the home secretary will demonstrate that in his words and actions in the coming days and weeks.”Mike Adamson, the chief executive of the British Red Cross, also said there was a need for a more understanding approach. “People only attempt perilous journeys like crossing the Channel because they are desperate,” he said.Javid said the government was doing everything it could to ensure boats found crossing the Channel were returned to France but acknowledged if Border Force vessels picked up people in UK waters, they would be taken to a port in the UK.Speaking earlier on Wednesday, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said Europe could not “close its borders” and said those coming to the UK by boat were fleeing war and hardship.Corbyn said it was “obviously necessary to work with other countries” but critics should bear in mind the “humanitarian aspect” of those people risking their lives.“They are the product of wars, they are the product of human rights abuses, they are the product of environmental disasters. Europe cannot close its borders to them,” he said.The UK announced earlier this week it would deploy two extra Border Force ships to the Channel to try to disrupt the crossings in small and often unseaworthy boats across one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes.The numbers crossing the Channel are still small. About 100 have made the crossing since Christmas Day, though Javid cut short a family holiday and designated the increase in the number of crossings a “major incident”.The home secretary said two Border Force cutters would be redeployed as part of wider efforts to ensure the route did not become more popular and said it was a priority to prevent deaths.On Monday, a group of 12 Iranians, including a 10-year-old child, were interviewed by immigration officials after they came ashore near Lydd-on-Sea, in Kent. Six Iranian men were also found on a beach near Deal in Kent on Sunday morning.The Red Cross, which provides refugee support services across Kent including food parcels and clothing, said Iranian asylum seekers were often some of the most destitute.Iranians have made up the highest number of asylum applications to the UK every year for the past three years, though numbers have fallen, according to Home Office figures."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17d718e06c7558f45b1df407e4b61ba14ad77a64/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa2f317b6f14a94c6bbe37d64993d2f0","title":"foundling museum london bedrooms exhibition highlights child poverty","story":"Bedrooms of London exhibition captures children’s spaces in bedsits and hostelsSome of them resemble cells while others are striking because of their lack of toys, space and privacy. All of them are children’s bedrooms, or at least the space they sleep in, exhibited in photographs displayed by the Foundling Museum, in London.More than 30 pictures by Katie Wilson expose the dispiritingly grim living conditions of families in poverty and form Bedrooms of London, an exhibition that could be one of the most challenging of 2019. “There is something very haunting about the images,” said Caro Howell, the director of the museum. “It is the absences, the absence of space for a child to walk in, or learn to walk in, or play in. The absence of toys, the absence of privacy. Because the people are not there, the environment is speaking for them, they are very haunting.”The photographs will be shown alongside first-hand narratives of the families. There is, for example, the tiny hostel bedsit of Amelie, a baby’s cot next to the mother’s sofabed and no room for the child to crawl then there is the story of Sainey, 32, who went to London aged 15 as a domestic slave, never left, and cannot work because she is in the country illegally and cannot afford clothes for her growing children.“Bedrooms are supposed to be a place of comfort and emotional safety and love,” said Howell. “A child’s bedroom is supposed to be a physical manifestation of the love that those surrounding it feel. Seeing the images brings you up short.”The project is the outcome of two years’ engagement with families by the the Childhood Trust, a London charity that is also producing a book and report to send to policymakers.The trust’s chief executive, Laurence Guinness, said some of the hostels in which people were forced to live were like open prisons. “It’s like you’re living in a cell. You can go out whenever you like but you’ve got no money to go and do anything. You can’t really escape, people are trapped.”When they set out on the project they assumed most children would have their own bedroom. “Even a child poverty charity can be naive about child poverty,” he said. “Those at the very bottom don’t even have a bedroom any more.”The exhibition will be at the museum which is dedicated to the history of the Foundling hospital, founded by Thomas Coram in 1739 as “a hospital for the maintenance and education of exposed and deserted young children”.Guinness said he hoped the photographs would be shown in parliament, where policymakers can take action.But while the families featured in the photographs were down, they were not out, he said. “We got them together recently to let people comment on the pictures and the report. They were very motivated to help.“The overriding question was: ‘How can this create any change?’ That’s all we’re interested in is change. We are not defeated yet.”• Bedrooms of London at the Foundling Museum, 8 February-5 May 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/655bf1899ac323f2481c7617b67d4588e68241a4/82_38_3755_2252/master/3755.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac6568e76333c6cd7fb79bc6b9c81861","title":"andy murray comeback halted daniil medvedev brisbanes second round tennis","story":"Andy Murray’s winning start to 2019 came to a halt at the Brisbane International after he was beaten 7-5 6-2 by Daniil Medvedev in their second-round meeting.Murray, who continues to be affected by a long-term hip injury, overcame James Duckworth in his opening match of the year on New Year’s Day but was comprehensively beaten by Medvedev. The 31-year-old Briton has slipped to 240th in the world rankings following surgery on his troublesome hip and admitted after overcoming Duckworth that he does not know how much longer his career will last. Medvedev hit 16 aces to set-up a quarter-final appointment with Canadian Milos Raonic on Friday. “He served extremely well and I didn’t really get many chances on his service games,” Murray said. “And then on my own service games I made a few too many errors in the rallies, especially early on I was trying to play a little bit more offensive. “In the second set, I made a few too many mistakes, and obviously there was a period in the match from 5-5 where I lost six games in a row. When you play better players … they will expose any errors that you make in your game or any shots that you’re not hitting particularly well. And he did that.” Murray put up a fight in the opening set having slipped 3-1 behind, winning four of the next five games to seize a 5-4 lead. But the momentum changed with the score tied at 5-5 in the 11th when he failed to convert two break points to lose the game and then concede the set as Medvedev claimed the next six games. The second set was more one-sided as Murray, a two-time winner of the hard-court tournament which serves as a warm-up for the Australian Open, allowed Medvedev to power 4-0 ahead. A brief fightback that produced success in the next two games followed but Medvedev steadied to seal victory with an ace.Rafael Nadal cast doubt on his fitness for the Australian Open by pulling out of the Brisbane International before his first match.The Spaniard opted not to play his second match at an exhibition event in Abu Dhabi last week after tweaking his thigh and is worried about the risk of exacerbating the problem.It continues a trend for Nadal, who withdrew or retired mid-match during all but one of his hard-court tournaments last season. His final match of 2018 turned out to be the US Open semi-final against Juan Martín del Potro, where he pulled the plug at the end of the second set because of pain in his troublesome knees.After recovering from that, an abdominal injury sidelined him for the rest of the season and he began his pre-season preparations late after opting to have ankle surgery to clear up a persistent niggle.This latest issue is a dispiriting blow for the world No 2 but he will hope sitting out this week will enable him to be fully recovered for the year’s first grand slam, which starts on 14 January.Japanese lucky loser Taro Daniel takes Nadal’s place and faces Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the second round."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5afb045f6076af15b9ce27a4de3e7ad0e39e223/0_436_4734_2842/master/4734.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d01c7471a29d471e4542f951518593d0","title":"bold sports predictions for 2019","story":"On the heels of a sports year that was chock full of surprises,  US contributors make their bold predictions for the months to comeHere are our bold predictions for 2019 in sports. Please note the bold (or should that be bold?) in bold predictions: these are to be taken with a pinch of salt.That Woods could compete in illustrious golf company once more was demonstrated by strong performances in the 2018 Open and US PGA Championship. Subsequent victory at the Tour Championship proved a further, notable milestone for a player whose career seemed destined to peter out because of fitness troubles. The US Open’s return to Pebble Beach must have Woods licking his lips he won the event by 15 shots there in 2000 – as remains a tournament record – and was just three adrift of Graeme McDowell in 2010, just months after chaos had engulfed his personal life. The last 12 months proved that Woods can add a 15th major title to his CV. The third of the upcoming year provides ideal opportunity. EMAnthony Davis will join LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers. OK, maybe this isn’t exactly the boldest possible prediction since James’ wooing of the ridiculously talented New Orleans Pelicans center has reached the point where the NBA has issued a statement warning teams against tampering. The Pelicans probably won’t be able to hold on to their franchise player and it’s hard to imagine a better situation for Davis, or the league, than having him join James in LA. A LeBronDavis Lakers team could do damage in the Western Conference, especially if Kevin Durant leaves the Golden State Warriors in the dust, which I’m also predicting will happen. HFOn the surface, Harper is a free-agent dream. A so-called “generational” talent at 26 years old, and one with a career OPS of an even .900. Just about everybody, but everybody doesn’t have pockets deep enough to accommodate the outfielder. That means he’ll land in a big market, meaning greater expectations and pressure that Harper never truly felt in Washington. While DC is the sixth largest television market in the United States, it doesn’t play like a New York or an LA. If Harper lands in a big smoke, Harper will struggle to find his feet with expectations mixing into a formula that’s already produced inconsistent results. For example, Yasiel Puig, who may have been moved to help accommodate Harper’s would-be budget-busting contract, had a higher WAR than Harper last season: a paltry 1.3, albeit, mostly because of poor defensive numbers. Then again, he’s capable of hanging a 10 on the WAR scale, but that was three full seasons ago. That’s not the consistency you should expectant from a “generational” player. Buyer beware. DLHardened skeptics pooh-poohed Mayweather’s summit meeting with Pacquiao for happening far past its sell-by date and were partially vindicated by a one-sided fight that left customers feeling let down and ripped off. A rematch between now-quadragenarian icons, surely won’t do the record-shattering business of that poorly received 2015 blockbuster, but will no doubt be a money-spinning affair and another nine-figure payday for both men. Pacquiao, who won a secondary welterweight title belt in the summer, signed with longtime Mayweather adviser Al Haymon last month and is due to fight Adrien Broner on 20 January. Should the Filipino senator make it through unscathed, a rematch that nobody asked for will likely be announced for May or June. BAGGiven she is 13 in the world and hits the ball as hard as Serena Williams, picking 20-year-old Aryna Sabalenka to win a slam in 2019 might not appear to be that outrageous. After all, there have been eight different champions in the last eight majors. However, while that statistic alone describes the volatility and promise of the women’s game, Williams, at 37, is in the mood to build on her two 2018 finals in a comeback year of high drama - so Sabalenka and the other contenders will have that considerable obstacle to a breakthrough. None the less, she has more weapons than nearly all of her contemporaries. It could be the start of another era – even at Williams’s expense. KMMixed martial arts can feel insular or expansive depending on your perspective. The UFC is often regarded as the sun at the center of MMA’s solar system, and the start of its five-year relationship with ESPN in January should only strengthen the promotion’s brand recognition. Heading into 2019, however, MMA outside the United States, particularly Asia’s One Championship, is well positioned to capture American fight fans’ imagination in a way it hasn’t since Pride collapsed more than a decade ago. JGCurling is a quadrennial hit on TV, and waves of people have hit the ice to try for themselves. But US broadcasters simply don’t know how to handle the sport between the Games. NBC’s Curling Night in America broadcasts, recorded en masse early in the season and shown game-by-game over the next several months, simply don’t cut it. They just repeat the same talking points – especially this year, when they talk ad infinitum about John Shuster’s magical gold-medal run – instead of giving a breakdown of the tactics behind each shot and whether or not it succeeded, as we can see on the occasional Canadian broadcast picked up by ESPN3. Ironically, the same network that makes curling a personality parade (NBC) proved the Premier League can be a hit on American TV when commentators stop talking down to viewers and start taking it seriously. When someone takes the same approach with curling, viewers will take notice.

The German is being cared for at home in Switzerland.“You can be sure that he is in the very best of hands and that we are doing everything humanly possible to help him,” the family said in a statement that made a rare comment about his condition.“Please understand if we are following Michael’s wishes and keeping such a sensitive subject as health, as it has always been, in privacy,” it added.The family said an official Michael Schumacher app will be released on Thursday to enable fans to review all his career successes. The Keep Fighting Foundation has also created a virtual museum.“The app is another milestone in our effort to do justice to him and you, his fans, by celebrating his accomplishments,” the family said. “Michael can be proud of what he has achieved, and so are we ... we want to remember and celebrate his victories, his records and his jubilation.”Ross Brawn, who helped mastermind Schumacher’s success at Benetton and Ferrari, and has visited the former champion in Switzerland, says the driver’s wife, Corinna, and family are right to be guarded over the information they release.“I am constantly in touch with Corinna, and I totally agree with their decision,” Brawn told the Press Association. “Michael has always been a very private person and that’s been a guiding principle in his career, his life and his family always agreed with that choice.“It’s completely understandable that Corinna has wanted to maintain the same approach, even after the tragic event, and it’s a decision we must all respect. I’m sure the millions of people who are still Michael fans will understand it, too.”Schumacher won his first two titles with Benetton in 1994 and 1995 before five in a row with Ferrari between 2000-2004. He remains the sport’s most successful driver, with a record 91 grand prix wins. Britain’s Lewis Hamilton, now a five-times world champion with 73 wins, has already claimed several of the German’s records and could ultimately match his title tally if he continues his current rate of success.“Lewis is certainly capable of matching and surpassing Michael’s other records,” added Brawn, now acting as the head of motorsport for F1. “There’s no doubt that Lewis and Michael are amazingly talented. In fact, it’s their natural talent that unites them. The way in which they achieved their wins is where they differ.“Michael treated his driving career as though it was a mission to which he dedicated himself completely from the first to the last day. In some ways, Lewis has taken longer to find his way, and today it seems he has found that way more from outside the sport than from inside it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d7a9465b77599cc2191d6cd99397d334b48b3dc/562_2807_2494_1496/master/2494.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cca9bb01c10e97277ffb61bf61c10223","title":"thick and tight interview dance gruesome twosome 2019 arts preview","story":"From Hitler and Cath Kidston to Freud and Madonna, a dance-drag act makes unlikely pairings duet together About five years ago, in a room above a pub in Kentish Town, north London, I saw two dancers perform an odd duet. It was an unlikely concoction of surrealist parody, lip-syncing, drag and some heavenly contemporary dance, featuring a lineup of characters including Freud, Madonna, Hitler and Cath Kidston. It was scrappy, silly, hilarious, camp and a bit perverse. These people were on to something, I thought, but who on earth were they?The answer is Thick \u0026amp Tight, AKA Daniel Hay-Gordon, 30, and Eleanor Perry, 31. The pair met at Rambert dance school when they were 18. “I knew I wanted to be two very different sorts of performer,” says Hay-Gordon. “Working in opera houses, but also working in cabaret bars. I wanted to be an entertainer and I wanted to be a sort of, I don’t know how to express it … ” He searches for the words to describe a suitably arty dancer. “A high-class entertainer!”With a CV that takes in Pina Bausch’s Tanztheater Wuppertal and queer cabaret mecca the Royal Vauxhall Tavern, he’s achieved that aim. We talk on video call from Berlin, where he’s assisting choreographer Aletta Collins on an opera, and Daniel Barenboim passes by in the background. You don’t get more high-class than that.Perry, meanwhile, recently played a wicked Margaret Thatcher in Gary Clarke’s dance-theatre show Coal and danced with contemporary choreographer Julie Cunningham. It was she who sowed the seeds for Thick \u0026amp Tight, when she made a solo about Edith Sitwell for a scratch night at Marylebone’s Cockpit theatre in 2012. Hay-Gordon was living with her at the time, “and I’d set myself the task of trying to listen to everything Schubert had ever done, and trying to learn about him,” he says. “So we thought, let’s put these two people together. How would they interact? And that’s sort of become our staple.”Each of Thick \u0026amp Tight’s duets is like a Venn diagram linking an unlikely pairing. So Freud and Madonna, what they have in common is sex, obviously. For Hitler and Cath Kidston, it is presented as a crazed drive towards an idea of perfection. The performances are built from dance, mime, songs, and lip-syncing to audio clips from film and television to create atmospheric, sometimes claustrophobic, worlds where these gruesome twosomes coexist.In their latest show, part of the London international mime festival, Princess Diana and Marilyn Monroe are united by fame, mental illness and a desire to be loved, and the resulting piece is permeated by a huge weight of sadness. Another duet has the tone of an early horror film, and sees Perry playing Queen Victoria and Hay-Gordon as a slightly zombified Miss Havisham from Great Expectations. “Victoria is the epitome of widowhood, dressed in black, an icon of grief really,” says Perry. “And then you’ve got Miss Havisham, who was never married and is dressed all in white. So you’ve got these opposites, but what really connects them is grief and longing and unfulfilled desire. But they’re both quite monstrous really and probably quite difficult to be around.”The vignettes Thick \u0026amp Tight create have humour and travesty, but they can also be dark, unsettling and genuinely moving. The aesthetic might seem niche, but the themes are universal, cutting from high camp to something very human, and the use of dance elevates what could have been a clever skit into something much richer.The pair’s dance background informs everything they do. “Even though what we’re doing may be considered mime or theatre or cabaret or whatever, we are dance-trained and we apply that same discipline,” says Perry, talking about their approach to lip-syncing. “There’s something in that rigour that allows it to be highly emotional and highly dramatic, but it’s still got clarity and form. But at the same time as taking it very seriously,” she adds, “it is also just us two pulling a face.”• A Night with Thick \u0026amp Tight is at Lilian Baylis Studio, Sadler’s Wells, London, 17-19 January as part of London international mime festival."},{"url":null,"title":"unmissable theatre dance comedy 2019","story":"Blanchett and Hiddleston get sexual, there are chills in a Glasgow tower block, Matthew Bourne takes on the star-crossed lovers, plus Catherine Tate, Tim Minchin and Ben Elton return to the road by  Michael Billington,  Lyndsey Winship and  Brian LoganKatori Hall, who had a big hit with The Mountaintop about Martin Luther King, tackles the story of a Rwandan schoolgirl who in 1981 had ine visions warning of a coming genocide. Hailed at its New York debut in 2014, the play raises fascinating questions about the nature of faith and, with the aid of a community cast, gets a large-scale production from James Dacre. Royal and Derngate, Northampton, from 12 JanuaryCate Blanchett and Stephen Dillane head the cast of Martin Crimp’s new play offering variations on Samuel Richardson’s 18th-century novel Pamela. The original book is about a virtuous serving-maid’s efforts to resist her predatory master, but Crimp and his director, Katie Mitchell, promise a more modern take on the nature of sexual domination. Dorfman, London, from 16 JanuaryGillian Anderson and Lily James star in Ivo van Hove’s adaptation of Joseph Mankiewicz’s classic Oscar-winning movie about backstage bitchery and fame hunger. Previously turned into a Broadway musical, Applause, the story seems made for the stage with its portrait of loyal dressers, waspish critics and aspiring stars from the Copacabana School of Dramatic Art. Noël Coward theatre, London,  from 2 FebruaryA positive feast of Arthur Miller is on its way. Rachel Chavkin, fresh from Hadestown at the National, directs this little-seen study of the impact of the 1929 stock-market crash on one particular New York family and the wider society. It will be accompanied by the transfer to Wyndham’s (from 5 February) of Jonathan Church’s superb Bath revival of The Price. Then (from 15 April), Sally Field and Bill Pullman star in All My Sons at the Old Vic. But Chavkin gets in first with this neglected panoramic piece. Old Vic, London, from 4 FebruaryGitha Sowerby, daughter of a Gateshead glassmaker, scored an instant hit with her debut play in 1912. It’s the story of the bull-headed boss of a northern metalworks who dreams of handing on the business to his son, but who manages to alienate his family. When he meets his match in his daughter-in-law, it is as if the drama of Ibsen and Granville-Barker is being rewritten from a feminist perspective. Caroline Steinbeis directs this terrific, pioneering play.Crucible, Sheffield, from 8 FebruaryBrecht refuses to lie down. Anna Jordan promises “a sharp new version” of this masterly play about a woman who sacrifices her three children to profit in the wake of a seemingly endless war. Julie Hesmondhalgh plays the woman with a cart in Amy Hodge’s production, and it will be fascinating to see how it strikes the balance between emotional empathy and critical evaluation. Royal Exchange, Manchester, from 8 FebruaryLucinda Coxon has adapted Harriet Lane’s acclaimed first novel about a manipulative, books page sub-editor on a posh Sunday paper whose life is radically changed after she witnesses a car-accident. Part psychological study, part suspenseful thriller, the play is directed by Nicholas Hytner and stars Joanne Froggatt of Downton Abbey fame and Robert Glenister from Spooks. Bridge theatre, London, from 25 FebruaryTom Mothersdale, best known for Peaky Blinders, plays the king in a show directed by John Haidar that sets up a new model for co-production. Jointly presented by Headlong and Bristol Old Vic, it also plays at London’s newly restored Alexandra Palace, as well as in Manchester, Oxford and Northampton. But the excitement will be in seeing how a fast-rising young actor tackles Shakespeare’s satanic ironist. Bristol Old Vic, from 1 MarchFamously without walls, the National Theatre of Scotland takes over a Glasgow office-block to stage three plays set in 2040. The writers are Morna Pearson, Hannah Khalil and Vlad Butucea, and the aim is to show how intimate relationships may be affected by new technology: android carers are at large in an old people’s home, and corporations interfere in their employees’ baby-making. Cora Bissett directs this chilling futuristic trilogy. A Glasgow office block, from 16 MarchOriginally a 1983 Bill Forsyth movie, this Scottish story has now been turned into a musical. Forsyth himself and David Greig have written the book and Mark Knopfler the music and lyrics, and it still focuses on a Texan oil exec who plans to buy up a Scottish seaside village and replace it with a refinery. At a time of resistance to international land-grabbers and growing awareness of local identity, this looks like the perfect musical. Royal Lyceum, Edinburgh, from 19 March and Old Vic, London, in June 2020What is South Africa like 25 years after the first post-apartheid democratic elections? That is the question posed in this new play by the towering South African actor-writer John Kani, best known for Sizwe Bansi Is Dead and The Island. Kani also acts in the play opposite Antony Sher as one of two men reflecting on a quarter-century of dramatic change. Janice Honeyman directs a joint RSC-Fugard Theatre production.Swan, Stratford-upon-Avon, from 21 MarchLiam Tobin stars as the demon barber in Nick Bagnall’s production of Stephen Sondheim’s masterpiece. The brilliance of the show lies in its ability to combine a story of personal revenge with a portrait of social cruelty. It also has a strong element of mordant wit as shown in the unforgettable waltz-time number, A Little Priest.Everyman, Liverpool, from 12 AprilTennessee Williams’s take on the classic myth last seen on the UK stage in Hadestown. Here, a footlose guitar-player wanders into a southern town that is a vision of hell on Earth and falls for an ageing Eurydice, whose husband was behind an act of racist violence. Tamara Harvey directs a play that combines Williams’s early romanticism and sweatshirt realism.Theatr Clwyd, Mold, from 15 April and Menier Chocolate Factory, London, from MayMore Arthur Miller, as Marianne Elliott and Miranda Cromwell direct this 1949 classic with a cast to die for. Wendell Pierce, of The Wire and Selma, makes his UK stage debut as Willy Loman. The great Sharon D Clarke plays his wife, Linda, and Arinzé Kene, fresh from the West End run of Misty, is his son, Biff. With a team like that, a play once described as “a powerful tragic symphony” will undoubtedly acquire new resonances. Young Vic, London, from 1 MayLenny Henry heads the cast of a key play by the late, great August Wilson. Set like most of his work in Pittsburgh, it’s the story of a smooth-talking hustler trying to rebuild his life and start a family against the background of Reagan’s America in the 1980s. Nadia Fall, who has made a fine start in her tenure at a historic theatre, directs a play that promises to be one of the year’s highlights. Theatre Royal, Stratford East, London, from 15 MayEllen McDougall directs Thornton Wilder’s 1938 hymn to small-town daily life, which seems to have gained new popularity in our fraught, hi-tech age. As Harold Clurman once wrote, “There is a bit of this play’s snowball purity in the social memory of every American.” It will be fascinating to see how it adapts to an alfresco theatre in an English summer. Open Air theatre, Regent’s Park, London,  from 16 MayDavid Farr has adapted the admired 2012 film by Thomas Vinterberg and Tobias Lindholm. Like Vinterberg’s earlier movie, Festen, it deals with allegations of child abuse in a Danish setting. A key difference is that the milieu this time is a tight-knit, lower-middle-class community, and that the accused is innocent. Rupert Goold directs this chilling Danish morality tale. Almeida, London, from 17 JuneThe Comédie-Française pay a rare visit to Britain with Ivo van Hove’s spectacular staging of a Luchino Visconti movie. Like the film, the play is about a decadent family of German industrialists in collusion with the nascent Nazi regime. Archival footage and live recordings blend with the action in a show that puts 30 actors and technicians on stage. Barbican, London, from 19 JuneJack Thorne as writer and John Tiffany as director have previously collaborated on Hope, Let the Right One In and Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. Now they are reunited for Thorne’s provocatively titled new play, set in 1997, which deals with a family gathering. Given that the play unfolds in the year of Blair’s electoral triumph and that the hosts have named their children after socialist heroes, it sounds promisingly political.Royal Court, London, from 27 JuneThe modern narrative ballet could be seen as a form in crisis, but not in the hands of Cathy Marston, whose sensitive handling of storytelling and steps has both clarity and texture. She has spent much of the last decade working outside the UK, now we’re finally getting to see more of Marston after her excellent Jane Eyre for Northern Ballet in 2016, she’s now creating another work for the company, based on the life of Queen Victoria.Tour opens at Leeds Grand, 9 MarchOn what would have been Merce Cunningham’s 100th birthday, 75 dancers across three cities will dance a total of 300 solos by the legendary choreographer. As well as performances in LA and New York, 25 dancers in London, including Siobhan Davies, Jonathan Goddard, Harry Alexander and Royal Ballet dancers Francesca Hayward and Matthew Ball, will dance a solo from every world or European premiere that’s been previously presented at the Barbican. A brilliant birthday party.Barbican, London, 16 AprilFew choreographers can excavate and illuminate music in the detailed way of Belgian choreographer Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker, and so this interpretation of Bach’s cello suites is well worth investigating. The six suites are played in their entirety by French cellist Jean-Guihen Queyras, while five dancers, including De Keersmaeker, bring sound into three dimensions. De Keersmaeker’s ascetic aesthetic isn’t instantly gratifying to everyone, but even when she makes you work for it, the rewards are rich. Sadler’s Wells, London, 24-25 AprilA new Matthew Bourne show is always a major event in the dance calendar. The man who gender-swapped Swan Lake and turned Sleeping Beauty into a vampire tale tackles the ever-popular Romeo and Juliet. Bourne will be putting a contemporary spin on the tragic lovers and aims to keep it fresh by working with young associate choreographer Arielle Smith and drawing on a huge pool of youthful talent found through local auditions and community projects.Tour opens at Curve, Leicester, 13 MayYou’ll be totally spoiled for choice in this two-week residency from San Francisco Ballet, making their first visit to the UK since 2012. There are four programmes featuring 10 works, all UK premieres, all made in the last few years, including Arthur Pita’s Björk Ballet, set to Ms Guðmundsdóttir’s music and by all accounts bonkers. Plus, Alexei Ratmansky does Shostakovich, and a chance to see pieces by Justin Peck, Stanton Welch and Trey McIntyre.Sadler’s Wells, London, from 29 MayIt’s two years since character comic Tate brought her alter egos out of cold storage for a national tour. That show, directed by Sean Foley and delivered with relish and considerable skill, was better than we’d any right to expect from a TV tie-in – even if a few of the jokes were, like her best-loved character Nan, showing their age. Now, after a tour of Australia and New Zealand, Tate’s stage show is back to bovver the West End.Wyndham’s, London, from 7 JanuaryAmong several terrific 2018 shows hitting the road this year (James Acaster’s prominent among them), the latest outpouring of heartsickness and hope from Jessie Cave is not to be missed. Sunrise follows on from 2015’s I Loved Her, bringing us bang up to date with Cave’s efforts to be happy and single while co-parenting with promiscuous fellow comic Alfie Brown. It offers neurotic humour in excelsis, big insights into the human condition, and big laughs.Tour opens at Warwick Arts Centre, 24 FebruaryAn intriguing prospect, this: ex-YouTuber Guz Khan – the man behind one of 2018’s funniest BBC comedies, Man Like Mobeen – teams up with Palestinian-American act Mo Amer, last seen supporting Dave Chappelle and Jon Stewart at the Albert Hall. Fans of Man Like Mobeen, and anyone who’s seen Amer on his Allah Made Me Funny tours, can expect caustic but playful comedy about membership of a maligned minority.Tour opens at Leicester Square theatre, London, 28 MarchThe standup silverbacks are out in force later in 2019: Eddie Izzard and Jerry Seinfeld both take to the stage with new shows. So too – for the first time in almost 15 years – one of comedy’s most isive figures, Ben Elton. Is he alternative comedy’s biggest sell-out? Or a great entertainer whose talent s novels and musicals, sitcom and live comedy? Answers (perhaps) on the UK’s standup stages, this autumn.Tour opens at Cheese \u0026amp Grain, Frome, from 14 SeptemberTim Minchin spent four years making an animated movie, Larrikins – only for it to collapse when DreamWorks studio changed hands. Awful news for the Matilda composer, but good news for fans of musical comedy – of which Minchin is, with Flight of the Conchords, the world’s funniest and most talented exponent. Subtitled Old Songs. New Songs. Fuck You Songs, the show tours his native Australia before hitting our shores in the autumn.Tour opens at Regent theatre, Ipswich, 15-16 October This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

It is set in the fictional kingdom of Agrabah, and was filmed in Wadi Rum in Jordan, where the protected desert landscape, sandstone and basalt mountains, canyons and otherworldly rock formations – such as Burdah Rock Bridge, one of the highest natural arches in the world – create a dramatic landscape.Exploring by 4x4 is recommended, and visitors can also stay in a Bedouin desert camp, go camel riding, and visit the 4,000-year-old rock drawings at Khazali Canyon. Booking directly with the Jordan visitor centre on arrival is advised, or with a tour company in advance (such as Jordan Tracks, 1 day 1 night, cameljeep tour from £90).• Released May 2019Quentin Tarantino’s ninth (and supposedly penultimate) film has a stellar cast including Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio, Margot Robbie and Al Pacino. Full details of the crime drama have yet to be unveiled, but last April the director told the CinemaCon convention: “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood takes place in 1969, at the height of the counterculture, hippy revolution and the height of new Hollywood. Street by street, block by block, we’ll transform Los Angeles into the Hollywood of 1969.”Photos and videos have surfaced showing a stretch of Hollywood Boulevard, between Las Palmas and Cherokee, transformed with period cars, shop fronts and cinemas. But while most of the sets are temporary, it is possible to visit some permanent fixtures featured in the film, including Hollywood’s oldest restaurant, Musso \u0026amp Frank Grill, which opened in 1919 and whose reputation was set during the golden age of Hollywood, visited by stars such as Charlie Chaplin.Other Hollywood locations for reliving the retro vibe include Dan Tana’s Italian in West Hollywood, the city’s first late-night restaurant, where stars would dine in anonymity: it celebrated 50 years last year. Next to the art deco Pantages Theater, there’s Hollywood’s oldest e bar, Frolic Room (which originally opened as a speakeasy in 1930, was a bolthole for Barfly writer Charles Bukowski, and featured in LA Confidential). And the Hollywood Museum in the restored art deco Max Factor building, has tons of memorabilia and a historic pink lobby.• Released July 2019Almost 25 years after the animated classic hit the screens, a CGI version featuring the voices of Beyoncé, Donald Glover, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Seth Rogen is being released. Research trips for the original animated film took place in Kenya’s Hell’s Gate national park in Kenya – though Pride Rock was a fictitious element added by the animators.Hell’s Gate national park,90km from Nairobi, is named for the intense geothermal activity within its boundaries. The spectacular landscape includes deep, twisting gorges, volcanic rock towers and plumes of steam. ABig cat numbers here are low, which means that, uniquely in Kenyan parks, pedestrians are allowed full access. But other wildlife is abundant, with more than 103 species of birds, buffalos, zebras, gazelles, hyenas, antelopes and baboons. Hire bikes and local guides (for hiking and walking safaris) are available at the entrance those wanting to explore by car can hire 4x4s at Nairobi airport). If a distant hyena lullaby sounds appealing, there are three campsites in the park (Endachata, Naiburta and Oldubai) and more options at nearby Lake Naivasha. • Released July 2019Jessie Buckley stars as a Glaswegian ex-con and single mum who dreams of breaking into the country music scene in Nashville. But Glasgow has its own Grand Ole Opry, a country and western club started in 1974 in a former cinema and still putting on gigs every Friday and Saturday. In March, the city, along with London and Dublin, will co-host Europe’s biggest country music festival C2C: Country to Country (8-10 March at SSE Hydro) with Keith Urban and Lyle Lovett on the bill. Glasgow is also a Unesco city of music, putting on more than 150 gigs a week in around 40 venues across the city. Music hotspots include King Tut’s Wah Wah Hut, Broadcast, Bloc+, SWG3, Stereo, Maggie Mays, and Mono, which is also a record store and vegan cafe.• Released April 2019The original film title – Everest – might have given a clue to the location of this animated film from DreamWorks. Although story details have yet to be disclosed, it is thought to follow a group from the streets of Shanghai who trek 3,000 miles to reunite the mythical Yeti with his family at the highest point on Earth, in the Himalayas.Since the first successful ascent to the summit of Everest in 1953, the Himalayas have become more accessible, with walking routes across Nepal, India, Pakistan, Tibet and Burma, and varied options depending on season, budget and ability. Trekking in China more specifically includes a multitude of routes around Tiger Leaping Gorge in Yunnan province, taking in deep ravines, snow-capped ranges, rivers, forests and remote rice terraces. Alternatively, there are routes at Sichuan’s Gongga Shan, the King of Mountains, passing glaciers, temples and views over the Tibetan meadows or in the far north-west of China in Kanas national park, in the Altai mountains that creep in from Siberia.Tours of the Himalayas in Nepal, India, Pakistan, Tibet and Burma, range from self-guided trekking suitable for families (World Expeditions, £990pp, 11 days B\u0026ampB), to trekking up to an altitude of 5,364 metres to Everest Base Camp (£1,740, 17 days, including all meals and accommodation).• Released September 2019Calanque de Méjean, an picturesque inlet near Marseille in southern France, was the location for this family drama by veteran director Robert Guédiguian. The tiny port beside the towering arches of a large viaduct sets the scene for the reunion of several siblings, who return to the family home when their father suffers a stroke.Guédiguian said Méjean had always reminded him of theatre: “The colourful little houses built into the hills seem to be no more than facades ... A viaduct overlooks them and its trains look like child’s toys the openness towards the sea transforms the horizon into a backdrop ... like painted canvases ... especially with the winter light, when everyone has gone. It becomes an abandoned set – melancholy and beautiful.”Méjean is one of several coastal hamlets along Provence’s Côte Bleue, with a picturesque railway route hugging the shore.• Released January 2019Another homecoming film, this time from Iranian director Asghar Farhadi, following Laura (Penélope Cruz), who travels from Buenos Aires back to her childhood home in a village near Madrid to attend a wedding. Abduction, threats and former lovers (namely Paco, played by Javier Bardem) play out in this Spanish drama filmed in the village of Torrelaguna 40 miles from the capital.Torrelaguna has a beautiful traditional plaza, atmospheric 15th-century church, a Roman bridge, a 10th-century watchtower, and other historic buildings mixing gothic, baroque and neoclassical architectural styles. Restaurants serving Spanishspecialities include Alfoli de la Sal and Casa Moraleda there are horse riding and walking routes in the surrounding meadows and hills and the views from the nearby black-slate village of Patones de Arriba are worth a trip too.• Released March 2019Set in Port Isaac, Cornwall, this feelgood British comedy drama is based on the true story of a group of fishermen who were given a record deal after singing sea shanties in their local pub. On the Atlantic coast of north Cornwall, the tiny village of Port Isaac is a popular filming spot, already featuring in Poldark, Doc Martin and Saving Grace.During the making of Fisherman’s Friends, the original fishermen worked on the boats with the film crew, helped with singing coaching and consulted on accents and dialects. If visiting the area, expect a bit of a sing-song in the local pubs, or during the summer (depending on the weather) you might be lucky enough to catch the Fisherman’s Friends giving a performance of sea shanties on the platt (dock). These shows are free, with donations going to charity. There are boat and fishing trips from the port depending on weather and season, and Polzeath beach, one of the best surfing spots in north Cornwall, is five miles away.• Released March 2019 This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Hairy blokes in coats that looked recently ripped from goats stood around wood fires on war-torn land. A growly voiceover explained that the ancient Britons had fought an enemy so terrible that his conquered corpse had been sliced in three, and the portions stored around the world, starting at a Pacific island and a Siberian freezescape.I made a mental bet that the rest of the super-warrior would be found under Sheffield, which turned out to be the case. After only 11 episodes in charge, Chibnall is already growing his own in-jokes. As well as audibly coming from Yorkshire, Jodie Whittaker’s Doctor is returned there at every possibility. So the squid-like innards of a Dalek, usually hidden within that man-sized pepper mill on castors, were inevitably dug up by archaeologists working in the S1 postcode.As well as making the series more Earthbound, especially around the West Riding, another mark of Chibnall’s tenancy has been topical commentary. The first season was explicitly pro-ecology and anti-Trump, and implicitly anti-Brexit.So liberal-friendly has the show been, it was a surprise in this special that the Dalekian inner jelly didn’t turn out to be called Jacob Rees-Blob, or that when the extraterrestrial glop was enclosed in a plastic bag, it wasn’t the packaging that proved to be the biggest threat to the planet.With 88 days to go until the UK is supposed to leave the EU, however, there was one pointed political reference. When the Doctor tried to call on the cross-border Unified Intelligence Taskforce to help save Sheffield from extermination, she learned that Britain was no longer a member after falling out with her “major international partners”. Another satirical gag was aimed at the cross-planetary force threatening to exterminate the BBC.When the Daleks broke the internet, a mother warned her children that no entertainment was available. “Not even Netflix?” pleaded a child. But no, even that modern superpower could not defy the croaky rollers.Presumably coincidentally, the overall theme overlapped with this year’s Queen’s Christmas message by stressing the need for national and community unity. The final scoreline was: United Sheffield 1, Daleks 0.Another Chibnall signature was entwining the extraterrestrial with the domestic. The absence of Bradley Walsh’s doctorial sidekick Graham from one key Tardis mission was so odd that you initially assumed a filming clash with The Chase, but it transpired that the character had been grounded in order to discuss responsible parenting with guest actor Daniel Adegboyega, as the absentee dad of sidekick Ryan (Tosin Cole).Having shown in Broadchurch an exceptional skill at writing family dynamics, Chibnall now extends this exploration into the broadest church of all – the universe. The show ended with a parent-child hug.That interaction poignantly wasn’t open to the main character, in a performance that gave us a bonus extra day of some of the best TV acting of 2018. Between intermittent radiant smiles and sharp one-liners, Whittaker’s dominant note in the role is a sense of lonely responsibility – carrying the cares of the solar system on her shoulders – which the scripts keep underlining.Preparing to face down the Daleks again, she is warned, “You can’t do it alone!”, but shrugs: “Always have done.” When an Earthling notes that dads are complicated, the Doctor ruefully replies: “So I’m told.” She is parentless, childless, partnerless, but everyone needs her.This Doctor feels like the world leader we want for these times. Sadly, though, she won’t be on screen again until 2020, the producers having asked to make the next episodes slowly. Quality control is the reason for the delay, and the classiness of this first series finale gives Chibnall a high bar to beat, but ensures that viewers will want to watch him try."},{"url":null,"title":"must see tv shows 2019","story":"Drama catches on to Brexit, Shane Meadows goes to Ireland, Helen Mirren plays Catherine the Great, and winter comes to Westeros by  Lanre Bakare,  Gwilym Mumford and  Stuart Heritage(Channel 4) For the last few years, Catastrophe has been one of the very finest comedies on television. However, 2019 is the year it all comes to an end. And, from what little information exists, it may be a bumpy ride. “We got to the last scene of the sixth episode and really, really embarrassingly, I kind of lost my shit a little bit,” Sharon Horgan revealed back in September. Start date: 7 January(Channel 4) AKA Benedict Cumberbatch’s Brexit film. Playwright James Graham has written this two-hour drama based on firsthand accounts of both the Remain and Leave movements. Cumberbatch plays the latter’s campaign director, Dominic Cummings. Co-starring Rory Kinnear, Richard Goulding and Oliver Maltman, Brexit: The Uncivil War promises to tell the tale of an epic game of cat and mouse – albeit a game where the cat eats the mouse and then poops all over your living room carpet. See Mark Lawson’s feature on Brexit TV.9 January(Sky AtlanticNow TV) True Detective season 1 was a game-changing piece of drama that existed at the meeting point between incredible writing, beautiful acting and sublime direction. True Detective 2 also existed. Hopefully, next year’s third series will be a return to form. The trailers – featuring Moonlight’s Mahershala Ali hopping backwards and forwards in time – look like vintage True Detective. Even more excitingly, one episode counts Deadwood creator David Milch as a co-writer. January(BBC Three) At this point, Phoebe Waller-Bridge can basically write her own cheques. For any other writer, Killing Eve would have been an all-time career highlight, but Fleabag remains her masterpiece. The first series was so perfectly self-contained, hinging on a flawlessly executed final-episode revelation, that it’s hard to know where a second series could go. But doubt Waller-Bridge at your peril. The woman can even fart on command. This will be unmissable. February(BBC One) Incredibly, Alan Partridge has been away from the BBC for 15 years. He’s been no slouch in the meantime, making films, writing books and starring in several perplexingly underwatched Sky specials, but this still feels like a homecoming. Not a vast amount is known about This Time … with Alan Partridge, except that it seems to be an extended One Show riff that will at least momentarily see Partridge standing inside a giant petri dish. This cannot come soon enough. February(Sky AtlanticNow TV) Finally, winter is here. After years of interpersonal squabbling, the rulers of Westeros must finally face the full force of the Night King and his White Walkers, and by all accounts it will be spectacular. Playing out across six ludicrously expensive feature-length episodes that utilise more SFX than ever, this looks set to become the high watermark of everything that television as spectacle can accomplish. April(Channel 4) After last year’s well-received Comedy Blap (Channel 4’s fancy name for a short, if you were wondering), Rufus Jones’s sitcom about a family who unknowingly return from a holiday in France with a Syrian refugee (Youssef Kerkour) in their boot receives a full series. Its tone is gentle rather than stridently satirical – understandable given the subject matter – but the gags are strong, the performances are likeable and the issues depicted could not be more timely. April(Channel 4) Shane Meadows projects are usually funny until they’re not. Punks and skinheads are all having a laugh, until they’re infiltrated by fascists. That creepy guy who is trying to woo your sister is harmless, until he turns out to be unhinged. But with The Virtues, Meadows seems to have reversed the formula. It tells the story of a labourer (played by Stephen Graham) – born in Ireland, put into care and then escaped to England – who goes back to deal with his demons. It’s bracing stuff, but in true Meadows fashion there’s humour interspersed with the grit. Told partly in flashback scenes filmed on handheld VCR cameras, it is visually ambitious – and Graham is magnetic as a man trying to overcome a painful history. April(SkyNow TV) HBO and Sky have teamed up for three big productions in 2019. This retelling of the biggest manmade disaster ever will focus on the people who tried to deal with immediate aftermath: in some cases to cover it up, and in others to ensure it could never happen again. Stellan Skarsgård plays Boris Shcherbina, the Soviet official charged with handling the fallout, Emily Watson is a nuclear scientist who wants to find out why the disaster happened and Jared Harris plays Valery Legasov, the Soviets’ man on the ground after the crisis. May(Channel 4) The first series of Lisa McGee’s Derry Girls was a monster of a show – Channel 4’s biggest new comedy in five years. A classic sitcom premise married to some timely 1990s nostalgia, where all the teens-go-mad action was flanked by the constant shadow of the Troubles. It’s such a perfect formula that a second series cannot feasibly disappoint. Spring(BBC One) Sally Wainwright stays in West Yorkshire, but swaps Hebden Bridge for Halifax as she tells the story of Anne Lister, the 19th-century figure often referred to as the “first modern lesbian”. Suranne Jones plays Lister, who became the head of a powerful family after the death of her four brothers in 1826. The eight-part series tells the story of her rise and eventual marriage to Ann Walker, an heiress of a neighbouring estate. It looks set to be one of the highlights of 2019. Spring(BBC Two) The headline of MotherFatherSon is that it stars Richard Gere in the first major television role of his career, playing a Rupert Murdoch figure in a series that sounds thematically similar to last year’s Succession. But the real draw is its writer: Tom Rob Smith wrote the breathtaking American Crime Story: The Assassination of Gianni Versace, and if he can bring even a fraction of that show’s claustrophobic tension to MotherFatherSon, it’ll be incredible. Spring(Channel 4) Long regarded as unfilmable – despite Mike Nichols’ perfectly serviceable 1970 adaptation – Joseph Heller’s black comedy is now coming to TV. Starring Christopher Abbott as Yossarian and co-starring Hugh Laurie and George Clooney (who also directs some episodes), Catch-22 has the potential to finally nail what was so special about Heller’s novel. Alternatively, it may mark the point where prestige TV finally overreaches itself. We’ll find out this year. Summer(ITV) ITV has so far struggled to find a ratings-winning replacement for Downton Abbey, but might this new period drama fit the bill? Created by Gurinder Chadha (Bend It Like Beckham) it follows residents of a 19th-century Delhi mansion owned by John Beecham, a former soldier haunted by the misdeeds he witnessed working for the East India Company. Set during the era when the British were battling for dominance over India, it should provide a pointed corrective to the dewy-eyed empire reminiscence being peddled as Brexit looms. Date tbc(Sky AtlanticNow TV) HBO’s whodunnit was one of 2017’s standouts with its tense thriller aspect butting up against a tale of small-town myopia and rivalry. The second season sees Jean-Marc Vallée try to repeat the feat while upping the stakes, as Meryl Streep joins Nicole Kidman, Laura Dern and Reese Witherspoon as Perry’s mother. She’s in town to find out what happened to her departed son, and she’ll need all her sleuthing to get past southern California’s scheming elementary-school parents.(Netflix) After a mixed fourth series full of more needless baby murders than anyone could ever really want, Charlie Brooker’s tech-horror anthology is back for another run. Everyone is keeping tight-lipped about what this new series has in store, but we got a festive sneak preview in the form of Bandersnatch – the Choose Your Own Adventure-style interactive episode where you pick the fate of the protagonist from a number of different but equally harrowing options. Date tbc(SkyNow TV) Following in the regal wake of The Favourite and Mary Queen of Scots comes the story of the Russian monarch who reigned in the 18th century. Helen Mirren stars as the titular ruler in a show which looks as if it has all the hallmarks of a prestige drama (big-name star, large budget, co-production with HBO). The four-parter will focus on the end of Catherine’s reign and her affair with Grigory Potemkin, which promises to be salacious and shocking. Date tbc(Netflix) The second regal performance of the year from Olivia Colman, though one that’s a world away from her gout-ridden, lobster-racing Queen Anne of The Favourite. She takes over from Claire Foy as Elizabeth II, as Peter Morgan’s monarchical saga moves into the mid-60s – a turbulent time for the house of Windsor, with Princess Margaret (now played, in a note-perfect piece of casting, by Helena Bonham Carter) attracting column inches for her affair with baronet Roddy Llewellyn. Also joining the cast this time around are Tobias Menzies as a now middle-aged Prince Philip, and Jason Watkins, playing Prime Minister Harold Wilson. Date tbc(AmazonBBC2) Fantasy credentials don’t come much better than those of this Amazon series, which has been adapted by Neil Gaiman from the novel he co-wrote with the late Terry Pratchett. It stars David Tennant as a raffish demon who has formed an unlikely 6,000-year friendship with Michael Sheen’s buttoned-down angel. When a looming apocalypse threatens their bromance, the pair team up to save the world. Psychedelic visuals, epic set-pieces and some wild hairpieces sported by Tennant suggest this could be a blast. If that doesn’t sate your appetite, there’s season two of Gaiman’s other epic fantasy, American Gods, which comes back in March. Date tbc(BBC One) Stephen Graham has been lined up as the latest villain in Jed Mercurio’s police corruption saga, Line of Duty. All we know at the moment is that Graham will be a balaclava man, part of the murky group of criminals whose MO is killing someone you have been intimate with, smearing your DNA on the body, putting the cadaver in a freezer and threatening to ruin your life by framing you unless you obey their instructions. The last season dangled the prospect that the corruption that AC-12 has been sniffing out could be very close to home. In true Mercurio fashion, Graham’s suspect may be a classic bit of misdirection. Date tbc(BBC One) Series four of everyone’s favourite chest-baring period drama ended with a jolting death that suggested the cosy Sunday-night staple still has the capacity to shock. Might more surprises be in store for its fifth and final run? What we do know is that it will see Ross (Aidan Turner) ditch Westminster to return to Cornwall, though the arrival of a friend in need will force him to once again take on the forces of the establishment, not least – one suspects – the nefarious George Warleggan. A final reckoning between the two surely awaits.

Several new cities would be created by the project, adding hundreds of thousands of new residents and hundreds of miles of new roadways.But almost half of the proposed area of construction falls within what US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) scientists recognise as “primary zone” for dwindling numbers of the Florida panther, a subspecies of puma of which barely 200 adults are believed to survive.The FWS says preservation of the entirety of the big cats’ hunting and roaming zone, which incorporates about 20,000 acres of the Collier development, is “essential for the survival of the Florida panther in the wild”.“This area was never intended for this amount of development,” said Amber Crooks, environmental policy manager of the Conservancy of Southwest Florida.“These parts of Collier county contain a lot of important habitat for the Florida panther and also so many other rare species and has important public lands on each corner. The best available science tells us the panther needs all its available habitat to survive and ultimately recover,” she said.The FWS must approve or reject the “habitat conservation plan” (HCP) submitted by the landowners, known collectively as Eastern Collier Property Owners, by the end of April. Under the Endangered Species Act, government approval is required when an otherwise lawful development could result in an incidental “take” of any listed species.Crooks’ group, along with the Sierra Club and Center for Biological Diversity, submitted 20,000 signatures and a 100-page letter of objection to the FWS during a 45-day public comment period that ended last month. Crooks said the service rejected their request to extend the comment period or hold a public meeting, in a letter citing shorter Trump-era deadlines for the process.“It was a quick 45 days,” she said. “Certainly we would have liked more time.”Other environmental groups, meanwhile, have worked with the landowners on a mitigation plan that promises $150m for panther conservation and 107,000 acres of non-primary zone land for preservation in exchange for development approval.Elizabeth Fleming, the Florida representative of Defenders of Wildlife, said previous developments had won approval despite the outright opposition of environmentalists, and collaboration could provide a better outcome for wildlife.“We’re not evil people who are being conscripted by the landowners to do thus and such,” she said. “When landowners can better trust in government policies and work together with conservation groups, we can come up with a successful paradigm that can be replicated elsewhere.“And with sea level rise predictions, some of the habitat available to the panthers now will no longer be. They’re going to need to move north through private lands because there just isn’t enough public conservation land, so the willingness of private landowners to accept sharing their land with these predators is so important.”Fleming said the landowners have been mostly receptive and made changes to the plan, including widening of corridors through which panthers would travel. “We have identified areas that shouldn’t be developed that they have avoided, and helped them make some of the travel linkages wider,” she said.“At the beginning they only wanted to work with panthers and we persuaded them to incorporate other species. That’s not to say we are completely satisfied with what they have turned in to FWS. We continued to submit comments as part of the public process and hope they will take into account some of our suggestions and make this plan better.”Crooks, however, is sceptical the approach has been successful. “Even after a decade of trying both from the inside with those groups sitting at the table with the landowners, and pushing from the outside, this plan still has so many fatal flaws that we hope the service will see, and deny it,” she said.Christian Spilker, vice-president of land management for Collier Enterprises and spokesperson for Eastern Collier Property Owners, did not return several messages for comment, but in a December opinion piece in the Naples News claimed the landowners were “good stewards of the land and treasured native wildlife”.“The HCP preserves 156 sq miles of high-quality habitat forever available to the Florida panther and a vast number of other protected and native species,” he wrote.The latest proposed encroachment on shrinking panther territory is far from an isolated example. Rising waters both in the ocean and the Everglades also threaten the rare animal. Its cousin, the eastern cougar, was declared extinct in 2015."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19af921e0d1f352446a25f1bbd5f9fecd50c2e69/0_0_4075_2445/master/4075.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9df406b5b504cde7c157786d6bbb27cf","title":"us satellite imagery 2018 kilauea hurricane florence paradise","story":"From lava flows on Hawaii to raging fires in California, images gathered from high above Earth by satellites in 2018 show how humanity, geopolitics and the force of nature upended lives and landscape"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7069a8ca638ab7d74da166a6c647dc81305a4bc7/0_0_4972_2984/master/4972.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=07945afc5220d4604d97649fdbe5e7d3","title":"indian women form 620km human chain in support of lifting of temple ban","story":"Women go into temple following court ruling opposed by traditionalist protestersTwo women have become the first to enter a Hindu temple in India’s southern state of Kerala after the supreme court lifted a centuries-old ban.Priests later “purified” the famous Sabarimala temple, which does not permit menstruating women inside. They closed the temple for several hours to conduct ancient rituals to remove the “polluting” female presence.The two women, named by Indian media as Bindu and Kanaka Durga, had tried to enter the temple last month but had been stopped by rightwing Hindu protesters determined to uphold the ban.Video footage on a TV channel appeared to show two women dressed in black entering the temple. The Kerala chief minister, Pinarayi Vijayan, confirmed the news. “Today two women have entered the shrine. We had given a standing order to the police to provide all possible protection to any woman who wants to enter the temple.”Media reports said the two women started the long uphill trek through forests to the temple at about midnight and reached it at about 4am. They were accompanied by a group of police officers. They left after offering prayers to the deity Lord Ayyappa, who is celibate. This celibacy is the reason Hindu traditionalists believe women under 50 should not enter the temple. The fear is that the women could “tempt” the deity.M T Ramesh, the head of the Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) in Kerala denounced the visit as “a conspiracy”. “Why this midnight visit? The Kerala government has connived in this crime. It is a conspiracy between the women and the government.”There has been an angry showdown for three months between Hindu traditionalists and the supporters of a September ruling by the supreme court that women of all ages must be allowed to enter the temple.After the ruling, several women tried to reach the shrine but were forced to retreat by activists comprising both ordinary women and political groups, including the ruling BJP which opposes the court ruling on the grounds that the tradition of the temple must be upheld.The prime minister, Narendra Modi, said in an interview on Tuesday the ban was a matter of religious belief, not gender equality.Amit Malviya, the national head of the BJP’s information and technology wing, tweeted, referring to the Communist party, which rules Kerala: “Have the Communists desecrated Sabarimala shrine by facilitating entry of women of restricted age group into the temple? Devastating, if true.”Local activist Rahul Easwar, who spearheaded the protests against the ruling, told a TV channel that he would verify the footage and take “appropriate action”.The Kerala government supports the court ruling but has been unable to implement it owing to the protesters camped at the place where the path up to the shrine starts. On 22 January, the supreme court will hear a petition challenging the ruling.On Tuesday, thousands of women in Kerala formed a human chain 380 miles (620km) long across the length of the state to demonstrate their support for gender equality. The “Women’s Wall” rally was backed by the government."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ddb7411077230c46b6150bbfa7b75019e2858f6/0_166_4229_2538/master/4229.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=461c7998d2202030db977acdf9934987","title":"vietnam criticised for totalitarian law banning online criticism of government","story":"Law forces internet providers to censor content deemed ‘toxic’ by the ruling communist government and hand over user dataVietnam has introduced a new cybersecurity law, which criminalises criticising the government online and forces internet providers to give authorities’ user data when requested, sparking claims of a “totalitarian” crackdown on dissent.The law, which mirrors China’s draconian internet rules, came into effect on 1 January and forces internet providers to censor content deemed “toxic” by the ruling communist government. Vietnam’s ministry of public security said it will tackle “hostile and reactionary forces”, but human rights groups said it was authorities’ latest method of silencing free speech.The Vietnam government has intensified a crackdown on criticism since 2016, jailing dozens of dissidents. Spreading information deemed to be anti-government or anti-state online is now illegal in the country, as is using the internet to “post false information that could cause confusion and damage to socio-economic activities”.Last week, the country’s Association of Journalists published a code of conduct banning reporters from posting information that could “run counter” to the state on social media. Daniel Bastard of Reporters Without Borders called the measures “a totalitarian model of information control”.The government has asked Facebook and Google to open offices in Vietnam, and to agree to comply with the new censorship and user data rules. Hanoi claimed that Google has put steps in place to open a base in the country, although the search engine has not confirmed this. In response to the new law, Facebook said it would protect users’ rights and safety.Phil Robertson, Human Rights Watch’s deputy Asia director, said the legislation was “the legal equivalent of a hammer to bash online critics, with overly broad provisions that can be easily used to classify almost any critical comment as criminal.”He told the : “While it’s likely that activists who have previously spoken up against government abuses will be targeted first, the government’s longer-term plan is to bring the internet under the same draconian controls that affect print media, TV and radio.

Last year, nine cyclists were killed on Irish roads, down from 14 in 2017.However, Dr Mike McKillen of the advocacy group cyclist.ie questioned the merit of any new law that did not contain a specified passing distance.He pointed out that there was already a law against dangerous overtaking in Ireland but that, despite repeated parliamentary questions submitted on behalf of cyclists, no evidence could be found of it being enforced when it came to dangerous overtaking of a cyclist.“I fail to see how specifically creating this new offence of ‘dangerous overtaking of a cyclist’ is going to improve on that.”Dr McKillen said Irish drivers were so litigious it was almost impossible to introduce any road safety measure. “They resent change, whether in terms of speeding or drink-driving penalties or anything else. Our drivers will challenge anything to prevent change.”In a research paper on the merits of a minimum passing distance law and improvements in cyclist safety published in February 2018, the Road Safety Authority said it had found limited evidence to support the implementation of minimum passing distance legislation.Recommending against the law, it suggested instead creating an education and awareness campaign based around an advisory minimum passing distance of 1m on roads with a speed limit under 50kmh and within 1.5m on roads with a limit of 50kmh or higher.The RSA said these guidelines should also be included in the Driver Theory Test and the Rules of the Road to inform drivers of the necessity for safe passing distances for cyclists."},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"Belfast 1994 archives: American embassy official described meetings with NI politiciansBelfast 1994 archives: Cahal Daly told NI minister an internal

Photograph: Alan BetsonUS-Ireland Alliance president Trina Vargo urged Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to stop sending diplomats to events organised by men-only Irish-American societies as they were not representative of Irish America.In an email to Mr Varadkar, Ms Vargo shared a statement issued by the male-only Society of the Friendly Sons of St Patrick in New York notifying members that they were encouraged to invite female guests to its 235th anniversary dinner in March.“I am writing to strongly encourage the Irish Government to stop sending diplomatic representatives to these men-only membership organisation events. It’s time to drag Irish America into the 21st century,” Ms Vargo, a former US congressional aide, wrote in her November 10th email.She said the male-only Irish-American societies were “not representative of the 36 million Irish Americans” . The image risked the future of relations between the two countries, she said.“This is but one example why the very future of this relationship is in doubt. I can’t tell you how difficult it is to interest people in becoming involved in a contemporary US-Ireland relationship when this is their image of Irish America,” she wrote in the email released under the Freedom of Information Act.“The Irish Government is seen to endorse such organisations when it sends representatives to these dinners. Are women supposed to be impressed by this? I hope the Government will do the right thing here.”The Society of the Friendly Sons of St Patrick encouraged it members “to invite their wives, daughters, sisters, mothers, aunts, nieces and female cousins, friends and colleagues” to the dinner on March 15th.“We are confident that the inclusion of women at the society’s annual dinner will serve as a peaceful example of inclusion, compassion and respect for all people,” said its president Kevin Rooney. The US-Ireland Alliance is behind the George J Mitchell scholarship programme that brings 12 US graduates to study in Ireland every year. Ms Vargo also hosts the annual Oscar Wilde Awards to honour the Irish working in Hollywood and is a commentator on Irish and US politics.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

Harry\u0026#39s birth name Henry hits top spot but Meghan is nowhere to be seenPerhaps  readers have been inspired by the Royal wedding. Henry - Prince Harry’s birth name - has risen to the top of the charts for baby boys, according to  birth announcements.The name Henry shares top place with Arthur among  readers. Margot, a lowly 12th in 2017, and Matilda are joint top of the girls’ list.Henry rose to top from third last year, possibly on the strength of Prince Harry’s wedding to Meghan Markle in May. The order of service, made public on the eve of the wedding, listed the groom under his official title His Royal Highness Prince Henry of Wales.Matilda The Musical, based on Roald Dahl\u0026#39s bookRoyal names dominate the boys’ list. After Henry and Arthur in the  readers’ popularity stakes comes Edward, William and George.Girls’ names are not seemingly on Royal message. There are no Meghans - in fact there hasn’t been a Meghan with that spelling since 2001 - and no Kates or Catherines in the top 30. There was a Queen Matilda on the English throne - she was married to King Stephen - but you have to go back almost 900 years.Margot Robbie on the red carpetMore likely Matildas are being named after Roald Dahl’s heroine, now hugely popular in an award-winning musical, while the incidences of Margot is trickier to explain. The Australian actress Margot Robbie, one of the hottest stars in Hollywood, is one possible explanation.Susan Cole, a retired librarian, from Sutton, Surrey, who has been compiling the list for almost 50 years since 1969, said: “Henry now tops the list but Harry doesn’t even make the top ten. Surprisingly Harry comes in at only 21st, well below Henry.”Ms Cole suggested that the Royal wedding - and the prominent use of the name Henry on the order of service - could have swung it among more traditional  readers.

I\u0027m sincerely glad to celebrate the new year together with you under the clear sky, he told the crowd, many waving Japanese flags and shouting Banzai, meaning long live.Japan\u0026#39s Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko waved to crowds at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo after giving a last New Year\u0026#39s address I hope this year will be a good year for as many people as possible, the soft-spoken Akihito said in a dark suit, flanked by Empress Michiko and other family members.I pray for the peace and happiness of the people of our country and the world, he added.The emperor delivers a brief New Year\u0027s greeting every year, and was expected to appear five times on Wednesday to address as many well-wishers as possible.Some in the morning crowd yelled Thank you very much as the emperor waved, while others sang the national anthem. One woman in the front row shed tears as she looked up at the balcony.The Imperial Palace said more than 114,600 people had turned out to see the address I came here with my mother to imprint his last appearance as emperor in our memories, said Yume Nishimura, a university student, as she waited in a long queue to enter the palace.I want to tell him we appreciate his hard work for the country, she told AFP.Kazuo Iwasaki, a 68-year-old pensioner, said: I hope he will be able to spend his post-retirement years in a healthy and relaxing manner with Empress Michiko.Akihito shocked the country in 2016 when he signalled his desire to take a back seat, citing his age and health problems.His eldest son, Crown Prince Naruhito, is set to ascend the Chrysanthemum Throne a day after his father\u0027s abdication, continuing the rule of the world\u0027s oldest imperial family.The status of the emperor is sensitive in Japan given its 20th-century history of war waged in the name of Akihito\u0027s father Hirohito, who died in 1989.People sang and cried during the emperor\u0026#39s last New Year\u0026#39s speechAkihito has keenly embraced the more modern role as a symbol of the state - imposed after World War II ended. Previous emperors including his father had been treated as semi-ine.The palace, surrounded by stone walls and mossy moats, is opened to the public twice a year - on the emperor\u0027s birthday and the second day of New Year - for the royal family to greet well-wishers.In a rare emotional address to mark his 85th birthday last month, Akihito pointed to the countless lives lost in the war.It gives me deep comfort that the Heisei Era (his reign) is coming to an end, free of war in Japan, he said in a press statement.Akihito has used his speeches and travels to express his strong pacifist views, which are sharply at odds with the aggressive expansionism Japan pursued under his father\u0027s rule.The emperor has also worked to bring the royal household closer to the people and frequently visited the disadvantaged and families hit by natural disasters.Three people found dead in Kirton house fire as Lincolnshire Police launch murder inquiry Judges can hold \u0026#34intolerant views\u0026#34, tribunal hears as Christian magistrate allowed to appeal dismissal over gay adoption caseAustralian man screaming at spider \u0026#39why don\u0026#39t you die?\u0026#39 triggers full police responseNo government would willingly support a no-deal Brexit, says Jeremy HuntNeedles found in supermarket grapes in Australia months after strawberry scandalJeremy Hunt\u0026#39s Singapore visit risks souring Brexit trade talks with EUMigrants crossing English Channel are not \u0026#39genuine\u0026#39 asylum seekers, Sajid Javid suggestsSharp rise in the number of deaths caused by air crashes last year, figures revealUS border officials fire tear gas at migrants on New Year\u0026#39s DayBristol University student dies after Ben Nevis fall on New Year\u0026#39s DaySix killed as passenger train \u0026#39hit by objects\u0026#39 from beer freight train in DenmarkViolence in India as female worshipers break blockade to secretly enter one of India\u0026#39s holiest templesYoung women sent abroad for forced marriages having to pay Foreign Office for their rescue as critics label practice \u0026#39immoral\u0026#39UK ticket-holder scoops £115m EuroMillions jackpot on New Year\u0026#39s Day drawComment: Revamped rail service will put last year\u0026#39s unacceptable disruption behind usComment: What a delight to see strong women back on the silver screenToo few loos: West End theatres have one ladies\u0026#39 toilet for every 38 women in the audience Comment: Forty years ago, Britain faced a far worse situation.

After the highs of 2017, which saw the price of bitcoin surge to $20,000 (£15,700), the world\u0027s most valuable cryptocurrency is currently trading close to its lowest point in 16 months.Bitcoin has fallen\u0026nbspby 3 per cent over the last 24 hours, adding to losses of 5 per cent in the last week, 10 per cent in the last month and almost 80 per cent over the last year – leaving little doubt\u0026nbspthat last year\u0027s peak was indeed the result of an over-inflated bubble.There have been five major price spikes in bitcoin\u0027s 10 year history, and after each previous crash the market has managed to recover to even higher levels.

FTSE 100 CEOs are falling like skittles FTSE 100 reaches record high as pound sterling drops to 2018 low Nonetheless, The Independent’s fortune tellers are bravely stepping into the breach again having taken a refresher course under Professor Trelawney (Harry Potter fans will know what I mean). We’ve also lined up a panel of worthies from the City. Our sincere thanks to all of them for being such good sports and putting their heads above the parapet.\u0026nbspI’ve changed the rules a bit this year: our panel was told they could vary their predictions based on possible Brexit outcomes, because, well, who could possibly make an accurate prediction for where that will end up?\u0026nbspBut before we get down to business, the usual warning. This feature is designed to be fun. If you’re going to put actual money down, do your own research into stocks and the markets and consider taking professional advice too.As the editor of this feature, I get to go first. That’s not something I relish looking into the fog that surrounds 2019. But here goes.\u0026nbspMarkets are due a rally after this year’s sell off, the FTSE 100 in particular. It’s suffered from the complete lack of appetite for UK assets, something else to thank Brexit for. But it is also worth remembering that it’s dominated by international companies that make most of their money overseas. It means there is real\u0026nbspvalue to be had for the savvy investor, and perhaps a lot. If some kind of Brexit deal is reached, or better still we have a referendum and stay, I’m going for a relief rally (at some point) and an end of year close of 7,200, which I admit might look optimistic. If it’s no deal, then we’re in real trouble. The markets will hate it, so maybe 6,800. Why not worse? If\u0026nbspthe pound really collapses, the UK’s foreign currency earning stocks could start to look absurdly cheap. But I’d advise heading out of the country if you have the option.Stock pick: HSBC (646.9p). CYBG (181.2p) if Brexit is resolvedI’ve no great love for HSBC, which has had a chequered regulatory history in recent years. That said, while it has a big UK business, its most important markets are\u0026nbspin the far east and it reports earnings in US dollars. The third quarter results were unexpectedly good and the shares have climbed since then. But it’s still offering a prospective idend yield of 6 per cent, with no signs that the payout is under any threat. That’s right, 6 per cent. Eventually people will wake up to a number like that. With the UK in turmoil, there are good reasons for investors to look to this most international of banks. If you think Brexit will end well, and the sugar plum fairy actually exists, however, take a look at challenger bank CYBG following its acquisition of Virgin Money. That was a sweet deal and yet the business trades on just six times earnings.\u0026nbspIf this ends better than I expect, its current price\u0026nbspcould look ridiculously cheap this time next year.While global stock markets looked like they were heading in the right direction earlier this year, they’re moving\u0026nbspinto 2019 on a markedly different path. The FTSE 100 hit record highs in May off the back of the weakened pound. However, while sterling continued its decline throughout the rest of the year, it was not enough to sustain the stock market’s strength. The root of all this volatility was, of course, Brexit, and it doesn’t seem like that’s going to be cleared up any time soon.If the UK crashes out of the EU with no deal, the pound is likely to see a crash of its own – but as we now know, that doesn’t necessarily mean a rally for the FTSE anymore. It could head back towards multi-year lows as investors scramble to distance themselves from the UK. Even if Theresa May manages to get some sort of deal through parliament, it will be some time before we know what sort of impact the new arrangement is having.It seems foolish to make any predictions but I’m going to target a FTSE 100 close of 7,000 – which seems wildly optimistic at this point in time.IAG is the owner of British Airways, Aer Lingus and Iberia, among others. The FTSE 100 company has paid out pretty hefty idends in recent years, and it’s relatively cheap at the moment – the share price was knocked severely by a cyber attack over the summer. Despite concerns that a potential no-deal Brexit could wreak havoc on air travel in the UK, chief executive Willie Walsh has not wavered from his positive outlook and says the company is confident that it will not be harmed by disruption to flying rights – so confident that the group announced a €2.6bn investment plan in November. With oil prices forecast to drop over the next year, fuel costs should be more manageable too.It’s not been a vintage year for global stock markets. Most are lower than where they started. However, that’s the nature of the beast: stock market returns are lumpy. The UK economy continues to limp along, though a pick up in wage growth has been encouraging. Clearly Brexit is the big swing factor when it comes to the year ahead, and until there is some resolution on that front we can expect sentiment to remain febrile.With the FTSE 100, I’m once again going to play the averages (it only works as a strategy if you do it year in year out!) The FTSE adds about 5 per cent a year on average, excluding idends, so from current levels that puts us somewhere near 7,050.Stock pick: Lloyd’s Banking Group (51.85p) assuming\u0026nbspan orderly Brexit.\u0026nbspDiageo\u0026nbsp(2,795p)\u0026nbsp in the event of a disorderly BrexitIn an orderly Brexit outcome my stock pick would be Lloyds Banking Group.\u0026nbsp It currently has a prospective idend yield of around 5.5 per cent. When CEO Antonio Horta Osorio took over in 2011, the bank was making a loss of £260m. Last year it made a £3.5bn profit, yet the share price is lower than when he started. The market is selling down Lloyds because, at best, it doesn’t know what the next year holds for the bank’s profitability while Brexit hangs in the balance. If the UK economy is unscathed we can expect the share price to pick up. In bad outcome, all stocks are likely to come under pressure in the short term. So is the pound. Bets can be hedged a bit by holding an internationally ersified defensive stock like Diageo. The manufacturer of Guinness and Johnny Walker gets most of its revenues from overseas. And let’s face we’ll probably all need a drink in this scenario.Political shenanigans in Westminster and the ongoing negotiations with Brussels mean that offering any sort of forecast for the UK economy in 2019 is a pretty thankless task. You can see the pound going to $1 in the event of a Brexit outcome that markets don’t like and it going back to $1.50 if the negotiations are seen as finally yielding a positive result, so at $1.25 sterling is probably appropriately priced right nowWhen it comes to the FTSE 100 the darkest hour comes before the dawn and with pessimism so pervasive the market may have a better chance of making it to 8,000 by the end of 2019 than many suspect. It is trading at levels last seen in December 2016 and even languishes below the high reached at the climax of the technology bubble in December 1999. As such, a good degree of bad news may already be factored into the valuation of UK assets, especially as the pound is still trading some 13 per cent below where it stood on the day of the EU referendum in June 2016. Unloved often means undervalued and the UK is not expensive relative to its international peers or its own history on an earnings basis.\u0026nbspIt also offers a prospective yield of 4.9 per cent, which beats base rates pretty handily and also outstrips the 1.25 per cent yield of 10-year UK government bonds.I’m normally wary of banks but in the case of the FTSE 250 “challenger”\u0026nbspOneSavings Bank I am prepared to make an exception. The stock trades on barely 6.5 times earnings and 1.4 times book value while offering a idend yield of 4.1 per cent. If everything goes wrong from a political or macroeconomic perspective, the lowly valuation could provide some relative downside protection, while the yield may offer some compensation for the risks involved as investors tough it out. A Brexit deal triggering a rally in sterling, and a resurgence in interest in UK assets, will put stocks like OneSavings Bank in the vanguard of a recovery, especially as loan growth is robust. The firm’s return on equity of 26 per cent is outstanding relative to its peer group. Given the bank’s exposure to mortgages, smaller companies and its strong focus on buy-to-let there are clear risks. Any economic and house price downturn could test sentiment and profits. But the valuation is low.Brexit, Donald Trump’s trade war and budget tensions between Italy, France and eurozone authorities will be major drivers of markets as politics dominates the start of 2019. The future shape of the UK’s relationship with the European Union remains unclear. A chaotic Brexit is likely to result in a fall in the pound, which is positive for the FTSE 100 as the majority of its earnings are generated abroad. However, a sharp rally in sterling could be negative for the index and any gains will be capped. Hopefully Donald Trump will be pushed in the direction of getting some sort resolution with China over the trade dispute so he can declare a “win” sooner rather than later. This will be positive for markets worldwide. The biggest risk is that the US Federal Reserve oversteps the mark and slams the brakes on the US economy too hard. However, there are signs that the central bank may be more doveish than many expected My FTSE 100 prediction: 7,100Growth at this Middle Eastern private healthcare network operator is supported by a strong economy in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the rollout of mandatory health insurance in the country. It also benefits from the UAE’s limited corporation tax regime and is expanding into Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Its new joint venture in Saudi Arabia, which will see it become one of the largest healthcare operators in the kingdom, is due to complete in the first quarter of 2019.Andy Brown, head of direct equities, Tilney Asset Management\u0026nbspLooking into next year, in the near term sentiment towards UK shares will depend in large part on what happens between now and the end of March when the UK is set to leave the EU. Many of the big UK political risks appear to be playing out now in the form of a potentially messy Brexit and with doubts about the sustainability of the current UK government. These anxieties are reflected in current UK equity valuations, which at 11 times earnings, are well below other developed markets and their longer-term trend.It’s important not to confuse UK equities and the domestic economy. In fact well over two-thirds of the earnings of FTSE 100 companies in aggregate are made outside of the UK. Currency volatility is likely to remain a feature which will have both an operational and financial impact of many UK companies. Not only are UK equities at discounted valuations, idends remain an attractive feature of the UK market both compared with\u0026nbspother regions and bond yields. We expect the FTSE 100 to eke out small gains by the end of 2019, perhaps finishing at around 7350, but with idends on top.DS Smith is a leading supplier of packaging products with a genuine global presence.

We are not short of key themes to ensure a bumpy ride across the year Trade wars, China slowdown, US Federal Reserve tightening (or not), Brexit and Italy all point to 2018’s volatility continuing if not rising in the year to come.The already challenging task of crystal-ball-gazing is almost impossible heading into 2019. With so much uncertainty surrounding Brexit and just three months to go to the break, perhaps the only certainty for the pound and the FTSE 100 is the continuation of this new uncertain phase.The year just gone has been a nightmare for the FTSE, which is down around 11 per cent this year, despite a 5 per cent drop in sterling. Weakness in the pound is good news for all the international stocks on the FTSE, around 70 per cent of the index itself. However, we expect broader fears of slowing global growth to ramp up across 2019, starting as soon as January with a softer US earnings season.Predictions for the FTSE would need to be split depending on the type of Brexit Theresa May secures. A disorderly, no-deal Brexit could see the pound plummet which would offer more support to the FTSE, as we saw post the Brexit referendum. However, a key difference is that the global economy was in better position in 2016. Under this scenario we envisage a very volatile year with the FTSE ending only marginally higher.A Brexit deal will see the pound recover some ground, adding pressure to the FTSE. A stronger pound, plus growing concerns over global growth would mean a difficult year for the FTSE which could close lower.Making money on stocks in 2019 amid such uncertainty will require careful choices. Gold has not lifted off this year, shedding 5 per cent of its value as a strong US economy and the\u0026nbspFederal Reserve\u0026nbsphiking rates have boosted faith in the dollar. However, with the Fed expected to slow its rate of interest rate rises this year the glitter could return to gold. With the precious metal expected to increase between 5 per cent and 15 per cent miner Randgold Resources will be a stock to watch.It has been a volatile year, although much of this comes off the back of 2017, one of quietest on record. The “synchronised global growth”\u0026nbspidea disappeared fairly early on, and trade wars have certainly not helped matters. The great post-2008 bull market has not come to an end, but it has taken quite a kicking. Things will remain volatile, but some of the bearishness and pessimism is perhaps overdone.If Brexit ends with a dealRemain, then the FTSE\u0026nbsp100\u0026nbspcould hit 7,500, but if no deal 6,000.\u0026nbspThe life insurer has good exposure to Asia, a strong idend, and is reasonably valued. I think this works in both situations.Stephen\u0026nbspAdams, head of equities, Kames CapitalDisorderly Brexit risk, Corbyn risk, earnings risk, monetary policy risk: it is little wonder then that the FTSE 100 is down. Nor is it clear that any of these pressures are abating as we head into the start of 2019. However, on a 12-month view it is possible to see the catalysts for a higher UK equity market.UK equities are the contrarian global asset class,\u0026nbspand any clarity on Brexit short of a no-deal cliff edge would likely be taken well. It is also possible that the economy would enjoy a relief bounce with the release of some pent up demand and a looser fiscal stance. In that scenario I would envisage the FTSE at 7,450 by year end 2019.By mid-year we may also witness a pause in US monetary tightening and a stabilisation in rebased earnings per share forecasts. Even with a no-deal Brexit I could see a FTSE little changed over the year as sterling takes the strain and the high percentage of overseas earnings in the blue chip index receive\u0026nbspa boost on any devaluation, so\u0026nbsp6,800.The deal with Schneider materially enhanced the sales opportunities for Aveva’s world class portfolio of design, engineering, construction and industrial software solutions. Recent updates have proved reassuring and with a significant proportion of the company’s earnings in foreign currency,\u0026nbspAveva would receive translational benefits on any sterling weakness.\u0026nbspBalfour Beatty, meanwhile,\u0026nbsphas undergone a painstaking and protracted period of dealing with underperforming contracts and has emerged with a strong balance sheet, rising margins and resilient cash flows unlike some competitors. As a contractor with a number of UK government contracts the stock should bounce on a Brexit deal and the valuation should see an upward re-rating.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Many low wage companies impose dress requirements that load costs onto staff and thus take them under the minimum wage threshold.\u0026nbspIceland says all its employees have the option of using the ‘safety shoes’ it provides and that are commonly used by its warehouse workers.

Previous studies have discovered that blue light emitted from the screens of laptops and smartphones can contribute to\u0026nbspblindness.\u0026nbspIn August, research by scientists from the University of Toledo, Ohio, revealed that prolonged exposure to the short-wavelength light triggers the generation of toxic molecules in the eye\u0027s light-sensitive cells.\u0026nbspIs Facebook finished? \u0027We\u0027re not far from Zuckerberg subpoena\u0027This process can lead to macular degeneration, a condition that results in blurred or no vision in the centre of the vision field.While it is thought that dark modes can help reduce eye strain, no studies have provided conclusive proof of whether the feature helps prevent this type of blindness.Facebook Messenger follows several other popular apps to introduce the feature, including YouTube, Google Maps and Firefox.WhatsApp, which is also owned by Facebook, is expected to introduce a similar feature later this year.As well as avoiding shining bright screens into people\u0027s eyes, dark modes can also improve battery life. Phones that use OLED displays do not need to light up parts of the screen that are black, potentially reducing the energy needed while the app is open.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2017/06/28/17/canterbury-housing.jpg","title":"first time buyer level uk property market research","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

But getting on to the housing ladder is still not an easy step for many young people, as demonstrated by the increasing numbers who have received help from the bank of mum and dad.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The major update – which would have been perhaps the biggest change to Instagram ever – was so widely despised that numerous users suggested the app is now dead.But very shortly after, the change appeared to be reverted and the feed went back to normal. And now it appears all of that happened by accident.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trial“Sorry about that, this was supposed to be a very small test but we went broader than we anticipated,” Instagram head Adam Mosseri wrote on Twitter, alongside an awkward-looking emoji. The change went to “a few orders of magnitude more people than intended”, he wrote.He said the change “should already be rolled back”. If it is still appearing, he told users they should “simply restart your app and you should be good to go”, Mr Mosseri advised.Created with Sketch.11 useful Instagram features you didn\u0027t know existed Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.111 Hide and reorder filtersFilters are a core part of Instagram, but there are so many available it can be easy to get lost. You can change the order in which they appear, and even hide the ones you never use, to speed up your photo-sharing process. On the filters page, scroll to the end, tap Manage, then drag and drop the ones you want to reorder, and un-check the ones you want to hide. Instagram controversially ditched its reverse-chronological order feed for a new order determined by an algorithm, making it easy to completely miss some posts. To make sure you never miss a certain somebody’s updates, you can set up notification for them by visiting their profile, tapping the three dots in the top right-hand corner and selecting Turn On Post Notifications.If you’re worried about how much of your mobile data Instagram saps, you can limit it by sacrificing the speed at which the photos and videos in your feed load.

To go a step further and hide your Suggested searches too, go to the search page, tap and hold the account you want to hide, and choose Hide from the pop-up window.Tagged photos on Instagram aren’t as prominent as they are on Facebook, but anyone can still browse through other people’s pictures of you by visiting your profile and tapping the photo of you icon.

Hit the + icon, select Gallery, choose Select Multiple, pick out up to 10 of the pictures and clips you want, tap Next and reorder them by dragging and dropping.Instagram Stories has been a massive hit since it came out last year, but you might not know that you can record Stories clips without having to hold one of your digits on the record key.

The alteration was just intended as a test, he said, giving no indication that it would be rolling out widely and properly any time in the near future.An Instagram statement suggested the change was a bug, rather than an accident, but both Mr Mosseri and the company\u0027s spokespeople were presumably referring to the same incident.“Due to a bug, some users saw a change to the way their feed appears today, the\u0026nbspstatement read.\u0026nbspWe quickly fixed the issue and feed is back to normal. We apologise for any confusion.Confusion as new Instagram appears and disappearsMr Mosseri only recently took up his position as Instagram’s boss, though he has worked for a long time at Facebook, most recently as the head of its News Feed. He was moved into his new\u0026nbsprole after Instagram’s founders left the company, reportedly in the wake of disagreements over its future direction.The roll-out of the change to the feed had already appeared strange: Instagram does usually allow small groups of people to test out new features, before slowly rolling them out to everyone who uses it. But this time around the update appeared to arrive on everyone’s phone all at once, dropping rapidly on Thursday afternoon UK time.When the change happened, it came with a screen that explained why it had arrived and how to use it. That suggested the change was not the result of a bug or that it had happened by accident, but presumably the same screen was only meant to be seen by the small number of people who would get access to the altered feed.Soon after, the new feed started reverting back to normal, before Instagram chose to announce that the update had been a mistake.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":null,"title":"instagram update new scroll left right sideways feature explained","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

With use, the power begins to drop – something that can lead to phones lasting for much less time, and to Apple having to slow down phones to ensure that they don\u0027t crash because they\u0027re not getting enough power.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialIt was the revelation that Apple was doing that – throttling performance on older phones, in line with more spectacular rumours that swirled before it was admitted – that led to the cheap repairs in the first place.When that story came out over the Christmas period in 2017, Apple apologised and said that as part of a range of ways of making it up to customers it would knock down the price of replacements, allowing people to restore their phone\u0027s performance if their battery had been degraded.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

Once the programme is over, the same service will cost £45 for most phones, and a full £65 for the iPhone X.Apple gives governments increased access to phone dataThe iPhone X recently became eligible for the throttling, which Apple still applies to more strained batteries to ensure they perform properly. One of the other forms of restitution offered to users was the option to turn that off, which can be found in Settings.Phones that are covered by its warranty period or extended AppleCare coverage will remain free, as they always have been.As the end of the year approaches, Apple Stores appear to be especially busy with users rushing to take advantage of the offer. Genius Bar appointments can be few and far between, though some customers have had success turning up at stores.The replacements require that a battery is sufficiently degraded, which will be checked by Geniuses at the store but can be seen by heading to the Battery options in the Settings app. But some customers appear to have successfully had batteries that are not under the critical 80 per cent mark swapped out all the same.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/12/27/12/gettyimages-669005400.jpg","title":"lady gaga enigma las vegas residency reviews setlist tickets","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

Three if I’m lucky!’”For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialLady Gaga’s Las Vegas residency is the role she was born to playA history of Las Vegas residencies, from Liberace to Lady GagaKendrick Lamar, Lady Gaga and Thom Yorke up for Best Original Song“There’s a short encore to properly conclude the show once Enigma departs. In an oversized march shirt that has her Bowie-inspired “Poker Face” lightning bolt cutting through a silhouette of her body, she sings one last song: “Shallow,” the runaway hit from A Star Is Born.\u0026nbsp“The moment is a balm, and its one that makes sure the show’s time machine takes us right back to the present, reminding us how far she’s come and the many lives she’s lived after taking us on a tour of her own musical history. She performs ‘Shallow’ as Ally Maine does towards the end of the film after becoming a full-fledged pop idol.”The review concludes: “For a show that at first seemed like an excuse to remind us what Gaga is best at, it ended up becoming a show that confirms and begins her legacy.”“Enigma\u0026nbspis a generous show, by Vegas pop standards, not just by exceeding the standard get-‘em-out-onto-the-slot-machines set length, but because Gaga also happens to do almost two hours more of actual singing than some of her counterparts on the Strip,” Variety said. “Watching Gaga do what she does best — even better than act, still — is all the story or connecting thread a show needs. She and ‘Born This Way’ were both born to be in Vegas, and to raise the bar for superstar residencies just a little bit higher.”Entertainment Weekly said: “Enigma is Gaga’s way of sharing an epiphany that we can only assume she’s recently experienced and strove to manifest creatively in the way that best suits her.\u0026nbsp“At some point, Gaga lost who she was — whether by her own fault, or the machine around her, is only for her to say — but Enigma, in as much as we need from it, serves as her way of affirming that she’s never been more secure in who she is, and that the most atypical parts of Lady Gaga are just as present and valid as the parts we perhaps have told her we’d have an easier time accepting.”Created with Sketch.Albums of the year 2018 Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms. The band appear reinvigorated, brimming with energy and self-assurance.Brent Cobb’s music is built around people and places. The country artist returns after the release of his acclaimed 2016 album Shine On Rainy Day with Providence Canyon a slice of blue-collar country offering fresh tales of Southern lifeThe Brighton metal band’s sublime second album is their most ambitious to date. Enlisting Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse) on production was a master-stroke – with his help they offer up vast sonic landscapes that recall the drama of Darion Malakian’s Scars on Broadway record, DictatorOne moment opining the joys of leaving a party to pluck your eyebrows, the next raging over the gaslighting of assault survivors, Miya Folick’s debut album continues her habit of cracking the shiny veneer of pop, and unsettling the exceptions put upon a feminine voiceThough their themes remain in the gutter, Suede aspire to monuments, and The Blue Hour will stand as another sordid masterworkSix years after the release of her last LP Sun, Cat Power – whose struggles with alcoholism, addiction and mental health issues have been much publicised – demonstrates “both a newfound sense of calm, and strength” on her new albumHoly Hell offers up some of the best tracks of the band’s career, with a through-line that maintains Tom Searle\u0027s role as an integral part of Architects, particularly on “Doomsday”, while “Hereafter” feels like the song that launches the album’s momentum. Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms.

On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.For Billboard, the outfits during the show were a big draw: “With her longtime fashion collaborator Nicola Formichetti and her sister Natali Germanotta joining forces, the duo spawned a number of creative looks —ranging from florescent and leather to a body suit with flashing LED lights and a nude-colored unitard— for Gaga, the dancers and her band that would have made David Bowie proud.”\u0026nbspThe EW review added: “As over-the-top as the show was, it was the more sombre\u0026nbspmoments that stood out and gave insight to her separate Vegas show titled “Lady Gaga Jazz \u0026amp Piano,” which will feature stripped down versions of Gaga’s hits.”In a feature for\u0026nbspThe Independent, Helen\u0026nbspBrown observed how the Las Vegas residency is the role Gaga was “born to play”.“Those out of the Sin City loop may think it odd for a star on such a trajectory to sign up for Vegas,” she said.\u0026nbsp”For decades, the Nevada city has been the place where America put pop singers out to pasture. But the mood has been shifting since Britney Spears began drawing a younger, hipper crowd with her 2013-2017 Piece of Me show, which earned the MGM Park casino hotel around $135m (£107m) in ticket sales alone. While that show was something of a comeback – albeit for a relatively young performer – Bruno Mars signed up for his 2016 residency at the peak of his commercial and critical success and made 24K showbiz magic of it.“Gaga has reportedly been given $100 million reasons to deliver a two-year residency (also at the MGM Park). She’s an even better fit for Vegas than Spears or Mars: she is capable of both visually excessive pop and elegant old-school jazz.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

This time around, almost everyone got the update within a matter of minutes.

It\u0027s not clear whether that is a bug – or whether the rollout itself had happened by accident, or early.Instagram had clearly meant for the update to go live at some point, since an instructional card popped up to explain that the change had been made and what users now had to do.There doesn\u0027t appear to be any way to make the feed change back. Instagram is not giving the option to revert to the old feed, even temporarily.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/12/27/12/samsung-galaxy-s10-leak-camera.jpg  width= 1254  height= 836  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/12/27/12/samsung-galaxy-s10-leak-camera.jpg","title":"samsung galaxy s10 release date price camera specs camera screen leaks","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

When a solid radio link finally was acquired and team members reported that their spacecraft systems were green, or good, she declared with relief: We have a healthy spacecraft. Later, she added to more applause: We did it again.\u0026nbspCheers erupted in the control center and in a nearby auditorium, where hundreds more — still weary from the double countdowns on New Year\u0027s Eve — gathered to await word. Scientists and other team members embraced and shared high-fives, while the spillover auditorium crowd gave a standing ovation.\u0026nbspStern, Bowman and other key players soon joined their friends in the auditorium, where the celebration continued and a news conference took place. The speakers took delight in showing off the latest picture of Ultima Thule , taken just several hundred-thousand miles before the 12:33 a.m. close approach.Nasa celebrates success of exploratory mission four billion miles awayUltima Thule is finally revealing its secrets to us, said project scientist Hal Weaver of Johns Hopkins.\u0026nbspBased on the early, rudimentary images, Ultima Thule is highly elongated — about 20 miles by 10 miles. It\u0027s also spinning end over end, although scientists don\u0027t yet know how fast.\u0026nbspAs for its shape, scientists say there are two possibilities.\u0026nbspUltima Thule is either one object with two connected lobes, sort of like a spinning bowling pin or peanut still in the shell, or two objects orbiting surprisingly close to one another. A single body is more likely, they noted. An answer should be forthcoming Wednesday, once better, closer pictures arrive.\u0026nbspBy week\u0027s end, Ultima Thule is going to be a completely different world, compared to what we\u0027re seeing now, Weaver noted.\u0026nbspStill, the best color close-ups won\u0027t be available until February. Those images should reveal whether Ultima Thule has any rings or moons, or craters on its dark, reddish surface. Altogether, it will take nearly two years for all of New Horizons\u0027 data to reach Earth.\u0026nbspThe observations should help scientists ascertain how deep-freeze objects like Ultima Thule formed, along with the rest of the solar system, 4.5 billion years ago.\u0026nbspAs a preserved relic from that original time, Ultima Thule also promises to shed light on the so-called Kuiper Belt, or Twilight Zone, in which hundreds of thousands of objects reside well beyond Neptune.\u0026nbspThis mission\u0027s always been about delayed gratification, Stern reminded reporters. He noted it took 12 years to sell the project, five years to build it and nine years to reach the first target, Pluto.\u0026nbspIts mission now totaling $800 million, the baby grand piano-sized New Horizons will keep hurtling toward the edge of the solar system, observing Kuiper Belt Objects, or KBOs, from afar, and taking cosmic particle measurements. Although NASA\u0027s Voyagers crossed the Kuiper Belt on their way to true interstellar space, their 1970s-era instruments were not nearly as sophisticated as those on New Horizons, Weaver noted, and the twin spacecraft did not pass near any objects known at the time.\u0026nbspThe New Horizons team is already pushing for another flyby in the 2020s, while the nuclear power and other spacecraft systems are still good.\u0026nbspBowman takes comfort and pleasure in knowing that long after New Horizons stops working, it will keep going on and on.\u0026nbspThere\u0027s a bit of all of us on that spacecraft, she said, and it will continue after we\u0027re long gone here on Earth.\u0026nbspAdditional reporting by Associated PressOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Clunge. Muffwagon. Goodness, it’s been a long time since we’ve heard those creative expressions of male sexual frustration, and it\u0027s\u0026nbspnice to hear them again, like old friends, or “Fwends” in this case. The Inbetweeners are back. Sort of.Even by the usually self-congratulatory standards of tellyland, the total of four hours and 10 minutes of airtime devoted by Channel 4 to their 2008 hit The Inbetweeners\u0026nbspis\u0026nbspa tad self-indulgent, though it is one of the channel’s recent glories.\u0026nbspHosted, inevitably, by the roughly contemporaneous Jimmy Carr, the first two hours of this teenage marathon, The Inbetweeners: Fwends Reunited, is given over to a sort of mix of This is Your Life, An Audience With..., and Radio 4’s The Reunion. That is followed by four full episodes of the series, mostly for the devotees, I imagine, as well as any stray viewers unfamiliar with this comedic landmark to judge this odyssey of pubic discovery, adolescence and embarrassment at first hand.\u0026nbspFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialIn all, The Inbetweeners ran to three series and two films, predominantly onanistic in tone, and most of the cast and creators turn\u0026nbspup for this celebration of its 10th anniversary. The Fwends Reunited show is dominated, naturally, by the four sixth form virginal idiots a good shag would have probably sorted out, but who, fortunately for us, never got lucky. Simon Bird (as Will McKenzie), Joe Thomas (Simon Cooper), James Buckley (Jay Cartwright) and Blake Harrison (Neil Sutherland) confirm the impression that they were basically playing themselves in The Inbetweeners and haven’t changed much since the last piece was smut was propelled like a flying turd into the public’s consciousness in 2014. I just hope their real-time personas have managed to “plunge some clunge” as they approach early middle age. Not sure, though.Given the vast prairie of time to fill, the producers plunder every known format to maintain some kind of momentum, and mostly to good effect, \u0026nbspthanks to the timeless quality of the original gags. So there is a series of “Awards” for stuff like “best bodily malfunction”, and I for one will never tire of seeing Simon projectile vomiting semi-digested creme de menthe on his girlfriend’s six-year-old brother nor of Simon’s left testicle hanging forlornly from his posing pouch in the school fashion show nor of watching Will tearfully confessing to his teacher that “I thought it was a fart”, as he had to be escorted from the A level exam room. You can almost smell the, er, shame.\u0026nbspThe 10 best TV shows of 2018The Inbetweeners\u0027 James Buckley \u0027could have died\u0027 filming boat scene There is a mini-quiz segment too, featuring Inbetweeners “super fans” whose programme knowledge exceeded that of the cast themselves, with a scholarly textual grasp of lines such as: “What is Swansea. Is it an animal?” “What\u0027s this pesto stuff? Is it for humans?” and “Just cos you’ve had your first puff on your first joint it doesn’t make you Kurt Cobain.”One super fan even had a tattoo of a grinning Jay with the inscription “CLUNGE” garnishing her upper thigh – ironically about as close as Jay ever got to a lady’s bodily treasure.The quiz “prize”, won by a Will lookalike in specs and a blazer, is a bright yellow M-reg Fiat Cinquecento Hawaii Edition, complete with “tape deck” and red passenger door.This runabout is also the co-star of the Fwends show and features in the freshly filmed sequences, such as their nostalgic trip back to Rudge Park Comprehensive\u0026nbsp(, as Carr puts it “in a car none of them owned to a school none of them went to”. Will relives the moment when he shat himself, which is, well, moving.Created with Sketch.Best TV of 2018 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Lennie James\u0027s missing-child thriller Save Me looked as though it might be a paint-by-numbers affair. Instead it was a gripping start to Sky Atlantic\u0027s impressive run, with James taking the lead as Nelly, the womanising bum who gains a new lease of investigative energy when his estranged daughter Jody vanishes. A smart script kept us guessing right up to an ending that denied us the closure we had expected. A second series has been commissioned.  210 9) Cunk on BritainHow much you enjoyed Philomena Cunk\u0027s history of Britain depended on how funny you find Diane Morgan\u0027s resting confused face. I find it hilarious. Her interviewees are kind of in on the joke but clearly briefed to take it as seriously as possible. They’ll be mid-flow and she will cock her head and drain all the interest from her face. “What\u0027s the most political thing that\u0027s ever happened?” she asked Robert Peston, who did his best to answer with a straight face. Co-producer Charlie Brooker\u0027s fingerprints are everywhere in the way Morgan\u0027s vain, poorly informed, easily distracted Cunk operates within a ruthlessly satirical production, which sends up the tropes and cliches of every dodgy documentary and history programme. She might not be the comic creation we need, but she is the one we deserve right now. You either love Julia Davis or think her sick filth ought to be banned. Sally4Ever proved yet again that there is nobody working today – or at least nobody with the same platform – with a blacker sense of humour. Sally (Catherine Shepherd) was already surrounded by monsters: her loser of a boyfriend (Alex MacQueen) and tricky colleagues played by Julian Barratt and Felicity Montagu. Then Emma (Davis herself) arrived, a tornado of sex and bad intentions. Beneath the shagging, drugs, excrement, manipulation and malice were pockets of tenderness, but you had to look pretty hard to see them. Luckily there were also gales of laughter. N.b. If you have yet to see it, please do not watch it with your parents or children on Boxing Day and then write in to complain.This was a spiritual successor rather than a sequel to The Night Manager. It was still a Le Carré adaptation on the BBC sprinkled with famous faces, but the differences were as pronounced as the similarities. Park Chan-Wook, the Korean auteur, directed with a high sense of style. Florence Pugh was dazzling as the ingenue actress Charlie, recruited for a dangerous mission across Europe, ably supported by Alexander Skarsgard and Michael Shannon as her spook handlers. Some viewers switched off after the first episodes, which took time to set the scene. They missed out on a vivid, beautifully told thriller. Hugh Grant… can act? That was the first surprise in this smooth, stylish BBC retelling of the Jeremy Thorpe scandal. He burst convincingly out of the charming fop mould he has slept in so comfortably for thirty years. What have we been missing all this time? The other shock was remembering how recent it all was. The government is still up to a lot of nonsense, but the days of this kind of cover-up, for these reasons, is surely over. Or is it?Edward St Aubyn\u0027s Patrick Melrose novels have the kind of precisely drawn interiority that makes any kind of adaptation seem doomed to fail. Instead, the Sky Atlantic series brought them convincingly to life. It is not a happy tale. In flashback we saw Patrick\u0027s childhood in the shadow of his monstrous father David (Hugo Weaving), and the decades of self-loathing and substance abuse that followed. At the centre of all this was Benedict Cumberbatch, as good as he\u0027s ever been. His Patrick could be brilliant, witty, cruel and pitiful, sometimes in the same smack-addled sentence. Weaving, Jennifer Jason Leigh as David\u0027s wife Eleanor and Pip Torrens as his ghastly friend Nicholas Pratt all put in memorable performances, too. At an age where most of us are long past doing anything, David Attenborough is still changing our expectations of what a nature documentary can do. Like The Rolling Stones, he has been on his farewell tour since about 1970, but unlike Jagger \u0026amp Co, the returns are not diminishing. Is he fuelled by anger at the world\u0027s response to climate change? Or simply driven by some massive internal dynamo, a soul-quest to improve our ability to relate to penguins? Whatever the motivation, Dynasties was wonderful, telling complex stories of the animal kingdom with beautiful photography. It\u0027s unusual for a TV writer to attract more attention than the stars or director. Perhaps the world is changing. Or perhaps it\u0027s simply that the writer of Killing Eve was Phoebe Waller-Bridge, star of Fleabag, Star Wars and one of the country\u0027s outstanding new talents. Here she turned her hand to a spy thriller, an adaptation of Luke Jennings\u0027 novels about a beautiful assassin, Villanelle (Jodie Comer), and the MI6 agent given the task of hunting her down, Eve Polastri (Sandra Oh). Both leads demanded attention: Comer the magnetic murderer, Oh the harassed but brilliant spy. The script swerved between comedy, action and drama often enough to keep everyone guessing.  Yes, the national team have played on television in a World Cup before, but I\u0027m including this because the outcome, an England penalty shoot-out victory, was so unusual as to count as a whole new format. At a time when we all watch things at different times, here was something unmistakably live. We watched Gareth Southgate\u0027s men knowing that the rest of the country was, too, poised in living rooms and pub gardens, ready to bury their heads in a sofa or throw their pints in the air. No other TV programme sold as many waistcoats. The ageing patriarch and his scheming children. Not an original concept. Trust, the drama about the last days of Getty family, proved that it was possible for a series built on this premise to have actors, scenery, direction, script, etc etc, and still somehow fall short. Succession, by comparison, felt alive. If US production values and ambition gave it its scale, its heart was dark and British. We can thank Jesse Armstrong, co-creator of Peep Show, and his all-star line-up of British writers, including the Lucy Prebble, Tony Roche and Georgia Pritchett. They made the Roy family expats themselves, and you could hear the old aristocratic froideur in every withering put-down. But we cared for them, too. One of the many TV professionals I consulted for this list thought Succession was so much better than everything else this year that the top 10 should just have it listed in bold and then nine blank spaces. I wouldn\u0027t go that far but it\u0027s certainly at the top.Lennie James\u0027s missing-child thriller Save Me looked as though it might be a paint-by-numbers affair.

I wouldn\u0027t go that far but it\u0027s certainly at the top.The talking (dick) heads are good too, especially when creators Damon Beesley and Iain Morris explain the genesis of some of the set pieces, often based on their own life experiences. Beesley, for example, confesses how he had ranted some foul-mouthed sarcastic abuse at some hapless kids for pushing in at an amusement park before bullying his way onto the ride. Smug, he turned to them and only then discovered that the selfish bastards were at the front of the rollercoaster because they had Down syndrome.\u0026nbspGreg Davies’s presence as the bad-tempered teacher Mr Gilbert is also enjoyable. No wonder that Davies went into comedy having himself been a bad-tempered teacher (“a living hell” in his seemingly sincere description). Waen Shepherd (Mr “Paedo” Kennedy) is extremely game to join in the fun –\u0026nbspperhaps surprising given the times we live in. Indeed, I wonder, only a few years on, if phrases such as “spaz” and “rapey” could be scripted now.You could call it a retrospective then, if you were pretentious enough, or “going in balls deep” if you’re Jimmy Carr.

Tackling loneliness would benefit iniduals, businesses and the economy.”It comes after a separate study found that the majority of adults in the UK who experience loneliness are afraid that no one will notice if something bad happens to them.The research, published by the\u0026nbspBritish Red Cross in November, found that approximately 9 million people in the UK said\u0026nbspthey often felt\u0026nbsplonely, with many struggling to make lasting, social connections with others.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

We should then go back to the EU with a discussion about a customs union.”Mr Corbyn also urged Labour supporters demanding he stop Brexit to “recognise a number of things”, saying: “About 60 per cent of Labour voters voted remain, about 40 per cent voted leave. We have to recognise why people voted in those directions.Conservative and Labour MPs join forces to stop no-deal Brexit“Labour is unique as a party, because it’s got to bring all sides together – hence my view on a customs union, on access to the market.”However, some estimates have put Labour voters’ backing remain at more than 60 per cent – while one recent poll found their support for a further referendum to be 80 per cent.The interview triggered a backlash from some Labour MPs, Chris Leslie, the Nottingham East MP, tweeting: “If Jeremy Corbyn facilitates Brexit he’ll share responsibility for the job losses, trade barriers and decade of austerity to come.Angela Smith, the Penistone and Stocksbridge MP, said: “We need to get the message over to Jeremy Corbyn that Labour members and supporters want a People’s Vote.”Created with Sketch.Newspapers react to Theresa May pulling the vote on her Brexit deal Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.And Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: “There you have it, Jeremy Corbyn refuses once again to take the blinkers off. He is ignoring the concerns of his own supporters and the economic damage experts warn Brexit will do to the UK economy.”In reality, the chances of a snap election in the new year are slim, with Theresa May having ruled it out – and many Tories opposed to her deal happy to run down the clock to a no-deal Brexit.Instead, Mr Corbyn is under pressure to swing behind a fresh referendum if – as seems certain – the prime minister loses the “meaningful vote”, in the second week of January and his vote of no confidence in her government fails.Some Labour insiders believe Labour backing for a referendum is all-but certain in those circumstances, given the party\u0027s inability to set out what the other “options on the table” it could pursue might be.Expats set to lose healthcare under no-deal Brexit, NHS toldThink homelessness is bad now?

Everything up until now – the endless disputes, crises and resignations, the huge cost, both in gold and other reforms forgone, are just a prelude for the tougher task ahead.If the UK leaves the EU this year, it will do so with no blueprint for its future trading terms, after Brussels comprehensively torched the Chequers plan in September.To give one example of the tortures ahead, the Commons would have to decide, in the summer of 2020, whether to implement the Irish border backstop the following January – the key controversy currently obsessing MPs.Created with Sketch.

It will take many more years than that.Even if the UK ever puts forward realistic proposals, trade talks will be held up by MEP elections and the appointment of new commissioners – creating a vacuum ripe for new more Tory Euro-wars.And the alternative to embracing the backstop – the UK staying under EU rules beyond 2020, while paying tens of billions of pounds more for the privilege – is scarcely more appealing.Turn a corner? The reality is the same road, stretching far into the distance – but strewn with even bigger potholes and boulders.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

I don\u0027t see any problem with supporting a new British business.Asked how the government knew the firm could run an effective service, he said: The reality is this has been looked at very carefully by a team of civil servants who have done due diligence on the company and reached a view they can deliver.Mr Grayling said the company was on\u0026nbsptrack to run services from April, yes and it would help to provide a bit of extra capacity in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Documents revealed that the Department for Transport had signed £107.7m agreements with French firm Brittany Ferries, Danish company DFDS and the UK’s Seaborne\u0026nbspto provide additional crossings.Pressure on Corbyn as Labour members back fresh Brexit referendumHunt under fire for hailing \u0027connections\u0027 with EU as key to successMay wants to ‘turn a corner’ after Brexit – but can it be that simple?What happens when MPs return from recess?These new routes would be equivalent\u0026nbspto around 10 per cent of all traffic on the Dover Strait, and will use other ports including Poole, Portsmouth, Plymouth, Immingham and Felixstowe.Seaborne said in a statement it had been working since 2017 on plans to reintroduce ferry sailings from Ramsgate from early 2019 and has been “financed by the shareholders” during a development phase.It added: “It was intended to start the service in mid-February but this has now been delayed until late March for operational reasons.“This coincides with the Department for Transport’s (DfT) freight capacity purchase agreement with Seaborne which is part of their preparations to increase ferry capacity in the unlikely event of a no-deal Brexit.”Liberal Democrat MP\u0026nbspLayla Moran, a supporter of the\u0026nbspBest for Britain campaign, told The Independent: “This has descended into farce.Supporting new business is one thing, awarding a multi-million pound ferry contract to a company with no ships is quite another.“If Chris Grayling is serious about supporting new British business he might wish to reconsider his position on the damaging Brexit his government is pursuing and give the people the final say.”It comes as MPs are gearing up for a Commons showdown over Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal in the coming weeks, with the prime minister facing intense pressure to win fresh concessions from Brussels.The original meaningful vote was pulled at the last minute in December in the face of near-certain defeat, triggering an unsuccessful\u0026nbspno-confidence vote in Ms May from her backbenchers,Foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt told the Today programme: We have a clear opportunity to leave the EU on 29th March.It has the vast majority of things that people wanted, not absolutely everything.The question is, can we turn this into something that gives us absolutely everything we wanted, and I believe we can.There will be some tough negotiations to follow in the years ahead but I think getting this clearer language on the backstop will help to get it through parliament.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

We’ve just accomplished the most distant flyby.”Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine said: “In addition to being the first to explore Pluto, today New Horizons flew by the most distant object ever visited by a spacecraft and became the first to directly explore an object that holds remnants from the birth of our solar system.“This is what leadership in space exploration is all about.”The radio message from the robotic craft was picked up in Madrid by one of Nasa’s big antennas. The data took six hours and eight minutes to traverse the massive breadth of space between Ultima and Earth.According to Nasa, scientists had not discovered Ultima Thule when the probe was launched in 2006, meaning the mission was unique. In 2014, astronomers found Thule using the Hubble Space Telescope and selected it for New Horizon’s extended mission in 2015. “Anything’s possible out there in this very unknown region,” said John Spencer, deputy project scientist for New Horizons. Launched in January 2006, New Horizons embarked on a 4 billion mile journey towards the solar system’s frigid edge to study the dwarf planet Pluto and its five moons. The spacecraft, which is the size of a baby grand piano, flew past Pluto in 2015, providing the first close-up views of the planet. During the flyby, the probe found Pluto to be slightly larger than previously thought. In March, it revealed that methane-rich dunes were on the icy dwarf planet’s surface.After trekking 1 billion miles beyond Pluto into the Kuiper belt, New Horizons will now seek clues about the formation of the solar system and its planets.There is a great deal scientists can learn from Ultima and the hundreds of thousands of similar bodies scientists deem to be in the solar system. Hal Weaver, project scientist on the mission, told the BBC the rock is “probably the most primitive object ever encountered by a spacecraft, the best possible relic of the early solar system”. The object is officially known as 2014 MU69, but was nicknamed Ultima Thule, a Latin phrase which means “beyond the borders of the known world”.Additional reporting by ReutersOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

We are willing to use the greatest sincerity and expend the greatest hard work to strive for the prospect of peaceful reunification.“After peaceful reunification, Taiwan will have lasting peace and the people will enjoy good and prosperous lives.

Every word of his tweet was correct — these men are sick, they are paedophiles and they are Asian.When politicians are condemned for telling the truth, for stating plain-as-day facts, you know we live in scarily censorious times.So, this week, Javid was right to turn down an invitation to “rethink” his October tweet.He was on the Today programme on Radio . A guest presenter — the British-Pakistani novelist Kamila Shamsie — asked himhe thought his tweet might have fuelled hate crimes. Coolly, and with rare principle, Javid said that of course politicians must be “careful with their language”.Butyou look at recent high-profile cases of gang-based sexual exploitation, “there is a high proportion of men that have Pakistani heritage”, he said.He’s right.Rotherham, Oxford, Rochdale, Derby, Telford, Newcastle, Huddersfield . . . across England there have been awful grooming-gang cases, where the perpetrators have largely been Muslim men and the victims white working-class girls.We must be free to talk about this. To analyse it. To ask how such a terrible situation came about where vulnerable, mostly white girls are preyed upon by wicked, mainly Muslim men.But we are not free to talk about it. Anybody who raises the issue of Muslim grooming gangs risks being branded as foul, a racist, a troublemaker whose words will fuel hate crimes.Indeed, Javid has been subjected to genuine racist abuse for speaking out on the issue.Vile, hard-left tweeters have denounced him as an “Uncle Tom” and a “coconut”.Such disgusting racist insults reveal where the real prejudice lies in this debate — not in Javid’s concerned comments, but in the PC outrage that effectively says to him: “Shut up, Coconut.” Javid was not being prejudiced but many of the supposed progressives raging against him have been.It is all a sign of the times. From Conservatives such as Javid, to Labour MP Sarah Champion and radical feminists such as Julie Bindel, anyone who expresses concern about Pakistani-heritage grooming gangs can expect to be bombarded with abuse.But a nation that cannot discuss its communal tensions is a nation that is in very serious trouble.That signicant numbers of Muslim men are abusing signicant numbers of white working-class girls suggests “multicultural Britain” is a fractured, sometimes ugly place — and we must be at liberty to talk about this.Shushing debate about Muslim grooming gangs is insulting not only to the victims of those gangs, but to Britain’s Muslim community, too.It suggests they are too fragile, too weak, to cope with honest debate about problems and crimes within their communities.So let us be thankful for Sajid Javid — a politician who is willing to look modern Britain in the face and ask it some dficult but essential questions.This is a Tory to watch.Their latest wheeze is to force restaurants and supermarkets to impose “calorie caps” on their dishes.Public Health England is thinking about stopping supermarkets from selling sarnies that have more than  calories and capping restaurant meals at  calories. This would effectively mean using the power of the state to force us slovenly, greedy plebs to go on diets.It’s so paternalistic.Here’s a radical idea – bugger off and let people eat whatever they want.Our lunchtime triple-decker sandwich and occasional restaurant blowout are none of your business.TALK about a self-fulfilling prophecy.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That would bring a bit of common sense and fairness to decision-making when boardroom pay packets are approved,” she said.“The Government should put an end to phoney incentive schemes that reward executives above and beyond the actual results they get.”Labour’s Shadow Business Secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey MP said Labour would go further than “weak Tory fudge”.She said: “Executive pay is running out of control. While the Conservatives’ watered-down regulations will only require large companies to publish pay bands, Labour in government will take decisive action on excessive pay.“Labour is committed to rolling out maximum pay ratios of : in the public sector and in companies bidding for public contracts, because it cannot be right that wages at the top keep rising while everyone ’s stagnates.“Labour will also legislate to reduce pay inequality by introducing an Excessive Pay Levy on companies with staff on very high pay.

He had disobeyed orders — it did not matter that his actions probably saved hundreds of lives.Historian Damien Lewis, whose new book tells the full story of Operation Tombola, is now demanding Lees be posthumously awarded a medal.He says: “I’ve written loads about World War Two but I’ve never started a petition before. This guy’s story ­outraged me. This man was a hero.“He was a maverick, he disobeyed orders — but we recruited mavericks and free thinkers to the SOE because we need them to do the unthinkable and break the rules of war.“Instead of getting the due reward, his reputation was trounced. It is unfair. It is a betrayal of a great British war hero.”Lees, who died in , galvanised a motley crew of  soldiers including  SAS commandos, Italian partisans and other fighters from around the world.Under his fearless leadership, they stormed a villa in Italy’s ­Apennine Mountains that was the HQ of Germany’s th Army.The villa was like a fortress, defended by more than  German troops armed with MG Spandau machine guns.Lees was known as “Wild Man” after a series of solo sabotage missions in Yugoslavia earlier in the war.Just , he was already a battle-hardened veteran of the SOE, the shady unit for “ungentlemanly warfare” PM Winston Churchill ordered to “set the lands of the enemy ablaze”.Lees took that command and ran with it, installing himself as de facto leader of a group of partisan fighters in northern Italy.His unlikely cadre of warriors hailed from all over the globe — Spaniards, escaped Soviet PoWs, former members of the French Foreign Legion, Italian freedom fighters, German defectors and a Dutch soldier who carried a long-handled ice axe.Damien said: “Lees could scrape together  irregular fighters, all speaking a dozen languages.”Often unkempt and bearded, ­sporting mismatched unorm, it was the ­British officer’s job to mobilise them into a force to be reckoned with.Needing a juicy target, Lees set up a network of spies to gather information on enemy positions.He enlisted the help of several ­gorgeous Italian women, who could use their feminine charms to ­hoodwink the enemy.Lees nicknamed them his ­stafettas, meaning messengers.Through one of them he learned of a secret Nazi base that was a key stronghold in the Gothic Line — miles of machine gun nests, trenches and minefields, bunkers and artillery positions, running from the Mediterranean to the Adriatic.It was strung together by  miles of barbed wire. The harsh winter was setting in and Allied losses were mounting.The push into Europe was stalling until a foolhardy German officer was a little loose-lipped during pillow talk.One of Lees’ stafettas ed from their romantic encounter with ­information about a previously unknown German command centre.The Nazis had set up a base at Villa Rossi in Botteghe, the HQ of five corps and the th Army.Field Marshal Kesselring was a regular visitor and taking it out would wreak havoc with Nazi communications.It was an ambitious target — but Lees couldn’t resist.Needing backup, he called in the SAS. Major Roy ­Farran was a legend, shackled to a desk job after being deemed too valuable to risk.As Farran’s team packed their parachutes and prepared to meet Lees behind enemy lines, he insisted on going up in the plane.When the moment to deploy came, Farran “accidentally” tumbled from the plane. Luckily, he happened to be wearing a parachute.Damien said: “He told the air crew to report he fell out by accident, so HQ believed him dead. Once he radioed in to ask for airdrops of supplies and weaponry, they realised what he had done. But they couldn’t get him back from behind enemy lines.”Farran and Lees were kindred sprits who hit it off at once. They started preparing for the assault.Damien said: “Farran understood the Italian mentality. He had unorms dropped in, complete with hackles — feathers in Italian colours to wear in their berets. He made them feel part of something much bigger. He made them feel they could pull off this impossible mission and survive.”He issued the men with shoulder flashes saying “Chi osera vincera” — Italian for “Who dares wins”.After a -hour march, the  fighters arrived at the German base, on the night of March , .In a final flourish, Major Farran had “Mad Piper” David Kirkpatrick parachuted in, wearing a kilt.In the darkness, the stirring sound of Highland Laddie rang out, mixing with the rattle of machine gun fire and the thud of mortar shells.Damien said: “The Germans had become very brutal in their reprisals against the Italian resistance.“Bagpipes are quintessentially ­British — so the Germans had to accept it was a British raid, so they wouldn’t burn Italian villages and kill hundreds in revenge.”Incredibly, the rag-tag team pulled it off. Fuelled by benzedrine — an amphetamine — they killed around  senior German soldiers and burned their base to the ground.Damien explained: “They took no prisoners. This was not ‘do or die’ — it was murder most brutal.“Success would shorten the war and save thousands of Allied lives.”The attack blew a gaping hole in the German line.Lees was shot five times and was carried to safety on a makesht stretcher. As his force dashed for the safety of the mountains, hunted by hundreds of German troops, Lees was smuggled through checkpoints in a stolen German ambulance.The injuries haunted Lees for the rest of his le but Operation Tombola was an unqualied success.Incredibly,Lees and Farran had listened to orders from HQ, the attack would never have gone ahead.The pair had been ordered to call off the assault moments before setting off for Villa Rossi.British authorities were worried about Communist ­leanings in the Italian partisans and were reluctant to empower them. ­Farran and Lees decided to go ahead, risking court martial on their .Damien said: “They knew they could never raise the fighters to this level of enthusiasm again.“Like Nelson, they decided to turn a blind eye.”After Tombola’s success, Farran avoided court martial and was decorated by the US. But Lees got nothing — though Farran recommended him for the Military Cross.Damien said: “Lees was languishing in hospital. He was hung out to dry.“Not only was his Military Cross refused, he was ­savaged by his peers and accused of insubordination. But he never showed any bitterness.”With the backing of Lees’ daughter, Christine Bueno, , Damien has launched a petition ­urging Parliament to award Lees the medal he deserved.Christine, who lives in Blandford, Dorset, said: “My father wasn’t a bitter man but the fact remains, he deserved a medal. He was motivated by one thing, always — to do the right thing.“I’ve lived with this all my le. I was born a year after Operation Tombola. My family would be thrilled to bits for him to get the medal.This is a man history has not recognised. What he achieved unquestionably saved lives.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

winds sweeping in from the Arctic circle will herald a big change in the weather.She said: “It is going to feel noticeably colder as we go through the rest of the week, we expect fairly widespread frosts, freezing fog and very chilly temperatures especially in the breeze.“Temperatures in the north will struggle to get much above freezing while where they will generally hover in single figures through the week.“There may be more of an Atlantic influence by the weekend which will lt temperatures in western Britain, but it is still going to feel cold widely.”Pressure patterns responsible for the recent calm conditions have shted to pull freezing air in from the north, she said.She added: “We have had a re-organisation of high pressure which is now bringing cold northerly air originating from Iceland into Britain.“It will be very cold overnight and there could be some stubborn fog to deal with on Thursday morning.PHE warned severe cold weather, icy conditions and heavy snow could wreak havoc into the weekend.Slow-clearing freezing fog and below-average temperatures may see the alert ramped up before the end of the week, it said.Elderly and vulnerable people are urged to wrap up and take extra care while out and about to avoid falls on icy pavements.The PHE warning states: “Prolonged periods of cold weather can be dangerous, especially for the very young, very old or those with chronic diseases.“This weather could increase the health risks to vulnerable patients and disrupt the delivery of services.“Cold weather criteria may still be met in some central, southern, and southwestern areas over the weekend where any freezing fog patches are slow to clear.“This may require the alert level being raised in these areas later this week.”Malcolm Booth, chief executive of the National Federation of Occupational Pensioners , added: “Very cold weather can strike quickly and catch people unaware, especially the more vulnerable.“It is vital that people prepare for cold weather ahead and make sure their homes are heated and they have enough in to keep them going.“Elderly people should also take extra care while out and about as it is easy to fall on icy pavements and the consequences can be serious.”Long-range forecasters say this could be the start of a y cold spell with winter set to lock in for the next month at least.A split in the so-called Polar Vortex driven by rising stratospheric temperatures threatens a repeat of last winter’s Beast from the East.What could be the strongest Sudden Stratospheric Warmingever observed is about to set in driving the cold weather, according to climate experts.An SSW event was responsible for triggering the extreme cold which virtually ground Britain to a standstill at the start of last year.This time round it could be worse with temperatures in the Polar stratosphere expected to rocket before the end of the month.Climatologist Judah Cohen from the US AESsaid temperature rises of up to C over the North Pole threaten to drive the strongest SSW ever recorded.While the potential impacts are still under discussion it could bring heavy snow across Europe, Eurasia and the US, he warned.He said: “NASA Model [s] [are] predicting close to all time record warmth at the North Pole in the stratosphere.“Temperatures are predicted to warm by nearly C or F in just a few days.“The most robust cold signal following a signicant PV [Polar Vortex] disruption is Northern Eurasia consistent with the temperature forecast.”SSW which triggered the Beast from the East big freeze in March happens when air over the North Pole warms and compresses.This stops mild westerly winds reaching Britain while opening the floodgates to freezing easterlies.A Met Office spokesman said: “There are increasing chances we could see temperatures turn colder as we move into the New Year.“This is connected to disruption of the winds high above the earth’s surface, in an event known as a Sudden Stratospheric Warming .“This increases the chances of colder-than-average weather in January and the rest of winter.”James Madden, forecaster for Exacta Weather, said January threatens to bring the coldest spell of winter so far.He said: “January is shaping up to be a colder than average month overall, while temperatures may deviate at times we expect to see some of the coldest temperatures of the winter within this period.“There is also a risk of several widespread snow events and over all we expect temperatures to be at well below-average for the month.”Thermometers are forecast to e below freezing across the nation at the weekend with daytime highs in low single figures.Windchill charts show feels-like temperatures of -C across parts of Wales and central England by the weekend with widespread lows of between -C and -C.It will bring a start contrast from the start of the week when the mercury hit .C in Boyne, Scotland, over the New Year."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT0004053026481.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"teenagers get half price rail travel as ministers announce new 16

never had a peanut allergy before, had a severe allergic reaction after eating a peanut butter and jam sandwich.Baffled by the sudden onset of the allergy doctors ran tests and discovered her blood had high levels of peanut-specic immunoglobulin, which causes an allergic reaction to the nuts.Two weeks before her reaction the patient had a lung transplant from a donor who had a peanut allergy.The antibodies that trigger an allergic reaction to peanuts were passed onto the woman through the donor lung, medics believe.Her case was published in the journal Transplant Proceedings.Dr Mazen Odish, a fellow in pulmonary and critical care medicine at the University of Calornia - San Diego Medical Center, who treated the woman said it was very rare for a patient to get a food allergy from a donor organ.There have only been about five reported cases of it happening after a lung transplant, he told Live Science.In this case, the woman needed a lung transplant to treat emphysema, a condition that damages the sacs in the lungs and makes it dficult to breathe.Her donor was a -year-old man.The day before she was scheduled to be sent home from hospital she developed tightness in her chest and was struggling to breathe.She underwent multiple tests but doctors couldnt find a cause for her condition.It wasnt until she said her symptoms started as soon as she ate peanut butter in her sandwich that medics realised it was an allergic reaction.Doctors contacted the transplant agency and discovered the donor had suffered with a peanut allergy.Although its rare for food allergies to be transferred from organ donors to transplant recipients, it can occur.Cases of food allergies being acquired from organ donors have been reported after liver, kidney, lung, bone marrow, heart and kidney transplants, the authors wrote.Not every patient who gets an organ from a donor with a food allergy will develop the same allergy though.Some studies have found that those who receive donor livers from someone with an allergy are more likely to develop the allergy.Other studies have found that  transplant-acquired food allergies are more likely when patients are given tacrolimus, an immunosuppressive drug used to reduce the risk of rejection.The woman in this case had been on tacrolimus.Skin tests later confirmed the woman was now allergic to peanuts as well as almonds, cashews, coconuts and hazelnuts.She was given an EpiPen in case of another allergic reaction."},{"url":null,"title":"tesco anus tinned beef curry","story":"Andrew Lee parted with £. for his favourite TV dinner

before.There was the beginning of a tube then it was cut off. There was a bit of string on it too.Its weird. I dont think its fat - its super smooth. The texture is like silk.Someone said it could be a blood vessel but do they get that big Id already eaten half of my dinner before I found it and I felt sick.

Well, it could be beef, but not meat beef.Normally you dont get any kind of fat or anything. Ive never had anything odd in there before.I couldnt eat for about two days after that. Its the first diet thats worked.I normally love the beef curry with some jasmine rice and poppadoms. Its quite tasty.But I wont be having those tins again and I wont look at cats the same either.After complaining to the supermarket giant online, Tesco immediately replied with: I would suggest... taking this product with the thing and receipt into your local store for this to be investigated properly by my colleagues at the customer service desk.However Tesco have since claimed the anus is in fact a large blood vessel and asked Andrew tothe thing so that it can be investigated further.Andrew said: Tesco even replied calling it a thing. It made me feel worsetheyre taking it so seriously too.After the Facebook post people were messaging me about it in disgust asId found a new species.

About time too. But still, it’s progress.And there is no doubt that ­attitudes to women are changing.We’ve got a second female Prime ­Minister and a female playing the lead in Doctor Who.And women are rising up. We are organising, ­protesting, shaming and building power.We are making the women’s movement central to everyone’s conversation. Women are finding their voice.And the most important thing is we are getting heard.We are not going to accept mansplaining or being ­spoken down to “stupid woman”.Feminism is the word of the year, with more and more women standing up for themselves and demanding equality, and I predict that process is going to continue in .Now that I think about it, there were other good things about .It was the year we rediscovered hope in football during the World Cup.We did better than we thought we would — and it’s not often we can say that.The England team and manager Gareth Southgate restored our ­national self-esteem and gave us something to cheer about when there really was not much .The World Cup showed us nice guys can win.Sure, we didn’t bring home the trophy but it’s fair to say Gareth Southgate’s a winner in everyone’s eyes.And it’s not over yet:  is the women’s football World Cup — so that’s something to look forward to with hope.Hope is an important word. And now, more than ever, we need to find a way to hang on to the things that make us feel optimistic about the future.There were other hopeful things about .This was the year that gave us the breath of fresh air that is Meghan Markle — and it also saw the most stylish royal wedding this country has probably ever seen.Meghan was a signier of change for the Royal Family, which needed to modernise.And while I know some people have decided she is “pushy”, or criticise her for her relationship with her father, I think Meghan is one of the best things that has ever happened to our royals.We also had a royal baby — Prince Louis — and now we have another one on the way, which is happy news.My personal highlight of  was having lunch at Buckingham Palace with the Queen.It really was a wonderful occasion, spending intimate time talking to such an inspiring woman.And now here we are, poised on the brink of .I’m not a New Year’s Eve ­person.

The party leader has resisted growing calls to back another EU referendum, instead calling for a general election and promising to strike his own Brexit deal with Brussels. But a study of Labour members found % want the chief to get behind a second vote, while % of Labour voters also want him to support another poll. Professor Tim Bale, of Queen Mary University London, said: Our survey of Labours grassroots clearly shows that Corbyns apparent willingness to see the UK leave the EU - a stance he has recently reiterated - is seriously at odds with what the overwhelming majority of Labours members want, and it doesnt reflect the views of most Labour voters either.  The party leader spent  years criticising Brussels before switching to support Remain when he seized the Labour reins in . Critics blasted what they described as his lacklustre campaigning – contrasting it with his enthusiasm during the  general election battle. Mr Corbyn is committed to seeing through BrexitLabour wins power. But todays poll suggest tens of thousands of party members could quit over the leaderships approach to leaving the EU. Some % oppose the partys Brexit stance - and % of those told researchers it has caused them to consider quitting. That would be equivalent to around , members, according to the projects analysis.  Nearly a quarter - % - of Labour members blame Mr Corbyns failure to back a second referendum down to a belief he secretly supports Brexit. If there is another referendum - and a three-way question - % of members would back Remain, % would leave with Theresa Mays deal and % would support quitting without an agreement. If the choice was between the Prime Ministers pact and leaving without a deal, % of Labour members would boycott the vote. But % said they would take Mrs Mays deal. Some % of Labour members - compared with % of current Labour voters and only % of all voters - are convinced leaving the EU without a deal would cause economic damage in the medium to long-term.  Prof Bale added: “Our survey suggests Labour’s membership is overwhelmingly in favour of the UK remaining in the EU and badly wants a referendum to achieve that end. “It also suggests that Labour voters, while not as keen as the party’s members on either count, are in the same camp. “Labour’s grassroots clearly hate Brexit, and although many of them still love Corbyn, he might not be able rely for much longer on their support for him trumping their opposition to leaving the EU. “As a result, our research is bound to increase the pressure on Labour’s leader to get off the fence.” A party spokesman said: As unanimously agreed at Labour Party conference,Theresa Mays botched Brexit deal is voted down in Parliament then a General Election should be called. In line with the policy agreed at conference,the Conservatives block a General Election then we will keep all options on the table, including the option of campaigning for a public vote.

Blundering Chris Grayling said it was no problem that the firm had been given a poundmillion deal because its a new start-up business. He made the bizarre excuse despite Seaborne Freight being expected to run emergency ferriestheres no deal, keeping supplies of essential goods flowing into the UK, in just three months time. The Tory Cabinet minister also called Seaborne a small business, despite the size and importance of the contract. Seaborne was announced as one of three lines to operate services between Kents port of Ramsgate and the continent in the event of a no-deal departure. But it quickly emerged it had no vessels and had never previously run a ferry service, despite winning the pound.million contract.   Mr Grayling claimed: “I make no apologies for supporting a new British business. I dont think theres anything wrong in the Government supporting small business.”He insisted ministers “looked very carefully at this business” and the contract was tightly-drawn-up so theyd have to deliver. He told the BBC: “They will be on track to run ferries in April. This is something we havent plucked from thin air.” He added: I dont see any problem in supporting a new British business. Lib Dem MP Layla Moran, of the anti-Brexit Best For Britain campaign, said: This has descended into farce.   Supporting new business is one thing, awarding a multi million pound ferry contract to a company with no ships is quite another.If Chris Grayling is serious about supporting new British business he might wish to reconsider his position on the damaging Brexit his government is pursuing and give the people the final say. The contract was revealed last week by the BBC. Tory councillor Paul Messenger questioned the contract, saying: It has no ships and no trading history so how can due diligence be done  Why choose a company that never moved a single truck in their entire history and give them pound million  I dont understand the logic of that. Mr Grayling shot back: “I am not quite sure what an inidual Conservative councillor would be able to tell us.  Seaborne was set up two years ago and has been in negotiations about running freight ferries between Ramsgate and Ostend, but no services are currently running. And narrow berths in the port mean there are few suitable commercial vessels available. In a statement, the company said it had been working since  on plans to reintroduce ferry sailings from Ramsgate from early . The business has been financed by the shareholders during a development phase involving locating suitable vessels, making arrangements with the ports of Ostend and Ramsgate, building the infrastructure - such as bunkering - as well as crewing the ferries once they start operating. It added: It was intended to start the service in mid-February but this has now been delayed until late March for operational reasons. This coincides with the Department for Transports Freight Capacity Purchase Agreement with Seaborne which is part of their preparations to increase ferry capacity in the unlikely event of a no-deal Brexit. But Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Sir Ed Davey said it pretty much sums up their farcical approach to the entire Brexit fiasco.

MPs are due to vote in the week of January  on the UKs Brexit deal - and we could crash out of the EU with no deal on March its rejected. The Brexit deal agreed by Theresa May and the EU covers two areas: the Withdrawal Agreement, covering the UKs exit from the EU, and the Political Declaration on a Future Framework, which sets out the relationship with the EU after Britain leaves. Key details on the Brexit deal include: . The Withdrawal AgreementThe transition period can be extended until  - after the next election Goods face being checked between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK A backstop could extend EU customs rules UK-wide - and wed need Brussels permission to quit European courts will still have a big hold on the UK. The Future FrameworkComprehensive arrangements that will create a free trade area - not exactly the frictionless trade hoped for Possible EU access to British fishing waters We would remain tied to European courts Wed respect human rights laws Visas needed for long term trips to the EU It has built in vagueness - kicking the can down the road for further negotiationsRead about the deal in more depth here.   ex-MPs have a security pass for the Houses of Parliament including disgraced former ministers Chris Huhne and Jonathan Aitken.

Punctuality plunged to a -year low in  after  months of delays, cancellations and overcrowding on many lines. Yet thanks to todays hike, commuters will be paying nearly pound, a year more to travel to work than in . As protesters gathered at stations around the country today, an analysis by the TUC reveals British commuters spend up to FIVE times as much on their season tickets as their counterparts in Europe. At the same time rail firms have paid a staggering pound billion to shareholders in the last six years, which the TUC says is “rewarding failure.” Scroll down for the  steepest season ticket rises since  - and examples of how common season tickets are up this year  Yet shameless Tory Transport Secretary Chris Grayling blamed rail workers for demanding better pay. Jeremy Corbyn branded the rise a disgrace and a shame and said Labour would bring railways back into public ownership. He added: Our railways system should work for the interests of everybody, not just the profits of a few. Research by Labour of  routes shows the average commuter will now be paying pound, for their season ticket, pound more than in  and average fares have risen three times faster than wages.  The highest increase was on a Virgin Trains season ticket between Birmingham and London Euston which has risen by pound, since  and now costs pound,. ,],totalVotes:,votesToShow:,mentometerId:,publicationId:,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  vote,closed:,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"  But the biggest percentage increase identied was between Thame Bridge Parkway, near Walsall, West Midlands and Nuneaton, where the cost of an annual season ticket will have risen by % since . In Prime Minister Theresa May’s own constituency the cost of an annual season ticket from Maidenhead in Berkshire to London Paddington has risen by pound since .  Regulated fares, about % of all tickets, are rising by an average of .% while the average rise for all fares including unregulated ones is .%. Bruce Williamson, of campaign group Railfuture, claimed passengers are being given another kick in the wallet following a terrible year on the railway. Andy McDonald MP, Labour’s Shadow Transport Secretary, said:“Today’s rail fare increases are an affront to everyone who has had to endure years of chaos on Britain’s railways. “Falling standards and rising fairs are a national disgrace. The Government must now step in to freeze fares on the worst performing routes.  “Labour will bring our railways back into public ownership so they are run in the interests of passengers, not private profit.” The amount by which train companies can raise regulated fares, which include season tickets and most other commuter tickets, is the responsibility of Transport Secretary Chris Grayling. He has the power to enforce this but has done nothing. Labour has committed to keeping fares down and pegged to no more than a rise of the Consumer Price Indexrather than the Retail Price Index , which is used by the government even though it is no longer an official measure of inflation. Labour has also called on the government to freeze rail fares on the routes most severely affected by the timetable changes - Govia Thameslink, Arriva Rail North and First Transpennine Express.  The timetable changes last May plunged busy rail routes in the North of England, London and the south east into chaos for weeks and led to calls for ‘failing’ Graqyling to resign. Meanwhile, the TUC said its analysis shows that rail fares are rising faster than wages for the ninth time in the last decade. But the rail companies putting up fares have made “excessive” shareholder payouts given the poor-quality service and high costs that workers face commuting by rail. The union body also says British commuters have the worst deal in Europe. Do all fares rise by .% in   No. This figure is an average from regulated fares. These make up just under half of all fares and include most season tickets, anytime tickets in cities, and some off-peak long-distance s. What about unregulated fares  They have much more flexibility to be hit with big hikes in . However, the average rise across all fare types is .%. Why do fares go up so fast  Its long been a political decision - since before the Tories - to make passengers foot more of the bill of our subsidised railways over time. The .% figure is set at what RPI inflation was in July. Where does the money go  Industry body the Rail Delivery Group says profit margins for rail firms are about %, with the rest going on running the railway. But the TUC says rail firms have paid more than poundbillion to shareholders in six years while passengers are ripped off. What do politicians say  The Tory government says it is investing in the biggest modernisation of the network since Victorian times, while passenger numbers have more than doubled since the network was privatised in the s. But Labour says it is being badly-run and should be renationalised. Someone on an average salary travelling from Chelmsford to London will have to fork out % of their pay for season tickets . By contrast, comparable commutes would cost a mere % of the average salary in France, % in Ireland and % in Germany and Belgium. Frances O’Grady, TUC general secretary, said:”The most reliable thing about our railways is the cash that goes to private shareholders each year. “But with the most expensive fares in Europe, that can’t be right. It’s rewarding failure and taking money away that should be invested in better services.  “It’s time to take the railways back into public hands. Every penny from every fare should go back into the railways. The number one priority should be running a world class railway service, not private profit.” Mick Cash, leader of the RMT rail union, added:“The British fare-payer has been battered by the toxic combination of gross mismanagement and profiteering by the private companies exploiting Britain’s rip-off railways. “Our passengers have been left paying the highest fares in Europe to travel on rammed-out and unreliable services and that is a national disgrace. The only solution is to sweep this whole racket away andour railways to public ownership.”Darren Shirley, chief executive of Campaign for Better Transport, said: “Rail passengers suffered atrocious service in  and today’s .% fare rise will only add to their misery. “The Government’s decision to press ahead with this fare rise despite a year of delays, cancellations and overcrowding, shows a total disregard for passengers and may leave many wondering what they are paying for. “The review of the railways currently underway must prioritise passengers’ needs and recommend a fundamental reform of the fares system and how fares are set.”  Anthony Smith, chief executive of the independent watchdog Transport Focus, said:“Passengers won’t believe this is not fake news! Rail fares are going up in January after a year blighted by timetable chaos, poor performance and strikes. Until day-to-day reliability s, with fewer signicant delays and cancellations, passenger trust won’t begin to recover. And Alex Hayman, of the consumer group Which , said:”These price rises will be hard to bear for passengers who have endured delays and cancellations on an unprecedented scale over the past year. “It is therefore no surprise that levels of trust and satisfaction with value for money on the railways are so low.” The worst  season ticket rises since KEY Route:  price -  price, pound increaseBirmingham - London : pound, - pound,, pound,Coventry - London Euston : pound, - pound,, pound,Swindon - London: pound, - pound,, pound,Stoke-on-Trent - Milton Keynes Central: pound, - pound,, pound,Norwich - London: pound, - pound,, pound,Source: Labour research Fare rises in top Cabinet ministers constituencies KEY Minister: Route  pricePM Theresa May: Maidenhead- London Paddington pound,Chancellor Philip Hammond: Weybridge – London Waterloo pound,Transport Secretary Chris Grayling: Epsom – London Victoria or Waterloo pound,Source: Labour research FOR INFO: Season ticket data for  has been taken from the Avantix Travellerdatabase.  are based on a .% increase on  prices which have been taken from the National Rail season ticket calculator.

She’s scared thatshe travels to see her family in Dundee, she won’t get back into the US, which she now calls home. Elizabeth has been fighting Henry through the courts for a mutual orce settlement that would allow her immigration status to be claried. She said she was duped into signing annulment documents but launched the court battle after realising that the papers offered no clarity about her right to stay in the US. Elizabeth fears she will be unable to convince immigration officers of her right to stay in the country as she has no official documentation from her orce. Her case has been repeatedly thrown out by judges and the courts say the case is closed because the marriage was annulled. Elizabeth claims the marriage was annulled illegally because she thought she was signing immigration documents relating to her residency. Several lawyers have tried and failed to fight her case. She told the Daily Record: “I have built a le for myself here and made friends. I want to fight for a legal orce from my husband and need the courts to help me. “I want to be able to come home and visit family but I’d have to answer to immigration before I’d be allowed to leave and probably won’t get back in. “My mother died two years ago and I couldn’t even come home. “I can’t remarry. I can’t work legally here and I can’t get any health insurance. I’m stuck.”  Elizabeth worked as a babysitter for Henry, looking after his children following the death of his we, when they struck up a relationship. They got married in Scotland and she said her husband assured her he had registered her arrival in New York and their marriage – but never did. She added: “He is an American citizen, born in Brooklyn. “His we had died. He had two young twin boys and I met him through an advert for a live-in babysitter. “I was his babysitter for four years prior to marrying him. “I never thought that he would do this to me. I believe he basically just wanted me to raise his kids. “He was supposed to register me and our marriage in the US. “When the marriage broke down, I ended up staying in a shelter for the homeless. “I never existed officially in the States until .” Elizabeth is only able to stay in the US as an “abused spouse”. She has shown the Record letters from a lawyer in the UK, which state it is unlikely that her marriage can be annulled in the US. Elizabeth, who is living in a friend’s home and supporting herself by doing upholstering and cleaning, complained to the New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct over the case in . She said: “I tried to file another appeal about two years ago. I hired five attorneys and none of them have been able to do anything. “I can’t get anything to immigration to prove my status and I need the court to take this up so I can finally get some answers.” The Daily Record tried to contact Henry but did not receive a reply.

The members of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Youth Associationwere up early and picking up rubbish and litter across Britain shortly after sunrise. They held a special prayer before putting on their hi-vis jackets and heading out into the empty streets to pick up any waste after last nights festivities.  Pictures show the groups holding orange plastic bags as they collect litter in Bolton. They wrapped up warm against the early morning chill and were all smiles when they finished their New Years Day clean-up and posed with lots of full bags.

Islam urges every Muslim to partake in charitable giving, community service, and promote cleanliness.  AMYA has and continues to instill young people with a sense of civic responsibility, and a desire to promote harmony within our local communities. The New Year’s Day Clean-up campaign ensures Muslim youth can be active members of society and serve their communities and the environment. Throughout , the AMYA planted more than , tress across the UK and held more than  community clean up events.  AMYA is the largest and oldest Muslim youth group in the UK. AMYA Yorkshire youth coordinator Nadeem Ahmed said: We’ve been doing the New Year’s clean-up for many years now, and each year we see more and more members coming to help. In Islam “Cleanliness is Part of Faith” so there’s no better way to serve our faith and our country, there’s no better way for us to start the new year.

In the Royal Bolton Hospital, eight wards were closed over New Year after an outbreak of the bug - with staff urging patients families to stay away. Visiting restrictions were put in place and anyone with symptoms of norovirus were told to avoid the hospital for at least  hours after they had subsided. The bug is often called the winter vomiting bug, but you can catch norovirus all year round.The NHS advises not going to your GP, as norovirus can spread to others very easily. Call your GP or NHS you’re concerned or need any advice. The latest NHS norovirus report says: Reports of suspected and confirmed outbreaks of norovirus in hospitals in England to week , are currently at lower levels than the average number for the same period in the previous five seasons from season   to season  . Symptoms of norovirus You’re likely to have norovirusyou experience: suddenly feeling sick, projectile vomiting, watery diarrhoea. Some people also have a slight fever, headaches, painful stomach cramps and aching limbs. The symptoms appear one to two days after you become infected and typically last for up to  or  days.  What to doyou have norovirus If you experience sudden diarrhoea and vomiting, the best thing to do is to stay at home until you’re feeling better . There’s no cure for norovirus, so you have to let it run its course. You don’t usually need to get medical advice unless there’s a risk of a more serious problem. To help ease your own or your child’s symptoms: Drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration . You need to drink more than usual to replace the fluids lost from vomiting and diarrhoea – as well as water, adults could also try fruit juice and soup. Avoid giving fizzy drinks or fruit juice to children as it can make their diarrhoea worse. Babies should continue to feed as usual, either with breast milk or other milk feeds. Take paracetamol for any fever or aches and pains. Get plenty of rest.  If you feel like eating, eat plain foods such as soup, rice, pasta and bread . Use special rehydration drinks made from sachets bought from pharmaciesyou have signs of dehydration, such as a dry mouth or dark urine. Adults can take antidiarrhoeal and anti-emeticmedication – these aren’t suitable for everyone though, so you should check the medicine leaflet or ask or your pharmacist or GP for advice before trying them. Babies and young children, especiallythey’re less than a year old, have a greater risk of becoming dehydrated. Norovirus can spread very easily, so you should wash your hands regularly while you’re ill and stay off work or school until at least  hours after the symptoms have cleared to reduce the risk of passing it on.  When to get medical advice You don’t normally need to see your GPyou think you or your child has norovirus, as there’s no specic treatment for it. Antibiotics won’t help because it’s caused by a virus. Visiting your GP surgery with norovirus can put others at risk, so it’s best to call your GP or NHS you’re concerned or feel you need advice. While caring for an infant or yourself get medical advice : Your baby or child has passed  or more watery stools in the past  hours, or has vomited  times or more in the past  hours Your baby or child is less responsive, feverish, or has pale or mottled skin You or your child has symptoms of severe dehydration, such as persistent dizziness, only passing small amounts of urine or no urine at all, or reduced consciousness – babies and elderly people have a greater risk of becoming dehydrated You have bloody diarrhoea Your symptoms haven’t started to improve after a few days You or your child have a serious underlying condition, such as kidney disease, and have diarrhoea and vomiting Your GP may suggest sending off a sample of your stool to a laboratory to confirm whether you have norovirus or another infection.  How to stop norovirus spreading Norovirus spreads very easily in public places such as hospitals, nursing homes and schools. You can catch itsmall particles of vomit or poo from an infected person get into your mouth, such as through: close contact with someone with norovirus – they may breathe out small particles containing the virus that you could inhale touching contaminated surfaces or objects – the virus can survive outside the body for several days, eating contaminated food – this can happenan infected person doesn’t wash their hands before handling food A person with norovirus is most infectious from when their symptoms start until  hours after all their symptoms have passed, although they may also be infectious for a short time before and after this. You can get norovirus more than once because the virus is always changing, so your body is unable to build up long-term resistance to it. Stay off work or school until at least  hours after the symptoms have passed. You should also avoid visiting anyone in hospital during this time.

She was just , struggling to fit into a size  and already feeling like she’d wasted her young le. At st lbs, she weighed the same as her age – and didn’t have the confidence to do anything her fellow teenagers were doing. She’d pulled out of girls’ holidays, stopped going on nights out and was even embarrassed to hold her boyfriend Sam’s hand in public. But now all that has changed – because Lucie is literally less than half the woman she used to be. Now a trim st lb, she loves nothing more than dressing her tiny size - frame in slinky dresses. And last summer she wore a bikini for the first time in her le on a Spanish holiday. “I have lost st lbs and feel like a completely new woman,” says Lucie, now .“I missed out on all the fun and excitement my teenage years should have been – going on nights out and on holiday – because of my weight. “So I didn’t want to ruin my adult le by being obese.” Lucie, a teaching assistant for special needs children, realised just how awful her le had become shortly before her th birthday in August . She had been living as a recluse, scoffing her favourite junk food because she felt too ashamed to go out. Her friends started asking what she wanted to do to celebrate her birthday – and she realised the answer was nothing.  “Finding something to wear, then getting the confidence to go out, and then hearing remarks from people when I finally plucked up the courage to go out was too much,” says Lucie. “Strangers would make comments about what clothes I was wearing and how they didn’t suit me and weren’t flattering. “My friends eventually stopped asking me to go out with them because I would always just say no or come up with an excuse. “From the age of  to  I practically didn’t go out at all and I rarely went clothes shopping. I had lost all of those years. I didn’t have any le experience.” Lucie’s weight had started to creep up throughout her teenage years after she was diagnosed with asthma. It fuelled her appetite and she remembers losing all self-control. “Food was like a blanket for me, a comfort,” she says. “It never let me down. Whenever anything went wrong, food was always there for me. “The times when I did go shopping and couldn’t fit in anything, I would go to McDonald’s afterwards because I would feel upset, and then the whole vicious cycle would start again. ” Lucie, who is ft ins tall, didn’t even have the self-confidence to meet her boyfriend Sam’s friends and family.  They stopped holding hands in public because Lucie struggled to keep up with his walking pace. “Sam has been through this whole process with me and it just means so much to me now that he can be proud of me as his girlfriend,” she smiles. Now, over the space of  months, Lucie has done everything she has always dreamed of. Not only has she been on holiday with Sam’s family, she loves going to adventure parks, no longer worried she won’t be able to get involved in all the activities. Sam’s friends even joke that he’s got a new girlfriend. “It feels like we’re in a new relationship, like our relationship is just starting now – it’s so great,” she says. One of her biggest inspirations to lose weight and change her le was her mum Catrina’s own successful weight loss at Slimming World. She had shed three and a half stone and eventually managed to persuade Lucie to join a local group. Within her first week at the Paston and Gunthorpe club in Peterborough, Cambs, Lucie had lost five pounds and was over the moon. “I was clearly the youngest person there,” she recalls.“I was terried walking through the doors, but my mum was with me every step of the way. I was just so embarrassed that I was so young and I had let myself get that big.“It was so upsetting to get on those scales and see how heavy I actually was. “But everyone was so friendly and put me at ease straight away.” As her self-confidence rose, her weight went down.Her original goal was to lose six stone, but then when she had shed that she aimed for eight, and then she just kept on going.  “I found myself thinking, ‘Oh, this really isn’t too bad’ “Slimming World taught me how to adapt some of my favourite meals, such as fry-ups, burgers and fish and chips, meaning I could still eat them – so it didn’t really feel like a diet at all.“It didn’t feel like I was missing out on anything.” That’s one of the reasons Lucie has found it so easy to avoid falling off the wagon, even at Christmas time, by opting for healthy versions of her favourite festive treats. She’s also taken up exercise, which has been another learning curve. “I didn’t exercise at all throughout my weight loss, and my excess skin really hindered me going to the gym as I got a lot of sores,” she explains. “So me and Sam go on lots of walks to improve my fitness levels. “Generally, I can just be more active in my day-to-day le now. I don’t get out of breath walking alongside Sam, or playing with the kids at school, or walking up the stairs.” Lucie has replaced her food cravings with fun and adventure. She had a huge st birthday party, surrounded by friends and family. And while on holiday in Calpe, Spain, Lucie went to a waterpark and into the sea for the first time in her le, riding on a jetski. “It felt amazing not having to get a seatbelt clip on the plane and be able to sit in all the rides at the waterpark,” she says.“I look back at the last  years and feel really sad that I haven’t been able to have these experiences. “The only regret I have is that I wish I had lost the weight sooner. I finally have my le back.” Now Lucie is looking to the future, hoping to buy a house with Sam, , go on another holiday and maintain her weight.“When I look in the mirror now and then look at old photos, I just can’t believe how far I have come,” she says. “When I was big I used to say, ‘I wish all this fat would just disappear’. “And I look in the mirror now, and it has all disappeared. My target now is just to enjoy le – and make more crazy memories.”  LUCIE’s menu before Breakfast: McDonald’s or a fry-up Lunch: Two supermarket meal deals with two sandwiches, two packets of crisps and two full-fat Cokes or energy drinks Dinner: A pizza or Chinese takeaway Snacks: Pork pies, sausage rolls, savoury mini eggs, chocolate, sweets HER MENU After Breakfast: Weetabix with strawberries anda banana Lunch: Homemade pasta salad Dinner: Slimming World lasagne or American-style burgers and chips Snacks: Boiled eggs, fruit, ham slices, vegetable sticks"},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather deep freeze begins","story":"NewsUK weather forecast: Freeze begins TODAY as back-to-work Brits face icy - commuteMet Office forecasters are warning people to \"be prepared\" and leave extra time for journeys as cars and roads could be covered in a widespread frostShareCommentsByAbigail OLeary:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video weather-forecast-first-week-january-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe UKs deep freeze begins TODAY as Brits ing to work after the festive period faced a spine-chilling - commute. Met Office forecasters are warning people to be prepared and leave extra time for journeys as cars and roads could be covered in a widespread frost. And the chilly start looks set to stick around, as meteorologists monitor the possibility of a longer period of arctic conditions - similar to last years Beast from the East which saw most of the country thrown into chaos. Forecasters are predicting conditions to get really cold, really quickly. Speaking about the chances of a second big chill, Met Office spokesman Simon Partridge said a similar three-month forecast at the start of last year was even harsher than expected.  He said: Last year there was widespread snow across many parts of the UK and temperatures were well below average. Theres a higher chance of seeing colder spells, and given that, as a result, theres a slightly higher chance of snow across the UK. On todays chilly start, Met Office forecaster Emma Smith said: Its going to be a pretty cold start to the day - temperatures were down to minus six in Scotland and there has been a quite widespread frost. Its dry out there so there wont be a problem on the roads - theres not much moisture around so obviously not much ice around. Theres only been a few patches of mist near the Scottish border, so its been quite a clear night in the sense theres not any fog. So itll be fine to drive to work, but it will be cold.  A low of minus C was recorded by the Met Office at Glasgow and Braemar in the early hours of Wednesday, while lows of minus Cwere recorded in North Wales and minus Cin the North West of England. Temperatures are expected to peak at around Cin London as the day wears on, with highs of Cin Manchester, Cin Newcastle and Cin Edinburgh. Ms Smith said: It will be a dry day and, throughout, the best of the sunshine will be in the west, mainly for Scotland, north-west England, Wales and the South West. For eastern areas, were looking at a cloudy day, and Northern Ireland is largely cloudy as well - but a dry day with really light winds.  It will be a lot colder than we have had recently. Temperatures in the north, for parts of Scotland, are not getting above plus onetoday and in northern England - Carlisle is plus two . Its going to be single figures really for much of the country, even in the south. Londons expected to get up to seven degrees, but quite a lot of places in the south are between five and six degrees for today - much colder than weve seen of late really.

Episode two of US comedians Hasan Minhajs Patriot Act was removed after it criticised Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman over the alleged murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Mr Khashoggi, a vocal critic of the kingdoms royal family, was killed at the the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October. Netflix confirmed to the Financial Times it had pulled the episode after receiving a complaint from the kingdoms Communications and Information Technology Commission that it violated Saudi anti-cybercrime law.  The streaming giant said: We strongly support artistic freedom and removed this episode only in Saudi Arabia after we had received a valid legal request - and to comply with local law. The episode in question is reportedly still available in Saudi Arabia on YouTube.  In it, Minhaj criticises Saudi Arabia for Mr Khashoggis death and the countrys involvement in the ongoing war in Yemen. Saudi Arabia has charged  people with the death of Mr Khashoggi, though strongly denies that the crown prince ordered the killing.  In December, the US Senate passed a resolution saying the crown prince is responsible for the death. Karen Attiah, Mr Khashoggis editor at The Washington Post, said Netflixs decision was quite outrageous. She tweeted: @hasanminhaj of @patriotact has been a strong, honest andvoice challenging Saudi Arabia + Mohammed bin Salman in the wake of #khashoggis murder. He brought awareness about Yemen. Quite outrageous that netflix has pulled one of his episodes critical of Saudi Arabia.

If I got a phone call to say that has changed I would be over the moon. But I don’t think we can sit back hoping for the phone to ring.“We have just got to be as active as we can to bring in another left-back.“Max would be my first choice to come back because he was magnicent for us. He was such a good kid to work with, but I think that ship has sailed unfortunately. Max is now trying to get himself into Derby’s team.”Left-back is unlikely to be the only position McInnes will move to strengthen this month.McInnes has admitted he would like to add “one or two” signings in the January window ahead of the second half of a campaign where Aberdeen sit just three points behind Premiership leaders Celtic and Rangers.Following the injury to Bruce Anderson in the - defeat of Livingston the Dons gaffer has admitted he could be forced to move for a striker in the window.Lowe is currently out injured having suffered a groin strain in the - defeat of Hearts. He pulled up in the Pittodrie clash and was taken off and missed games against Celticand Livingston .The injury to Lowe is a yet another blow for Derby boss Lampard, with left-back Scott Malone recently sustaining a groin injury that could rule him out for up to six weeks.Derby have not had much luck with left-backs this season as Scotland cap Craig Forsyth is recovering from knee surgery and is out for the campaign.Swedish international left-back Marcus Olsson has not played since the end of last season due to a knee injury. Olsson couldthis month, but he will need time to build match fitness and sharpness.Calum Macdonald, Derby’s left-back in the under-s, is injured.Right-back Andre Wisdom has played on the left recently.Such is the high regard Lampard holds for Lowe, who started the first two Championship games of this season, he tied him up on a new three-year contract less than  hours before he moved on loan to Aberdeen at the end of the summer window.Lampard hopes Lowe will be available within two weeks.Lampard said: “Max has a small groin injury.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.

And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13713656.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_CP43067514.jpg","title":"ayr united players pose inbetweeners","story":"NewsAyr United players pose as Inbetweeners stars on hilarious Christmas party nightHigh flying Ayr United hit the town with some of their squad bearing a resemblance to the cast of the Inbetweeners.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsAyr playersJames Hilton, Liam Smith, Daniel Harvie and Michael Rose\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheyre flying high in the Scottish Championship.

South Ayrshire ruling councillors in the SNP and Labour rejected a plan to build an underpass at Doonfoot in Ayr. But SNP Councillor Siobhian Brown defied her party to turn against their decision and call it in. In front of a packed council chamber, the Doonfoot politician spoke out against the Leadership Panel vote to install a Toucan crossing instead. She said: “Public safety is at stake here. I urge the  to send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking at the Audit and Governance Panel,she said: “I oppose the amendment on the strongest terms.” A police officer at the meeting backed her up saying the crossing and a mph zone extension would be unsafe. Citing a speeding concern, the police recommended an underpass as well. The Ayrshire Roads Allianceis also in favour of the underground crossing.  ARA head Stewart Turner said: “The best option is the underpass.” During a leadership  meeting last month, Councillor Ian Cochrane put forward an amendment for the crossing and mph extension. It deviated roads department recommendations to get planning consent for the subway this financial year. As a result external funding, which was available for the underpass, would go unused. Tory Councillor Hugh Hunter questioned SNP Councillor Cochrane on why he made the amendment. Councillor Cochrane said he had meant the Toucan crossing to be installed quickly while plans were being made to progress the underpass. The meeting heard how the Leadership Panel minutes did not reflect that. Councillor Hunter said: “The only thing we can do is send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking after the meeting, he added: “There is utter confusion in the Leadership Panel. I was astonished at that. It is a no brainer. What possessed people in a position of leadership to reject advice from the police and the roads department. It beggars belief. They turned down half a million pounds of external funding. There would be no defencesomeone died at that crossing.”  The Panel agreed to send it back to Leadership. Dozens of people donned visitor passes to pack into County Hall for the debate. Keen cyclist Clive Drummond said: “We are pleased that the council have directed the Leadership Panel to reconsider their decision to install a controlled crossing instead of an underpass at Dunure Road, Doonfoot.” He thanked people for firing off  emails to councillors to voice support for the underpass. He also thanked the Ayrshire Roads Alliance, Police Scotland and Councillor Siobhian Brown.

And the health board have been asking young interns with additional support needs, and no training, to deal with the problem. Pictures seen by the Standard show dozens of ‘sharps’ boxes filled with hypodermic needles stacked up in full view of the public at a number of sites.  They also show hundreds of rubbish bags bursting from containers with incontinence pads, fluid bags, and materials soaked in blood and other bodily fluids not securely contained. That’s despite medical waste having to be dealt with under the strictest of safety and hygiene conditions. Now Chief Executive John Burns has been forced to issue reassurances to staff and the public, saying the problem had been “addressed immediately”.The Standard can exclusively reveal the extent of the problem faced by waste management operatives on a daily basis, with unions raising “grave concerns” at their exposure to a number of serious health risks. A dossier of evidence submitted to health bosses from UNISON showed project SEARCH interns had been tasked with dealing with the specialist problem. The project helps those aged  to  with additional needs – including those on the autistic spectrum – gain work experience and placements. In his submissions to senior management, Robert Rae, UNISON regional organiser, said the youngsters had been “primarily placed” to deal with disposal tasks. Mr Rae added: “We are calling upon John Burns to take immediate action to address the serious concerns we have with regards the potential risk to safety and wellbeing of staff and patients within NHS Ayrshire and Arran.  “Our members and the patients they serve should not be exposed to any potential risk of infection or injury due to the shambolic way the current waste crisis throughout the UK has been dealt with in NHS Ayrshire and Arran this past week.” Images show orange and yellow bags marked ‘clinical waste for alternative treatment or incineration’ overflowing from container cages at Crosshouse, Ayr and Ailsa hospitals. Another shows ‘sharps’ boxes piled up on top of an industrial freezer next to staff lockers. Cages containing ‘sharps’ boxes, cytotoxic, and used drug vials with the remnants of drugs, can be seen next to a perimeter fence with high banking, meaning anyone could lean over and access the boxes. Glass drugs vials, blood, incontinence pads, and other medical waste can also be seen on the ground.UNISON have raised concerns with the training, protocols, and risk assessments being applied to the disposal and handling of waste. Their report says that bags are being ‘inappropriately handled, stored and transported,’ citing instances where they have been thrown into cages or onto the ground, where they “cannot possibly only be handled by the neck” – the agreed safe method of handling such medical waste. Complaints to health bosses also show “blood spillages are often left untreated all day, despite being seen by supervisors”. Mr Rae added: “A supervisor was unable to advise of the procedure or cleaning agents used to clean this. “It is also concerning that the supervisor himself, when questioned, was unable to provide information on how spillages should be dealt with. “Staff have not been informed nor advised that they should be changing out of their work clothes which are clearly being exposed to spillages and they are travelling home in this clothing.

In recent months, the town has seen a spike in thefts, with  recorded last month. And residents at Girvan Community Council raised questions over the lack of CCTV along Dalrymple Street. Now council bosses have confirmed that a replacement has been ordered to be installed in the next few weeks due to the current cameras nearing their ‘operational le’. A spokesman said: “Due to intermittent issues with CCTV in Dalrymple Street we recently carried out repairs to make sure our Emergency Response Team can monitor the area  hours a day. “However, given the camera is now nearing the end of its operational le, and to make sure the system is fully fit for purpose, we’ve ordered a replacement which is due to be installed in the next few weeks.

The transformation of an old lodge house on the site in Ayr’s Seafield has joined the existing mansion buildings of Carleton Turrets and Craigweil House. Headmaster Simon Johnston opened the new building, called Craigweil Lodge, last week. He believes it is a signicant step and provides extra classroom space and better single campus. He said: “It provides us with additional accommodation of the highest quality, but it also forges a link between the existing buildings of Carleton Turrets and Craigweil House. “Wellington now has a single, coherent campus and the development potential of this wonderful seafront site has been well and truly unlocked.” The school is working in partnership with architects Austin-Smith: Lord on a long-term masterplan for the campus and this is very close to publication.  The new Lodge contains an additional P classroom and this year the school has three P classes for the first time. It also contains an additional social studies classroom, a staff work room and an attractive new Support for Learning Hub. Equally signicantly pupils will be able to move freely between buildings without having to go out onto the public pavement along Craigweil Road. Jenner Simpson, Board of Governors chairman,has been instrumental in developing the plans for expansion. She said: “We cannot afford to stand still and the board are continually looking at ways to move the school forward. The opening of the Lodge is one step in many that the board are currently working towards and we are looking forward to unveiling the other plans that we have been working on very soon.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"woman admits acting intimidating manner","story":"NewsWoman admits to acting in intimidating mannerThe -year-old shouted, swore and acted in an aggressive and intimidating way towards Shannon Kerr.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  DEC NewsAyr Sherf Court \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA woman has admitted to acting in an intimidating manner.

Irsquom all for what is being proposed but in the interest of fairness we need to go back to the public on this.However, some councillors have spoked out in opposition to introducing any anti-alcohol by-laws at all.In particular, Jedburgh and District councillor Scott Hamilton said the by-laws would contravene personal liberties, and tabled a motion calling for the proposals to be scrapped altogether.He told fellow councillors: ldquoBy agreeing to move these by-laws forward, we will be starting a process which barbarously pushes back our freedoms and personal liberties.ldquoIt is the freedom of choice which has underpinned the very ethos of le in the western world, and we this morning seek to change a liberty.

It strengthens the case, very strongly, for extending the railway to Carlisle, so I am incredibly supportive, as yoursquod expect. I think this helps us grow the Borders on to success.ldquoThe stats sound almost academic and meaningless, but wersquore talking about a development here of hundreds of jobs.ldquoThat is a huge leap for the Borders, especially when these better, higher-paid jobs come in. It gives us a business space of a quality which we donrsquot currently have in the Borders, and it gives us control over a potentially fantastic housing site.ldquoThis is positive and a good news story.Council officers estimate that developing the estate would cost an extra poundm on top of the price of the land but would potentially generate poundm of gross value added for the regionrsquos economy.However, Tweeddale East councillor and opposition leader Stuart Bell claims the estate is valued at much less than the council paid for it.Mr Bell also revealed that Scottish Governmentrsquos district valuation service, a body offering impartial advice on how public money is spent, also told the council the property was not worth what it has paid for it.He told members: ldquoThe Lowood Estate acquisition, which we are undertaking by ourselves, remains a tortured tale.ldquoThe pound.m outlay, plus expenses, plus cost of maintaining the land and assets, plus the cost of borrowing, means wersquoll need to sell it all for over poundm just to break even. ldquoReports we have seen in private say there will also be signicant infrastructure costs to develop the site.ldquoI donrsquot believe this site is worth pound.m when you go into the detail of the terms and conditions of the sale, and that was the opinion of the district valuer, whose assessment with vacant possession, which we will not have, was much lower than pound.m.ldquoEven when adjusted up for a special assumption, the district valuer still valued the land at a price lower than we are paying.ldquoThis is a speculative and risky expenditure of public money at a time when, quite apart from Brexit, there is shuddering uncertainty in markets. ldquoHouse prices and land values can go down as well as up. We should not be spending public money on buying this estate at this time for more than it is worth.ldquoIn what alternative opportunities could we invest poundm ldquoThis council should invest enough in roads to signicantly improve the road condition index, but we cannot afford to do that.ldquoThis council should commit to four new high schools in  years, but you wonrsquot make that commitment.ldquoI will not tell the electors in Peebles, as you will have to, that they cannot have a new high school within  years when you have tied up poundm for  or so years in Tweedbank.ldquoWe canrsquot even cut the grass properly in our cemeteries, but this administration glibly spends poundm on buying a private estate.ldquoThis is a decision I fear you may come to regret.In reply, East Berwickshire councillor Jim Fullarton defended the deal, claiming that pressures on local government spending made such projects necessary, saying: ldquoWersquove had several briefings on this subject, and officers have presented us with an excellent paper on the future benefits of developing this site, especially with the council in control.ldquoNow councillor Bell is scaremongering about service cuts, but this is a smokescreen to keep us away from the real issue at hand, which is the financial pressure being passed down to Scottish local authorities by his SNP colleagues.ldquoScottish local councils are currently expected to continue services while facing continuous cuts.ldquoIt will be very interesting to see what opposition councillors bring to the table for their budget proposals. No doubt there will be some vanity projects.The Tweedbank masterplan, going hand in hand with the Borders Railway blueprint programme, includes earmarking residential and business space on the estate, as well as expanding Tweedbank and rebranding the current industrial estate there as the Borders Innovation Park.The deal agreed with the estatersquos owner, Alexander Hamilton, is for the remaining  acres still in private hands to add to the  acres bought from then owner Constance Hamilton using compulsory powers by the former Roxburgh County Council in the early s to create Tweedbank.The land will now be owned by Lowood Tweedbank, a company set up and owned by the council."},{"url":null,"title":"royal-scots-history-is-on-parade-at-peebles-library","story":"AN historic link between Peebles and what was Britains oldest infantry regiment was further strengthened this week with a presentation at the towns library.The Royal Scots was raised by Royal Warrant in  and subsequently served with distinction for almost four centuries through many campaigns across the globe.The Regiment continued to recruit almost entirely from Edinburgh, the Lothians and Peeblesshire until its amalgamation just over a decade ago.During the First World War the Regiment expanded to  battalions in which over , men served.During the - conflict a total of , Royal Scots made the ultimate sacrice - many from the Borders, including  from Peebles,  from Innerleithen and  from Walkerburn.The Royal Scots served in most of the campaigns of the First World War, from the Western Front to Bulgaria.To mark the close connection with the area the Regiment was awarded the Freedom of Peebles in .As the centenary year of World War I ending draws to a close this month, a presentation was made on Tuesday by representatives of The Royal Scots Association at Peebles Library.Nick Edwardson and Alex Dockar presented a rare three-volume History of the Royal Scotsto head librarian Alison Tait.Mr Edwardson told us: \"The presentation of the volumes acknowledges the contribution made by the county of Peeblesshire to the story of Britainrsquos senior infantry regiment.\"The Regiment was amalgamated in  but its long history of proud service continues today as part of st Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland.The Colours of the Regimentrsquos th Battalion which historically had a particular association with Peebles were laid up in the town in .And they are now displayed outside the entrance to the library in the Chambers Institute.The three-volume History of the Royal Scots will now be available for everyone to read in the library."},{"url":null,"title":"chance-for-parents-to-register-children-for-nursery-places","story":"PARENTS in the Borders are being invited to register their children for a place at nursery.Enrolment week takes place from Monday, January , to Friday, January .

water treatment work in the Borders has proved its number one when it comes to number twos, as it celebrates a green efficiency milestone.Galafoot Waste Water Treatment Plant in Galashiels has become one of Scottish Waterrsquos most self-sufficient energy sites, generating more energy than it uses.Using a technique called Combined Heat and Power , the site generates electricity from sewage sludge, the semi-solid by-product of waste water treatment.On average the Galashiels site generates more than , kWh week of renewable energy - which is enough to power  homes for a year.The site does still have to import a small amount of power to the site when the CHP needs maintained, but the consumption of imported power to the site has dropped by a dramatic two thirds since the CHP was installed three years ago.Only two operators work at the Galashiels site which processes an average  m of sludge every day. The sludge is created as part of the water treatment process at the site ndash which serves a population equivalent of around ,. It also treats sludge from most other parts of the Borders, from Eyemouth in the east to Newcastleton in the west.Brian Reavely, better known as Fudge, has worked as a Site Operator at Galafoot for  years. He says one of his proudest achievements is seeing how the site has transformed the way it operates ndash and ensuring it becomes a green as it can.The -year-old, who lives in the town, said: ldquoTreating waste uses a lot of energy,you think about what we are dealing with and the dferent processes it has to go through you get an idea. Added to that this site operates round the clock every day, so it needs a lot of power.ldquoWe take our environmental responsibility very seriously here, even down to recycling items like cans and bottles and packaging in our kitchens.ldquoAnd one thing we have started doing is working with our neighbouring works to ensure that the sludge dry solids are as high as possible when they arrive at our site -ndash to save on energy use, reduce our carbon footprint and minimise vehicle movements.ldquoThings like this can make a real dference. The imported sludge is mixed with the on-site, indigenous sludge. This feeds the digestor which produces the gaswhich is the fuel for the  kW capacity CHP.ldquoWe are very green-aware here and proud of what has been achieved, so much so I have made signs reminding us of how self-sufficient the site is.ldquoI also thought it would be a good idea to let people in the town and the many people who visit here know about our achievements and it was decided a plaque highlighting how energy efficient we are would be a good way to let people know.Another addition to the site is a collection of items that have been put down toilets which enter the sewer network in the town these include a number of rubber ducks,  teeth, plastic toy figures, tennis balls, a dogrsquos chewy toy and ious sized toy cars.Fudge said: ldquoWhether these things have been put down accidentally or not they can block our drains and do real damage to the network. So we do urge folk to be careful what goes down their toilets and sinks.ldquoBut it is baby wipes which are our biggest headache these days, the number of items put into the sewer is unbelievable.ldquoThey do not break up ndash where do people think they go  They just clog up our machines and causes blockages that can lead to flooding and bursts.ldquoOne of my biggest hopes for the new year is for more people to get the message that they have to be more careful what they put down their loos and sinks, be that baby wipes or sanitary products or fats and oils and grease.More than  of Scottish Waterrsquos water and wastewater treatment works are either self-sufficient or partly sufficient in their power requirements, leading to lower operating costs and a more sustainable business.Galashiels is one of the top five that offset most of the sitersquos use as well as being able to export to the gridndash others include Glencorse Water Treatment Works, near Edinburgh and Loch Turret Water Treatment Works in Perth and Kinross.Simon Parsons, Scottish Waters director of strategic customer service planning, said: ldquoTo keep the cost of our services as low as possible it is essential we develop our approach to energy management and continue to reduce our carbon footprint.ldquoWhere appropriate, like at Galashiels, wersquore exploring opportunities to export energy to the National Grid, showing that itrsquos possible to maximise the economic advantages of Scotland water resources in the spirit of a Hydro Nation and contribute to national renewable energy targets.ldquoScottish Water is committed to continuing to reduce its energy bill and further increase renewable generation ndash and Galashiels is a wonderful example of what can be achieved.Three years ago Borders College in Galashiels became the first organisation in the UK to benefit from a waste water heat recovery system, installed in partnership between Scottish Water Horizons and Shark Energy.It extracts the natural warmth contained in waste water in the sewer and transfers the heat to the clean side of the heating system via a heat exchange mechanism. The recovered heat is then amplied via pumps to generate appropriate temperatures for use in buildings.The heat produced is being sold to Borders College producing savings in energy, costs and carbon emissions. The system now provides around  per cent of the heat needed by the Galashiels campus.Earlier this year Scottish Water achieved a major energy milestone when it was announced the amount of renewable energy the company generates and facilitates is now more than double its electricity consumption. It now generates and hosts  Gigawatt hourper annum of renewable energy - enough to power more than , homes for a year."},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-woman-loses-six-stone-at-slimming-club","story":"A GALASHIELS woman who lost a staggering six dress sizes is encouraging people to join her in dropping the pounds.Jacqui Porteous decided  was her year to lose weight and has so far managed to sht a whopping six stone after signing up to her local Slimming Word class in Galashiels.Jacqui said: ldquoI joined Slimming World after I saw photo of myself that made me realise how overweight I was, as well as how much my health was deteriorating.

We now look forward to the merriment of Hogmanay! These days in between, traditionally known as the Daft Days, are my favourite of Yule time.Yet not so long ago the most popular focus of festivity was neither Christmas nor even Hogmanay, it was Handsel Monday.It fell upon the first Monday after New Year, although there was some dispute as to the exact Monday it should be celebrated, for some measured the date by the old calendar.This was the case for the country folk in East Lothian, or Haddingtonshire as it was then known. So Auld Handsel Monday fell for them on the first Monday after January .It was the country folkrsquos winter holiday because Christmas and Yule festivities had for so long been banned by the Kirk.The word Handsel apparently comes from an old Saxon word which means to give by hand.On Handsel Monday the family gathered together and shared gts and social time, which for much of the th century remained the main winter festival of the rural poor in East Lothian.The East Lothian writer and poet James Lumsden captured the atmosphere of this now forgotten holiday in one of his poems about the day.He tells us the children would wake up all excited, and the merriment would begin as the dawn of this winterrsquos day heralded a special time of conviviality and reunion:ldquoBy screich o morn the bairns are up,\"And loud the auld folk rousin\"What braws are donnd, what sangs are connd,\"What daffin an carousin!\"It was a time when family members made huge efforts tohome and celebrate together. Food had been specially kept for the occasion and those at home awaited the arrival of others who they had perhaps not seen since the previous Handsel Monday.Lumsden says streams of young folk left the towns for their homes in the countryside. Domestic servants, shop assistants, apprentices all set off in the early hours on Handsel Monday ason a pilgrimage, to share in the celebrations:ldquoSune ran we hame wi anxious haste\"For our grand Hansel denner,\"Pork chops and dumplins ndash lord a feast ndash\"A gorge for saunt or sinner!We can picture the scene as daughters and sons ed, greeted by parents and younger siblings, grandparents and old friends. It was a time of gt giving, with family and neighbours sharing treats.But the rich were expected to give too, as it was the tradition that masters and employers would give gts of drink, food and even a financial contribution to the communityrsquos festivities. In fact, the social norms were often overturned on this day, with the landowners serving and working for the poor on this one special day.While it had no religious content, Handsel Monday was in its own way sacred. It was a longed for day off for those who worked hard with little in the way of holidays. It was Christmas Day, Boxing Day and Hogmanay all wrapped into one.And as the day wore into evening, the merriment would build. People made the most of this precious social time together, with stories, dance and song:ldquoSyne sune wi reels, an strathspeys even,\"The wee cot housie dirled,\"As a the blasts o yearth an heaven\"Were gainst its boukie hurled\"Braw lads and lasses lap and skirled.As is always the case with such gatherings, time flew and too soon the day would draw to a close:ldquoBut daffin jigs, an sangs, an tales,\"Sped far too swith the hours on.Sad farewells would have to be made. Mothers and fathers hugged tightly their grown children as they prepared to set off back to their employment. Old and new friends from near and far, who had come to share the day, parted to their duties.They would have to wait another year for the next Handsel Monday gathering. Who knows what fortune and fate would have in store before that time:ldquoFor freends were met whom morrows gales\"Wad waft apart les course on\"Anither year, and maybe neer\"Again while times flood roars on,\"Might they eer meet, or even greet,\"This fickly warls shores on,\"Tho here this day!And yet it was to be Handsel Monday itself whose fate was sealed, as it faded in importance compared to Hogmanay and its traditions of gt giving and family time overtaken by Christmas.It has became part of our Auld Lang Syne, yet its spirit is perhaps now spread over a thankfully longer time of winter festivity.Happy New Year, when it comes.With thanks to Electric Scotland website for the copy of the poem."},{"url":null,"title":"man-caused-disturbance-at-tranent-opticians","story":"Paul Donaghue behaved in a threatening manner and repeatedly shouted and swore at MontgomeryOptometrists on the townrsquos Bridge Street.Donaghue, of Main Street, then began throwing papers around the shop and refused to leave the premises when asked to do so by staff.The -year-old also stole a toy from the Tranent Paper Shop and a quantity of foodfrom a nearby Greggs shop.All the offences took place on November .Donaghue then told police officers his name was James Davidson in an attempt to evade arrest and he was prosecuted for perverting the course of justice.He also pleaded guilty to being in possession of a screwdriver on the same day.Donaghue appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court,where sentence was deferred for reports to next month."},{"url":null,"title":"new-council-houses-planned-for-ormiston","story":"Proposals submitted by East Lothian Council for  new homes in the village will be scrutinised by its planning department.The site, which would be made up of one, two and three-bedroom properties, is off Tynemount Road and forms part of a wider development of the area which includes  new homes by developer Walker Homes.The development would consist of four one-bedroom ground-floor cottages four one-bedroom upper-floor cottages six two-bedroom ground-floor cottages six two-bedroom upper-floor cottages  three-bedroom end-terraced houses five three-bedroom mid-terraced houses one two-bedroom bungalow and one three-bedroom bungalow.A council spokesman said the local authority was investing pound million in new council housing over the next five years.He added: ldquoThis development would provide a mix of dferent house styles, providing high-quality accommodation for families and iniduals, contributing to the outcomes set out in our local housing strategy by increasing the supply of affordable housing.ldquoWhile a small number of the new properties may be made available to a housing trust for rental opportunities, the majority of the new homes built will be offered as council housing.ldquoFollowing a number of applications for market housing on the site this detailed application is for the development of affordable housing on the site.Scott Gillies, chairman of the villagersquos community council, welcomed the potential of council houses being built.He said: ldquoWithout a doubt it is welcome."},{"url":null,"title":"unique-new-features-for-new-elphinstone-playpark","story":"Pupils at Elphinstone Primary School were given a choice of three potential options for a replacement playpark on the villagersquos Buxley Road.A vote was taken, with an option chosen to create a playpark with two features which will be unique to East Lothian.The first of those is made up of three D hexagon structures which have foot and hand-holds and are designed for climbing on.The second is a raised disc which youngsters can run on.The rest of the park is made up of familiar playpark favourites, including swings, a slide, seesaw, flying fox and climbing net.Elphinstone Community Association has been busy working with East Lothian Council on the project for nearly a year.Now they are hopeful the playpark, which it is estimated will cost about pound,, could be in place in the spring.Stuart MacKenzie, chairman of the villagersquos community association, said: ldquoI think it is fantastic.

Like the Ides of March, Britains fate must be sealed on Brexit day in only  weeks time.Will May finally win parliamentary support for her Withdrawal Deal  Will she be ousted in a cabinet coup  Will there be a repeat referendum  Will Britain end up revoking Article   These are the options, broadly speaking. About the only thing that seems pretty certain to me is that there will be no General Election and no ldquoNo Deal Brexit. I simply cannot see parliament or the country accepting the chaos, cost and potential suffering of crashing out of the European Union without any negotiated settlement.True, planes wouldnt fall out of the skies and trade would continue, somehow, but the disruption would create enormous stress. There is a strong possibility of food shortages, and people with medical conditions would suffer needless anxiety over medicine supplies. The fact that the Government is preparing to put the army on the streets and ports testies to the risk of civil disturbance. There would be a hard border in Northern Ireland overnight and a resumption of sectarian tensions. Small firms would go bust and big firms would leave.So, I am confident that MPs and ministers will prevent this happening,necessary by removing Theresa May and forming the equivalent of a wartime coalition. Working back from that the most probable outcomes look like: Revoking Article  or Mays Withdrawal Deal. And, it will be Labour, not Theresa May, the Tory Brexiters or the DUP, who decides which.Brexiters hate the Withdrawal Deal, which they think chains Britain to the EU, and Jeremy Corbyn does too ndash and for rather similar reasons. He thinks the state aid rules would prevent a Labour government nationalising the utility companies, and also believes that a permanent backstop would give Britain ldquono say on any future trade deals. Mays Withdrawal Deal should therefore be defeated by around - votes.Corbyn will then finally table that motion of no confidence in the government which he delayed in December. May will assuredly win that vote, because the last thing Tory MPs and the DUP want is general election, a Corbyn government and an even worse deal. May will now have won confidence votes from her own MPs and from the House of Commons. That will make her immovable ndash at least for the time being.Armed with this she willto Brussels and stage another televised spat with Jean-Claude Juncker. The  will probably have something  up their sleeves . Perhaps Michel Barnier will propose amending the Political Declaration to include a -month limit to the Irish backstop. This was dropped from the final draft of the December communique.The  could also extend the transition period making a commitment that negotiations must be concluded by March . This is already in the Political Declaration, but it could be built into a firm commitment and subject to independent arbitration. The Irish backstop would thus become a last resort and triggered only in the event of a total breakdown of time-limited trade negotiations.This will be the moment of truth for Labour, as Theresa May brings her amended deal back to the Commons in February. The hardline Brexiteers and the DUP will not be persuaded because the legally-binding Irish backstop will still be there in the Withdrawal Agreement. The future will be in Labourrsquos hands. Many pro-Europeans tell me that Corbyn will at this point ldquopivot to a referendum, voting down the Withdrawal Deal a second time, and backing a cross-party amendment for a Peoples Vote.But while he doesnt accept Mays Withdrawal Deal, still less Norway Plus, nor does Corbyn favour remaining in the European Union. Before Christmas, he caused widespread dismay among pro-Europeans by confirming that, evenhe were to win a general election, Labour would still be committed to Britainrsquos departure from the European Union.The Labour leaders instinct will surely be to secure concessions from Theresa May on the future trade negotiations. A closer alignment with the single market and a permanent customs deal, is what he wants. To get her business through, she would surely end up agreeing. Deal done. Britain leaves as planned. Pro-European Labour MPs would rebel, but that would be unlikely to scupper the governments pro-Withdrawal majority.Alternatively,Jeremy Corbyn stands firm and pivots to a referendum, there will be unprecedented turmoil in parliament, not least over what the question should be. Theresa May will stand down and there will be a political vacuum. As the clock ticks down to Brexit day, a new parliamentary party could emerge: the Europe Party, uniting all the pro-Remain MPs, and dedicated to a second referendum. The choice for voters would be Revoking Article  or No Deal. Mayrsquos deal, it seems to me, would be a dead duck by this stage.By Revoking Article  Britain would retain its opt-outs from the euro and its budget rebate and there would be no disruption of trade. It would be asBrexit never happened. Brussels would happily delay Article  for a referendum. However, this referendum would be like an offer voters canrsquot refuse, because MPs in the ldquoRemaniac Coalitionwould have to resign en massethe country opted for No Deal.It would be terrible campaign, exactly three years after the original referendum, with the far right raging about immigration. It would take years, decades for the bad will to subside. But faced with the prospect of a chaotic No DealI suspect voters would back Revoke. There is nothing undemocratic in having a final say. Parliament has failed to find a credible formula for leaving the EU. The only way end this agony and confusion is for Britain to accept that Brexit is just too costly, too dficult, too unpredictable and too all-consuming.

Equally crucial are other issues that have vexed women for decades,not centuries, among them equality of pay, professional respect and opportunity.So far, so reasonable. Yet, when I heard Mary Robinson, former President of Ireland, talking last week about Mothers of Invention, a podcast she has set up that focusses exclusively on womenrsquos efforts to address climate change, my heart did a double skip: one for delight, two for despair. Delight that women are getting involved directly in trying to help reduce our carbon footprint, without a doubt the most urgent of the worldrsquos ails, but despair at Robinsonrsquos smug assumption that ldquoitrsquos women who change behaviour, in the family and the community.Letrsquos put aside for a moment the fact that, as Robinson reveals in her recent book, Climate Justice, her own awareness of environmental calamity dawned on her like a Damascene conversion astonishingly late in the day. What sets my teeth on edge is the sanctimonious way in which women are increasingly frequently being portrayed ndash mostly by other women. Itrsquos asthere is a collective halo that needs constant polishing, lest it lose its lustre. Indeed, it seems you cannot these days be a female in a position of influence or authority without feeling the urge ndash or the pressure ndash to add a stone to the cairn of womenrsquos rights, entitlements and endeavours.Donrsquot misunderstand me. I am an old-style feminist, and decry utterly the unfair, oppressive and sometimes iniquitous treatment of women in our and other societies. Men have an awful lot to answer for, today and in the past. But I get decidedly uneasy at the perceptual ide that appears to be widening between the sexes. Climate change, said Robinson, is ldquoman-made, and she enjoys using the term, even though admitting it embraces men and women. But apart from this deliberate provocation, is she really correct in assuming that women change attitudes more widely than men Maybe it depends on what sort of country yoursquore living in. When I look around the UK, I donrsquot recognise that stark distinction. Plenty of men seem to be trying to bring about green change, ethical enlightenment, societal improvement, better childcare and education, and are working towards this alongside women. Sometimes, for heavenrsquos sake, they are even taking the lead.Meanwhile, children in two-parent families are open to influences from both parents. While women still tend to spend more time with their young, this does not necessarily equate to a more lasting influence on their behaviour or outlook. The other day my husbandrsquos granddaughter rushed to interrupt her mother who was on the phone to announce that Liverpool had just scored a fourth goal against Newcastle ndash whose influence was that We are going through a phase where almost every interview with a woman politician or banker, entrepreneur or artist, includes the obligatory question about #MeToo, in the same way that every American is asked their opinion of Trump. And while it obviously takes women at the top to help bring about change for those lower down the ladder ndash or in the community at large ndash it is surely not a sacred obligation placed upon each of them. To assume that is to be sexist and discriminatory. Itrsquos certainly not an expectation placed upon men.Yet to listen to some womenrsquos outrage, yoursquod think therersquos a contract, signed at birth, that insists women pay especial attention to female issues eventhere are things that interest them more. Florence Nightingale and Elsie Inglis personally helped save hundreds of lives, and their influence rippled down the decades to the benefit of all, women as much as men. Yet their initial impulse was not to improve things for their own kind, but to help wounded soldiers and the sick and dying. In other words, to improve the conditions of humanity as a whole, not one gender or the other.Of course splinter groups and special interest parties can make things change ndash just look at Dr Inglisrsquos formidable all-women hospitals. There is a galvanising power and collective spirit in female solidarity that nobody can deny. So letrsquos hear it for women tackling climate change. And for men too.In these unsettling and perilous times we surely need to remember that we are all just people. Our identity is not primarily male or female, trans, intersex, other, or whatever label fits. We are simply and essentially human, with all the complexities of personality, type, and biases that entails.

I suppose thatrsquos made for more free-expression than last year, which seems only fitting just now given everything thatrsquos going on, and itrsquos been really gratying as dferent drafts have come in, and incredibly emotional as well. It really feels like this is what art should be doing right now.The writers include historian William Dalrymple, who takes an impassioned look at Scotlandrsquos relationship with mainland Europe against the backdrop of the Tron Kirk, brought to le by bespoke projection company Double Take Productions, and featuring a score from composer RJ McConnell.Bulgarian born and Highland-based non-fiction writer Kapka Kassabova will explore the origins of Europe alongside the even more dramatic Scottish Monument on Calton Hill. This will be accompanied by a score by Pippa Murphy, which is inspired by Greek, Mesopotamian and Gaelic female chanting, while images from Susannah Murphy and Cristina Spiteri of Bright Side Studios dissolve into the ether as time moves on.Leith Library is the setting for poet William Letfordrsquos touching reminiscences, with artist James Houston taking a typographical approach to illustrating the story. At Custom House, also in Leith, journalist Chitra Ramaswamyrsquos letter looks back to her childhood, holidays in Spain and le in Scotland with roots as a second-generation immigrant. Daniel Warrenrsquos accompanying film will mix archive footage and animation, and will feature a song by Emma Pollock.Up at the Cowgate, at the Bongo Club, playwright Stef Smith joins forces with composer MJ McCarthy and artist Eleanor Meredith for a moving tale of separation and broken hearts set to McCarthyrsquos ambient score and Meredithrsquos vivid watercolours. Over at the Tech Cube in Summerhall, fiction writer Louise Welsh pares things back to explore the international language of words themselves, with designer Emlyn Firth using typography to illustrate it.With a total of sixteen artists working on Message from the Skies, this multi-media fusion of form and content is itself an illustration of what might happenshared experience is used for the power of good.ldquoThe collaborations were the fun bit of it, says Glass. ldquoI spoke to each of the writers very early on, and started to try and get a feel for how they were thinking, and how they formally might approach things. Listening to that, you start to see and hear things that makes you think about what the end result might be, and to keep the authenticity of that you start to think about people from other artistic disciplines who might sit well within what each writer is doing, and you try and pair them up. People just wouldnrsquot have come into each otherrsquos spheres without this project, and you start to see and hear the words dferently.Glass doesnrsquot mention Brexit by name, but the shadow of the UKrsquos forthcoming departure from Europe looms large over Message from the Skies. Run in partnership between current Edinburghrsquos Hogmanay producers Underbelly, Edinburgh City of Literature and Edinburgh International Book Festival, and enabled by the Scottish Governmentrsquos Festivals Expo fund, the initiative also points up some of the problems which have already arisen regarding bringing artists from abroad to these shores.While the writers werenrsquot asked which way they voted regarding Brexit before they were commissioned, that should become clear from the work itself. There is little in the way of tub-thumping on display, however, with each piece humanised by the deeply personal tone of them all.ldquoDidactic is word thatrsquos been used a lot when wersquove talked about some of the big polarisations that exist when wersquore talking about Europe just now, says Glass. ldquoA lot of those conversations have been about the role of writers and artists in managing those conversations, and whatrsquos happened as wersquove gone along is that itrsquos become okay to make statements that are hard. There may be people who disagree with whatrsquos in a letter, but I think itrsquos still important to be able to make the space to have that conversation.The words written by the six writers taking part in Message from the Skies will live on regardless of what happens next, and can be published in book formdesired. The assorted artworks that bring those words to le have also been created with the same sense of love and care, and given the scale of the event, it is hoped that they too might have another le, crossing borders with their own unique sonic and visual languages as they go.ldquoWouldnrsquot it be brilliantthis could go across the world and other people could see it  Glass muses. ldquoWouldnrsquot it be wonderfulit could travel Message from the Skies, ious venues, Edinburgh, today-January , dusk-pm.www.edinburghshogmanay"},{"url":null,"title":"edinburghs-hogmanay-review-concert-in-the-gardens","story":"Concert in the GardensEdinburghrsquos HogmanayNeil Cooper****The spirit of Glasgow club-night Optimo hung over the capital on a grand scale to see out  with a very hip spring in its step.While Optimo DJs prepared to man the decks alongside Chicago House queen The Black Madonna at Leith Theatre, Edinburghrsquos Hogmanay kick-started official celebrations with a mainstage triple bill headlined by Franz Ferdinand, one of the first of a post-millennium art-pop new wave to infiltrate the mainstream.That happened shortly after the bandrsquos first scheduled Edinburghrsquos Hogmanay appearance was cancelled due to high winds.Fteen years on, the same slot is taken by Free Love, the Glasgow-based duo of Suzi Rodden and Lewis Cook formerly known as Happy Meals.The euphoric storm of hippied techno whipped up by a barefoot Rodden and a beret-clad Cook on an analogue electronic kit flanked by a mini backdrop of psychic signs and symbols suggests biblical weather wouldnrsquot be a problem.Rodden revels in conjuring electronic zaps into the air inbetween singing in French or  breaking out into Lindsay Kemp style dance routines.

Andrea Leadsom, the Commons Leader, is due to tell MPs, probably in her weekly business statement on Thursday, just when the key vote on Mrs Mayrsquos plan will be during the following week.However, there is a deal of uncertainty hanging over the whole issue with much resting on whether or not the desired change to the proposed agreement, that could come in the form of a legally-binding addendum, is forthcoming and will satisfy the concerns, in particular, of Northern Irelandrsquos Democratic Unionists, on whom the PM relies for a Commons majority, as well as the Tory Brexiteers.It is not impossible that Mrs May will make a statement to MPs, informing them of the progress or otherwise, of the talks with the EU.

It is thought other senior Shadow Cabinet members such as Tom Watson and Sir Keir Starmer are supportive of a Peoples Vote should a general election fail to materialise.Speaking about Labourrsquos conference motion Mr Corbyn told reporters the policy was \"sequential\" on a range of issues, explaining: \"The issue of another referendum was, of course, one of the options, but that was very much after the votes have taken place in Parliament.\"We havent yet had a vote and the Government really should be ashamed of itself.\"This vote has been delayed and delayed and delayed.

I urge Jeremy to seize this chance to change the course of history, before itrsquos too late.\"Eloise Todd, head of the pro-EU Best for Britain campaign, said: ldquoLabour members are clear about what they want. Jeremy Corbyn has run on a ticket of party democracy so that party policy will reflect the views of ordinary members more than ever before. Brexit is his chance to deliver on that promise and with a majority of the country now wanting to stay in the EU that leadership is needed more than ever.\"The clock is ticking and Labour must change tack in the New Year by securing a public vote on Brexit and campaigning to reflect what its members and families and communities around the UK want: to stay in the EU and rebuild Britain from within, she added.The poll, carried out by YouGov for the Economic and Social Research Council-funded Party Members Project, also found backing for a second vote among Labour supporters with  per cent of current Labour voters and  per cent of those who backed the party at the  election wanting Mr Corbyn to \"fully support\" a fresh referendum.It also suggested that tens of thousands of Labour members could be prepared to quit the party over the leaderships approach to leaving the EU.Some  per cent of Labour members put the party leaderrsquos failure to back a second referendum down to a belief that he supports Brexit.Some  per cent opposed the stance the party has taken on Brexit and  per cent of those told researchers it has caused them to consider quitting. This proportion would be equivalent to around , members, according to the projects analysis.If there were another referendum - and a three-way question - some  per cent of Labour members said they would back Remain, three per cent said they would leave with Mrs Mays deal and five per cent would support leaving with no deal.Professor Tim Bale from Queen Mary University of London, which was involved in the research, said: \"Our survey of Labours grassroots clearly shows that Corbyns apparent willingness to see the UK leave the EU - a stance he has recently reiterated - is seriously at odds with what the overwhelming majority of Labours members want and it doesnt reflect the views of most Labour voters either.\"He added: \"Labours grassroots clearly hate Brexit and, although many of them still love Corbyn, he might not be able to rely for much longer on their support for him trumping their opposition to leaving the EU.\"As a result, our research is bound to increase the pressure on Labours leader to get off the fence.\""},{"url":null,"title":"review-scottish-chamber-orchestra-usher-hall-edinburgh-four-stars","story":"Scottish Chamber OrchestraUsher Hall, EdinburghKeith Brucefour starsAS some citizens of the capital have been crossly pointing out, the history of celebrations of the turn of the year there goes back a great deal further than the time for which Hogmanay has been so successfully exploited for commercial advantage through tourism.However, it is not so very long since the Usher Hall was dark on New Yearrsquos Day because the cost of opening it then was prohibitive.Today, January the first is altogether less dour, with much of Edinburgh open for business and the SCOrsquos New Year Gala in aid of Marie Curie nurses an established,relatively recent, institution ndash and a programme the chamber orchestra takes out on the road, this year to Dumfries , Ayrand Perth .The distant model is that of the Vienna Phil at the Musikverein, whose annual concert of waltzes, marches and polkas was broadcast to the world a few hours earlier, but the SCO, happily, has more freedom of repertoire before the Strauss-soundtracked sprint to the tape of Tristch-Tratsch Polka, Blue Danube Waltz and the obligatory clap-along encore of the Radetsky March.A very full house, with a goodly number sitting in the top tier, likely included a few less experienced classical music fans, so the lack of a singer this year was perhaps regrettable, but the SCO is a band of soloists and this programme was designed to allow a number of them to show their skill.Most obviously that was leader Stephanie Gonley, stepping front of stage for the virtuoso Ravel gypsy violin showpiece Tzigane, but principal cello Philip Higham had been first in the spotlight with the opening of Weberrsquos Invitation to the Dance, as orchestrated by Hector Berlioz, and clarinettist William Stafford , and first horn Alec Frank-Gemmill were also among those featured.This was a large edition of the SCO, with percussionists, five horns, and eight brass, under the direction of Duncan Ward, a young conductor of hugely erse experience who first stepped in to work with orchestra two years ago, and who drew particularly lyrical playing from the strings here."},{"url":null,"title":"aldi donates over 15k meals to charities","story":"Supermarket chain Aldi spread some festive cheer in the north east on Christmas Eve by donating , meals to ten charities.Aldi paired ten stores with local charities and food banks to make the most of quality unsold fresh food after stores closed on December .Around , meals were donated across the country, including , from Aldi’s stores in Scotland.

who lives in Thurso, has been awarded the British Empire Medal in the New Year honours list in recognition of his services to the community in Caithness. He will be  next month but still visits schools and other groups to give slideshow presentations about his war experiences. Here we reproduce an interview with Don which was published in the Groat in June  to mark the th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Don flew to Normandy twice on D-Day, first dropping paratroops and then a glider with more troops and equipment.Don had been fascinated with aeroplanes since his childhood in Worcestershire. As a young boy he once walked four miles with his family to see a travelling circus which featured a plane of Great War vintage Don could only gaze in wonderment as the flying machine entertained the crowds, and he resolved that one day he would fly an aircraft of his own. It was an ambition that would be fulfilled with the onset of World War Two.Although just  at the time of D-Day, Don had already clocked up numerous operations as a bomber pilot. He had been severely injured in a fighter attack over Germany in  and was declared medically unfit. After being reinstated on appeal, he was retrained as a radio observer.ldquoWe had been in No.  Group Bomber Command, says Don, who moved to Thurso in the s but whose Caithness connection goes back to  when he flew Blenheims out of Wick. ldquoThe whole squadron were suddenly lted out of Bomber Command and put into  Group, airborne support, which was a completely new role because wed never worked with paratroops or the like before.He was now in  Squadron, flying a modied version of the Stirling four-engined heavy bomber: the Mk IV troop-carrier and glider tug. ldquoWe had to do a lot of exercises to get used to that aeroplane and to get used to dropping troops and towing gliders, which obviously was a dferent ball game altogetherhellip It required a lot of dferent techniques.ldquoAnd it was necessary with any airborne group to drop them accurately in as tight a bunch as possible ndash therefore yoursquod got to operate at a low height and also not get them scattered, so timing was important.ldquoThere developed a formation flying technique which was called starboard echelon, so youve got two lines of aircraft flying parallel to one another. We had to practise these on group exercises, and a number of things happened: tow ropes broke, gliders went down in dferent places.ldquoOn one group exercise we were flying along in this starboard echelon formation and there were literally hundreds of us ndash it wasnrsquot just my squadron, it was a number of dferent squadrons ndash and suddenly an aircraft in the port line veered straight across into an aircraft in the starboard line and they both went down in flames. We lost two aircraft and two crews, just like that, on an exercise. Those are the things that stick in the mind.That tragic accident occurred on May , , in one of the last group exercises before D-Day. It was becoming clear that a big operation was imminent, one that would have major repercussions for the course of the war.ldquoObviously we knew something was happening, Don says, ldquobecause we were practising with troops and gliders and whatever. But we werenrsquot aware, of course, until the th of June when we were briefed originally.The invasion was scheduled initially for June  but was postponed for  hours because of the weather. ldquoBefore that we had the indications of the airfield being closed off and we werent allowed to leave ndash we were shut in, the mail was censored.Paratroops of the th Airborne Division had been arriving at Fairford from the middle of May, and glider pilots were gathering there too as the security arrangements became ever tighter. The troops camped out on the airfield and Don remembers: ldquoOne thing that struck me was that most of them were not very big men but the amount of equipment they carried was phenomenal, with kitbags full of gear strapped to their legs. The other thing that struck me as quite remarkable was they were all carrying water bottles full of white rum!Stirling LJ  took off from Fairford at . hours on June  in what was code-named Operation Tonga, with Don as wireless operator air gunner. On board were  fully equipped paratroops and the BBC correspondent Guy Byam.Donrsquos chief recollection of that night flight over the English Channel is the sight of vast numbers of landing craft and other vessels in the assembly area ndash which was known as ldquoPiccadilly Circus ndash as they awaited the signal to head for the beaches.ldquoWe were briefed to drop precisely at a time and place, he explains. ldquoIt was important to get the troops on the ground in a bunch, not scattered. We were only over mid-Channel so we did an orbit ndash that was a bit dicey with so many aircraft about, all flying in one direction, and us crossing the stream. It all went to build up the tension.Finally, at . hours, the troops were released at Ranville, where they were to set up a homing beacon to aid following aircraft and also to assist in holding bridges over the nearby river Orne after the seaborne invasion had begun. Don remembers the red light in the fuselage turning to green on reaching the dropping zone. ldquoThey all had to go together. Naturally some hesitated on the lip of the door ndash but they had all got to go.In the lead-up to the drop, there had been a close encounter between the Stirling and a group of paratroops released by a nearby Dakota. ldquoHe released his troops and they came past us and we flew right through and didnt touch one, says Don.ldquoThere was no flak at all over Normandy but then we had to fly in a northerly direction towards the Pas de Calais after dropping our troops, which was a feint because the Germans expected us to attack the Pas de Calais rather than anywhere . So we flew on a northerly track and we experienced flak around Le Havre and Dieppe, and then when we exited France towards Beachy Head we got some light flak on the coast, but there wasnrsquot a great deal of resistance.It was a dferent matter altogether when Don and his crewmates embarked on their second operation of D-Day, code-named Mallard.This time their Stirling had a Horsa glider in tow, containing more troops bound for the Ranville area along with an armoured jeep, four anti-tank guns and ammunition. Take-off time was . hours and the glider was to be released at ..Don remembers the scene vividly: ldquoThe Channel was still littered with shipping but when we approached the Normandy coast it was a chaotic mass of ships and landing craft and smoke and explosions. It looked like a scene out of a nightmare, really. And, of course, as we went over land and approached the landing zone there was a lot more activity and a lot more flak.ldquoYou couldnt tow a glider above  knots so it was fairly slow. You were low because you didnrsquot want the glider to be shot down before it could get down to land. So obviously a big aircraft like the Stirling, with a ft wingspan or thereabouts, and a Horsa glider behind it, was a good target. In fact, all  of our aircraft were hit by anti-aircraft fire.Indeed one of those planes was shot down and crash-landed into the beachhead. The airmen were uninjured and got away for a while before being picked up by a German patrol.Subsequently the German position where they were held prisoner was captured and the crew ed to base.Reflecting on the chaos and confusion of D-Day, does Don recall feeling scared by what was happening around him  ldquoWell, everybodyrsquos scared ndash I donrsquot care what anyone says, he replies. ldquoIf yoursquore not scared you donrsquot perform, but itrsquos discipline and training that takes you through. You do reach a point of no .ldquoThis is rude, I know, but itrsquos what I call s**t or bust. You go on and do it. Itrsquos a matter of accepting whatrsquos going on and just dealing with it, and doing the job yoursquore supposed to do.ldquoItrsquos not a question of bravery. Irsquom very suspicious when people say, lsquoOh, yoursquore a brave man,rsquo or lsquoYouve got a lot of courage.rsquo You react to circumstances. Itrsquos a question of training and discipline and doing your job, without really recognising the probability of being killed.ldquoAnd I think to some extent the unorm protects you ndash you feel less vulnerable when yoursquove got a unorm on and yoursquore acting in that capacity. Everything happens very quickly.ldquoSo Irsquom very suspicious about lsquobraveryrsquo. I think we react more instinctively based on our training and our own iniduality. I donrsquot think I could have coped with being an infantryman, for instance. I donrsquot know how those chaps did it, because it must have been hell on earth for them.DON can look back on hundreds of hours of operational flying in a distinguished RAF career that included missions for the Special Operations Executive. And yet, despite the passage of years, he has never forgotten the thrill of his first tantalising taste of aviation.ldquoI fell in love with aeroplanes when I was a kid when Alan Cobhamrsquos Flying Circus came to visit our town with an old World War One aeroplane, and it was fascinating, Don says. ldquoHe had a couple of old SEs [fighter aircraft] and you could have a flip round the field for  shillings ndash but of course  shillings was half a manrsquos wage, so we just stood there with our mouths open.ldquoBut the smell of hot engine oil, castor oil and fumes and what-not got into you. I was determined to try to get into it in some way, and of course thatrsquos what I did.He grew up in Kingswinford, Worcestershire, where his father ran a transport yard. Don trained as a motor mechanic after leaving school at the age of  and went on to qualy as a motor vehicle technician in the summer of . He was called up when war broke out in September of that year, having joined the volunteer reserve two years previously.After pilot training he enjoyed rapid promotion in Bomber Command and was an acting squadron leader when, ing from a mission near Hanover in May , his aircraft was attacked from below by an unseen German fighter plane. The bomb aimer, navigator, flight engineer and wireless operator were all killed but Don survived along with his mid-upper and rear gunner. Somehow he managed tohis crippled Stirling to an emergency landing field on the east coast of England despite suffering severe spinal injuries, damage to his left eye, lacerations around his head and a hole in his knee. He still bears the scars.Don spent eight months in hospital and was discharged as medically unfit. However, he refused to accept that his flying career was over and lodged an objection with the air ministry. Eventually his appeal was successful and he was reinstated, being retrained in the new discipline of radio observer.Operations in the aftermath of D-Day included Market Garden in September  ndash ldquoI went to Arnhem five times during that debacle, says Don ndash and he continued in Stirlings until rsquo.He and his first we Lillian were married in  and they had three children: daughter Elaine, now living in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and sons Peter and Robert, who are both ex-Navy. Peter is in Denmark while Robert has a management post at Dounreay.Don ed to the motor trade after the war and became general service manager with a large garage group. He then spent more than  years working in further education, including a spell as head of the engineering department at a college of technology in Salisbury.Lillian died in  after many years of ill-health and in  Don moved to Thurso, coming out of retirement to work for eight years with local firm Ashley Ann. In  he was married for a second time, to Lybster-born Isabel, whose three daughters became part of the family. Isabel died in .Don still keeps in touch with three of his former crewmates from those D-Day operations: Jim Wayman, the rear gunner, who lives in Dorset Eric Winter, flight engineer, in Coventry and Sid Harrison, the mid-upper gunner, who lives in Crewe. However, there was a particularly close and enduring bond between Don and his pilot, New Zealander Frank Cox.ldquoAlthough our families were half a world apart, they sort of grew up together ndash he came over [to this country] and I went to New Zealand, says Don. ldquoIn  his daughter rang me from New Zealand and said Frank was dying of bowel cancer ndash he knew he was terminally ill and he hadnrsquot got long to live. They had asked himthere was anything he really wanted, and hersquod said, lsquoIrsquod love to see my old mate again.rsquo So I went to New Zealand and I was with him when he died.ldquoNow you canrsquot explain relationships like that ndash they exist because of the worth of each one of you to the other in action. Itrsquos what they call camaraderie. Irsquom still in touch with his family.As his thoughtsto the events of  on the Normandy beaches, Don agrees that D-Day was a turning point ndash ldquotherersquos no doubt about that. But he adds: ldquoI regret to say I donrsquot think wersquove learned any lessons. I donrsquot think we should be doing what wersquore doing now [in Iraq].ldquoAs I look back I think first of all how lucky I was and I feel very sad about the people who gave their lives in that struggle. Itrsquos not really appreciated, the sacrices that were made both on the home front and in action.

Sixteen-year old Mark Macadie, brother of Richard, made his first appearance on the bench.Academy started positively and Marc Macgregor twice tested Formartine keeper Kevin Main within the opening  minutes ndash first when he scuffed a shot straight at Main after being set up by a driving run down the right from Davie Allan, and then seeing an edge-of-the-box effort comfortably held.With Wick sitting deep in clear defensive blocks of four and five, the visitors took control after that and passed up several decent opportunities to take the lead.Archie Macphee found himself with a clear look at goal a quarter of an hour in but he somehow poked wide of Sean McCarthyrsquos left-hand post, and Rodger followed that moments later by guiding a shot wide of the same spot.After coming through that tough -minute spell, it was Academy who threatened next when, after a great spin in midfield by Grant MacNab, the ball came through for Macgregor whose shot was blocked by Main.The biggest cheer of the half came when Formartine assistant manager Russell Anderson, unhappy with what he felt was a series of unfair decisions against his team, was given a strict talking to by lineswoman Molly Alexander.Academy made a tactical switch with Craig Gunn and Davie Allan swapping wings and Gordon MacNab moving upfield to partner Macgregor up top. The move failed to pay idends as Wick couldnrsquot trouble the away defence throughout the half, Davie Allan coming closest to goal when he skewed his shot wide after a one-two with Macgregor.Formartine similarly struggled to break down a well-drilled home defence, but they smelled blood when Mackay was given a second yellow card in the last minute after a collision with substitute Scott Ferries.It was another Formartine sub who played a key role in the winner when Liam Burnett skipped past Craig Gunn to the by-line and cut back for the unmarked Rodger, who had the simple task of tapping it home.Wick Academy: McCarthy, M Steven, Farquhar, D Mackay, Manson, Henry, Gunn, Macgregor , D Allan, Gordon MacNab , Grant MacNab .

This is a new permanent  scheme.Councillor Matthew Reiss, Thurso and Northwest Caithness, a former senior police officer with a particular interest in road safety, said: ldquoIf you have a lower speed limit, safety is improved ndash that is a fact.ldquoIf the local residents are happy with it then Irsquom very happy. With many parked cars on the streets there is always a chance of children walking out between them and not being seen. Slower cars will cut the chances of any potential accident.The civic leader, Councillor Willie Mackay, Wick and East Caithness, said research had shown a big reduction in collisions in built-up areas in towns and villages following the introduction of mph zones. They also improved the character of residential areas and the quality of le for residents, he added.Councillor Andrew Sinclair, Wick and East Caithness, admitted to being a bit sceptical when he first heard about the proposal. ldquoIt sounded like change for the sake of change. Whilst I have slightly warmed to the idea, I still have some concerns, he said.Councillor Sinclair thinks the vast majority of vehicles are already driving at around mph through Wick anyway.He wonders how effectively the new speed limits will be implemented with all the current pressures and priorities of the police.The scheme is being rolled out across the region with restrictions implemented for Alness, Dingwall, Invergordon and Tain. Gateway signage, roundels, mph repeater signs and speed indication devices have been introduced in all four Ross-shire towns.Some local residents commenting on social media felt it would be hard to police the speed restriction effectively.Wick man Konrad Szewczyk said: ldquoSuch nannying should be relegated to nurseries and primary schools, not entire settlements.\"A Bridge Street shopkeeper, Kevin Milkins, thought there was \"little use having laws with no-one to enforce them\", referring to a lack of policing.While one local woman who did not wish to be named said: \"They can set whatever speed limits they want but the idiots and young racers will decide their own speed.\"A council spokesperson said thatthe scheme goes through the consultation process with no objections it could be in place by March.Wednesday  Jan  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118636.jpg","title":"New chief is told of local issues","story":"BUDGET cuts and decentralisation were the main topics raised by Caithness people when the new Highland Council chief executive, Donna Manson, visited Wick and Thurso.She met staff, councillors and members of the public as she listened to their concerns and issues.

The issue was highlighted in the Courier of November  and Highland Council made aware of the most recent spate of vandalism in which first-floor windows were broken.A former janitor had confronted boys throwing stones at the windows and had previously alerted police when he saw people walking about on the roof of the former technical department.Speaking about her efforts to make the building safe, Councillor Sinclair said: \"I first asked for this work to be done several months ago but officers in every department are very stretched both for time and money, so I am pleased that the work has finally been completed and thank the people involved, both council and contractor.\"However, she stressed that it was only a \"small step forward\" and that it should \"not take elected members months of asking to have this small amount of work done\".She said: \"The council as a whole needs to consider whether it has become so bureaucratic and centralised that it effectively disempowers its own members. I hope our new chief executive will take radical steps to shake things up and deliver the localism we have been promised.\"She went on to say how she is now considering a motion to the council that commits it to having a better-planned exit strategy for its estates. \"Too many town centres are falling into a state of terrible decline,\" Councillor Sinclair said. \"Often that is to do with market forces and therefore beyond our control, but when its council land contributing to that decline we have a responsibility to address it.\"A council spokesperson said: \"The property was boarded up to try and prevent further vandalism.\"Initially we boarded up all the ground-floor windows and doors on all the buildings.

More information is given on the Scottish Government#s website, here.Publishing the payment schedule, rural economy secretary Fergus Ewing said: “As we approach the commencement of the New Year, I want to provide farmers, crofters and other rural businesses with as much clarity and certainty as possible.“I am therefore confirming that we intend to keep to the proposed CAP payment timetable published in our stabilisation plan, which outlines when farmers and crofters can expect to receive their CAP entitlements.“By doing this, we are offering clarity and certainty over when payments will be made, demonstrating stability in our payment system, while enabling farmers and crofters the opportunity to plan ahead accordingly.”The president of the Scottish farmers union, NFU Scotland, Andrew McCornick said the timetable will be valued by farmers and crofters, particularly following a tough year for agriculture in Scotland.Mr McCornick: “Confirmation that balance payments for Pillar  schemes will start in March, and payments for coupled support and LFASS starting a month later, will allow many businesses to now plan their cash flows on that basis.#Many farmers are extremely reliant on these scheme payments and their timing so the payment calendar will allow farmers and crofters to carefully plan for the year ahead. Any delay in the timetable with an important scheme like LFASS, would merit Scottish Government considering another loan scheme as a contingency, as it has previously.“Successive loan schemes have been invaluable in addressing cash flow concerns but the continued need for loan schemes demonstrates that confidence in the SGRPID system to deliver prompt payments in the future is still an issue. The move from loan schemes to direct payments and other schemes meeting set payment deadlines will build trust within the sector in the post-Brexit era and aid the organisation and planning of farm businesses in uncertain times.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

She called for a second referendum on Scotland’s future, then backed down in the face of popular uncertainty. But to use a dferent cliché, indyref was the dog that didn’t bark in .Sturgeon can’t be blamed for the UK Government’s failure to settle the outcome of Brexit in time for the SNP leader to offer clarity on a second Scottish independence referendum – but that won’t hold for long in . She will eventually have to show her hand.When that moment comes, it will offer her the opportunity to deliver some home truths to her own supporters: that there isn’t time or means to keep Scotland in the EUthe UK leaves, and that true shape of the relationship between Brussels and London may not be known until close to the next Scottish election in .The Government in Edinburgh insists it has a mandate for a new independence referendum from this Scottish Parliament. Butthe Sturgeon believes the public will back leaving the UK over the final Brexit deal, why wouldn’t she put that to the public in  and prove it Another hold-up might not be the message independence activists want to hear, but it may be the only way to convince the majority of Scots that the question needs to be asked again.The UK Government: Get back to delivering the milkIt’s been a busy two-and-a-half years for the Blitz spirit, invoked at every opportunity by Brexit campaigners. It should mean automatic disqualication from public debate to suggest that the privations of wartime Britain are something to aspire to for the future, rather than a lesson from the past.Nonetheless, helped along by a handful of recent blockbuster Hollywood depictions, Winston Churchill has been repeatedly dragged into debate on Brexit by both sides either in support of the myth that Britain has always ‘stood alone’ in Europe, or that European unity was a Churchillian idea. In our present situation, I personally find the most useful quote attributed to Churchill his reflection that: “Democracy means when there’s a knock at the door at am, it’s probably the milkman.”The comment is obviously referring to examples of brutal oppression by the undemocratic governments of his time, but it also reflects the truth that democracy, when it s, is in part the triumph of small freedoms and practicalities over the big, dangerous idea.Events have moved at such a pace that it’s been impossible to stop and ask where we are. But however you feel about Brexit, it’s clear that a government of a wealthy country forced to nationalise shipping capacity to guarantee supplies of food and medicine, not because of a natural disaster but a political event taking place in just three months’ time, isn’t a responsible government, but one that has already failed.It serves the interests of a narrow and extreme segment of opinion to raise the stakes and turn every issue facing the West into a test of national virility. It allows representative democracies to be hijacked by debates about honouring ‘national sovereignty’ and ‘the will of the people’, asthose weren’t deeply conflicted and debatable concepts.Churchill should be invoked not just to remind us of our finest hour, but of just how banal democracy is supposed to be, when it works well.EU leaders: Tackle anti-immigration agenda head-onEurope has challenges beyond Brexit to face in , and the continent will have to find its way without the certainty of Angela Merkel’s leadership.She offered the strongest, most consistent defence of European values in response to the wave of refugees from conflicts across the Middle East and Africa. Someone  will need to step into her shoes and ensure the anti-immigration narrative doesn’t metastasise into a yellow-vested popular movement that could disrupt upcoming national and EU Parliament elections.US Democrats: Remember who your enemy isIt seems crazy that, with the US Presidential election still almost two years away,  will be decisive in whittling down the field of candidates seeking to oust Donald Trump from the White House.The Democrats would do well to ensure that the process doesn’t turn into a bloodletting. The signs aren’t good, with backers of  left-wing challenger Bernie Sanders and  breakthrough candidate Beto O’Rourke tearing chunks out of each other on social media.Yes, the party needs to refresh its identity to try win back the voters that helped deliver Trump the presidency.But Democrats also need their whole coalition to back the candidate they eventually settle on – something they didn’t achieve in .So much of the political narrative across the West relies on the outcome of the  presidential election. Perhaps more than in any US vote in history, the eyes of the world will be on the Democratic Party. They need to get it right.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4850831.1546358824!/image/image.jpg","title":"rail fare rise paying more for poor service leader comment","story":"Rail fares have soared in recent years and commuters may respond by taking to the roads, causing increased congestion and air pollution.There is something rather romantic about travelling by train. So much so that VisitScotland promotes “Scotland’s Great Rail Journeys” through some of this country’s most stunning scenery such as the West Highland Line from Glasgow to Mallaig and the trip from Inverness to Kyle of Lochalsh. This is rail transport at its finest, travel for its own sake, for enjoyment.But the ordinary experience of many Scottish commuters attempting to travel on more workaday routes is anything but joyful.Instead, delays and cancellations have become all-too-common – with ScotRail’s current problems recently branded “unacceptable” by Transport Secretary Michael Matheson in the Scottish Parliament. Those failings can have signicant knock-on effects on iniduals and the wider Scottish economy. Indeed, one Edinburgh shop boss last month went so far as to say he would never again employ someone who relied on trains to get to work because of the delays experienced by a key member of staff. That may have been an over-reaction, but the frustrations of those concerned are understandable to most people.: Alastair Dalton: How to find hidden cheaper rail faresAnd so it was hardly surprising when there was a chorus of outrage over the latest ticket price rises. ScotRail’s fares were due to go up today by an average of . per cent, while London North Eastern Railway’s fares were to increase by . per cent. Across the whole of the UK, the average rise is . per cent.An analysis of more than  routes by Labour found the average annual season ticket cost £,, up £ from , and that fares had risen nearly three times faster than wages.With UK rail travel already among the most expensive in Europe, commuters can be forgiven for complaining, particularly when the service is not up to scratch. Apart from delays, finding a seat on the most popular rush-hour journeys is often a struggle.The problem for those who travel by other means is that rail travellers may do more than complain, they could decide to switch to the roads, leading to increased congestion, air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.The railways are a vital part of this country’s transport infrastructure, playing a key role in the economy. Trains need to run on time except in the most exceptional circumstances.

Now senior party figures want her to make the same call on tuition fees, the Tory source said.“Ahead of the last election, we made the announcement on free prescriptions,” the source said. “The other big policy is tuition fees.“When voters decide on a change of government, it hasn’t been because the winners have offered total, radical change, but because they’ve represented a degree of continuity like Tony Blair in .”The source added: “There’s the issue of unfairness, with many young people not able to get a university place because of free tuition. People are waking up to that, but it doesn’t look like a decisive sht will happen by .”The SNP’s defining policy of not charging tuition fees for undergraduate courses remains popular. A poll ahead of the  Holyrood election found voters gave it a rating of . out of ten, behind only pledging to increase funding for the NHS.However, critics say it has failed to improve access to higher education for all. The participation rate on degree-level courses for -year-olds from the most deprived areas was twice as high in England in  as it was in Scotland.And opponents claim there is growing evidence that a cap on university places for Scottish and EU students means pupils with top marks are being unfairly shut out.Figures for  show , Scots failed to get a place at a Scottish university, equivalent to three in ten applicants. The figure is  per cent higher than when tuition fees were abolished.Responding to the figures yesterday, Tory education spokeswoman Liz Smith said: “The fundamental problem of the SNP’s free tuition remains the fact that there is discrimination within the system and an unfair capping system, which means that a ­signicant number of extremely well-qualied, Scots-domiciled students are unable to get a place.”Brexit could allow future Scottish Governments to end free tuition for the more than , EU students accepted at Scottish universities each year, easing that pressure.A policy review is being carried out by Tory MSP Donald Cameron to prepare a manesto for  that can put Ms Davidson into Bute House. However, the source told The Scotsman that university tuition policy was unlikely to change while Ms Smith remains in place, as she is considered a strong supporter of the principle of fees.An SNP spokesman said: “Just like on prescription charges, the Tories have railed against SNP policy for years, but now seem to be realising that their plan to whack a price tag on education is deeply unpopular.“The SNP scrapped tuition fees – in contrast with the Tories’ record in England where young people face tuition fees of £, a year.”A Scottish Conservative spokesman said: “As with every party, we are undertaking a policy review and we will set out our proposals in the run-up to the  Holyrood election.”©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland.

Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27509  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinI remain optimistic because Ireland is changing. I believe that we have the policies and plans to tackle the housing and health care crises. The debate on Irish unity is under way, and we will have elections and the opportunity for people to have their say. The choice is simple, continue with the failing policies of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil or plot a new course for a new and united Ireland. was a milestone in a changing Ireland. It was given voice in the Repeal referendum. In Belfast the largest political demonstration was Pride. For this generation the border is an anachronism. When the Repeal result was read out a sign was held aloft, ‘The North is next’. Rights transcend borders and so does this generation. will mark the centenary of the First Dáil. A people’s parliament for a revolutionary generation. The coming year is an opportunity to rebuild that culture of change and a parliament that serves the people and not vested interests. Sinn Féin will stand with the people on the streets and stand up for them in the Dáil because the housing and health crises can and must be ended.The policies of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael created and sustained the health and housing crises. As waiting lists grow and the number of patients on trollies hit record highs, the Taoiseach points the finger of blame at doctors and nurses who take Christmas leave. His response to rising evictions and homelessness is to defend the Vulture Funds and give tax breaks to landlords.The Taoiseach and Fine Gael are supported in all of this by Mícheál Martin and the supply and confidence trick.Regardless of what choice the British government makes on Brexit, it cannot be allowed to damage Irish interests, our economy, our agreements or the rights of citizens. This is one issue that unites the majority of parties North and South. We will continue to stand up in the interest of all Ireland. Early in January I will travel to Brussels to continue our engagements with European leaders.An Executive in the North should be in place delivering for all in the community, growing the economy, standing up to destructive Tory policies, and representing the majority view on Brexit. Instead we have witnessed daily at an inquiry the corruption of governance that led to the RHI scandal.No government could sustain the abuse of power and intolerance displayed by the DUP. All the while the Irish and British governments looked on and refused to act. It is a disgrace that the institutions of the north are not up and running.We had a deal with the DUP leadership that would have reinstated the Institutions. The DUP walked away. The two governments promised a new talks process. Ten months on there has been no talks and no process. There has been nothing constructive from the two governments. That is not good enough.Every day that the Executive is suspended undermines the political institutions. Every refusal to recognise rights undermines the political process. The threat to impose Brexit undermines the democratic process.The DUP know that their deal with the Tories will end. They also know that the refusal of rights is not compatible with equality and power-sharing government. They should also know that there is no good or positive Brexit for the north.Sinn Féin is ready for talks, to establish a new Executive working in genuine power-sharing, and operating to the highest standards of governance. A new Executive must include new ways of working, be inclusive of all parties and respect the rights of all the people.The DUP knows what needs to be done. Theresa May knows what needs to be done. It will require leadership that has been absent to date.The two governments have indulged the DUP at the cost of the political process. The two governments know what must be done to form a new Executive in the north. The current do-nothing approach is running out of road.The majority of parties share a common approach to Brexit and to the rights of citizens, and are committed to working together to build a new Executive.The two governments must convene talks and make clear the agreements and rights of citizens will be at the core of a new Executive.The Irish Government cannot look on as spectators. They cannot stand idly by while the DUP and British government shred the agreements. The agreements are the people’s agreements. The people voted for them. The Taoiseach said that the people of the north will not be left behind again. The government must plan for a successful talks process and also have a backup plan.They must also begin preparations for Irish Unity. There is no contradiction in seeking the establishment of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and fulfilling its promise of a unity referendum. The time is right to hold an informed and respectful conversation and referendum on our shared long term future as a united people and a united Ireland. No government should try and stle that debate or call for it to be suspended.I remain optimistic because Ireland is changing. I believe that we have the policies and plans to tackle the housing and health care crises. The debate on Irish unity is under way, and we will have elections and the opportunity for people to have their say. The choice is simple, continue with the failing policies of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil or plot a new course for a new and united Ireland.I look forward to the new year and the continued challenges and opportunities of a changing Ireland.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8745500.1545401332!/image/image.jpg","title":"galgorm resort and spa evacuated","story":"Galgorm Resort and Spa has ed to business as usual after an evacuation earlier this afternoon.The hotel was evactuated as a precaution following a small electrical fire, which had been dealt with by staff by the time the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service had arrived at the scene, a fire service spokesperson said.Galgorm Resort and Spa.Victoria Brown, marketing manager at Galgorm Resort and Spa, said: “As a precautionary measure we evactuated the resort this afternoon following an incident whereby smoke was seen coming from a ceiling .

He had made arrangements with Antrim Borough Council to have their carriage kitted out with flowers and champagne, only for his plans to be put on ice due to the weather.Not one to hang around, he put together a back-up plan to ask Leanne for her hand in marriage at the Templeton Hotel in Templepatrick.Leanne, , said: “We’re five years together, we’ve one child at four and another on the way. Romance is sort of put to the side. I hadn’t a clue this was coming. Leannes four-year-old daughter Quinn was there to witness the romantic moment on Sunday“We had our gym party on Saturday night. The idea was to go up the big wheel first then go to the party and be able to tell everyone, celebrate with them and show them the ring.“Because of the weather warning, rather than wait, he went for plan B.”At the Templeton they were taken to a reserved table decorated with crystals where staff brought out drinks and a plate with ‘Marry Me ’ written on it in chocolate.Leanne said: “Then he got down on one knee and gave me the ring. It was really romantic. I was crying my eyes out. Then he told me what I could have won.”She added: “At least we got a second go at it.

Last winter’s figures for NI will be released on Wednesday.The comments from Age NI come three weeks after the Department of Healthannounced a ‘review of urgent and emergency care’ with a particular focus on the elderly in light of emergency departments experiencing “intensying pressures over recent years”. DoH acknowledged growing waiting times for hospital admissions and that “another dficult winter period” is anticipated.Age NI welcomed the review – but expressed concern about the timing. “It is good news but it seems late in the day to start this processwe want to see any benefits this winter,” a spokeswoman said. ldquoit seems late in the day ,,, this process should have started months agoAge NI“We all know that our healthcare system, particularly our hospitals, come under extreme pressure during these winter months and this process should have started months ago.” She noted the “added impact” a long wait in AE can have on the elderly and pressed for “safe and effective” alternatives that will be “just as beneficial or more so than an admission to hospital”.Rita Devlin, deputy director of the RCN in NI, said nurses are worried. “Our members are fearful that there will be a repeat of the problems experienced last year in emergency departments over the holiday period,” she said. “Staff would hope that trusts will have contingency plans in place to ensure that services will be maintained at normal levels.”Dr Grainne Doran, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners NI, said GPs have “serious concerns about the increase in workload that will come this winter”. She added: “With services already struggling, doctors have voiced their concern about being able to manage with the additional workload during the winter season. “A review of emergency and urgent care, and the implementation of necessary changes, cannot come quickly enough.” of Donaghys, Banbridge presents a cheque for the money raised at the recent Ladies Night held in aid of Ellens Journey.

While each trust will have a winter contingency plan, he said, staff face “additional workload and work-related stress” during the winter period which may see “the whole system begin to wobble”.Properly funded home care packages for discharged patients are needed, he said, along with “meaningful long-term workforce planning” to have enough doctors in place to meet the needs.Last winter saw Antrim Area Hospital call in St John Ambulance volunteers for basic ward cover on New Year’s Eve, while SDLP MLA Dolores Kelly said  people waited at Craigavon Area Hospital over two nights for assessment on January  and .In the first week of January, staff reported that Belfast’s Royal Victoria Hospital was “at breaking point” and a ‘major incident’ was declared because of the excessive backlog of patients.Londonderry’s Altnagelvin Hospital had to implement an emergency plan for its emergency department, and on Boxing Day the Southern Health Trust said patients were having to wait for up to  hours to speak to an out-of-hours GP.From December  to January  last year, some  NI patients waited more than  hours for admission, transfer or discharge, the BBC reported.However, the Department of Health said that its newly launched review of emergency care is not intended to address problems this winter.A spokeswoman said: “The review of urgent and emergency care is a long-term project and should not be conflated with initiatives to counter winter pressures in hospitals this year.”The review will aim to establish a new regional care model for the Province, with particular focus on the elderly, she said. “A range of measures have been put in place by trusts for this winter in expectation of another challenging period for health services across these islands.”The department has funded these initiatives, recognising the need for immediate mitigations and longer term review, she added.Age NI advises that by taking some simple steps, older people can stay warm, well and safe in the winter months-. By setting your heating to the right temperature , you can keep your home warm and your bills as low as possible.. Food is a vital source of energy, which helps to keep your body warm. Keep basic food items in the cupboard or freezer, and try to have hot meals and drinks throughout the day.. Try to avoid going outside on extremely cold days. If you do need to, wrap up warm and remember that several thin layers will keep you warmer than one thick layer.. Keeping active generates heat and helps to keep you warm, so when you’re indoors, try not to sit still for more than an hour. Get up and walk around, make yourself a warm drink, and spread any chores throughout the day.. If you’re over , be sure to have a seasonal flu jab. Seasonal flu viruses are always changing, so you need to have a jab every year, using the latest vaccine.. It’s not unusual to feel a bit down in winter. Try to keep to your usual routines and,you can’t visit friends, make sure you phone them regularly for a chat.. Call Age NI’s Advice Service on    for a free benefits check.

offer in case of emergency card","story":"Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Policing and Community Safety Partnership , in partnership with local police is launching a new community safety initiative, in case of emergency card , to make sure people get the best treatment at a time when they need it most.Indicating who should be contacted in the event of an accident or emergency, the ICE Card also provides your medical information including any conditions or allergies you may have, medication you are taking and your blood type.An emergency can strike anywhere - you might be far from home, family or friends - and carrying the ICE Card means that your loved ones can be reached quickly and avoids the problem of unlocking mobile for emergency details.Stressing the importance of carrying an ICE Card, Chair of ABC PCSP, Councillor Joe Nelson commented: “This is a very simple yet effective initiative. Schoolchildren, cyclists, runners, older people and people with acute medical conditions immediately spring to mind, but in fact I think everyone should carry an ICE Card. People don’t think twice about wearing a seatbelt or cycling helmet, butyou had a serious accident you’d like your next of kin to know as soon as possible and you’d want the best care possible in a medical emergency. Almost everyone carries a wallet or purse with them so this is the ideal place to keep an ICE Card”.Chief Inspector Barney O’Connor commented: “PSNI is fully supportive of this initiative which is straightforward, practical and user-friendly and provides families reassurance that a loved one has personal information accessible in all emergency situations. Ideal for use whether you are a student studying away from home, an older person or someone with a medical condition.”The ICE Card ensures all the essential information is accessible in one place meaning it could help save lives, provide the best help and care, as well as make sure your next of kin can be contacted promptly.Information about medications and allergies helps ambulance personnel make better decisions about treatments they can give you and crucially in the case of heavy blood loss, it is important for emergency staff to know your blood type. In the case of people with conditions such asAlzheimer’s it can help a person who may be confused contact their family and avoid any unnecessary distress.The cards are initially being rolled out at PCSP and PSNI engagement events and through groups. For more information on how to get an ICE Card please contact PCSP Project Officer, Billy Stewart on    or by emailing william.stewart@armaghbanbridgecraigavon.gov.uk.\"  \"  Police warn Northern

In a move that’s sure to be viewed with envy by congregations all over the city, Clonard has upholstered its wooden seats just in time for the festive season. On Friday night the church welcomed guests to its sold-out Candlelight Christmas at Clonard event, which featured the St Dominic’s Grammar School for Girls’ Choir, baritone Karl McGuckin and West End star Niamh Perry. Clonard church manager Tom Brady said even at this early stage it’s clear the cushioned seats are a welcome addition at the church. “This is a way of providing comfort for the congregation, it’s a way of giving back to them and as a way of thanking them for all their support and generosity shown to the church,” he said. “Both our concert and carol service over the weekend were packed to capacity and with our annual Féile concerts people can rest assured that the seats will be cushioned for years to come. Clonard attracts people from all over and we are really looking forward to welcoming everyone who comes for their Christmas Masses. We have three vigils on Christmas Eve, one at pm, pm and .pm. “We would also like to thank all those who donated so generously to our Christmas crib during the carol service and hampers are now being prepared and distributed by the St Vincent de Paul Society.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"local schoolboy pulls toddler from pond","story":"A YOUNG boy from the Cltonville area has been hailed a “hero” after pulling a toddler from the Waterworks lower pond.-year-old Neil Francis Montgomery from Brookhill Avenue was walking through the park with his friends on Sunday when a toddler slipped into the duck pond.While other passers by looked on in shock, the Edmund Rice College boy leapt into action, jumping into the freezing water to pull the child out. Speaking to the North Belfast News, Neil Francis said: “Me and my friends were walking out of the playground and this baby walked down towards the pond. We saw a woman pointing towards the baby and he slipped into the water face first. “All the other people started panicking and they all ran over and people were screaming. I got on my stomach and tried to reach in to get him, but I couldn’t reach so I just jumped in lted him under the armpits and lted him out.“A woman took the baby and cleaned him and dried him. I was scared, but nobody  seemed to be doing anything so I just jumped in. I was worried that it might be a bit deep, but I was more worried about the baby. I’m just really happy that the baby wasn’t hurt.”Neil Francis has been recognised as hero at his school assembly, and was gted a superman t-shirt by his religion teacher Mr Wylie. Paul Berne, acting Principal at Edmund Rice College, said: “We’re delighted that these kids are able to do what they’re doing. It’s the second time our pupils have saved someone’s le in a month. We’re very, very proud of them. They are top class role models for the school. About a month ago a sixth year helped someone in a hit-and-run and now we have this.It’s great that young people that age are able to do that – it’s incredible.

And the contrast with the spanking new facilities of its Catholic grammar school neighbour, Aquinas College, has raised questions about the priorities of education chiefs.Principal Michele McCormick says the school’s results, particularly in Maths and English, are the best in Belfast in the non-selective sector. In , the school also won the Aisling Award for ‘Oustanding Achievement in Education’. “St Joseph’s has a warm, welcoming ethos and they pride themselves on the care and compassion the staff have for pupils and their determination and passion to achieve the best possible success for every child,” added the Lord Mayor.#St Joseph’s College is delivering a first-class, st century education to our young people. It’s time, therefore, that it was given the st century resources it needs to fully realise its mission.”A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “The Department does not maintain a prioritised list of schools in need of a new school build. When a major capital announcement is being planned, the education managing authorities are asked to providea list of schools that they consider most in need of a new build at that time. “Due to the many demands on the Department’s capital budget, when a call for proposals is made, all projects submitted by the Managing Authority are assessed under the Department’s protocol “Any school not announced must be selected through the formal ‘call for projects’ processit is to become eligible for a new build. Given the medium term budget uncertainty and the absence of a Minister, there are currently no plans for a further major capital investment announcement.”"},{"url":null,"title":"meet the brexitbashing twitter account followed by leo varadkar","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Concerns have also been raised about the investigation of the scene, which allowed politicians and media to walk through the building just days after the fire.The families of victims petitioned the Attorney General last month for a new inquest into the tragedy.“The Government has a lot to answer for,” Mrs McHugh said.“We were told nothing about the fire even in the days after.”The couple said in the aftermath of the fire they came home one evening to find the Taoiseach Charlie Haughey in their living room, offering his sympathies, before family asked him to leave.“We were told what funeral home to use and graveyard to bury Caroline in,” Mrs McHugh added.“She’s buried in Sutton, it’s not near where we live, I don’t know why, we never got a choice.“We were grieving so much, we just did what we were told.“We don’t even know where inside Caroline was found, or what happened to her.”The couple, now , say they have close relations and have watched nieces and nephews grow up without Caroline.“You never get over it… it’s the anniversary on Valentine’s Day, then her birthday, then our birthdays, it never stops,” Mr McHugh said.“Unfortunately we never had any other children, so we missed out on a lot really,” Mrs McHugh added.“She was a very good girl, a good child, we never had any trouble with her, what more can we say  We didn’t have her that long, just  years.”"},{"url":null,"title":"berlin wall sections to be auctioned 30 years","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Editors Viewpoint: State papers show leaders saw a bigger picture The diplomat said many MPs who did not take an active interest in Irish affairs became \"puffed with outrage and conviction\" about doing something in response to the killings.He said suggestions ranged from demands for a tougher and revised policy of policing funerals to a demand for internment throughout Ireland and, in \"more cases than previously\", to a demand to setting a date for withdrawal from Ireland \"in order to let the Irish get on with butchering each other\". State papers: Clintons invite to Adams provoked furious response from PM Majors private secretary Mr Ryan also said people across Britain wrote to their MPs demanding greater action against terrorists.The two plain-clothed British soldiers inadvertently drove into the path of the funeral before mourners pulled them from the car and were beaten before being shot dead by members of the IRA.The murders happened days after the funerals of the three IRA members who were shot dead by the SAS in Gibraltar. State papers: Taoiseach backs Garda in face of Iron Lady Margaret Thatchers disdain Mr Ryan said after meeting backbenchers at Westminster, he was struck by their exasperation and anger \"without any proper sense of how to ventilate it\" while there was a resurgence of \"frustrated patience\" with Ireland.\"The complexity of the issues elude their instinctual approach to policy questions, that of self-interested pragmatism and this further fuels their primary response to events such as last Saturdays,\" he added. State papers: Thatcher warned Haughey of worst civil war everUK allowed Irish unity \"It has to be said that no amount of violence toward the UDR, the RUC and Northern Irish or Irish civilians of any religious persuasion could come anywhere near provoking the same reaction in Britain to Saturdays killings - and the sort of killings they were - of their own English soldiers.\"He later said there was a risk the Anglo-Irish relationship and the Agreement may be \"caught in the net\" when MPs look for the reasons behind the murders.Days after the killings, the Secretary of State Tom King, made a speech to the House of Commons in which he described the \"horric events\" that shocked the world. State papers: Thatcher asked to make gesture of clemency in Guildford Four case  In a separate memo from Mr Ryan following a meeting with Conservative MP Edward Leigh, he said the Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was left \"very distressed and very angry\" by the soldiers murders.Mr Leigh indicated that MPs held special meetings to call for support for \"much tougher and direct action\" by the SAS and other special units against terrorists.\"He stressed several times that he was not exaggerating the mood generally\", Mr Ryan wrote.Mr King told Mr Leigh during a meeting they had reason to believe the IRA was \"planning a serious offensive\", however he did not elaborate further than this."},{"url":null,"title":"7 people who already broke their new year resolutions by","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The bumper pre-match lunch crowd were less than keen to brave the elements, but a few hardy souls cheered the team on.Johnny McPhillips was released by Ulster late on Friday night and he started the match with Ryan Wilson ping to the bench. Ulster flyer Iwan Hughes also made his debut on the wing and Peter Nelson continued at full back.Kyle McCall ed at loose head, but his brother Zac was ruled out with Clayton Milligan taking his place at hooker. Malone looked strong with Ross Kane, Joe Dunleavey, Peter Cooper, Adam McBurney and Matthew Dalton all released by Ulster to bolster their forward pack.The wind was blowing across the pitch and this did not really favour either side. However, it did make things even more dficult as the rain was relentless and conditions underfoot were fairly treacherous.No one expected a classic and Ballynahinch had a little more composure in the key moments to secure a vital win. Local knowledge certainly helped with Nelson providing a masterclass in tactical kicking throughout, using his big left boot to keep his forwards on the front foot and dig his team out of trouble.Two McPhillips penalties and a typical Ross Adair finish following a Kyle McCall break had Ballynahinch - up at the break and they were well worth their lead.Malone turned the screw in the second half and when they scored a penalty try following a collapsed scrum under the lsquoHinch posts to close the gap to - with around  minutes the game could have slipped away from the home side, especially as McCall was sin-binned at the same time.However, the  man defence held out, and with the outstanding John Donnan laying waste to the Malone line out, the locals held out in relative comfort for another tight derby win.The next AIL fixture is away at Malone for the next instalment of the double-header on January .Ballynahinch will hope to have some players back from injury as the season reaches a crucial stage.The Ulster derbies look likely to decide the shape of the table and lsquoHinch will be away from home for three out of four in the second half of the season.Brian McLaughlin and his coaching staff will be plotting over the break to gain any advantage in the race for promotion.Ballynahinch Malone AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£250k Lottery Funding boost to restore Castlewellan park  ","story":"MAJOR plans to restore Castlewellan Forest Park to its former glory as part of a signicant investment programme have received a major pre-Christmas boost.The Heritage Lottery Fund confirmed yesterday that it is to provide almost pound, to help with ambitious redevelopment proposals which are being spearheaded by Newry, Mourne and Down Council in conjunction with the Forest Service.Fund officials had made it clear that the application process was very competitive, with council officials delighted they had made a persuasive argument to secure the cash they require.The local authority is also in the process of making a separate pound, bid to the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs to assist with the work at the forest park. The closing date for applications is the end of next month.Since the s, the forest park was the demesne of the Annesley family, a long line of passionate gardeners who created a beautul landscape and a nationally and internationally important  hectare arboretum.The pound, Heritage Lottery Fundgrant will be used to help fund the development phase of the project, which will work to achieve a vision for Castlewellan Historic Demesne to create a heritage-led destination to connect people with their built and natural heritage.The development phase includes surveys of the woody plants in the arboretum and bioersity of the park, alongside design work to repair and develop the buildings in The Grange and walled garden. Work is also required to carry out further consultations and submit planning applications.Council chairman Mark Murnin, thanked the HLF for its financial support for the exciting project.ldquoThe park is such a vital part of the local community, he said. I am delighted that this funding gives us the potential for its restoration and that future generations will also be able to enjoy the facility and engage with its heritage, he added.The local authority is keen to see the picturesque forest parkrsquos Arboretum, Annesley Garden and Grange Buildings redeveloped to help increase the number of visitors and provide the area with an economic boost.A recent economic appraisal recommended the development of what is being described as a welcome centre in the Walled Garden area designed to provide access via lt to its upper floor, with the local council keen to play a leading role, alongside the Forest Service, to help transform the parkrsquos fortunes and make it even more popular.Politicians were told last week that architects have been awarded the tender for works in the Walled Garden and Bothy Yard and Rhododendron Wood areas, with work underway on planning and statutory approvals for works in the Walled Garden and Bothy Yard.It has also been confirmed that a topographical survey mdash which could cost as much as pound, mdashwill be required to assist with the planning process.Council officials say that while they recognise the parkrsquos undoubted heritage signicance, parts of it require investment to preserve and help promote an area which has ldquoexceptional tourism and recreational potential.It is envisaged that initial restoration work will focus on the -acre walled garden which is at the centre of the critically acclaimed arboretum, Bothy Yard and pathways which wind their way through the Rhododendron Wood.A critical look has also been taken of the parkrsquos traffic management and parking facilities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£700k environment scheme set to begin  ","story":"WORK on a near pound, environmental improvement scheme at Irish Street in Downpatrick starts on January .The Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council are jointly funding the initiative which will result in one traffic lane being closed during the scheme to facilitate the contractor.The government department is making a pound, contribution to the public realm project, with the local authority providing the remainder of the cash for the eagerly-awaited revamp.Design proposals have revealed the work mdash which includes new granite footpaths, lighting and street furniture mdash is due to be completed before the end of the financial year.The government department said funding for the streetscape scheme will build on the ldquosignicant public realm investment already made by the government department in Downpatrick over recent years.Local council officials are delighted to be working in partnership with the Department for Communities to deliver the project and are looking forward to the benefits that it will bring to Irish Street in terms of regenerating a central part of the town which has missed out on major public sector investment for several decades.Damian Mulholland mdash director of regional development with the Department for Communities mdash said recently that funding for the streetscape scheme will build on the ldquosignicant public realm investment already made by the government department in Downpatrick over recent years.He said the latest investment for Irish Street will enhance the natural heritage of the area at this historic part of the town and help improve visitors and resident experience.Councillor Dermot Curran says he is pleased work will start early in the New Year and has appealed to motorists to be patient during the lane closure.ldquoI realise this will inevitably have an impact on traffic, but hope roads officials will alter the sequencing of town centre traffic lights in a bid to minimise this, he continued. ldquoI hope the lane closure will be in place for the shortest time possible and will be liaising with contractors throughout the duration of the scheme.Cllr Curran said the scheme will help regenerate Irish Street, providing a boost for traders and residents and help arrest decline in an area where the presence of the townrsquos former police base was a major impediment to investment.He continued: ldquoBusiness owners in particular will be delighted that work is due to start soon. As I have said previously, Irish Street is ripe for redevelopment opportunities and this major investment is long overdue.Cllr Curran is also hopeful that Newry, Mourne and Down Council will make a fresh bid for Heritage Lottery Funding to help restore historic buildings within Downpatrickrsquos conservation area, which includes Irish Street.Several weeks ago it was confirmed that the local authorityrsquos initial bid for a so-called townscape initiative had been rejected, despite a signicant amount of time, effort and money being invested in the application process.Officials in charge of the heritage fund claimed the local authorityrsquos bid was influenced by planned regeneration opportunities within the wider conservation area ldquorather than heritage need.In addition, they argued there was limited scope within Downpatrickrsquos townscape initiative area to deliver a ldquocomprehensive scheme and believed that given development proposals for Irish Street and the townrsquos former police base, the local authorityrsquos proposed scheme was ldquoinfluenced by regeneration opportunities within the wider conservation area.Cllr Curran says he hopes a fresh application will meet with success to assist further the social and economic regeneration of not only Irish Street, but the wider town centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch fete Schmidt  ","story":"IRELAND coach Joe Schmidt was the guest of honour at Ballymacarn Park on Friday when  members and guests enjoyed an excellent lunch followed by a question and answer session, conducted by club chairman Philip Gregg.He was his usual humble self as he described his coaching philosophy and the journey he has been on over the past  years and it was a wonderful afternoon for all in attendance.Despite his tight time schedule, Joe took the time to mingle with those present and was a complete gentleman throughout.

These conditions could prevent a leboat from ing to its moorings and may prevent it from getting out of the harbour on service.Lord Roden, the honorary secretary of the Newcastle leboat station, has also rejected the latest call to switch the leboat base from his town to Kilkeel.ldquoI can give an assurance that Newcastle is taking no part in such an argument, he said. ldquoThe stationing of boats on the coast is solely a matter for the RNLI management committee.ldquoThe Newcastle leboatmen are proud of their boat.

Antrim.Like the Beast from the East, a weather system from Scandinavia is moving towards Northern Ireland.The current Scandinavian blast is being driven by what experts call a Sudden Stratospheric Warming .The Met Office have warned against possible snowfall and freezing cold temperatures as a result of the S.S.W.The S.S.W. is currently underway which has resulted in the moving south of a displaced polar vortex from the Arctic. A S.S.W. could see Northern Ireland hit with bitterly cold weather.\"There is a risk of some hill snow in the north, but perhaps to lower levels at times too,\" said the Met Office on its official website.In reference to the second half of January, the Met Office warned of \"severe gales\", \"heavy rain\" as well as an \"enhanced risk of frost, fog and snow\".\"It is likely start unsettled across most areas at first, with perhaps heavy rain and gales at times, especially in the north, where severe gales are possible.\"Hill snow is also possible, as well as snow to lower levels at times in the north.In  the Beast from the East caused widespread disruption and chaos.\"By the third week of January there is then an increased likelihood of a change to much colder weather generally, bringing an enhanced risk of frost, fog and snow.\"These conditions may then continue to the end of the month, but some milder, wet and windy interludes also remain possible throughout this period.\"What is a S.S.W. The term SSW refers to what we observe - rapid warmingin the stratosphere, between  km and  km up.There is an enhanced risk of frost, fog and snow in the second half of January  according to the Met Office.Jet streams high up in our atmosphere, in both the northern and southern hemisphere, circumnavigate the Earth from west to east. One of these, the Polar Night Jet, circles the Arctic.Sometimes the usual westerly flow can be disrupted by natural weather patterns or disturbances in the lower part of the atmosphere, such as a large area of high pressure in the northern hemisphere.This causes the Polar Jet to wobble and these wobbles, or waves, break just like waves on the beach.When they break they can be strong enough to weaken or even reverse the westerly winds and swing them to easterlies.As this happens, air in the stratosphere starts to collapse in to the polar cap and compress.As it compresses it warms, hence the stratospheric warming.Motorists should take extra care when driving in cold and icy conditions.What is a Polar Vortex The polar vortex is a circulation of winds high up in the stratosphere, up to  milesabove the earth.It is present in winter, and is not a new phenomenon, scientists have known about it for many years.The winds regularly exceed  miles per hour– the strength of the winds in the strongest hurricanes .During the winter it can strengthen and weaken. These changes exert an influence lower down in the atmosphere and ultimately on our weather.try catch            ..

Yet, a recent incident in the Republic may have provided ordinary, working unionists in Northern Ireland with an insight into what they can expect in a ‘New Ireland’, particularlyit is shaped by the attitudes of Sinn Féin and its supporters.There were unpleasant scenes near Strokestown in County Roscommon before Christmas, when a security firm from Lisburn removed three siblings from a family farmhouse, after a bank secured a court order for their eviction. The episode, caught on camera and shared widely on the internet, was disturbing and there were suggestions that the security guards acted heavy-handedly.Understandably, the video generated a great deal of public anger. Irrespective of the circumstances, nobody likes to see people being forcibly removed from their home, especially in the run up to Christmas.However, much of the reaction and, indeed, much of the coverage in some papers, had a distinctly unpleasant undertone. There was a special focus on the accent of the security guards, who came from Northern Ireland, and the fact that one of them was heard to state that he was ‘British’, after an onlooker claimed he should be ashamed to evict a “fellow Irish man”. In an ugly sequel to the repossession, a cattle truck full of ‘vigilantes’ descended on the property to take retribution on the security guards, with the result that three of them were hospitalised and a guard dog killed.Gardai accused republican elements of exploiting a public outcry over the eviction, in order to conduct a brutal, well-planned assault. The unspoken tensions beneath this sequence of events were clear to see in the Irish parliament, when Sinn Féin’s Pearse Doherty condemned the thuggery of the ‘bank’s enforcers’, but failed to mention the later, more serious attack. After some testy exchanges, the taoiseach observed that, when it comes to the Shinners attitude to the rule of law, “it doesn’t take long for your balaclava to slip”.It seems unlikely that the republican party’s response to the eviction, and indeed the extent of public anger, was not fuelled by the security guards’ northern unionist identity. Robin Swann: With Stormont still out of action, people’s faith in politicians is stretched to the limit Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The reaction among Sinn Féin’s army of online supporters, or ‘Shinnerbots’, centred on the men’s apparent links to the British army. It was insinuated that these links meant they were also likely to be connected to loyalist paramilitaries.It has since emerged that the firm’s boss probably was a soldier, first with the Ulster Defence Regimentand then with the Royal Irish Regiment. Some former members of the UDR have been accused of links to paramilitary groups and, in the popular republican imagination, the regiment is often portrayed as an adjunct of armed loyalism. In truth, it played an important role in preventing Northern Ireland from descending into outright civil war and sustained severe casualties, as its mainly part-time soldiers were targeted viciously by the IRA.None of this necessarily excuses the conduct of the security company behind the eviction, which will no doubt be investigated by the Gardai for any wrongdoing. In the Republic, the incident will create a perfectly valid discussion about regulating repossession and how much force is legitimatepeople will not leave property willingly. A report in the Irish Daily Mirror quoted sources in the security industry that had very little good to say about the firm that was involved in the ruckus in Roscommon. However, from a Northern Ireland perspective, more interesting were the role of Sinn Fein in inflaming opinion, the suspected involvement of republicans in reprisals, the tenor of media coverage and the anti-British hostility that seemed to characterise some of the public reaction. The political background and the previous employment of the personnel involved should, by rights, have remained irrelevant to this story. Many unionists in Northern Ireland served with distinction in the armed forces and are proud of their former regiments. Likewise, they feel that their identity is British, in whole or in part. Yet, it seems that these simple facts could be considered provocations or aggravating factors,their job makes them unpopular in an all-Ireland republic.

I don’t think anyone should be afraid of it.”Mr McCarthy, who sat on the SDLP national executive for  years, said the party had been in decline for well over a decade. An SDLP source told the News Letter that, having spoken to councillors in the party theand breadth of the Province, he was convinced that the “vast majority are ready and willing to embrace” the proposed merger.The News Letter contacted a number of SDLP members yesterday in a bid to gauge opinion on the matter.Robin Swann: With Stormont still out of action, people’s faith in politicians is stretched to the limit Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Of the more than  people we contacted by phone, only three answered, and none were willing to comment.MLA’s Patsy McGlone and Daniel McCrossan both said it was an “internal party matter”, while former SDLP deputy leader Seamus Mallon said he had “no information on the subject whatsoever”.In his New Year’s message, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood has said the party is ready to “embrace” change in .try catch            ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

By hanging on as she did and with the support of everyone involved the rescue was affected quickly and safely.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

According to the latest Real Estate Outlook report from CBRE, there was take-up of , sq ft of office space across  transactions, in . It says that was more than double the figure a year earlier. Some of the major deals completing last year included PwC’s move to Merchant Square, the Northern Ireland Civil Service at  Lanyon Place and Allstate at Mays Meadow. “During an unsettling period of political uncertainty, the local office market is an indicator of the health of the Northern Ireland economy, with the professional services and technology sectors in particular leading the way,” Brian Lavery, managing director at CBRE said. “Currently we only have around , sq ft of grade A office space available fragmented across a number of buildings underpinning the need for more investment in this space. “Alongside this office space growth, we are also seeing the green shoots of demand for residential living in the city centre. We believe this is the trend to track in  and beyond as investors across the UK and globally continue to look for opportunities in this area. “However, on a more positive note, we are seeing strong interest from a wide spectrum of investors for office investments in Belfast which is being driven by growing rents and demand, combined with limited supply of high-quality accommodation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
