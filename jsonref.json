When nerve fibres in the skin, called C-tactile afferents, are stroked it triggers the release of ‘love hormone’ oxytocin, which makes us feel happy and secure. This could also explain why weighted blankets might have a calming effect, says Francis McGlone, a professor of neuroscience at Liverpool John Moores University.The concept of heavy bedding isn’t new parents have swaddled newborns for centuries, and weighted blankets or vests have been used for more than a decade to soothe children with autism.Around 70 per cent of those with autism sleep poorly because of differences in their melatonin production — the hormone that controls the sleep-wake cycle – as well as the way they respond to their environment.The theory is that a weighted blanket might reduce stress by changing how they process sensory information.However, while there is anec-dotal evidence that weighted blankets work, studies have failed to come up with scientific proof.         The mechanism behind them is deep pressure stimulation (DPS), a soft, even pressure applied to the body providing the feeling of a firm hug, swaddling or massage. Stock pictureAfter being contacted by parents who were using weighted blankets on their autistic children, Professor Paul Gringras, a children’s sleep expert at the Evelina London Children’s Hospital, decided to put them to the test.In his trial, 67 children with autism and a severe sleep disorder used either a weighted blanket or one of a normal weight that looked identical for two weeks, and then swapped to the other blanket.The study, published in the journal Pediatrics in 2014, found the blankets ‘did not help children with autism sleep longer, fall asleep faster or wake less often’.‘The negative results were important to know about, but disappointing for families of children with autism, as sleep is such a huge problem for them,’ Professor Gringras told Good Health.Alarmingly, two deaths have been linked to the misuse of weighted blankets: a nine-year-old autistic boy died after being rolled up in a heavy blanket and a seven-month-old, who had been covered with a weighted blanket designed for children over three.The blankets come in different weights, and Dr Sally Payne, a professional adviser for children, young people and families at the Royal College of Occupational Therapists, warns the weight should be appropriate (roughly 10 per cent of your body weight).‘To prevent the risk of suffocation, take the blanket off the child when they are asleep,’ she says.In healthy adults, a few studies have had more positive results.A U.S. study in Occupational Therapy in Mental Health journal in 2008, involving 32 adults with anxiety, found two-thirds were less anxious if they used a 30lb blanket.Meanwhile, a Swedish study, published in the Journal of Sleep Medicine and Disorders in 2015, found sleep quality improved when 31 insomniacs used weighted blankets.There is, of course, a drawback: they can make you feel very hot.And some sleep experts say the blankets, which cost up to £145, are an expensive gimmick.‘There is no evidence they provide any health benefit,’ says Dr Neil Stanley, a sleep expert and member of the British Sleep Society. ‘If you like to feel cocooned, make your bed the old-fashioned way, with a blanket and sheet.’Dr Guy Leschziner, a consultant neurologist and sleep physician at Guy’s Hospital in London, agrees: ‘There is no real research on these blankets or how they work. But if you like the sensation and you find it relaxing and comforting, then that probably will help you sleep and it’s unlikely to do any harm.’ "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86e0d1d3104e19d49d4af703e6e7bb45f7524de5/0_173_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d3b59711f5151ff139b8712b163a9051","title":"deutsche bank jobs staff london","story":"Some staff in London reported to be in tears after hearing their jobs have goneDeutsche Bank started slashing thousands of jobs in the City of London and in New York only hours after announcing a drastic plan to reduce its global workforce by 18,000.Germany’s biggest lender employs almost 8,000 people in the UK, with 7,000 in London, which is one of the main hubs for its global investment bank, where the bulk of the job losses will be focused. The jobs being cut make up about a fifth of Deutsche’s global workforce of 91,500.Some staff in London were reported to be in tears after hearing that their jobs had gone. Workers started leaving the bank’s building in the City at around 10am carrying bags of belongings. Some said they were told their passes would stop working at 11am.A male contract worker on his way into the building in Great Winchester Street said: “The bank is not doing well, so they have to do something to get back up and running.”In New York, hundreds of workers were summoned to the cafeteria at Deutsche’s Wall Street office to hear their fates. Employees were seen leaving with their redundancy terms in large white envelopes. Staff at the nearby Full Shilling Irish bar were expecting laid-off Deutsche workers to congregate in the afternoon.After suffering big losses in the wake of the financial crisis and also in four of the past five years, Deutsche Bank’s problems have raised fears about its future among German government ministers. Berlin encouraged it to discuss a merger with its German rival Commerzbank, but talks ended in April, leaving Sewing to look for other means to safeguard the 149-year-old bank’s future.Sewing, who travelled to London to announce the cuts outlined on Sunday, expects to spend €7.4bn in order to cut the bank’s annual running costs by €6bn a year by 2022.Deutsche is also separating €74bn of bad loans and risky derivative contracts into a so-called bad bank, to be run down or sold to banks under less pressure. Sewing also pledged to invest an extra €13bn in technology and increase revenue in the core bank.Christian Sewing, Deutsche Bank\u0027s chief executive, told staff that the cutbacks were regrettable but inevitable: “We are making deep cuts. I personally greatly regret the impact this will have on some of you. In the long-term interests of our bank, however, we have no choice.”An equities trader in New York predicted that the layoffs on the equities floor would be swift: “It’s obviously going to suck for a couple of years.”One IT worker leaving their City of London office said the bad news was dished out briskly on Monday morning: “I was terminated this morning. There was a very quick meeting and that was it.”An equities trader emerged from Deutsche Bank’s London offices and headed to the pub, saying: “I got laid off where else would I go?”Another equities trader in Hong Kong said their offices had been gripped by news of the layoffs: “There is hardly any work getting done today and folks are just mailing or calling friends or headhunters. Half of the floor is gone and others are just waiting to be called in. Some people are saying their byes even before being called in.”A banker leaving the Hong Kong office confirmed that Deutsche had begun implementing the cuts on Monday: “If you have a job for me, please let me know.”A Singapore banker who remains in his job questioned whether Sewing’s plan would revive Deutsche’s fortunes: “The biggest question for us is where do we go from here if we don’t offer the whole suite of products? Will clients stick with us or is the game over?”Banking expert Philip Augar says Deutsche had bowed to the inevitable: “Their ambition was to challenge the Wall Street giants. And for about decade, it looked as though they’d pulled it off … They’ve been limping along for the last few years and I suppose this day had to come.”Anke Reingen of Royal Bank of Canada said the restructuring was more radical than expected: “However, as the plan pushes the profitability improvement further out in time on our estimates, we see more value elsewhere in the sector. Maintaining our rating of underperform, speculative risk.” Graeme WeardenHe promised not to ask shareholders for fresh funds. They have already stumped up almost €30bn in the past decade, only to see the company’s market value plunge to half that amount. Analysts at the US bank JP Morgan said Deutsche’s plan was “for the first time not half-baked”. But they also pointed out the bank’s poor record on executing plans, and questioned how motivated investment bank employees would be to revive the remaining business. Deutsche indicated that it could post another loss this year. It has already been through a series of attempted revamps, but without the big overhauls put in place by rivals such as Royal Bank of Scotland.The bank has given no breakdown for the job cuts, but they are likely to fall most heavily in Europe and the US, where its investment bank, which has 38,000 workers, employs thousands of people. Job losses will affect frontline traders and support staff in areas such as IT and compliance.The cuts will undo decades of expansion as Deutsche tried to compete with the biggest Wall Street firms such as Goldman Sachs. It made bold moves in the late 80s and 90s, buying Morgan Grenfell in London and Bankers Trust in the US.Deutsche earned the grudging respect of Wall Street rivals during the boom years leading up to the financial crisis, but the bank, which was a big player in the mortgage bonds at the centre of the US subprime crisis, struggled in the aftermath. It failed to absorb extra costs imposed by regulators after the crisis, turning its once powerful investment bank into a burden.Deutsche has also been at the centre of a string of scandals caused by lax controls during the boom years and has come under scrutiny over its business dealings with Donald Trump. Bankers Trust was the only New York bank prepared to lend to Trump in the 90s. Congress and New York state are investigating Trump, his family and Deutsche.The bank paid billions of dollars in fines and settlements related to failings before and after the 2008 financial crisis. It agreed a $7.2bn settlement with the US Department of Justice in 2017 in connection with selling bonds backed by mortgages lent to people with bad credit histories. More than $4bn of that sum was earmarked for homeowners who had lost out as a result of Deutsche’s dealings.The job cuts will be some of the biggest since the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in 2008 put 26,000 people out of work. Deutsche’s woes also show that the financial crisis is continuing to reverberate more than a decade after its peak.Sewing, who joined Deutsche as an apprentice 30 years ago aged 19 and is the bank’s fifth chief executive since 2008, said he regretted the cuts, but drastic action was needed after his predecessors’ careless expansion. He said the investment bank would now rely less on sales and trading of shares and bonds to make it viable.“We tried to compete in nearly every area of the banking market at the same time,” Sewing said. “Too many resources went to businesses where we don’t compete to win … Parts of our investment bank have been a drag on our results for years.”Deutsche said a slimmed-down corporate bank would keep a significant business in London, where it is currently constructing a new City headquarters. Sewing said Deutsche could continue to advise on flotations and other share issues for corporate clients without an equities trading ision."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/512a6a75fa7c643e4b142bfa682cbd16938c9066/851_1246_1808_1085/master/1808.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4d20083e3e3c356266266ab30d3e14c","title":"what went wrong at deutsche bank","story":"Drastic job-cutting is the latest chapter in the 149-year-old bank’s dramatic fall from graceDeutsche Bank’s drastic retrenchment marks the latest chapter in a dramatic fall from grace for a bank that was riding high until the banking crisis struck in 2008. Here’s how the 149-year-old bank ran into trouble.The Frankfurt-based lender embarks on a period of global expansion, beginning with the acquisition of blue-blooded merchant bank Morgan Grenfell in the UK.Capitalising on the rapid pace of globalisation, it pushes into European markets such as Spain, where it buys Banco de Madrid. Acquisitions are part of its ambition to become a major player in investment banking.It consolidates its US operations into one, in an effort to take on the big beasts of Wall Street such as Goldman Sachs, and in 1999 it builds on its US foothold by snapping up New York-based Bankers Trust for $10bn (£8bn).Deutsche Bank floats on the New York Stock Exchange, cementing its position as one of the major players, not just on Wall Street but in global banking.In the years leading up to the banking crash, Deutsche Bank is a leader in mortgage-backed securities, bundling up homeowners’ debt into huge packages and selling them on to investors. The bank continues to sell toxic mortgage-based investments even as the market turns south and it begins betting against such products itself.A key character in The Big Short movie about the sub-prime scandal – played by Ryan Gosling – was based on a Deutsche Bank trader who was enabling investors to bet against the very market in which Deutsche was involved.In 2008 the bank reports its first annual loss for five decades , losing €3.9bn. “We have made mistakes, as everyone did,” said chief executive Josef Ackermann.An internal investigation finds that the bank hired private detectives to spy on people it considered a threat to the bank – including a shareholder, a journalist and a member of the public. German prosecutors find no evidence of criminal wrongdoing or that senior executives were involved.Deutsche’s boss Josef Ackermann, a Swiss banker, stepped down after a decade in the top job in May 2012. He was succeeded by joint chief executives Anshu Jain and Jürgen Fitschen, who resigned  in the wake of the Libor scandal. A British banker, John Cryan, took over, but he left in 2018 having failed to get to grips with the bank’s problems. Deutsche’s shares lost more than half their value under Cryan as it struggled to return to profitability. He was succeeded by Christian Sewing, who said yesterday the bank had “no choice” in axing 18,000 staff.Deutsche is fined $2.5bn (£1.7bn) by US and UK regulators for rigging the key Libor interest rate. The bank was also ordered to fire seven employees and accused of being obstructive towards regulators in their investigations into the global manipulation of the benchmark rate. The fine is a record for Libor transgressions.The bank is fined a further $258m in the US for doing business with US-sanctioned countries like Iran and Syria.As regulators continue to sift through the wreckage of the banking crash, Deutsche takes a large slice of the blame. In September 2016, its shares slump on news that the institution faces a $14bn charge over mis-selling mortgage securities in the US. It eventually reaches a $7.2bn settlement with the US Department of Justice.In 2017 UK and US regulators fine Deutsche more than $630m after finding that the lender failed to prevent $10bn of Russian money laundering via “mirror trades”, which had no economic purpose and served only to transfer money covertly.Last year New York financial regulators hand down a fresh fine, $205m this time, for “lax oversight” in the bank’s foreign exchange business between 2007 and 2013, when it was the world’s largest dealer in foreign currency.After struggling to recover from the financial crisis, , Deutsche attempts to organise a merger with another troubled German lender, Commerzbank.

The disembodied broadcaster details new parking measures, issues with the pneumatic waste disposal chute and various building maintenance jobs to be carried out that day.“There’s no way of turning it off,” sighs Kim’s wife, Jung-sim, as she prepares breakfast. “I hate technology but my husband is an early adopter. He has to have everything first.”It was Kim’s love of the latest tech that prompted him move his family to the future, or the nearest thing to it – Songdo, South Korea’s self-styled “smart city”, built on a 600-hectare parcel of artificial land dredged from the Yellow Sea near Seoul’s Incheon airport. It is a place where the garbage is automatically sucked away through underground pipes, where lampposts are always watching you, and where your apartment block knows to send the elevator down to greet you when it detects the arrival of your car. Sensors in every street track traffic flow and send alerts to your phone when it’s going to snow, while you can monitor the children’s playground on TV from the comfort of your sofa.The feature Kim enjoys most is a small touchscreen display on his kitchen wall that allows him to keep track of his and his wife’s consumption of electricity, water and gas and, most important, compare it against the average statistics for the building. Flicking between the screens of bar charts and graphs, a broad grin spreads across his face: for yet another day running, they are more energy-efficient than all their neighbours.From their living room window at the top of one of the city’s new residential towers, a panorama of downtown Songdo unfolds. Across an eight-lane highway lies Central Park, a broad swath of trees surrounding an ornamental lake, flanked by rows of glass towers with vaguely jaunty silhouettes. Armies of identikit concrete apartment blocks march into the hazy distance beyond, terminating at a Jack Nicklaus-designed golf course. It looks a lot like many other modern Asian cities, a place of generic towers rising above a car-dominated grid. Public life is mostly confined to the air-conditioned environments of malls and private leisure clubs.Initiated by the South Korean government in the late 1990s, when Incheon airport was being planned, Songdo represents a model that has been replicated numerous times around the world. Begun as a joint venture with US developer Gale International – which has since hawked its “city in a box” kit to other countries – the Songdo International Business District was conceived as a $40bn hub for international companies, an exemplar of sustainable urbanism and testing ground for new smart city technologies.Scores of new cities are rising across the world from previously untouched desert and jungle, or on land “reclaimed” from the sea. While the history of cities built from scratch is long, the scale of the current epidemic is beyond anything seen before.\u0026nbspAnother 2.5 billion people are predicted to move to cities over the next 30 years and the trend shows no signs of stopping. New research has identified more than 100 examples, nearly all in Asia and Africa.\u0026nbspThis week  Cities meets the 90-year-olds who built the Bulgarian city of Dimitrovgrad after the second world war (many still live there) and visits the bizarre Bahria Town development promising Karachi residents protection from terror attacks and violent crime.\u0026nbsp We look at Hong Kong’s plan to build artificial islands for 1.1 million people and examine Egypt’s dream to conquer the Sahara. We remember past visions of future cities and ask, is there ever a good reason to start a city from scratch?It claims to have the highest concentration of green Leed-certified buildings in the world, yet it is still entirely car-based, with not even a train line to the nearby airport. To get to Seoul, just 30km away, takes an hour and a half by metro. Songdo may have an “Integrated Operations Centre” – a Big Brother control room where reams of data are funnelled in real time from thousands of sensors across the city – but the physical urban model is no different to any other car-riddled business district. For all its low-energy labels, it is an expensive, exclusive and impersonal place.Across the world, there are countless new cities like Songdo in the making. Barely differentiable, and often designed and serviced by the same international consultancies, these hi-tech urban enclaves are cropping up from Kenya to Kazakhstan . India has pledged to build 100 smart cities, while Africa is seeing $100bn pumped into at least 20 projects. China, having initiated 500 of its own smart city pilots, is now summoning a string of outposts through its Belt and Road initiative, from the dry port of Khorgos, on its border with Kazakhstan, to east London’s Royal Albert Dock, reborn as the Asian Business Park.Saudi Arabia has pledged to trump them all with Neom, a $500bn mega-project billed as an answer to Silicon Valley. Planned as a centre for renewable energy, biotechnology, manufacturing, media and entertainment, it sprawls across an area 33 times the size of New York City. It claims to be nothing less than “the world’s most ambitious project” an incubator for “the next era of human progress”.The escapist urge to build cities from scratch is nothing new. At the turn of the 19th century, the Garden City movement saw a generation of bucolic communities planned in reaction to the grime and overcrowding of rapidly industrialising cities, driven by a powerful campaign for social reform. Half a century later, the New Town movement developed these ideas, promising a brave new world of modern, self-sufficient municipalities rising from the ruins of the second world war, and focused on building an inclusive, democratic society.Now, in the first decades of a new millennium, a surge in global population growth and a sense of impending environmental armageddon have spurred an epidemic of planned cities of a very different kind. This time they are being conceived by private multinational corporations as gilt-edged gated communities and tax-exempt free-trade hubs, each branded as the ultimate techno-eco-utopia.According to research from Savills, real estate is now a more valuable asset class than all stocks, shares and securitised debt combined, with a total value of around $228tn. That represents three and a half times global GDP, or 40 times the value of all the gold ever mined. While once we dug down to extract value from the earth, the bristling glass towers of these new urban enclaves are the inverted mineshafts of today – complete with equally damaging side effects.This new breed of city takes various different forms, from government initiatives, to public-private partnerships, to entirely private enterprises. Many are being used to jump-start economies in the developing world, with masterplans carefully calibrated to attract foreign investors and treasuries looking to sink their funds into something concrete. They provide a powerful means for wealthy countries to expand their strategic influence abroad, with the construction of new cities acting as a form of “debt-trap diplomacy”, tying host nations into impossibly burdensome deals. They are billed as a panacea for the world’s urban ills, solving overcrowding, congestion and pollution yet, more often than not, they turn out to be catalysts for land dispossession, environmental degradation and social inequality.At the southern tip of Malaysia on a series of four artificial islands, one such promised Elysium is sprouting from the sand. Launched in 2014, Forest City is a $100bn joint venture between the Chinese developer Country Garden and the Sultan of Johor. It is planned to house 700,000 people by 2050.Forest City has been marketed as an “iconic urban area” moments from Singapore, a “new Shenzhen” where the “concepts of safety, convenience, green and smart are integrated into every corner of life”. It features luxury apartment towers, hotels, offices, shopping malls and an international school, all smothered with a lush blanket of greenery and surrounded by a “virtual electric fence”.The apartments are prohibitively expensive for most Malaysians but a relative bargain for Chinese investors, who have been flown here in droves and bussed to the spaceship-shaped sales gallery to marvel at the enormous model of the Avatar-like world that awaits. Cashiers stand at the end of the guided tour to take credit card down-payments before the tourists get back on the bus.This self-styled “eco-city” is being built on 162m cubic metres of shipped-in sand that has already had a damaging impact on the surrounding marine environment. The causeway built to facilitate the land reclamation for the islands cuts right across the Tanjung Kupang seagrass meadows, a precious habitat that helps to stabilise the sea floor and protect coastal erosion, while mangroves have been trampled to make way for the development’s prefabrication factories.Reclamation began without the required environmental impact assessment, and the effects have already been felt by local fishermen, who complain of reduced catches due to the destruction of their fragile ecosystem. The emerging island community, meanwhile, is not so much a city as a ghostly duty-free resort, a haunted Photoshop montage mostly bereft of full-time residents.A similar story is taking place thousands of miles away on the west coast of Africa, where “an investment opportunity on an unprecedented scale” is being touted on a patch of sand dredged from the Atlantic Ocean, off the coast of Lagos. Eko Atlantic is another public-private partnership, this time brokered between the state government and the Chagoury Group, an influential Nigerian business empire, with engineering expertise provided by the China Communications Construction Company – a state-owned conglomerate that appears to have cornered the market in conjuring land from the ocean, being responsible for dredging Forest City as well as terraforming disputed islands in the South China Sea.Eko Atlantic is protected by its own sea defence barrier made of 100,000 five-tonne concrete blocks, dubbed the “Great Wall of Lagos”, making it a secure private island for the few, shielded from climate catastrophe at the expense of others. It is a raised atoll for the wealthy Nigerian elite, while the poor remain consigned to low-lying coastal slums whose exposure to deadly flooding and coastal erosion has only increased since the construction of the sea wall.As the environmental activist Nnimmo Bassey put it, the project “is contrary to anything one would want to do if one took seriously climate change and resource depletion”. As if to cement Donald Trump’s image as the poster boy for climate denial, the US embassy recently announced it will be relocating to a secure five-hectare compound there.The glamorous computer-generated visions of Lagos’s exclusive new appendage have sparked a thirst for similarly futuristic and climate-inappropriate schemes across the continent, as countries race to provide the answer to housing the additional 1.3 billion people that are projected to be added to Africa’s population by 2050. Ghana unveiled plans for the Hope City – Hope is an acronym of Home, Office, People and Environment – a $10bn fantasy that would be home to Africa’s tallest building.It has been joined by Tanzania’s Kigamboni New City in Dar es Salaam, Kenya’s Tatu City in Nairobi, Rwanda’s Vision City in Kigali, and Senegal’s plans for the $2bn Diamniadio Lake City (designed by the appropriately named Bad Consultant) – all of which follow the cookie-cutter approach of car-based, hi-tech hubs, rarely planned with existing populations in mind.As Rachel Keeton and Michelle Provoost of the International New Town Institute say in their new book, To Build a City in Africa: “New Towns are becoming islands with high quality services, while many existing African cities continue to suffer from unreliable electricity provision, limited access to clean water, and other ineffectual municipal services. Because of limited access to mortgages and other home financing models, the real African middle class cannot afford to live in these New Towns.”Despite the evidence of half-built utopias lying mostly empty around the world, the seductive dream of building new cities from scratch shows no sign of abating any time soon. City-making, and the innumerable planning, engineering and technical services that go with it, is a booming industry, and corporations are intent on recycling their ideas irrespective of local context.Back in Songdo – whose developers proudly list the exotic destinations where their ideas have since been rolled out – an innovation centre showcases the latest in parking violation sensors and crime-fighting lampposts, all branded with the u-City logo. Why “u”, I ask? “It stands for ubiquitous,” says the company rep. “Ultimately, we want our kind of city to be everywhere.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5d3a45b250940990b58eb972d51a1e80ddd95ff/2025_336_3134_1880/master/3134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d30e384828049a857da9a1f69b25e8ea","title":"embassy leak kim darroch foreign office","story":"Under the Vienna convention the diplomatic bag is inviolable. That’s because states have long accepted that ambassadors need to be able to report home in frank terms without the prying eyes of the host nation reading what they write. The principle still applies, even though sealing wax and Queen’s messengers have been replaced by encrypted emails. But all the effort to keep diplomatic communications secure counts for nothing if they are leaked by the home side.The scandal surrounding the reporting from British ambassador Kim Darroch in Washington is not that he was sending home his unvarnished analysis: that’s what good ambassadors have done for centuries. It’s that someone inside the British system deliberately amassed a stash of his assessments, then chose the moment of maximum impact to leak it. This was not a spontaneous decision to make public a single document: it required premeditation and therefore an agenda. Can it be a coincidence that the material appeared in the middle of the Conservative party’s leadership election?Some have said Darroch should have been more circumspect about what he wrote. But that is to undermine the whole purpose of having diplomats overseas. Their job is to give their best judgment and advice. It is up to ministers whether to take it or not. The quality of foreign policy decisions would certainly suffer if ambassadors censored their reporting for fear of it being leaked.The British diplomatic service has long been regarded as one of the best in the world. That’s partly because it employs excellent staff, trains them to be shrewd analysts and encourages them to give their views without fear or favour. It’s also because Whitehall has had a culture of sharing information efficiently among those who need to have it. When I was serving abroad, I was often better informed about meetings between heads of government, for example, than the officials in the local foreign ministry, where information was regarded as power and tightly held.Given the range and complexity of risks facing modern governments, the capacity to integrate information from a wide range of sources is more crucial than ever to good policymaking. If or when Britain does finally leave the European Union, negotiating a new basis for relations with our former partners and rethinking national strategy will put unprecedented demands on Whitehall. It will be essential that ministers get the best advice from their civil servants, and that decisions are based on pooling all the key information.That can only happen in an environment where everyone has trust that confidential information will remain just that. It’s embarrassing that we all know Britain’s ambassador believes the US administration is “dysfunctional”, “unpredictable”, “faction-riven” and “inept”. But the most toxic aspect of the latest leak is that it undermines trust in that confidentiality. Following the briefing to the media of discussions in the National Security Council about the role of Huawei in the UK’s 5G network, it suggests a deeply worrying pattern is emerging. Some people in the system are abusing their access to national security information to pursue political goals without any thought for the damage to the county’s interests or reputation.I do not believe the content of Darroch’s messages will do any lasting damage to the British-American relationship. Of course it’s not a great day for ambassadors to wake up and find their reports on the front page of a newspaper. It never happened to me, but there were plenty of occasions when I pressed the send button and then thought: “I really hope that doesn’t leak.” The relationship with Washington is based on strong and deep shared interests. Those are unchanged by the leaks. After all, the Americans had 250,000 state department cables from their embassies all around the world revealed by WikiLeaks in 2010 without lasting damage to their foreign relations.No, the damage is elsewhere – in three areas. First, to Britain’s reputation as a country that knows how to keep its secrets, with the suspicion that the ided and antagonistic state of our politics is spilling over into the handling of sensitive information.Second, to the willingness to share information efficiently around the system so that good decisions are taken on the basis of up-to-date knowledge of the true state of things. A natural reaction to what has happened might be to prune distribution lists, and to apply the “need to know” principle even more tightly. If taken too far, that could weaken one of the strengths of the British administrative system just when we will need it to be at full effectiveness. Third, the damage is to the confidence of civil servants to put their frank thoughts to ministers. They will have seen Ivan Rogers hounded out of his post as permanent representative to the EU after some of his reporting was deliberately leaked to undermine him. Now this.This pattern needs to be broken. I hope Darroch will have the staunchest backing from the future as well as the current government. I hope he will be replaced with another professional when his tour ends. And I hope that the leak inquiry will be pursued with real determination, and will involve the police if there is reason to believe the Official Secrets Act has been violated. The person who carried out this premeditated effort to undermine our ambassador, and with it our national interest, needs to be very worried today. When they are caught, it should be a career-ending event. That’s the only way we can stop the rot.• Lord Ricketts is a former permanent under-secretary at the Foreign Office and ambassador to France"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72bb705255dbfc22c14e8e879fcc2ad7d4ce4412/0_234_3504_2102/master/3504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1fb2b48d8cbd2aa98b11517a7d76ca1","title":"kate hoey brexiteer","story":"With esteemed friends from Farage to Rees-Mogg, the pro-hunting, pro-shooting Labour MP loved a party. Just not her ownI do feel that with the name Hoey it isn’t particularly prudent to put yourself about a lot, but she made a hobby of hanging out in random parties. She especially liked socialising with Nigel Farage (“I really don’t think Nigel Farage is a racist,” she has said of a man who literally once blamed traffic on immigrants). Perhaps the nadir was when she joined him on that infamous Brexit flotilla – which at the time I thought was the most absurd thing we would ever see in British politics, but which since seems the equivalent of looking through a pinhole camera, ie we actually only glimpsed a snippet of the full, damaging fury of it all.The one good thing about this trip was that it gifted us some great pics. In particular, the one above, in which Hoey resembles one of two neighbours screaming at each other across the road about an issue with the bins. “COME ON THEN, COME AND PUT YOUR KNOTWEED IN MY FOOD BIN RIGHT NOW, SANDRA, I SWEAR TO GOD.”And this one, in which her and Farage resemble a couple on a retirement cruise, in which the only sound that has passed between them in three weeks is the scrape of cutlery on plates as they dine in otherwise deathly silence.Talking of Hoey and parties, please enjoy this snippet of intel about Hoey getting absolutely wild at a bash Jacob Rees-Mogg held.I can but imagine Hoey coming out of a k-hole, smashing through a six-pack of Kit-Kat Chunkies. Please note that in this same article, about this same party, Rees-Mogg is (I am not joking) compared to Jay Gatsby.Good to know that Hoey was anti the handgun ban that was introduced after the Dunblane massacre. In an interview she gave to Sporting Gun magazine in 2001, she bemoaned her Labour colleagues’ “very unfair attitude” to handguns, as though they had jumped ahead of guns in an ATM queue, and weren’t in fact speaking out against mass murder.Hoey also once took a bunch of school children on a shooting trip, which, as far as I’m aware, is not a part of key stage 3. She is also famously pro foxhunting.If you have forgotten the time that, during the 2017 election campaign, Hoey photoshopped out a Liberal Democrat candidate who was attending an event with her, but left his legs intact, I am here to remind you.A recent beautiful moment was when Andrew Neil asked Hoey whether she could name a study that showed that the country was better off leaving the European Union. “Probably not”, was the key segment of her answer, and then she made a noise that sounds a lot like when you try to answer a question with a mouth full of toothpaste.Recall when Hoey tweeted the following:Apart from being the sort of thing your granny muses as she’s passing the potatoes, this is also something that having a cursory knowledge of current affairs or, say, the internet, could answer. Muslim countries in the Arab world have taken in the majority of Syrian refugees. Turkey, for instance, has around 3.5 million Syrian refugees Lebanon 2.2 million and Jordan 1.2 million.The one time Hoey has made me laugh is when she referred to the Independent Group for Change as “that little rump”. Heidi Allen, quick off the mark and in good spirits, replied: “I don’t think ‘that little rump’ is the name we’re gonna go for.”Despite representing Vauxhall, home to one of London’s gayest institutions, the Royal Vauxhall Tavern, Hoey has a worse record on pro-gay rights than 120 Tory MPs. Should she ever decide to move back to her home nation of Northern Ireland, I am sure she’d fit right in with the DUP. But I think we all know she’ll be soon turning up at the Brexit party HQ, in one of those scarves she loves, thrown over the shoulder like Tom Baker’s Doctor Who, hair sprayed to the height of the Shard, a bottle of bubbly in one hand, and an entire night’s supply of Hobnobs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a7c7f81825e07ada9e053ea1800e9ec3bd80c07/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7550904dabdd284d3c937c934ec3340c","title":"the guardian view on religious liberty the freedom to be wrong","story":"Conservative religious believers, of whom there are perhaps 4 billion in the world today, mostly Christians and Muslims, still suppose that homosexuality is sinful. Sometimes their belief is an expression of genuine hatred sometimes it is an unconsidered expression of belonging in a prejudiced society. In countries where this is a generally accepted prejudice, they probably don’t think about it much. In countries where gay people are accepted and affirmed as equals, fundamentalists have to think more carefully. Some retain their beliefs but place them in a context where homosexuality becomes merely one sin among many others – most of which the believer shares – and nothing to get worked up about. Others turn homophobia into a central point of doctrine, and fight against equality for gay people.In Britain, Christian Concern is a pressure group which has brought numerous lawsuits in an attempt to establish a right for its members to discriminate against gay people. Almost all of these have been lost. Last week, though, it won a partial victory in an important case at the court of appeal, even though the judgment dismissed most of the argument that the organisation had brought. The case concerned a trainee social worker originally from Cameroon, Felix Ngole, who was thrown off his course by Sheffield University in 2017 after some posts he had made in an argument in the comment section of an American news site two years before were drawn anonymously to the university’s attention. There is no suggestion that Mr Ngole had discriminated against gay people in practice, but the university took the view that “any expression of disapproval of same-sex relations (however mildly expressed) on a public social media or other platform which could be traced back to the person making it, was a breach of the professional guidelines” as the court summarised it.The judges pointed out that this position went some way beyond the professional guidelines which are meant to regulate social workers’ use of social media. It would in fact bar almost all conservative Christians and Muslims from any caring profession. At the same time, they rejected Mr Ngole’s claim “that the university had no business in interfering with his freedom of expression”. This also has to be right. Religious convictions cannot provide – and do not in law provide – a licence to ignore laws which the believer rejects. The case has now been remitted to a second disciplinary panel with the hope that both sides will attempt to find a mutually respectful standpoint.The distinction between speech and action is fundamental to a liberal society. Freedom of speech means nothing if it is not also the freedom to be egregiously wrong. This distinction becomes especially important in an age of social media when everything that anyone has said online can be dredged up and examined, not just by the state, but by almost any private enemy before being used as grounds for denunciation. The law can compel behaviour, but it shouldn’t compel thought and should not often compel the expression of thought. Not all disagreement is hatred. This may seem a trivial point when violent persecution of gay and trans people is on the rise. But persecution is not a zero sum game. Sexual minorities are persecuted round the world, but so, in many countries, are Christians and Muslims. Active persecution starts with intolerance and intolerance starts with a lack of empathy and of the imagination required to see the other as human, even when the other is a fundamentalist Christian."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59a06b0a196668fba1fd0b32b065f4583611c883/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aeb5f29fd82273c3ece072e08a1ba66c","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of summer","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘summer’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘summer’.Share your photos of what summer means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 10 July at 10am.

Fortunately, an army of volunteers – and a couple of international cricket stars – came to the rescueRelocation can be daunting enough when it’s by choice and you’re just one family leaving and needing to find a new home for an entire cricket club takes it to another level. That was the task facing Uttoxeter Cricket Club when they found out that their lease was not going to be renewed.The search for a new ground was neither swift nor easy but the solution did come from somewhere close by. Just four miles down the road the village of Marchington offered a glimmer of hope. “The village club had disbanded in the early 2000s,” says James Burton, head of fundraising at Uttoxeter, who led the committee overseeing the move. “There had been a little bit of cricket in the intervening period, but there hadn’t been a permanent club for about 15 years.”The ground was in a state of disrepair, and investment was clearly needed to give the ground “a radical facelift”, says Burton – so when Staffordshire Cricket Board and NatWest CricketForce, among others, stepped in to help, the sense of relief was huge. “Staffs cricket and the ECB putting faith in us – that was massive. It felt like some value was seen in our vision,” he says.CricketForce, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) initiative with long-time cricket supporter NatWest, helps community clubs upgrade their facilities, making it easier for communities to enjoy a huge summer of cricket.“The building work started in around October last year, so it was a real race against time to get ready for the new season,” says Burton. The club’s first game was scheduled for 20 April 2019.Ensuring that deadline was met – and adding a bit of excitement to the proceedings – were England cricketers Chris Woakes and Danielle Wyatt, who joined an army of volunteers mucking in with CricketForce.“CricketForce has been massive for us,” says Burton. “The number of people there from the village was phenomenal. People who we’d never even met came and supported us and gave their time generously.“Chris and Danielle were brilliant. Everything we asked of them, endless photographs, autographs, you name it. They were getting stuck in.“It was lucky some of our juniors weren’t at school that day. It was a great chance to meet their heroes.”With the work completed, Uttoxeter were ready for their first game. As too were the locals. Starved of cricket since the early 2000s, many returned to the ground, keen to hear the crack of leather on willow.“We’ve got a community,” says Burton. “We’ve got somewhere we know is home, and we’re starting to put structures in place and build on all the hard work that has gone before.And the club is seeing benefits beyond the increase in spectators. New players have joined both the adult and children’s teams, and the club has increased in size overall. “A number of adults have made their debut this season and we’ve got a number of juniors who have joined us too,” says Burton. “Previously they wouldn’t have found out about Uttoxeter Cricket Club.”“We go all the way up to under-13s now, whereas previously it was only under-eights,” adds Burton, who is also one of the junior coordinators at Uttoxeter.He is particularly proud of the fact that some of the under-13s have made their debut in the second team this season. “That, for us – the fact the youngsters are integrating in the club, mixing with senior players – has been the big payoff,” he says.As with any move, particularly in sport, a difficult adjustment period is almost inevitable, however – and Uttoxeter hasn’t been immune to this. “The first and second teams are both in the relegation zones at the moment, and our under-11s have played two and lost two. But the under-13s, at least, are top of the league.”However, with the success of the club’s off-the-field move undeniable, Burton is glad the attention can finally be on the sport: “It’s almost like cricket can start being the focus now. We’re here and this is now the beginning. The new challenge is starting.”For almost four decades, NatWest has supported cricket, with a mission to make the game easier for everyone to play and enjoy.A proud partner of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and the charity Chance to Shine, NatWest champions cricket at all levels – from grassroots support for local clubs and getting more people involved in the game, to supporting current and future England stars and helping fans cheer on their teams, however and wherever they choose.With NatWest, cricket is a game that has #NoBoundaries.

Institutions across the UK are teasing out stories of same-sex desire and gender nonconformity in artefacts that have, until now, been left untold, or actively suppressed. In 2015, National Museums Liverpool launched a research project to identify objects with an LGBTQ connection, resulting in a trail that takes in four separate venues. Last year, the University of Cambridge began piloting a tour programme that takes in its classical archaeology, zoology and polar museums (gay penguins make an appearance). Building on an audio trail devised in 2017 to mark the 50th anniversary of the partial decriminalisation of homosexuality, the British Museum recently announced it will offer volunteer-led tours around its permanent collection. And the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford has been awarded £91,200 in lottery funding to develop a series of exhibitions and permanent changes to its collection under the banner Beyond the Binary: Queering and Questioning Collections and Displays.Part of the response includes finding new ways to interpret the objects already on display, sifting through the vast stores to find hidden gems, and even “ethically collecting” new artefacts: the museum is in discussions about acquiring designs by Corey Bulpitt, a First Nations artist from Canada, whose work based on the traditional Haida motif of the rainbow has been adopted by LGBTQ activists. During a short tour of Pitt Rivers’ spectacular cast-iron central court, research assistant Mara Gold picks out a cabinet containing knickers made from reindeer skin, brought back from a research trip to Siberia in 1915 by the Polish cultural anthropologist Maria Czaplicka. Her work focused on shamanistic societies and, according to Gold, she was the first scholar to differentiate between cross-dressing and being transgender, both of which she identified in different Siberian groups.The Pitt Rivers is working closely with both “originating communities” and local LGBTQ people to overhaul its collection in a process that will take up to two years. Back at the V\u0026ampA, the criteria for deciding what features in the tours are more straightforward. “We have a rule of three for choosing things,” says Vo. “Either the creator is queer, or it could be the object itself depicts a queer subject. The third and most important one is that it’s something the community may have taken on board as part of their story.” The plaster reproduction of Michelangelo’s David in the museum’s cast room satisfies all of these requirements, by virtue of the homoerotic friendship between biblical figures David and Jonathan, Michelangelo’s reputed homosexuality, and the fact that the statue was used as a discreet come-on by travellers returning from the grand tour. “If you brought back a statue of David and had it on your shelf, it was usually an invitation, a hint for others to approach you and say, I think there might be things we can talk about.”Harmless as they may seem – you don’t have to go on any of the tours, and the Pitt Rivers changes will affect only a fraction of its half-a-million items – efforts at queering haven’t always met with acclaim. The National Trust’s 2017 Prejudice and Pride programme, which aimed to show “how the often secretive lives of members of the LGBTQ community have helped shape the places we care for”, was labelled a “gay campaign” by the  and said to have provoked an (ultimately illusory) “membership crisis”. The Pitt Rivers is bracing for a similar reaction.“There is going to be backlash, for sure, but I welcome it,” says Hannah Bruce, the Beyond the Binary activities officer. Does she worry that some visitors will be alienated by all the focus on LGBTQ issues? “You mean people suddenly experiencing a feeling where they’re like, ‘Oh, I’ve never been excluded in my life before’? It kind of has to happen,” she says. “Some people are used to being represented. And there are these other communities that have had zero representation.”People from those communities seem to be pretty happy about finally seeing themselves in the picture. James Daykin, 44, travelled from Banbury to attend the Pitt Rivers tour. “I think it’s fantastic. It’s the start of something.” Daykin points out that the queering of museums doesn’t serve the needs of just LGBTQ people. It’s for everyone, to show that “We’ve always been a part of society. We’ve always been contributors to society. We didn’t just appear 50 years ago. And we didn’t just appear 50 years ago with the intention to wreak havoc on the world, you know?”By the end of the tour at the V\u0026ampA, a mother and daughter from Edinburgh named Zoe Agnew, 60, and Harriet Phillips, 21, are bubbling over with excitement. “When Harriet first came out to me, I wasn’t in a good place at that time, so I wasn’t very accepting of it.” But that has changed to the extent that, as Harriet points out, the V\u0026ampA visit was entirely her mum’s idea. “I just want to educate myself,” Zoe says.“Once you start seeing it, you see it everywhere. Sculptures, paintings … and you just go, how come I never noticed this before? It’s all there, but it’s all been stifled – it’s all been shut up. It’s so life-affirming. You know, she’s my daughter, I love her, I want her to be able to live in a world where people accept her for who she is.”At this point, Harriet beaming beside her, Zoe grabs me for a spontaneous hug, wondering out loud: “I don’t know if you hug journalists!” I assure her it’s fine, before leaving them in the shop, buoyed up by their infectious enthusiasm. Whatever else it does, a queered museum can definitely put a spring in your step."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/130e11a424b1a4caecc3c98f290b744aa9ae88bd/0_189_4320_2591/master/4320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5b4530976bd7b808ffc10ed1b357fa4","title":"primary school teachers want to see sats scrapped","story":"More than 54,000 primary members of the National Education Union (NEU) took part in an indicative ballot last month. The vast majority said they supported their leaders’ campaign for “a sensible alternative” to the national standard attainment tests, which they say are damaging children and narrowing the curriculum.The NEU said the result sent a clear message to the government that the assessment system must change. The results of a second question on the ballot paper, asking whether members would be prepared to take industrial action and boycott Sats, have not yet been released.The teachers’ poll coincides with the publication on Tuesday of the key stage 2 Sats results for 600,000 10- and 11-year-olds in England who took tests in reading, maths and spelling, punctuation and grammar (Spag) in May.The tests are used by the government to assess school performance and hold schools to account. The NEU argues that young children should not be tested as it leads to hothousing, stress for both pupils and teachers, and a narrowing of the curriculum.Kevin Courtney, the NEU’s joint general secretary, said the union’s indicative ballot showed there was “resounding support” for a change to primary assessment. “Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Green party all have major concerns about our Sats-dominated system and have pledged to change it.“Government now needs to listen, and to accept the need to change a culture in which too many classrooms are dominated by teaching to the test, at the expense of the learning and wellbeing of our children.”The schools minister, Nick Gibb, dismissed the ballot, saying that scrapping Sats would be a backward step. “The NEU’s indicative ballot does not even represent half their members, let alone the whole teaching profession.“These tests have been part of school life since the 90s and have been pivotal in raising standards in our primary schools. Abolishing these tests would be a terrible, retrograde step. It would enormously damage our education system and undo decades of improvement in children’s reading and maths.”Jeremy Corbyn received a standing ovation when he announced to teachers gathered at the NEU’s annual conference in April that his party would scrap Sats. Delegates at the conference voted in favour of a ballot over a possible boycott of Sats tests, seeing off an amendment from the executive arguing that a ballot was not the most appropriate tactic.Responding to the NEU ballot, the shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said: “These results should send the government a clear message that Sats aren’t working for teachers or pupils, and it’s about time they listened.”More Than a Score, a campaigning group of parents, teachers and education experts, said: “It’s not right or accurate to base a school’s overall performance on the test results of primary-age children. There are more supportive ways to assess children and fairer ways to measure schools, without the need to turn pupils into data points.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a65ab1aecb4921457f3db7f7fad29dc0f2d73dd/209_531_3968_2381/master/3968.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa11d7e78ea045b82e7291ea4af1b48b","title":"share photos of wildflower and planted meadows and verges near you","story":"If you have seen any planted meadows or verges by roads or public spaces, we would like to hear from youBritish conservation charity Plantlife’s campaign to encourage the growth and planting of flowers on UK roadside verges has seen some councils take the message seriously.Posting on Twitter, Bex Langley wrote about the eight miles of flowers planted along a major road in Rotherham thanks to the local council.The group’s road verge campaign started in 2013 in response to the mowing down of wildflowers – flowers which are not intentionally seeded or planted.

They need large quantities of cooling water to function, however the increasing number of heatwaves are threatening this supply.The French energy company EDF is curbing its output from four reactors in Bugey, on the Rhône River near the Swiss border, because the water is too warm and the flow is low.Some reactors in the US are also frequently affected. This matters in both countries because the increasing use of air conditioning means electricity demand is high during summer heatwaves and intermittent nuclear power is not much help.This does not affect nuclear power stations in the UK because they draw their water supplies from the sea, which stays relatively cool. However, it may affect plans to build small reactors on a lake in Trawsfynydd, Wales. And it may also reduce some of the UK’s power supplies during the summer.As heatwaves intensify, the flow of electricity from French reactors through the growing number of cross-Channel interconnector cables cannot be relied on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43716fbfda71ce297b03a645f5162b33f94069d7/0_626_1502_901/master/1502.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c94df54148c974a9b231c44a55f385b9","title":"thomasina miers recipe cherry bundt cake","story":"A boozy, fruity bundt cake enhanced by cherries poached in star anise and a sharp lemon drizzleCherries are a summer fruit I find hard to resist, with their scarlet juices and rich, berry flavour. They’re labour-intensive to harvest, which makes them relatively expensive, but they are so special, I think they are worth every penny. You don’t need a huge amount for this almondy bundt cake, but they lend it a beautiful, crimson hue and, of course, give it that delectable cherry taste.Gently poaching the cherries in star anise and kirsch does wonders for their flavour.250g unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus extra for greasing325g plain flour, plus extra for dusting200g fresh cherries, stems removed3 tbsp maple syrup1 star anise, ground in a spice grinder or mortar1 tbsp kirsch (optional)500g caster sugar6 large eggs½ tsp salt¼ tsp almond extract2 tsp baking powder300ml whole milk100g ground almonds1 lemon, finely grated zestFor the drizzle1 lemon, finely grated zest and juice175g icing sugarHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan) 350Fgas 4. Using the butter wrapper (or kitchen towel), thoroughly grease a large bundt tin (or a 26-28cm round cake tin) with butter, then dust generously with flour and shake out the excess.Put the cherries, maple syrup, star anise and kirsch (if using) in a small pan with a splash of water, and simmer for four to five minutes until soft, pressing down on the cherries with a potato masher or wooden spoon to release the stones. Cool slightly, then remove the stones. Whizz the cherries to a puree with a stick blender, then set aside.Beat the sugar and butter in an electric mixer until pale – three to four minutes – then incorporate the eggs one at a time until just mixed in. Next, being careful not to over-beat the mixture, fold in half the flour, the salt, almond extract and baking powder, until just incorporated, then stir in the milk. Fold in the remaining flour, followed by the ground almonds and lemon zest.Spoon a third of the mixture into the cake tin, then spoon over half the cherry puree, swirling it in a little. Top with another third of the cake mixture, and swirl in the remaining cherry puree. Top with the last of the cake mixture, then bake on the middle shelf for 50-60 minutes, or until golden and a skewer inserted into the middle section of the cake comes out clean. Cool in the tin for 15 minutes, then turn out on to a wire rack to cool completely.While the cake is cooling, whisk the lemon zest and juice into the icing sugar to make a pourable drizzle (you may need to add a splash of water). Once the cake is cool, spoon over the icing, allowing the drips to fall down the sides. Serve with a pot of tea and a bowl of whipped cream or creme fraiche.Swirl excess cherry puree through homemade vanilla ice-cream for a special dessert: homemade ice-cream always makes people smile.

Meanwhile, the game’s governing body hit a lowI had to wipe away a few tears as the final whistle blew on Sunday. It was emotional watching friends and former teammates win this World Cup. I understand what it means and I know first-hand the time and effort that every team member put into the end result.I was especially happy for some of the younger players who earned this – as well as the unsung heroes who aren’t in the spotlight and don’t get a lot of attention: Crystal Dunn, Sam Mewis, Kelley O’Hara, Becky Sauerbrunn, and Rose Lavelle. They all played so well during the final and across the entire tournament. You don’t hear a lot about those players but they are the heart and soul of this team.The game changed when the US were awarded the penalty. I wanted to see them score from the run of play, not from a VAR call. But, as it turned out, at 1-0 the game opened up and the Netherlands had to take more risks. The VAR controversy wasn’t whether it was a penalty or not (it was). The bigger issue is Fifa’s lack of respect for the women’s game. We have the fans, we have the viewership, we play quality football, and now it’s time we had respect. That means not testing VAR for the first time ever in women’s football on the biggest stage.VAR first needed to be implemented into women’s leagues around the world so referees could get used to it before a major tournament. VAR had at least been tested in some men’s leagues before being used at Russia 2018. And that’s even before we talk about introducing a lot of new laws at the same event. Women were used as guinea pigs. VAR has been so frustrating throughout this tournament that the Premier League has now said it’s reconsidering how it will implement the system.Lavelle, Dunn and Tobin Heath are my players of the tournament. Rose was a great playmaker, Tobin had inidual brilliance, and nobody could beat Crystal. Being unable to separate those three is one reason why this is the best American side I have ever seen. That doesn’t take anything away from teams of the past. We’ve had great athletes and good physical players like Christie Rampone – probably the fastest defender we ever had on the women’s national team – and Abby Wambach, who had unrivalled goalscoring ability, especially in the air. Yet the technical ability of the current team – from passing to reading the game – is better than any previous US side.How did that happen? Relying on physical players won us tournaments in the past. We used to have only under-16, under-18, and under-21 youth teams but as football grew we have been able to develop the technical ability of players at younger ages. The popularity of soccer in America means it was bound to grow and with better coaching now available for girls, better players have emerged.Still, women’s soccer in America has to be aware of how to remain the best in the world. We have put so much focus on the national team that we have cut corners on the domestic professional league. We want to always win on the biggest stage but countries like Italy, Spain, England, and the Netherlands are fast becoming leaders in player development. It’s incredible how much money has been invested in the Women’s Super League in England and Spain’s Primera Division. You can see how far those countries have come. They will ultimately develop better players than we do in the US unless we reconsider how we approach the big picture. Previously, US teams were competing with our own history. From this point on, we’re competing with the future and with the fact that other nations are quickly catching up.The US is already losing out on bringing more players to the NWSL because many top players want to play in Europe. If the best players in the world don’t want to compete in our domestic professional league, it is going to affect development in America. That should be seen as an exciting challenge for soccer in the United States and put more fire under the American game. We need a stronger US professional league, more financial investment, and better player development. That’s not only an investment in our team’s future success, but it’s also good business. This tournament again proved the market value for women’s football in the US and around the world – unprecedented viewership, packed stadiums, record jersey sales and more.We can’t stand still and let down the young girls watching this team win the 2019 World Cup. We want them to have an equal opportunity to play the game at the highest level and build women’s football to levels we haven’t even come close to yet. We want today’s team to wipe away tears when they watch future generations add more stars to the shirt."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e6c005ee20c1a851cec8df1012b7f12fe8f3691/0_0_2419_1451/master/2419.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7e5e38aa7a871324e2a2f50891885b8","title":"womens world cup 2019 guardian writers highs lows","story":"From kindly taxi drivers to the great goals, games and Megan Rapinoe, our writers tell all about their month in FranceMatch of the tournament England 1-2 USA. Yes, England lost and, on balance, they deserved to be defeated but it was tense and tight and a wonderful advert for the women’s game. An evening when many of those who have long patronised the sport were surely won over, with even the most stubborn refuseniks having to admit that it is rather good after all.Player of the tournament Jill Scott. Admittedly she tired a little as England lost the third-place play-off to Sweden but the midfielder frequently held Phil Neville’s team together. It is no exaggeration to say that, without Scott, the Lionesses may not have reached the final four.Goal of the tournament Lucy Bronze v Norway. An imperious, unerring, first-time, 25-yard strike. The look on the watching David Beckham’s face after he had admired its inexorable trajectory towards the top corner spoke volumes. Personal highlight A tie between a taxi driver who recognised me in Nice airport and rushed over saying “Bonjour madame” and another in Paris who carried my case – at full gallop – to the correct station platform, enabling me to catch a train to Lyon with a minute to spare.Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsBiggest disappointment Cameroon’s appalling behaviour as they lost against England in a game which turned into high farce. It was comedic at times but also a truly dreadful, and depressing, advert for the women’s game. Fondest memory of France The consistent friendliness, politeness and helpfulness of virtually everyone I encountered. As someone who, bar the odd “Je suis désolé”, cannot speak French, that proved refreshingly stereotype-defying.Match of the tournament In terms of atmosphere it has to be France v USA at the Parc des Princes. La Marseillaise sung in full voice at the start was spine-tingling and it was fiery from start to finish. For the match itself? The final, purely because the Netherlands were really impressive at holding the champions at bay for as long as they did, having looked defensively shaky throughout.Player of the tournament It is obviously Megan Rapinoe. Plenty of players had great World Cup tournaments but no one matches the on- and off‑the‑field all-rounder. Using the biggest stage in the world to speak out on the issues she cares about while juggling the pressure to perform that that brings? Incredible. Megan for president.Goal of the tournament Lucy Bronze’s rocket against Norway. It was beautiful. Capping a great performance, the way Bronze waited alone on the edge of the box and powered it into the roof of the net was magical.Personal highlight Too many to choose. The England press pack have been a fantastic bunch to work with, for one. The final week in Lyon was by far the highlight. I got to go beyond the World Cup and take part in the Equal Playing Field World Record five-a-side match (dragging a motley crew from Phil Neville’s press conference to take part too) and then attending and moderating a session at EPF’s Equality Summit – a packed room of stellar influential women in football discussing the game, changes, challenges and more? Absolutely buzzing.Biggest disappointment France. They are experienced at hosting major tournaments but you could be forgiven for thinking this was their first time. There was little hype, at alleged sold-out matches – semi‑finals and final in particular – it was frustrating to see as many empty seats as there were. Staff were overzealous (they confiscated my water because it wasn’t the right sponsor in close to 40C heat) and transport to and from stadiums was a nightmare.Fondest memory of France Given the above … the fondest memories I will take from this tournament are of the people I was working with, the people I was socialising with, the brilliant Football Association communications team and the general playfulness of the England players.Match of the tournament For pure momentum shifting it is hard to look past the Netherlands-Japan last-16 game. The Dutch started the first 30 minutes close to their imperious best but as the second half wore on the Japanese grew exponentially into the contest. Only another late VAR‑bacle could decide the match, one worthy of being played much later in the tournament.Player of the tournament The big names and strikers often scoop the accolades at tournament’s end, but it is the midfield metronomes who best determine their side’s fortunes. When the USA are in trouble it’s the pure tenacity of Julie Ertz that sets the tone, while for the Dutch Sherida Spitse has added four assists to a near flawless display of passing, tempo-control and tackling.Goal of the tournament For team goal, Japan’s against the Dutch – calm, clinical, creative. For feeling, Jamaica’s first World Cup goal – Havana Solaun, only just off the bench, sent brilliantly through by Khadija Shaw and finishing with aplomb.Personal highlight Amid the wreckage of Australia’s Group C opening defeat rose the phoenix of one of the feelgood stories of the Women’s World Cup: Italy. After a 20-year absence Le Azzurre announced their arrival in the women’s game – passionate (Elena Linari’s anthem belting), ruthless (Barbara Bonansea’s cool tournament opener) and cultured (Aurora Galli’s finish against China).Biggest disappointment Germany. There were questions marks over this squad, and injury to the playmaker Dzsenifer Marozsan did not help. Riding their luck in game one as a pacy Chinese side comfortably got in behind should have been the canary in the coalmine, but then came that defensive showing against Sweden to blow the quarter-final.Fondest memory of France After Australia’s “nightmare in Nice” against Norway my tournament was in effect over. To watch in among the crowd, surrounded by 53,000+ others, a game of the intensity, quality and excitement of USA v England was to witness the pure potential of the women’s game. Match of the tournament England’s match against USA. The game had everything: great goals, VAR controversy, a missed penalty and a red card. But at its core the semi-final was a battle of two heavyweights playing some of the best football of the tournament.Player of the tournament Who else but Megan Rapinoe? My respect for her grew tenfold when she fronted the press in the leadup to USA’s blockbuster quarter-final with France. The Twitter spat with Donald Trump was threatening to overshadow the match but, rather than hide from the issue, Rapinoe pre-empted the first question: “I’ll just address it head on and then we can get to the soccer questions. I stand by the comments that I made about not wanting to go to the White House with the exception of the expletive. My mom will be very upset about that.” All class.Goal of the tournament It was perhaps not a goal for the ages but when Havana Solaun collected an incisive through-ball on the break before rounding the Australian goalkeeper Lydia Williams and slotting home, the joyous celebrations of the small contingent of Jamaica fans in Grenoble said everything. For this Caribbean island to reach the tournament against all odds and then score their first World Cup goal – moments such as that make these tournaments special.Personal highlight This is my third major tournament covering my native Australia, having followed the Socceroos at the Confederations Cup and World Cup. In that time, I had yet to see my homeland win. Then, in a comeback for the ages, the Matildas scored three goals in the space of 20 minutes to defeat Brazil. Truly, the miracle in Montpellier.Biggest disappointment While smaller host cities got into the World Cup spirit – Valenciennces deserves a shout-out for its abundant tournament signage – in the larger cities it was hardly obvious that a World Cup was being staged. Fondest memory of France I feel privileged to have had a ringside seat to a tournament that will, I suspect, be remembered as an inflection point for women’s football. The tournament has been far from perfect but over the past four weeks there has been a real sense among players, observers and fans of the significance of this tournament. In a world struggling to redress systemic gender inequality, the rise of women’s football is a force for good. That – and the 21 croissants I consumed – will be my fond memories from France.Match of the tournament Italy 0-1 Brazil in the group stage. From the matches I covered, I always seemed to be in the wrong place, watching the wrong 22 players as another match from the same day brought about 90 scintillating minutes of football as I was left with some dishwater. However, when Italy and Brazil clashed in Valenciennes, it was a rare treat to see both teams so enamoured and keen to attack.Player of the tournament Kosovare Asllani. The one-of-a-kind Swedish No 9 has been kicked up and down the pitches across France, running on fumes and driving ever forward for Blågult this tournament. Having matured an astounding amount between leaving and returning to the Swedish Damallsvenskan, this summer has seen Asllani remind the world just what’s she’s capable of. Goal of the tournament After attending 21 matches, everything has unfortunately rather blurred together but Lana Clelland’s belter against Japan sticks out. Just 12 minutes into her World Cup debut, the Scotland striker was left in space in front of the Japan box with time to pull back and put her laces through the ball. Personal highlight After I arrived at my hotel in Nice only to be told they’d given the room away, I popped up a frustrated tweet and immediately had 10 people message me offering to help. I was tired, sweaty and disgusting in every single way but in that moment I was overwhelmed by the kindness of the women’s football community.Biggest disappointment That almost at every match (before kick off or at half-time) the stadium announcers would encourage everyone in the stands to engage in a Mexican Wave. Wholly unnecessary.Fondest memory of France When I finally got to say goodbye to the Murder Basement when I left Paris to travel down to Lyon. It will not be missed.Match of the tournament The Brazil v Australia group stage game. With Australia desperately needing a result to keep their knockout stage aspirations alive coupled with the fermenting rivalry between the two sides, this game had everything: spikiness, a comeback victory and a dash of VAR controversy.Player of the tournament Megan Rapinoe. Partly because in games where the US haven’t looked as convincing as the standards they have set for themselves might demand, she’s been the player to pull them through. But also for how, with her candidness and her determination to use her platform and profile to consistently draw attention to the contexts and issues which affect the women’s game. So in that sense too she really has been the player of the tournament, a figure really transcending the sport.Goal of the tournament Lucy Bronze v Norway. What a way to cap off a personal performance par excellence in that quarter final.Personal highlight Seeing how this tournament has engaged people who ordinarily wouldn’t have bothered with football, and has helped to reframe how they see the game. I got chatting to a bloke who, after hearing I was in France for the World Cup, started to reply with “Speaking as a man…” (I inhaled and braced myself for a potentially awkward interaction) “…who has previously had no interest in football at all because of the theatrics and nonsense in the men’s game, I’ve really enjoyed the last few weeks and have been making the effort to watch the games” (I exhaled and relaxed into the conversation thereafter).Biggest disappointment The difficulty of watching games if you couldn’t be physically at the stadium, particularly for the early stages. Not having games on free-to-air TV, and the reticence of many bars in host cities to show games unless prompted, particularly in the group stages, made seeing some games unnecessarily difficult and gave off the feeling that the World Cup was being tolerated rather than embraced in the way that the men’s tournament would be.Fondest memory of France It’s difficult to go beyond the camaraderie and generosity of spirit of the fan groups and football communities coming together. For New Zealand’s opener against the Netherlands I found myself sitting in a very Netherlands-filled section of Stade Océane a lone Kiwi in an Oranje sea. No matter. “If you lose, you have some shoulders to cry on,” one told me before kick off, and we commiserated at the final whistle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62beaf9c1a5fd8c256ddb59246b9dda8f839f83b/0_297_5472_3285/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19e227d7c5a22d04b73ad854ad3aea73","title":"were you and your partner married by a loved one in an unofficial ceremony","story":"Who did you choose to conduct your ceremony and why?

But how often should it be done, and what’s the best way to use conditioner?The biggest myth is that washing your hair frequently is bad, but there is no real rationale for that. You take your hair everywhere you go it picks up dirt and pollution, and you’ve got sweat, oil and dead skin cells. You can wash it every day if you want to. You are not stripping the natural oils from your hair, because they do not travel from the scalp down the hair shaft, especially if your hair is damaged or colour-processed. Physiologically, all hair is the same. The difference is in the shape of the strands.Although there has been a trend for washing only with conditioner, generally you do need to use shampoos. They contain a surfactant, which is designed to hold in dirt and oils that can then be rinsed from the hair.Get your hair thoroughly wet. If you wash your hair twice and the shampoo seems to lather better on the second time, it’s because your hair is properly wet. A 50p-sized amount of shampoo is enough for most people. Wash the scalp rather than the hair and allow the suds to run down. If you are washing your hair every day, you do not need to shampoo it twice. If you are washing twice a week, or if your hair gets very greasy or you use a lot of styling products, you might want to do it a second time.Afro hair is more susceptible to damage and dryness, but you can wash it as frequently as suits your hair – at least once a week. If you have short hair, you may not need conditioner, but if your hair is longer, you should use it, particularly if it is colour-treated. Conditioner hydrates and smooths down the outer cuticle, but just put it on the mid-lengths and the ends.Zoë Passam, trichologist at Philip Kingsley, was speaking to Emine Saner"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f30a9fa00e3556274f3af548074b739e95f6e3f0/0_214_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5bc5b3faced6a50177b9295ef61052a6","title":"labour plans ban leaseholds new build homes","story":"Party says it would end ‘feudal system’ in overhaul of property ownership rules in EnglandLabour has set out plans to ban the sale of new private leasehold houses and flats in an overhaul of property ownership rules that could slash the costs for homeowners of buying their freeholds.The shadow housing secretary, John Healey, said the proposals would end exploitative practices by freeholds, “from rip-off ground rents, to punitive fees to onerous contract conditions stating what they can and can’t do to their own homes”.The government has already announced it will axe leaseholds on all new-build houses, though it is not clear when the measures will formally take effect. However, the Labour policy also proposes a ban on the sale of new leasehold flats by the end of the Labour government’s first term, a substantially larger number of homes.At least 4.3 million homes across England are owned on a leasehold basis. For a property in England priced at £250,000 with a 90-year lease, Labour says its proposals could mean the cost of buying the freehold is slashed from over £10,000 to £2,500.There have been cases where buyers have discovered that their ground rent doubles every 10 or 15 years, including one example of a Birmingham flat owner who discovered her ground rent was not £250 a year, as she had believed, but was now £8,000 a year and would keep doubling so that in 95 years it would be £8m.“Leasehold is a symbol of our broken housing system, with millions of England’s homeowners feeling like they’ve bought their home but still don’t own it,” Healey said.“We need a revolution in rights for leaseholders. This consultation document sets out the next Labour government’s ambition to end the broken leasehold model for good.”The shadow housing minister, Sarah Jones, said leaseholders often had the odds stacked against them. “England is one of the only places in the world which has failed to move away from this feudal system,” she said.One leasehold flat owner, Jay Beeharry, told the authors of the report he had been charged £50,000 in fees over four years after buying a modest two-bedroom flat in London. “I have lost thousands of pounds, significant time, life and equity in my leasehold flat that I have been unable to sell. I have been threatened with forfeiture of my home,” he said.“Residents tried to challenge the freeholder four times in tribunals – where in one case we were told repair costs had risen from £79,000 to £525,000 and another case where repairs had risen further to £600,000. I discovered an invoice which showed residents had been charged £72,000 for part of the works which only cost £21,500.”Martin Boyd, the chair of the campaign group Leasehold Knowledge Partnership, said the proposals were well thought through and signalled a political consensus was building on the issue.“It’s likely to give a lot more certainty to leaseholders knowing where they stand. The reality is that developers are finding it harder to sell leasehold houses anyway and that market has almost collapsed. But the commitment to end leasehold flats within the first term of a Labour government is excellent,” he said.He said there were still “huge issue with existing right-to-buy properties”, including leaseholders who had purchased former council homes being hit with huge bills. Earlier this year, 20 leaseholders in Southwark, south London, received estimated bills of up to £151,000 each for the regeneration of the estate where they had bought their homes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcfe59549992952d27c14827702c2b324bac4ff1/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1004c36ecf49815729edcbe6d936ff83","title":"a sneaker peek behind the scenes at new balance","story":"Since 1982, New Balance has produced its flagship 990s at one of two US factories. We take a look at the craftsmanship that goes into each trainer at the site in MassachusettsFew trainers can claim a fanbase as erse as that of the New Balance 990 series. The first trainer to cost $100 when it was released in 1982, it was a performance running shoe that was eventually embraced for its nerdy dad look (the late Steve Jobs was a fan), while also acquiring street cred in Baltimore and DC. Meanwhile, the 990v4, which was released in 2016, popped up at fashion shows while being name checked by rappers such as Meek Mill and Lil Yachty.Each pair of 990v5s takes three hours to make they’re constructed from more than 30 different components and are handled by more than 30 workers. Tejada is the leader of the “closing” team, which puts the final touches on the shoe – hand-sewing the leather and suede in the heel. She’s been sewing at New Balance for 31 years, and first put needle to thread when she was a nine-year-old girl under the watchful eye of her mother, who was a seamstress in the Dominican Republic, where Tejada grew up.“I have sewn all my life. This is my pride,” she says. “When I’m sewing, I am happy – I am doing what I learned, with high quality. No run-off. Clean lines, everything where it needs to be.”Eric Vassall, the senior product manager at New Balance in charge of the 990 series, believes the craftsmanship and experience that workers such as Tejada bring to bear is part of what has made the shoe appeal to so many distinct markets.“I’ve been here 19 years and you see generation after generation after generation. So you have the mother who has been here that taught the daughter, who had taught the son,” he says.And at New Balance, the workers don’t just make the shoes – they are also integrated into the design process. This is only possible because, unlike most of its competitors, New Balance both manufactures and designs the bulk of its trainers in the same offices. This means that instead of emails going back and forth across different time zones, workers can give designers and engineers direct feedback in person.For Vassall, the fact that his team only works a few floors above the production line has been crucial. It allows them to make quick adjustments and, ultimately, produce a better product.“I would say for the latest version of the 990, the 990v5, we always would come downstairs and talk to the craftspeople and say: ‘Hey, what’s working, what’s not working?’”Jesse Plouffe, the product developer who worked on the 990v5, says workers like Tejada have made him better at his job.“They’re experts. I can’t tell them how to stitch the shoe. I have no idea how to stitch it. I know what I want to do, but they are experts and the value they add is incredible,” he says.And the atmosphere on the line embodies that spirit of collaboration. The workers move quickly – they each have just 22.5 seconds to complete their task – but still find moments to greet each other warmly.Luis Puello, a 51-year-old leather cutter, carefully runs his hands across a sheet of pig’s hide, looking for defects that he marks with a laser before a machine makes a cut. Over the years, he says, he has developed a better feel for the leather, quickly sensing which parts will function best in different areas of the shoe.He smiles when asked what he thinks about the 990s that he helps make every day. “When the job is done, you see what you’ve done, and you feel proud,” he says.New Balance’s 990v5s are available at the New Balance London flagship store or newbalance"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a76d80e489963ae45bcb555f88ec2b9a863a7ace/150_355_3108_1865/master/3108.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=262f7d605e02781db0703192ab9b5fd8","title":"what really happens to the waste in your recycling bin podcast","story":"Recycling is often cited as one of the easiest ways to make a difference to the environment.

Both failed to get elected because of the Liberal Democrat surge in the capital.Labour sources said the party would favour a minority ethnic candidate and could aim to produce an all-BAME shortlist. Others who have been tipped for the seat include İbrahim Doğuş, a Kurdish entrepreneur and founder of the annual Kebab Awards, and Florence Eshalomi, a member of the London assembly.Eshalomi is also believed to be also considering a run for Labour in Streatham, where the current MP, Chuka Umunna, has defected to the Lib Dems.She campaigned in 2016 with Nigel Farage’s Grassroots Out, including posing with the then Ukip leader on a boat on the Thames. Local anger grew when Hoey put her name to an amendment to the customs bill put forward by the pro-Brexit European Research Group (ERG) ruling out a customs border in the Irish Sea.She was one of four Labour MPs to support the government in defeating an amendment calling for a post-Brexit customs union. Hoey did not support Theresa May’s Brexit deal on the grounds that it was too soft.Though the no-confidence motion had no force, Hoey might have faced a reselection battle in her constituency after rule changes last September made it easier for members to force a trigger ballot, which would require an MP to compete against other candidates for reselection.The seat has a 20,250 Labour majority but has been heavily targeted by the Liberal Democrats because of Hoey’s Brexit views, meaning the constituency party is likely to select a candidate with pro-remain credentials.In a surprise move on Monday, the former shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg also said he would stand down. Twigg, the MP for Liverpool West Derby, who was on the shadow frontbench under Ed Miliband, wrote to his constituents saying he wanted to seek new opportunities outside parliament.In his letter, Twigg stressed the importance of Labour remaining a “broad church” and keeping “an open and respectful culture”. He wrote: “I have spent most of the past 30 years of my life as an elected representative. As I approach my mid-50s I want to have the opportunity to take on something new.”Stephen Pound, the veteran MP for Ealing North, has told his local party he will stand down. Three other MPs who have either backed May’s Brexit deal or opposed efforts for a second referendum have already announced they will stand down: Poplar and Limehouse’s Jim Fitzpatrick, Rother Valley’s Kevin Barron and Blyth Valley’s Ronnie Campbell."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4eec1a7043878994673828356aa6a5a1ff714597/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb350e32573d13eae1963882ea7f8579","title":"unions agree labour should back remain second referendum brexit","story":"Party poised to announce move in surprise consensus but will still seek deal if elected in timeLabour is poised to declare it will campaign for remain in a second referendum on any deal put to parliament by a Conservative prime minister, after trade union leaders including Unite’s Len McCluskey backed a change of policy.The joint position agreed by the unions on Monday would not commit Labour to an explicitly pro-remain position in all circumstances: unions also agreed Labour should seek to deliver a Brexit deal if the party won an election before the UK left the EU.That Labour deal would also be put to a public vote, but the party would not commit to campaigning for remain against its own Brexit deal, throwing into doubt what Labour would offer in any snap election manifesto.One senior shadow cabinet source described it as a significant win for remain campaigners, despite the potential lack of clarity.“Unions have backed a referendum on any deal this parliament and Labour campaigning for remain – that’s a big victory. What’s in a manifesto is a debate for another day,” the source said.Barring any major intervention, the surprise consensus among trade unions including Unite, GMB, Unison, Aslef and Usdaw is likely to force any remaining sceptics to agree to the new position when the shadow cabinet meets on Tuesday.Several shadow cabinet sources said the policy had the hallmarks of being approved by the Labour leader’s office and said it “would not be watered down” – though some shadow ministers are likely to push for an even stronger position.Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, who has regularly clashed with Jeremy Corbyn over the party’s Brexit position, tweeted: “Remain is who we are. Our values are remain, our hearts are remain. Today is a step in the right direction but members and supporters are clear that any kind of Brexit gives us less than we have now and Labour should not support it.”Union leaders had met on Monday to agree a common position on Labour’s Brexit policy, in a meeting one source described as fractious but ultimately consensual.The proposed policy, which will be offered to the Labour leadership as the unanimous view of the unions, will say:A senior Labour source said Corbyn had not been present at the meeting but suggested it was a helpful outcome. “Jeremy has been working to unite the party and the wider Labour movement around a common position,” the source said.Union sources close to the talks said they did not want the position to be presented as an out-and-out victory for remain campaigners, saying the party would still have a chance to tell leave voters it would honour the result of the 2016 referendum by negotiating a Brexit deal if in government.“Ultimately everybody just wants this to end,” one union source said. “It would be an error to let this drag on until conference and have the battle on the conference floor. But it is right to reserve the position on a Labour-negotiated Brexit deal which could deliver the result of the 2016 referendum. It would be mad to say we would negotiate a deal and then campaign against it.”One union source said the meeting had been lengthy but amicable and its purpose had been to find a consensus. “We are pleased and confident that everything is on the right road,” the source said.A briefing war has erupted over the past few weeks as some shadow cabinet ministers suggested senior Corbyn aides and union figures such as McCluskey were preventing the party moving to an explicitly pro-remain position or championing the change in party policy.On Sunday, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, denied claims he had been urging Corbyn to sack his two most senior aides, Karie Murphy and Seumas Milne, because they were opposed to Labour committing to backing remain in a second referendum.Labour had already shifted its Brexit stance to propose that any Brexit deal passed by parliament should be put to the people in a second referendum, after the party suffered heavy losses to the pro-remain Liberal Democrats at the local and European elections.Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, had previously said publicly she was “beginning to worry” about party policy not being sufficiently pro-remain.Labour MPs at a private meeting of parliamentarians on Monday night expressed some caution about the new policy.“It is not exactly the absolute clarity we were hoping for,” one MP said. “It sounds like we are reserving the right to campaign for remain against our own Brexit deal – that will just sound ludicrous to voters.”The party came under attack for the policy from both sides of the Brexit ide as the trade union agreement emerged. The Conservatives called it “an attempt to frustrate Brexit and ignore the democratic mandate to deliver it”.The Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman, Tom Brake, said: “Even now, after millions of remainers have deserted them, Labour manage only a fudge.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7312b82017c1a1db63ba04b3c0da56628c13276/23_611_4427_2656/master/4427.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d01257516671203ee78a9e2363a0d8e3","title":"home office applies good character test to children as young as 10","story":"Human rights committee says children who have grown up in UK are being denied citizenshipChildren who have grown up in Britain are being deprived of their right to citizenship because of the “heavy-handed” approach taken by immigration officials, a parliamentary committee has said.The “good character” test is being applied so strictly that it is even affecting youngsters who have no criminal convictions, according to the joint committee on human rights (JCHR).The committee’s report, which scrutinises the government’s proposed changes to the British Nationality Act 1981, raises concerns about immigration control practices.A police caution or minor offence could mean that a child who has grown up in the UK may be denied British citizenship, the MPs and peers warned.The study follows a report in the  last year based on freedom of information requests, which found that on average one child a week has had their application rejected over the last five years.Campaigners estimated that as many as 400 children had been denied citizenship for failing to satisfy the good character requirement since it was introduced in 2006.The committee investigation noted that during the past decade “good character requirements have been extended to apply to children who are entitled to be British citizens due to their close connection with the UK”.The report said: “It is inappropriate to apply the good character requirement to young children with a right to be British, where the United Kingdom is the only country they know and where they have grown up their whole lives here.”Evidence heard by the committee showed that good character tests affected children as young as 10 who had lived all their lives in the UK.MPs and peers were also critical of the high fees charged for applications, which can cost up to four figures. “This means the government is asking children for fees that are more than three times the cost recovery for processing such an application,” the committee said. “The committee is concerned that disproportionately high fees could risk excluding children from more vulnerable socio-economic backgrounds from accessing their rights.”The Home Office is urged to review its proposed changes to the law and act “without delay” to ensure a fair, non-discriminatory approach to UK nationality law.“The application of good character requirements to children raises concerns that the rights of the child – and in particular the requirement that the best interests of the child be a primary consideration – are not being respected in the application of nationality law to children living in the UK,” the study said.Cuts to legal aid have compounded the problem. “It is now harder than ever for iniduals to obtain the advice they need to be able to access justice and enforce their human rights,” the committee concluded.“This can be all the more important relating to citizenship rights as these touch upon the very identity of a person and their rights to live in the country where they were born, have grown up and with which they identify and have their cultural links and identity.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/263ea1207d72b4ca400d00c3def9cad8773c8237/0_159_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=830d672d8298dcd7dcadcc36a64e409d","title":"cockatoo choreographs his own dance moves researchers believe","story":"New study of Snowball the prancing parrot points to bird at peak of his creative powersWhen Snowball the sulphur-crested cockatoo revealed his first dance moves a decade ago he became an instant sensation. The foot-tapping, head-bobbing bird boogied his way on to TV talkshows and commercials and won an impressive internet audience.But that was merely the start. A new study of the prancing parrot points to a bird at the peak of his creative powers. In performances conducted from the back of an armchair, Snowball pulled 14 distinct moves – a repertoire that would put many humans to shame.Footage of Snowball in action shows him smashing Another One Bites the Dust by Queen and Cyndi Lauper’s Girls Just Wanna Have Fun with a dazzling routine of head-bobs, foot-lifts, body-rolls, poses and headbanging. In one move, named the Vogue, Snowball moves his head from one side of a lifted foot to another.“We were amazed,” said Aniruddh Patel, a psychology professor at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts. “There are moves in there, like the Madonna Vogue move, that I just can’t believe.”“It seems that dancing to music isn’t purely a product of human culture. The fact that we see this in another animal suggests that if you have a brain with certain cognitive and neural capacities, you are predisposed to dance,” he added.It all started, as some things must, with the Backstreet Boys. In 2008, Patel, who has long studied the origins of musicality, watched a video on the internet of Snowball dancing in time to the band’s track Everybody. He contacted Irena Schulz, who owned the bird shelter where Snowball lived, and with her soon launched a study of Snowball’s dancing prowess.While some animals can be trained to move in response to music, Patel suspected that anticipating the beat and moving in time was a skill unique to “vocal learners”. Unlike cats, dogs and monkeys, which are born with innate sounds, vocal learners such as parrots, dolphins and elephants, can learn an array of sounds based on what they hear in the environment.Not all vocal learners are destined to be dancers, however. Patel suspects a number of factors have to come together for an animal to get into the groove, including an ability to learn complex sequences of actions and form long-term social bonds. Dolphins are a good contender, but Patel is not overly optimistic. “They may not spend enough time bonding with dancing humans to develop dancing themselves,” he said.The first study showed that Snowball indeed anticipated the beat, bobbing his head and stomping his feet in time to the music. He kept on the beat when the music was slowed down and speeded up, his only encouragement being verbal praise from the sidelines.After the research, Schulz noticed that Snowball was experimenting with new moves. That piqued Patel’s interest: it suggested that the beat was not simply triggering Snowball to make stock moves, but that he was choosing which moves to make.Writing in Current Biology, the scientists describe how they filmed Snowball dancing to the Queen and Cyndi Lauper tracks three times. Joanne Jao Keehn, a cognitive neuroscientist and trained dancer on the team, then used frame-by-frame analysis to note all the moves he made. While Snowball had danced to the tracks with his owner before, her style is apparently rather limited, suggesting the parrot may have drawn on his own interpretation of the music.“He has this incredible repertoire. His movements to music are amazingly erse,” Patel said.“His owner dances – and she is the first to admit it – by nodding her head and waving her arms, so it’s quite plausible that some of these moves are things he came up with himself.”As impressive as the display was, Snowball didn’t always hit the beat with some of his more elaborate moves. But Patel suspects there is good reason for that. “He seemed to be trying out all these moves, so synchronisation perhaps wasn’t his initial concern.”With Snowball living in a bird shelter, Patel concedes that there’s a chance an enthusiastic dancer paid a visit and influenced the parrot’s creative process. But even that would be an impressive feat for a parrot, Patel said. “It’s either imitation, which is sophisticated enough or it’s actual creativity, which is incredibly interesting.”The researchers are now exposing Snowball to Billy Idol’s Dancing With Myself to see if he dances when there is no one in the room to offer encouragement. “We are testing that now,” Patel said. “People are fine listening to music on their own, but when it comes to dancing, people want to do that with friends rather than put music on in their living room and dance by themselves. We’ll see if Snowball is the same.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad33672eb139cee9e6b45e1ebcd2792fb4f49cdd/0_0_4840_2905/master/4840.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=000b4aaaa1749c44204a40821a98357f","title":"how secondhand drinking ruins lives every family has been touched by this","story":"Helen Witty thought she had taught her children all about the dangers of drinking. She was raised with the knowledge that her great-grandfather’s alcoholism had led him to suicide. “It’s in the family,” her mother warned her. In a classic expression of the ripple effect of harmful drinking, Witty kept her own consumption modest. And she taught her two children to understand and to be careful of the long shadow cast by other people’s drinking.But what none of the family had prepared for was the day when Helen Marie, Witty’s 16-year-old daughter, stood in the drive of their Florida home wearing her skates she wanted to destress before a big school play. She flipped around, blew her mother a kiss and said she would be right back.She didn’t return. When her father went to look for her, he found a crime scene. Helen Marie had been hit while skating on a bike path by a 17-year-old driver who had been drinking tequila and smoking cannabis. Instead of bringing his daughter home, her father had to identify her body.Helen Marie was killed by another person’s abuse of alcohol in a tragic example of so-called secondhand drinking. While the concept of secondhand, or passive, smoking is familiar, secondhand drinking is a growing field of study. Last week, the Alcohol Research Group at the Public Health Institute in Emeryville, California, published research showing that 53 million Americans each year experience harm from another inidual’s alcohol use. That is one in four men, and one in five women. Given that passive smoking is treated as a serious public health hazard in countries from Mongolia to Colombia, Australia to the UK, why are governments so slow to notice, let alone challenge, secondhand drinking?“Secondhand smoking really changed public opinion and paved the way for legislation to make bars and public places smoke-free,” says Sir Ian Gilmore, the chair of the Alcohol Health Alliance and the director of the Liverpool Centre for Alcohol Research. “There is undoubtedly harm from secondhand smoke, but the range and magnitude of harms is likely to be even greater from alcohol.”“We are only just starting to appreciate the long-term impact of these harms,” adds Katherine Karriker-Jaffe, a senior scientist at the Alcohol Research Group in the US, and the author of the research published last week. Her team worked with 10 categories of harm, from harassment to assault. Although she cannot recall experiencing any secondhand harm herself, she is something of an anomaly because, as Gilmore points out: “There is hardly a family that hasn’t been touched in some way, whether it’s a child of an alcoholic or someone who has been punched on a night out. There are so many examples it is genuinely unusual to come across a family where someone hasn’t been affected by alcohol.”Often, the effects of alcohol use can ripple from one life into another. All too easily, a person who suffers a secondary harm can become a perpetrator of further harms.Sam is the birth mother of a child with foetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). When she was pregnant, her then partner had a problem with alcohol. “It was an abusive relationship,” she says. “I struggled with what was going on. When you’re in that part of your life where everything is overwhelming …” She trails off. She drank on average a bottle of wine a week, with “the odd binge”.Sam’s son was nine and had repeatedly been excluded from mainstream school when he was finally diagnosed with partial FAS (foetal alcohol syndrome). “When the paediatrician confirmed my fears, I broke down and cried,” Sam says. “You have to come to terms with the fact that you harmed your child. You gave your child brain damage. There is a massive part of you that just wants to block it out. But you can’t. You have to live it, day in, day out.”Sam’s long list of her son’s symptoms, which include sleep issues, manic behaviours, depression and low social maturity, is balanced by an equally long list of what she appreciatively calls his “highest qualities”: his creativity, his IT skills, his loyalty to friends and “massive heart”. She is clearly a loving, attentive mother who is highly attuned to her son’s needs. At some point, when her little boy has sufficient emotional maturity and stability, she will need to muster all of those qualities to explain to him his diagnosis.It is the ultimate discharge of maternal responsibility, but Sam worries that the disclosure may take her away “as his one safe person. This is what secondary alcohol use has created in my family,” she says.Even when a person harmed by secondary drinking acts to intercept the repercussions, the psychological impact can be inescapable. In 2014, Jabz Musinga’s father died after falling into the River Aire in Leeds. It took several weeks for his body to surface, but Jabz, 25, knew what had happened as soon as she saw the security video of her dad walking drunkenly beside the water.The certainty must have felt strange, because she had spent her childhood “on tenterhooks”. What she had witnessed in her own home, her father’s behaviour, “carried into my adult life, trickled into my dating life”, she says. “I had low standards of what to expect from a guy, and even from friends. People easily took advantage of me.”She soon found herself in an abusive relationship. “It was very brief. I put my foot down straightaway. It was like two weeks and I said: ‘This is not going to work.’” She was thankful, she says, that she was “able to stop” – which suggests that she may also have been able to continue. It took a particular conviction to intercede.“It was very hard to say: ‘I’ve been affected by someone else’s drinking,’” Jabz says. “The focus tends to be on people who have addictions,” not those around them. But she has no doubt that alcohol changed her. “It shaped my personality. I would be a completely different person if it hadn’t happened. I do think about it, once in a while – the person I would have been,” she says, as if a ghost self shadows her. “I think I would have been more confident. Maybe a better person.”Jabz sounds adjusted and happy in her life, but that last note of self-rebuke recalls the words of the MP Liam Byrne, another child of an alcoholic father and a patron for the National Association for Children of Alcoholics (NACOA), a charity that Jabz volunteers for. “You don’t know what’s normal, so you construct these perfect templates of what you think good looks like,” he says.Self-medicating with perfectionism, Byrne wrote “long lists of attributes” to live up to – “a blueprint for being a superhuman with super powers”. He is 48 now. How old was he when he wrote his last list? He sighs heavily. “Forty-three? Forty-four?”“People say that if you smoke you harm others, but with alcohol you only harm yourself,” says Amy, 30. She vehemently disagrees. Her sister began to drink in her early 20s – just “having a wild weekend”, as medical staff initially described it to the family. Within seven years, she died of heart failure. “Anyone else who had a terminal illness would have an abundance of understanding from friends, colleagues. But you don’t have that support,” Amy says. “In fact, you don’t have the ability to talk about it without stigma.”She is not alone. The day after we speak, Karriker-Jaffe emails to say that she would like to alter her answer about her own experience of secondhand drinking. “I watched an extended family member struggle with an alcohol use disorder that I believe eventually contributed to her death,” she says. “I think about her often in relation to this work.” Karriker-Jaffe adds that she is unsure why she did not mention this on the phone. “Stigma, I suppose.”Her revelation, as an expert in this field, suggests that alcohol abuse, and the harms of secondhand drinking, need to be destigmatised in order for its scale to be properly confronted. In the UK, it is widely seen as deplorable to smoke in the company of children – but even the most conscientious parents display few qualms about drinking. Does it matter, for instance, if children see a parent habitually reach for a glass of wine to de-stress? Byrne laughs drily. “It does, yeah. Because you need to be able to model self-care.”“We need to reframe what we believe is problem drinking,” agrees Josh Connolly, a life, leadership and performance coach who has experienced secondhand drinking as the child of an alcoholic parent, and as an alcoholic parent himself. “I say: come away from quantity and how often you are doing it. Because if your children know you get them to bed, get the wine out, have one glass of wine and relax, what they see is that they can’t help you relax: you go and get a glass of wine. It’s about the behaviours, the feelings that alcohol use creates.”Twelve-step programmes, including that of Alcoholics Anonymous, helped Connolly eliminate alcohol from his life. But, in his sober years, he has found that his presence can make drinkers feel uncomfortable in their relationship with alcohol – and this, he thinks, is where everyone who enjoys alcohol could benefit from some self-appraisal.“The strange thing, as somebody who is seven and a half years sober, is that I now face more stigma from society for not drinking than I did as a dad who drank,” he says. No doubt this reluctance to examine our relationship with alcohol helps to make secondhand drinking so hard to acknowledge. As he says: “Society doesn’t have a line to cross on this. So how is an inidual going to have one?”Maybe it is time to explore not only the ways in which we have, as iniduals, experienced a secondhand harm from alcohol – but also those in which we may have perpetrated one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c370e88560fd8b6c2fe4ac2611d54a247bb416e7/0_0_3960_2376/master/3960.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9279cec1b162bdd57116c08be12b36b5","title":"australia england world cup semi final","story":"• Justin Langer’s squad ‘pour hearts out’ in team-building session• Handscomb may replace Khawaja Woakes and Roy set to playIf defeat by South Africa brought Australia down to earth then their coach, Justin Langer, appears keen they remain there, having sat his players down for some barefoot storytelling before their World Cup semi-final.The blockbuster with England at Edgbaston on Thursday will be the seventh time Australia have vied for a place in a men’s World Cup final and having progressed each time – including the famous tie with South Africa here in 1999 – it is well-charted territory for cricketers in canary yellow.Nevertheless, Langer was keen the current generation – bundled into the supposedly trickier second semi-final by a 10-run defeat to Faf du Plessis and co at Old Trafford on Saturday – went the extra mile in familiarising themselves with their surroundings in Birmingham.Before nets on Monday Langer ordered the squad and coaching staff to whip off their shoes and socks for a spot of “earthing” on the outfield – a practice that the Australian website Barefoot Healing claims will help to “normalise the body’s biological rhythms”.After a lap of the boundary, they sat in a circle to share stories about their World Cup dreams, something Peter Handscomb, their newly arrived middle-order batsman, fancied will benefit them.“It was nice,” said Handscomb, who could make his first World Cup appearance in place of Usman Khawaja, who has a hamstring injury. “You get a feel of the grass on your feet, a bit of grounding, the positive and negative energy flowing through and coming out of the earth.“It was just an open and honest conversation and it was great that some of the guys poured their heart out there about what it meant to get to the semi-final.”Earthing is claimed to “accelerate recovery from intense athletic activity” but whether it helps Marcus Stoinis, the all-rounder whose side strain flared up against South Africa, remains to be seen. Mitchell Marsh, who like Handscomb has been in the country on Australia’s A tour, is on standby.Handscomb was actually the replacement for Shaun Marsh following the latter’s broken arm last week, with Australia yet to officially swap out Khawaja. The in-form Matthew Wade, among those feeling the grass between his toes, could also step up when the medical staff make their final decisions on Tuesday.“Each to their own,” replied a slightly bemused Joe Root when told of Australia’s barefoot session. “They can prepare how they want. We will make sure we are ready in our own way.”Root was one of only four England players to bat at their voluntary net session on Monday, with Eoin Morgan, Jos Buttler and Moeen Ali outnumbered by support staff. Chris Woakes and Jason Roy also undertook some outfield sprints but England insisted these were not fitness tests on their respective knee and hamstring problems, just regular aerobic work.Beyond the coach, Trevor Bayliss, sporting a new sun hat after his car was broken into the over the weekend and kit was pinched, it was notable that two left-arm net bowlers were drafted in for this early tune-up.After all, Mitchell Starc and Jason Behrendorff shared nine wickets when Australia won the group game between these sides at Lord’s a fortnight ago. But despite that result, Australia’s Nathan Lyon has subsequently claimed the World Cup is “England’s to lose”.Root, one of five English centurions in the tournament, knows all about the off-spinner’s public pronouncements after he spoke of “ending careers” before the 2017-18 Ashes.“Nathan has a lot to say, a lot of the time, so you take it with a pinch of salt,” Root said. “It might be a way of taking pressure off himself and his team. We know what we need to do to perform well. If that clicks, we will be a force to play against.”England have not beaten Australia in a World Cup since 1992, the last campaign in which they ended up as finalists. If they deliver on Root’s words and break this run of four successive defeats, it will certainly blow a few socks off."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8ac0c77a6f996b454e8198470f36d8b04fc63d8/0_38_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=27becc759955a3dbb1c6291b6a4276cf","title":"coco gauff johanna konta florida family","story":"As Coco Gauff’s Wimbledon dream drew to an agonising close, the chants rang out. “We are proud of you, say we are proud of you,” filled the air of the Paradise Sports Lounge in Delray Beach, the drinking establishment owned by her father, Corey.Family and friends packed this little spot in a typical Florida strip mall hoping to witness another landmark moment in Gauff’s meteoric rise. Paradise has never seen anything quite like it. Indeed, it’s normally closed on a Monday.Yet here we were, at 9am and with the sun already blazing, as more than 100 people crammed in, giddy with excitement and hope. Perhaps it was the mimosas and breakfast burritos kindly donated by Lee Cohen, a local lawyer who was aghast to learn nothing special had been organised for Gauff’s latest monumental moment. “I called her aunt on Sunday night and told her we had to do something,” he said.Coffee, breakfast fare and something a little stronger were all on offer with Aunty Joi Grant running the show, thanking everyone profusely for giving up their Monday mornings for the chance to witness something truly special.Family members, led by Coco’s grandmother, Yvonne Odom, packed a top table while locals and assorted others gazed up at the action being beamed in from London. With some of the family originating from New Orleans, good luck beads were handed out.“I have been wearing them for every round,” said Daisy Odom-Fulton, a great aunt. “But there’s also someone high above looking out for Coco.”Seven news crews had set up shop, keeping an eager eye on events while photographers fixed attention on her excitable grandmother, who whooped and cheered with every point won from Gauff’s racket. Her 11-year-old brother, Cody, excitedly shook a cowbell. “The attention she is getting is crazy,” he said.The Gauffs are a true sporting family – Corey was a reputable college baseball and tennis player, her mother, Candi, was a gymnast and Cody has a big baseball tournament coming up in Birmingham, Alabama, this week. “There’s a lot going on right now,” said Yvonne without a hint of understatement.Gauff was visibly nervous early on as Halep, the former world No 1, began to assert herself and broke in the opening game.Paradise, however, continued to keep the faith. “You go girl,” roared Yvonne as her granddaughter began to show signs of life.Serena Williams has been fined $10,000 (£8,000) for an incident on the eve of the tournament at Wimbledon, when she threw a racket and damaged one of the outside courts where players are allowed to practice. The American has won about 40 times that amount so far, by reaching the quarter-finals of the singles and the second round of the mixed doubles with Andy Murray, but it is an embarrassment for her in the middle of what has been a successful tournament and one full of promise.Other fines handed out included $3,000 to Fabio Fognini, for saying during his third-round defeat that he wished a bomb would hit Wimbledon. In 2014, the Italian was fined $27,500 for a series of acts, including damaging a court.Nick Kyrgios has been fined a total\u0026nbspof $8,000 for incidents in his first‑ and second-round matches.\u0026nbspThe first set slipped away but hope flickered. After all, Gauff had so memorably recovered from a set down in the previous round against Polona Hercog. “Look what happened last time,” said another great aunt, Brenda Lee‑Williams, watching on nervously.Another break by the Romanian came at the start of the second but Gauff, who arrived at Wimbledon ranked 313 in the world but will now rise into the top 150, fought back and began to ask the former French Open champion some questions.“It’s amazing what she is doing out there,” beamed her former mentor Dennis Murray. “What a learning experience for her.”It was, however, not to be. When she saved two match points, the bar erupted once more – though Halep’s quality eventually shone through. The disappointment was obvious yet the heartwarming love and admiration for this local girl made good was unmistakable.Her life will never be the same. The talk of multimillion-dollar sponsorship deals and a push to become a grand-slam champion have put paid to that. Her beloved grandmother Yvonne, however, wasn’t so sure.“I am so proud, but I always have been proud of her,” she said after texting her granddaughter a simple “You’re the best and we love you” message.“Look at what Coco has done, look around. The family have always known about what she could be capable of and now the world knows too. Our pastor at the local church has started a series of sermons called ‘the Coco factor’. It’s all about perseverance and believing in yourself.“She won’t have changed, though. We won’t let her change, we are grounded. She will still clean her room and go to church when she gets the chance.“I don’t like to push the Bible on people but you have to understand when something is your calling. God has given her a gift and she has to treasure it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe3955c544f6b3a5e4a4249073342048761f8bd1/0_518_8170_4901/master/8170.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c63b06ff69502f397209d02c5489304","title":"world cup semis ashes annihilation and corbyn pads up the spin podcast","story":"After 45 games of this World Cup we’ve reached the knockouts.

Rambert – who writes, directs and designs – has his nine characters explore the brutal decline of a turn-of-the-century Viennese Jewish family. The show is posited as a warning of history repeating itself today, and – at four hours long – it is developed in panoramic breadth, each member of the ensemble cast being given a lengthy star turn. Despite the extraordinary talent on view (Emmanuelle Béart, Stanislas Nordey and Denis Podalydès are thrilling), the result is vacuous. The cataclysmic ending – played in a meta-shift to a chummy rehearsal room setting – is a navel-gazing copout after such a lengthy build-up.Only Pamplemousse, the site’s cat-in-residence, seemed to sense the mood correctly, making a slow diagonal prowl across the vast stage during a quiet scene, puncturing the pomposity and bringing things back down to Earth.Also focused on history and displacement, Brazilian director Christiane Jatahy’s The Overflowing Present (★★★★★) is in another category altogether, of original, urgent, loving, self-disciplined theatrical genius. Jatahy’s protagonists are real actors who are all experiencing some form of exile. Half of them (from South Africa, Palestine and Lebanon) appear in documentary films on an enormous screen facing the audience beyond a seven-metre no man’s land. The other half mingle among the audience. Jatahy’s premise is that the exile has no place and no time but the present, the past being cut off and the future unknowable.These exiles tell their own stories using the structure and text of Homer’s Odyssey. Some are trapped in the screen (the excellent Omar Al Sbaai, currently stateless, was unable to come on tour) some are confined to the theatre (Yara Ktaish, who says she was detained as a suspected satanist in her native Syria and fears stepping outside of the show’s tour for visa renewal and potential re-arrest). Belgian scenographer Thomas Walgrave recounts his grandfather’s long march escaping the Nazis and his later return through the horrors of war. Greek-Jewish-Swiss Melina Martin feels by default (and exclusion) “only truly Swiss, but I don’t know what that means.” The state of exile exists, Jatahy implies, in degrees for all of us.The present and absent performers set up an intricate dialogue through live-filmed and past footage, giving the absent performers strange agency. An uproarious party, seen on screen in Lebanon and also erupting in the theatre, concludes and calms under the stern, closeup screen gaze of a South African girl.The actors bear witness with professional skill, and perform hauntingly beautiful music by Domenico Lancelotti and Vitor Araújo. Jatahy herself mixes the whole thing in the wings. A major figure of contemporary theatre, she feels under personal threat in Jair Bolsonaro’s Brazil. This extraordinary, vital, funny, deeply moving show allows us to feel that we all, to some degree, share her fear.Nous, L’Europe, Banquet des Peuples (★★★★☆), directed by Roland Auzet and written by Laurent Gaudé, is a preachy, almost propagandist examination of the European Union through its roots in war, revolution, slavery, colonialism and the upheavals of Prague, Berlin and the Balkans. It seeks to create a renewed positive myth of Europe by facing the continent’s worst hours, and uses sledgehammer techniques such as a thrash metal score (brilliantly performed on voice and guitar by the actor Karoline Rose), big-screen keywords and an enchanting all-ages choir.Former French president François Hollande was a gasp-inducing deus ex machina on Saturday night, gamely answering the cast’s pointed questions about social justice and his failings in office. Unscripted, he laid a few killer blows, such as: “The climate emergency proves the incongruity of rising nationalisms.” Hollande remained on stage for a bare-breasted bacchanal of the 1968 uprisings.There is an absent party in all this, though: one actor is admonished for citing 28 member states: “No, 27,” he is waspishly corrected. Nonetheless, the climactic search for a European anthem settles on Hey Jude, raucously na-na-na’ed, even by Hollande, with an accompanying stage invasion. This show is joyous, and who cares if it is primarily making a point? The other, dark side of the argument has crept in everywhere."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d7b200e0aa5e209d1bd57fb80cdec69ca597c50/67_358_4505_2704/master/4505.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87d5b402ff89d84f24ee6e9f47c70277","title":"bose frames review smart audio sunglasses are a blast","story":"Music without earbuds looks and sounds surprisingly good, making these smart glasses the antithesis of Google GlassThe Bose Frames are the answer to the question: what if your sunglasses were also a set of smart, hidden headphones with no earbuds or no bone-conduction system, just a set of personal speakers?As a wearer of true wireless earbuds, that’s not a question I ever thought I would ask. But the Bose Frames are delightful and leaving your ears free of buds or headphoneshas a clear and obvious case.The term “smart glasses”’ might conjure up visions of Google’s ill-fated Glass, but the Bose Frames are not in the same league. There’s no screen, camera or any visible signs of “smart” from the front. Instead they have built-in sensors and a pair of hidden speakers, which pipe music to your ears.Bose has nailed the design of the Frames. They look like regular unisex sunglasses. Granted, the arms are a bit thicker and wider near the ears, where traditional sunglasses would taper, and there’s a small gold button for turning them on and controlling music. But I was happy wearing them when not listening to music.There’s a choice of two frames: the larger, squarer Alto (as tested) and the smaller, rounder Rondo. Both are made from black nylon, come with black lenses and look fairly generic.They’re comfortable to wear for extended periods without pinching on the nose or ears, and fold up just like any regular set. They weigh 45g, which is about the weight of a thicker set of premium sunglasses.If I was to nitpick I would say that the black frames look a little cheap and almost too generic. But the fact that’s even worth mentioning is testament to how not like other smart glasses the Frames are.In terms of raw sound quality, the Frames sound like a very open set of quality earbuds. They lack deep bass, but give them something complex and they shine with energy and warmth, with excellent separation and clarity.The one thing the Frames can’t do that earbuds can is protect you from the loud din of a city. You can forget hearing music on a screeching train or while walking by a working jackhammer. In this regard they are very much like Apple’s popular AirPods.The Frames support standard Bluetooth audio (SBC) as well as the higher quality AAC audio, and had rock-solid connectivity with both Android phones and the iPhone. No noticeable lipsync issues were present either, which made the Frames great for watching video.The microphone was surprisingly good, picking up my voice clearly for the other end of the call (or Google AssistantSiri). Be warned though: with no earbuds visible people think you’re talking to yourself.Turning on the Frames is as easy as pressing the single discreet button under the right arm. The button also serves for pauseplay or accepting a call. Double press to skip forward, triple for back. Anyone who has used wireless earbuds before will be familiar with this.To switch them off just turn them upside down for a second or so. It all works great. The one thing they’re missing is volume control, so you’ll be reaching for your phone for that, which is a shame.You get just over three hours of continuous listening out of the Frames before the battery runs dry, which is normally enough. Charging is fairly slow and needs a proprietary magnetic USB cable that snaps on to the inside of the right arm.The Frames come with a traditional sunglasses case, which is a missed opportunity. Most true wireless earbuds last about three hours, but are charged multiple times by their case. The Frames could really do with a battery in the case. It’s too easy to forget to charge them, turning them into standard sunglasses.The smart bit of the Frames is support for the firm’s audio augmented reality platform, Bose AR, which is also available on the Bose’s popular QC35 II headphones, and on the upcoming Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700.The Frames know which way you’re facing and your location from the GPS on your phone, so you can use audio to feed information about the real world into your ears.But the platform only supports iOS at the moment and lacks a killer app. The best of the bunch are some 3D audio experiences, a golf app that can tell you where the hole is and some walking directions. None of them were interesting enough to use beyond novelty, but Bose AR has potential.For comparison, the Oakley Radar Pace, which has in-ear buds attached to the sunglasses, costs £400 while various bone conduction sunglasses cost from about £100.Clearly this is a massive advantage for cyclists or pedestrians, but it also means you’re subjected to the noise of the world around you. For anyone who always walks around with earbuds in, as I do, this can be quite overwhelming when you first start out.They look good enough that I ended up wearing them even when not listening to music. And when you do switch them on they sound surprisingly good, with rich audio that sparkles with the right track. There’s simply no comparison with bone conduction or similar other non-earbud personal audio technologies.Listening to your tunes while still being able to hear the great outdoors while sitting in the garden or park in brilliant sunshine is thoroughly enjoyable. Trying to listen to a podcast while travelling on London’s noisy Piccadilly line, not so much.So the Frames will never be the only set of headphones you need, and they could do with a battery in the case, volume controls and a few more styles, not to mention prescription lenses and some killer Bose AR apps.But even at £200 the Bose Frames are the most interesting piece of wearable technology I have donned since the original Google Glass.Pros: music without blocking your ears or making a racket for others, look good, choice of lenses and frames, comfortable, sound good, solid Bluetooth connection, excellent call qualityCons: no battery in the case and only 3.5 hours between charges, will never be your only set of earphones, can’t protect from noise of the outside world, AR potential unrealised This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Those three states have allowed undocumented immigrants to obtain driver’s IDs and permits, but also have appeared at times to work with Ice agents seeking access to those databases, according to Georgetown Law experts who obtained the government files through records requests.In Utah, the state DMV database was the subject of nearly 2,000 facial-recognition searches from outside law enforcement and federal agents, including Ice and the FBI, according to an analysis by the Washington Post, which first reported on the records. One official noted in the records that the Utah database included more than 5m driver’s licenses and state ID photos.Redacted Vermont records showed that immigration authorities and other federal agents have at times received state approval to conduct searches of the DMV “facial recognition photo repository”. One file said the purpose was to compare the photos with those of suspects, and, potentially, to apprehend them.A Vermont DMV spokesperson said Monday that the state had stopped the use of facial recognition software in May 2017, and that “no information has been shared” since then.The records from Washington state also showed that immigration agents made facial recognition requests to the state’s licensing department. State officials admitted to the Seattle Times last year that the department, which issues driver’s licenses, had regularly provided Ice with photos and license applications. The Democratic governor, Jay Inslee, said at the time he was ordering a stop to the practice, though the status of that policy was unclear. The licensing department said in a statement Monday that it only releases data for “immigration purposes” when there is a “judicial court order or subpoena”. Since 2013, the state has received 53 requests for data access, which include two from the FBI and four from Ice.When matches are found, the state “would provide limited identity information”, the statement said. Washington is one of a handful of states across the country that has a sanctuary law on the books meant to limit cooperation between local law enforcement and immigration authorities.There has been a growing push across the country to allow undocumented people to have licenses, with the understanding that it improves their lives and aids public safety. But that information should not be used by Ice to pursue deportations, activists said.“It’s putting people in this impossible situation,” said Jacinta Gonzales, an organizer with the group Mijente, noting that state IDs are supposed to help undocumented people avoid arrest. “It’s a lose-lose for immigrants.”Last week, Mijente released documents showing that Ice agents exchanged cheerful messages about upcoming raids and potential arrests, with one official writing, “Happy hunting!”When people take driver’s license photos, they have not given consent for their images to be searched, added Sarah St Vincent, a surveillance researcher with Human Rights Watch.“States have tried to improve people’s lives and people’s ability in this country to move around by giving them the ability to drive,” she said. “But are the states ensuring that it’s not used in a way that abuses rights?”The FBI has also logged more than 390,000 facial-recognition searches of government databases since 2011, including DMV data, the Government Accountability Office disclosed in June. Neither Congress nor state legislatures have passed laws authorizing these types of systems, the Post noted.There has been growing evidence in recent years that facial recognition technology can supply “false positives” and can exacerbate racial biases in the US criminal justice system.Asked about the Georgetown records, Ice spokesman Matthew Bourke said the agency does not comment on “investigative techniques, tactics or tools”, adding, “During the course of an investigation, Ice has the ability to collaborate with external local, federal and international agencies to obtain information that may assist in case completion and prosecution efforts.”An FBI spokesperson pointed to its recent testimony before Congress, which said: “Facial recognition is a tool that, if used properly, can greatly enhance law enforcement capabilities and protect public safety.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5eb3bfc6efaf1e15c969c39a6beea1529d557c82/28_163_3199_1919/master/3199.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e17131d0c88f628b81c6631b8c3ffc2a","title":"is a new generation taking over the democratic party podcast","story":"Kamala Harris was the big winner of the first round of Democratic party debates in the US.

But don’t panic. These hacks, says Susie Mesure, can help you become a time lordWho doesn’t dream of having more hours in the day to get stuff done? Sadly, until quantum scientists figure out how to reverse time, we’re stuck with having to manage with what we have.Trouble is, the world of time management can sometimes seem a bit, well, time-consuming. There are so many different techniques and systems, from sophisticated activity logs and minute-by-minute scheduling, to synchronised software and apps.Luckily, there are a number of quick and easy life hacks and mental tricks to help blitz your to-do list.A key thing is to try to be aware of the value of each passing moment. “Remember every task comes with a cost,” says Ellen Hendriksen, host of the podcast Savvy Psychologist and author of How to Be Yourself: “Be mindful about what task you are choosing to spend your time on because that is time spent not only on doing that task, but on not doing other tasks.”Another way to make yourself more aware is to first picture in your head your ideal working day – epitomising optimum levels of productivity and downtime. Then compare it to how your actual day is panning out. This will you give an idea of how and where you’re falling short.Kelsey also swears by limiting interruptions from telephone calls or emails using your travel time efficiently not overcommitting yourself and curtailing the time spent in meetings. He also suggests keeping a diary so you can spot where you might be going off-piste. Another, obvious, tip is to delete any social media apps from your phone – we all know they’re like catnip, and a quick scroll can easily cost you half an hour.Hendriksen suggests slimming down to-do lists to include only small, specific tasks. “If we are staring at 10 huge things, especially a large number of non-specific things, such as ‘clean the house’, ‘finish project’ or ‘figure out work presentation’, then those large tasks will seem overwhelming. So keep your to-do list to more defined things.”Other simple techniques include tackling trickier or more boring tasks first, like ticking off your business admin, so you finish them faster.One – arguably masochistic – tip is to replace your clock with a timer – even an hourglass or egg timer – to make your deadline feel more menacing. Or, if that sounds too stressful, use the stopwatch app on your phone and challenge yourself to speed up each time you do something repetitive.Another approach to time management is to focus your mind not on the value of each passing hour, but rather on the value or importance of each task. Indeed, self-help types often reference a matrix, based on a quote attributed to US president Dwight Eisenhower: “I have two kinds of problems, the urgent and the important. The urgent are not important, and the important are never urgent.”Stephen Covey, in his 1989 book, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, says the matrix comprises four boxes: urgent and important not urgent but important urgent but not important and not urgent and not important. The idea behind it is straightforward: by thinking about where your task sits within the quadrant, you should be better able to notice whether or not you’re wasting your time.Kelsey points out that it can be helpful to think of time management as something to continually struggle with, rather than as something that can be mastered or cured. “It’s worth noting that I wrote these books from the perspective of being a sufferer, someone who struggles with issues like time management,” he says.Whatever your business, don’t keep knocking essential tasks to the bottom of your to-do list.Tailor your business insurance with AXA. It couldn’t be simpler. That’s one less thing to worry about, and more time to spend getting on with business.

Tehran last week accused the US of being the major violator of the treaty because of its unilateral withdrawal from the deal.The Isna and Fars news agencies separately quoted Behrouz Kamalvandi, the spokesman of the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran, saying the decision to further enrich met the needs that Iran had now.The Iranian moves had been anticipated by diplomats and analysts who argued that the country was likely to break conditions of the JCPOA as part of its pushback against the Trump administration’s policy of “maximum pressure” and to put pressure on Europe.Iran has set its own 60-day deadline for saving the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, which it said would expire in September.Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman, Abbas Mousavi, said on Monday that if European nations “do not fulfil their commitments seriously and do not do anything more than talk, Iran’s third step will be harder, more steadfast and somehow stunning”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c58ef5cc956bde4ed6b3598245336f903cdb9aad/0_76_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90e99468e2be959e36d0ac155e0113e3","title":"pride in london parade in pictures","story":"Huge crowds gather on the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3944128.1562536849!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"how you can take on ryanair and get your money back","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Ryanair logo is pictured on the the jacket of a cabin crew member.

File photograph: Donall FarmerInphoA levy on the greyhound industry is set to be imposed in order to fund a “pension plan” and retirement homes for dogs when they finish racing, an Oireachtas committee is set to hear today.In his opening statement to the Oireachtas agriculture committee, Irish Greyhound Board chairman Frank Nyhan will say that the IGB is advancing plans to institute a levy on attendance income, prize money and a percentage of all sponsorship to be paid into a “care fund” which will be managed through a trust with external appointees monitoring the care and welfare programme.A levy paid at the time that dogs are registered in the national stud book will also “contribute towards a ‘pension plan’ for the greyhound in retirement”. The IGB is also proceeding with an immediate expression of interest for the provision of “greyhound care centres so that greyhounds can lead a healthy life after retirement”. These centres would be paid for by the care fund and by a contribution from owners.Mr Nyhan will also say that he is open to engaging with the Government on the ringfencing for animal welfare of a set amount of money from the €16.8 million in state funding received by the industry each year. Meanwhile, sanctions and notification requirements on the transfer of ownership of dogs are to be strengthened in an effort to improve the data available on the industry.He will also say that the industry wants to introduce new rules on euthanasia which will stipulate that when necessary, such procedures should only be carried out by a qualified vet. This rule should apply to racing and coursing dogs, he will say.Mr Nyhan will outline reasons why the board does not accept the programme’s assumption that almost 6,000 dogs which were unaccounted for from the 2009 greyhound pool were culled.In a critique of a report commissioned by the IGB itself, Mr Nyhan will say that the “analysis was based on estimates and assumptions and lacked any empirical evidence base”. The IGB chairman will also criticise aspects of the RTÉ programme, and claim that a “false impression” of the total spend on welfare by the industry was created. He will argue that the total spend on welfare and regulation will be close to €2 million this year."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3950593.1562612371!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sinn f%C3%A9in to seek to improve public communication strategy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald: came in for general criticism for a number of incidents in the past year. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillA Sinn Féin review into its poor performance in the local and European elections has found the party needs to significantly improve how it communicates with the public. However, it strongly argued that the party’s policies and political positions do not need to change. The review does not single out or criticise the performance of any iniduals, including party president Mary Lou McDonald. Ms McDonald, a TD for Dublin Central, came in for some criticism for a number of incidents in the past year, including being photographed posing behind a banner which said “England: Get out of Ireland” at the St Patrick’s Day Parade in New York.It is understood the review has recommended a revamp of the party structures to focus its organisational efforts on the forthcoming general election. Two review panels of three members each were established by the ard chomhairle, the party’s governing authority, to compile submissions from across the party on both elections.Two panelsThe submissions came from members, cumain and cuigí – regional structures based on the European Parliament constituencies – to the ard chomhairle.Reports from the two review panels were considered by the ard chomhairle at a meeting last Saturday. The European elections saw Sinn Féin drop from holding three seats in the Republic to just one, with Midlands North West MEP Matt Carthy its sole MEP south of the Border.The local elections saw Sinn Féin drop from a council seat haul of 159 in 2014 to just 81 this time out. Party sources said between “10 and 20” recommendations arising from the elections have now been sent to the Sinn Féin officer board – which includes officials such as party treasurers, secretaries and others, as well as elected representatives such as Ms McDonald and vice-president Michelle O’Neill. Social media The recommendations are understood to include changes to how the party gets its message out via its own press office, social media channels and website, with one figure saying it has “slipped” in its social media output. “Is our message getting through?” asked one source, adding that a focus would now come on how the party improves the communication of its own policy solutions and proposal. This would come in addition to the usual critique of government policy.Organisational changes mentioned include reallocating some staff to areas that will help prepare for a general election, such as improving regional structures. The party press office and communications arm is also earmarked for change and improvement.Examples of successful use of social media cited include a video posted last week of finance spokesman Pearse Doherty questioning insurance industry figures at a recent Oireachtas committee about fraudulent claims."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3950677.1562618137!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cabinet to be told about dire realities of no deal brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar and Tánaiste Simon Coveney:  Mr Coveney is set to tell Ministers  a no-deal Brexit  is more likely now than at any time to date. Photograph: Michelle DevanePA Ministers will face “dire” warnings on Tuesday about the realities of a no-deal Brexit when they are expected to discuss the implications for the Border if the UK crashes out of the EU in October. The Cabinet will hear about the “dire consequences for Northern Ireland and the all-Ireland economy” according to sources familiar with the memorandums to be presented to Ministers. Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney is due to bring three Brexit memos to Cabinet, including a revised contingency action plan which will be published later on Tuesday. The Government is increasingly concerned about how it can reconcile the twin obligations to maintain an open border on the island while at the same time protecting the single market and customs union if the UK leaves without an agreement. Mr Coveney warned: “We can’t allow . . . Northern Ireland effectively to become a back door – if it’s unguarded – into the EU single market and customs union. Because if that happens then the Republic of Ireland will essentially get taken out of the single market by default and we can never allow that to happen.” The Taoiseach said tariffs and customs in the event of a no-deal Brexit would not need Border checks but that checks on food products and animals were a difficulty. “We’ve made no preparations for infrastructure,” he said. Tourism and medicineThe contingency plan, about 100-pages long, is an update of the plan published last December before the previous Brexit deadline of March 29th. It will cover preparations in about 20 areas, including aviation, road haulage, retail, tourism and medicines. There will also be a memo describing preparations at ports and airports. According to sources familiar with its content, the memo will approve the permanent structures at airports and ports, including Dublin and Rosslare Europort. The third memo will outline communications plans required to inform businesses and the public about the implications of a no-deal Brexit – an outcome Mr Coveney will tell Ministers is more likely now than at any time in the past. Officials are concerned that while there was a take-up of Brexit preparations and requirements in advance of the March deadline – which passed when the UK was granted an extension – there has been a fall-off in Brexit preparations by businesses since then. UK break-upOne source said the Government needed to make “an absolute wake-up call” to business, especially small and medium-sized businesses. A campaign to prompt holders of UK driving licences to apply for Irish licences is already under way.Meanwhile, the chair of Westminster’s Northern Ireland Affairs committee has warned unionists that a hard border after Brexit could lead to a united Ireland and the break-up of the United Kingdom. Conservative MP Simon Hoare said it was a huge risk to presuppose that “the cards will all fall in our favour” over Brexit in relation to the Border.“We will play with fire if a policy is pursued which adds an accelerant to a demand for a Border poll. Because I have to say, and it saddens me to say it, I am not convinced that we as unionists would win that poll,” he said“I am also certain that even if we were to prevail and that precious union was to maintain it would open yet again – and one could not refuse the request for a second independence referendum in Scotland, and it is worrying – and I say this as somebody who is saddened to say it, I do not want to wake up and find myself a subject of the United Kingdom of England and Wales.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

File photograph: Jacob KeplerBloombergReforms of a 50-year-old gaming Bill currently before the Oireachtas could lead to a 300-fold increase in the maximum stake allowed for slot machines.The current 3 cent maximum stake for gaming machines has been unchanged since the Gaming and Lotteries Act became law in 1956. The stake, and the payout limit of 50 cent, are widely seen as anomalous and have been flouted for years by amusement arcades. However, concern has been expressed that the proposed increase of the limit to €10 for each stake, and a new maximum payout of €750, will exacerbate an already serious problem with gambling addiction in Ireland. This provision of the new legislation was strongly criticised by two Independent Senators, David Norris and Gerard Craughwell, when the Gaming and Lotteries (Amendment) Bill, 2019, was debated in the Upper House last month.“They are enormous and vast increases. From 3 cent to €10 is bad enough, but from 50 cent to €750 clearly raises this situation beyond the question of gaming for amusement,” said Mr Norris.An organisation which provides services to problem gamblers strongly criticised the change as “extremely worrying”.Barry Grant, chief executive of Problem Gambling Ireland, said that even with the nominal 3 cent limit, his organisation has already dealt with numerous people who went into arcades and casinos with their week’s wages and walked out a few hours later with nothing. “How much more quickly will they lose a week’s wages at €10 a spin in a market that is unregulated and has a history of zero enforcement?” he asked. ‘Completely unrealistic’Minister of State in the Department of Justice David Stanton, who is behind the new Bill, said the stakes set out in 1956 were “completely unrealistic” and needed to be brought up to date. He said that other gaming offers, including bingo, scratch cards, and lotteries, already offered much greater stakes and prizes. The new Bill is the first part of wider reforms of gambling laws, which will see the establishment of a regulator’s office within two years. Mr Stanton said the new law will enforce a minimum age of 18 for all gaming and lottery games.

We can never allow that to happen,” he said.The issue would be addressed “in probably more direct language” following the presentation of the latest Brexit preparation memos to Cabinet today, he said.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said that, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, there was “no preparation in terms of structures “at the Border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.If there is no deal “we’ll have to protect the single market and the customs union. We’ll want to do that as well because our economy and our jobs are based on that. But we’re going to need to do it in a way that doesn’t undermine the Good Friday agreement or obligations there,” he said.Things anticipated in such a scenario could include “imposing tariffs. We know that they don’t have to be done at a border as such. Most people pay their taxes online now. But checks, obviously, is where it gets much more difficult,” he said.They were speaking to the media at Dublin Castle yesterday morning where they had launched the one-year progress report on Global Ireland 2025. The Taoiseach said it was “one of those strategies where we are well ahead of schedule – eight new embassies and consulates opened around the world.“We’ll bring three memos on Brexit to Cabinet and the main memo there really is an updated Brexit preparedness plan.”While looking forward to an early meeting with the new British prime minister, he said “the absolute red line for us is, and always has been, that we have to have a legally operable, legally binding assurance that whatever else may happen as a consequence of Brexit the re-emergence of a hard border between North and South won’t be one of them.”Great reluctanceHe also believed there would be a “great deal of reluctance” among European leaders to grant the British government another extension beyond October 31st. If such an extension was to be granted, it would be in the context of “a general election in the UK or something like that,” he said.Asked whether relations between Ireland and Britain were likely to become more fraught over coming months, Mr Coveney responded: “I hope not. I think the relationships that both the Taoiseach and I, and others in Government, have worked hard to build with the previous British cabinet were very strong.”The Taoiseach noted how both of the two men running for the Conservative Party leadership – Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt – “actually voted for the withdrawal agreement only a few weeks ago”. He said “fundamentally the best way that we can restore relations between Ireland and the UK is to come to a resolution on Brexit.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

There is absolutely a perception among students, echoed by teachers, that getting top grades in languages is difficult and is more difficult than other subjects.”Mike Buchanan, executive director of the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference, says the status quo is \u0026#34unacceptable\u0026#34He said this is not an unreasonable calculation to make, adding that parents also advise their children against languages on this basis. They are making the same sort of calculation: What is going to enable my child to as successful as possible?What will be the best passport to the next stage?Entries for GCSEs in both French and German have dropped by 30 per cent over the past five years, while Spanish has dropped by a more modest two per cent, according to figures compiled by the British Council for its annual language trends report. The report, published earlier this week, showed that in 2014, there were 166,167 entries for French GCSE and 60,362 for German but by 2018, this had dropped to 117,046 and 42,296 respectively.Mr Buchanan said that the status quo is “unacceptable”, adding: “Whether its Ofqual or someone else - unless we do something, languages will die. There won’t be students who want to take them, and over time there won’t be enough teachers to teach them”.This summer is the second year that students have taken revamped GCSE exams in modern foreign languages (MFL).The new courses were part of a package of reforms by Michael Gove, the former education secretary, designed to toughen up syllabuses, make courses more linear, and cut down on the number of students getting A*s.Ofqual, the exam regulator, is currently undertaking a review of the reformed GCSE MFL subjects, which is due to conclude this autumn.It said it is “aware of statistical evidence” that suggests that GCSE MFL subjects may be “more severely graded than many others”.However, the watchdog said that this alone is not necessarily enough to “justify a change to grading standards”.An Ofqual spokesperson said that their research so far suggests that the new GCSEs are “functioning well”, but added that it takes concerns about the perceived difficulty of MFL subjects “seriously” and it “continues to look at this issue in detail”.They added: “We are currently conducting a comprehensive review of grading standards in GCSE French, German and Spanish, looking at statistical evidence, contextual data including trends in the numbers taking these subjects and the quality of students’ work, to see if there is compelling case for an adjustment to grading standards in these subjects.”Billionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein pleads not guilty to sex trafficking chargesDonald Trump \u0026#39will no longer deal\u0026#39 with British ambassador, as he hits out at Theresa May for Brexit \u0026#39mess\u0026#39 Families left to plug £15bn gap in \u0026#39dreadfully broken\u0026#39 dementia systemHPV jab for boys raises hope of eradicating cervical cancerChildren have never had it so good, Education Secretary insists amid warnings of social media fuelled \u0026#39childhood crisis\u0026#39Comment: Boris Johnson has the imagination, energy and resolve to save our party, as 1,500 councillors endorse himGCSE exam board adds more ethnically erse texts, after complaints of too many \u0026#39dead white men\u0026#39Boris Johnson vs Jeremy Hunt: Tory leadership candidates quizzed by  writersComment: The gloom is gone.

It’s an absolute nightmare.The BB closed down two years ago and was left empty while the owners decided what to do with it.John is inspecting the property with a view of renovating it and letting it out as bedsits.But hes is shocked to find the space is awash with cigarette butts, needles and other drug paraphernalia - and there are two broken toilets overflowing with human waste.“That’s just awful – covered in s**t and it looks like they’ve been using an old curtain to wipe their a**es on. The mind boggles,” says John. It’s not often I smell things like that.”The landlord realises that a number of squatters have been living in the disused hotel after breaking in through the back door.“Yes, there is an issue with drugs in Blackpool. You have to be vigilant when there are sharps lying around that could harm my colleague or I,” says John, surveying the chaos.The property used to be a successful bed and breakfast business, located within walking distance of Blackpool Pier.“It’s a prime location for anyone to have a nice home, not like the s**t we’re seeing in front of us,” John says.He later discovers the local birds have also been making themselves at home - and pigeon faeces and feathers are left all over the property.Then John opens the door to a bedroom and finds a couple sleeping on an old mattress.Keeping calm, John tries his best to convince the squatters to leave peacefully.“Putting people back on the streets is dficult but they can’t see us as a soft touch,” John says defending his decision to kick them back out.John manages to get the squatters to leave without involving the authorities.“I’m glad they went quietly, you can’t have any qualms though because they are doing wrong and it’s a criminal offence to squat,” he is keen to point out.However, homelessness is re in Blackpool and John suspects it’s just a matter of time before they are back.“The people are desperate and are stuck. Blackpool is victim to its past, people think the streets are paved with gold and they are not,” he says. With all the squatters out, John pays up £ to have the property renovated and transformed into somewhere which is ready to be let.Nightmare Tennants, Slum Landlords airs Monday at pm on Channel .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Perhaps they feel aggrieved by the bad publicity and have decided to pull up the drawbridge to keep us all out today.It doesn’t work like that.Diana, who knew all about public perception and how to deal with the media, would have advised them to counteract the criticism by making sure that Archie’s christening was an event the whole country could enjoy.There would have been no question of the names of godparents being kept secret, or photos of such a big occasion only being released on Harry and Meghan’s carefully controlled Instagram account.Diana would have known that images of a cute baby and his doting parents, with guests all done up to the nines, would take the heat off the negative stories surrounding the Frogmore building work.I’m sure Meghan has been bruised by some of the, frankly, racist and utterly vile comments on social media, as well as the upsetting and ongoing feud with her family — apart from her mum, Doria.Not even Diana would have been able to silence those hideous trolls, but her wise counsel would have stopped the Markle clan from being a thorn in Meghan’s side.Even before the engagement announcement, Diana would have flown over to the USA and entranced Thomas Markle.I have no doubt Diana would have given him a masterclass in dealing with the media.There would have been no clumsy staged paparazzi shots and Thomas Markle would have proudly walked his daughter down the aisle.Diana, would have been on hand with advice about the announcement of baby Archie’s arrival, which was all a bit messy.She would have been a staunch ally to Meghan and helped her navigate the choppy waters of royal protocol, and been a terric sounding board for any worries the new mum might encounter.Diana would have been a cheerleader for Harry and Meghan’s plans to make a dference both here and in Africa and supported their plans to spend half the year in Botswana with baby Archie, albeit with assurances that “Granny Di” could pop over for regular visits.I understand Harry and Meghan want to protect their little boy and allow him to grow up leading as “normal” a le as possible, but they really can’t have it both ways.Either they are private citizens and pay for their own loft extension, or they are royals and have to share the big events in their lives with the rest of the world. Diana would have helped them achieve that balance.It’s a crying shame she isn’t here, but I truly hope Harry and Meghan have a joyful time today and maybe even change their minds and give us all a peek at the celebrations.FIFTY years ago, Neil Armstrong landed on the Moon and the world was in awe.As a ten-year-old watching this “giant leap for mankind” I genuinely believed that we had taken the first small step into the unknown and were boldly going “where no one had gone before”.I did a primary school project on the first manned voyage to Mars, which we reckoned would take place in  –  nothing seemed impossible.In the years before the Moon landing, we watched Star Trek and thought we’d be living that TV series for real.There was to have been a lunar base, and from there we would explore the solar system and eventually the rest of the universe.Of course none of this came to pass, except in our imaginations and sci-fi films.Scientists had the curiosity and the imagination but, sadly, the general public lost interest.After the space shuttle disasters in  and  that killed  crew members, politicians got cold feet and the manned missions were shelved.This loss of le was tragic but, ever since we started exploring space, astronauts have always paid the ultimate price.Even the Apollo  Moon landing came close to disaster.This week sees the release of Armstrong, an astonishing documentary about the first man on the Moon.Watching the footage, you will gain a new-found respect for this rare breed of human beings.Hopefully it will ignite a new passion among this current generation to once again travel into space.If we don’t seek out “new le and new civilisations”, then what are we actually here for THE biggest kid of all in the le of Coleen Rooney would appear to be her husband.She’s ed home with her four boys and left Wayne in the US with a list of strict instructions most mums would leave for their stroppy teenage sons.Wayne has been warned that there is to be no boozing, no wild parties and he has to phone Coleen every day to check in with her so she can be reassured he really is behaving himself.No wonder the poor lass has to have so many holidays.Looking after FIVE boisterous boys must be utterly exhausting.I AM more than a little bit in love with Suranne Jones as “Gentleman Jack”.This cracking drama based on the real-le th century lesbian Anne Lister is witty, wicked and, at times, impossibly sad.Anne was a bold pioneer trying to find her place in le.At a time when women were kept firmly in their place and either treated like imbeciles or fragile pieces of bone china, she was a sharp businesswoman who owned her own land and took no s**t.When it came to matters of the heart, however, Anne was achingly vulnerable and badly let down by the women she loved.It’s the last episode tomorrow but,you have missed out, you can catch up on BBC iPlayer and a second series has already been commissioned.CAROL Vorderman has the sort of figure that would make Jessica Rabbit turn pea green with envy – proper gorgeous, voluptuous curves.She told me it’s all down to doing thousands of squats, walking for miles in the countryside and the side-effects of the menopause.Under that regime, most of us would end up with rock-hard flat buttocks, sore feet and horric night sweats.GAIL Porter famously once had her derrière beamed on to the Houses of Parliament.It actually made a refreshing change to see a backside on the outside of the building, instead of the usual arses who inhabit the interior.Back then, Gail was at the height of her fame as a TV presenter and lads’ mag favourite.It looked as though she was living the dream, but the poor girl was suffering horribly inside.She’s had well documented mental health issues including being diagnosed as bipolar, and suffering with anorexia and anxiety.At one point, in deep despair, she even tried to take her own le.Possibly due to all the stress, Gail’s hair fell out and never grew back.It’s not been an easy road, but I am delighted this irrepressible and beautul woman has bounced back.She’s now in a good place and keen to help others who have been through similar experiences.Gail has teamed up with The Samaritans, an organisation that has helped her in the past, to ask us all to take part in a marathon.The good news is you can take the whole of July to reach  miles.That’s under a mile a day and you can run, jog or walk.Build up your miles in your nearest park, going to work on foot or just out for a stroll.For more information on the Samarathon, see Samaritans.org. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So best of luck saving the Euro, Christine.Ursula von der Leyen’s nomination as EU Commission President has provoked outrage in her native Germany, where it is perceived as an undeserved reward for miserable failure.Frau von der Leyen’s six years as defence minister earned her the reputation as “the worst minister in Germany” and being promoted to President of the EU Commission is seen as getting “kicked upstairs” by her friend, Chancellor Angela Merkel.Certainly there is nothing on Ursula’s CV to warrant such a promotion.As defence minister, Frau von der Leyen prioritised creches and flexible working hours for Germany’s armed forces.Funding shortages became so dire on her watch that on a Nato training exercise in Norway, German troops were obliged to use broomsticks painted black instead of guns.I don’t fancy her EU army’s chances against the Russians.But I would bet they have childcare facilities to die for.Unelected by the people, unaccountable to the people and contemptuous of the people, this next generation of Eurocrats remind us why the British have no future inside this arrogant empire.Yes, Brexit has been an agony.But the appointment of the EU’s new Ayatollahs prove that remaining is unthinkable.BRIAN JONES, the original Rolling Stone, died  years ago this week.“No Jones, no Stones,” said Bill Wyman. “He formed the band.

We have to be for Remain now.“Just when we think we’ve got Jeremy over the line, the Three Ms talk him out of it again.

Create a separate veterans department for the first time to coordinate their needs across Whitehall, run by a minister who attends Cabinet,. Enshrine the Military Covenant into law to allow vets and bereaved families a way to hold the Government to accountthey suffer disadvantage,. Pass new legislation to end unfair and repeated investigations into historical allegations before the next General Election.The call for the two wannabe Prime Ministers to sign up to the pledge is also backed by ex-Army senior Tory MPs from each of the two men’s campaigns.Writing in The Sun today, ex-Royal Artillery officer Johnny Mercer – a prominent Boris backer – brands it Britain’s “GI Bill moment”, named after the time when America finally decided to do good by its Vietnam War veterans.Mr Mercer adds: “It would be political madness for Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt to fail to sign up.”Hunt supporter Richard Benyon, a former Green Jackets officer, said: “The change of leadership is a very important opportunity for us to reboot what Government should be doing to protect our veterans.“The Veterans Pledge is the right way forward.”Previous Governments have, to their credit, taken steps in the right direction.But their activities have often been piecemeal or lacking in an overall direction.Giving the money from interest rate-rigging fines to Armed Forces charities is a good example.A promise of nearly £bn, but a promise that hasn’t been delivered as fully as it should have been, with Ministers even dipping into the pot to cover shortfalls in their own budgets.We need a sea change — and that’s why we’ve partnered with Help for Heroes and Combat Stress to demand a Cabinet Minister takes the reins on this vital issue under a Johnson or Hunt Government.And that Minister mustn’t just be there to turn up for photo ops at far-flung bases.They must drive through a firmer commitment to the Military Covenant and, vitally, work with the Attorney General to end the persecution of veterans from former conflicts.Everybody who has served has put their le on the line for us — and their families have sacriced plenty, too.Time to deliver.Help for Heroes CEO Melanie Waters said: “We have supported over , wounded military personnel and their families so far and the need is growing, which is why we are calling on the leadership candidates to sign up to the Veterans’ Pledge.“Many wounded veterans feel let down by the system and we know more needs to be done by the Government to ensure our heroes get the fair deal they deserve.”Eighteen years of almost constant war fighting since the   terror attacks in areas such as Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria have taken a huge toll on troops.Last year alone, there were , medical discharges from the UK’s Armed Forces,  of them for mental health conditions.It emerged yesterday that almost  vets a day are now seeking help for mental health issues.A recent King’s College London study revealed , former servicemen and women are still suffering from their physical or mental injuries from the modern wars of the past  years.The pledge’s unveiling comes as outgoing PM Theresa May today makes the final speech of her Premiership to the forces to thank them.On a visit to Permanent Joint headquarters, Mrs May will say: “There is no greater responsibility as Prime Minister than ensuring the safety and security of our people.“And doing so is not something any Prime Minister can achieve without you.“You are not just a part of British le – you are the guarantors of British le. The foundation of our freedom. The protectors of our democracy. And for that, we owe you a debt of gratitude.”I have no ties to any particular charity, no agenda in this field — except a point-blank refusal to accept poor care of vet­erans and their families.Make no mistake — Help for Heroes, the Legion, The Soldiers Charity, SSAFA and more deliver world-class services.But there is no doubt they need help. The pathways are still too unclear.Not all charities spend their money in the most effective way.Access to service records remains a nightmare.The Veteran’s transition from military service to a civilian GP is still entirely postcode-driven.The Military Covenant is not applied equally. If a local authority does not believe in it, then it does not apply.Similarly, hundreds dragged through the historical allegations process have no clear support.The new PM must seize the nettle and create a small, dedicated unit in the Cabinet Office.This is our GI Bill moment, a chance to emulate the US treatment of its veterans.Our Government has not led in this sector for too long.

But their activities have often been piecemeal or lacking in an overall direction.Giving the money from interest rate-rigging fines to armed forces charities is a good example.A promise of nearly £bn, but a promise that hasn’t been delivered as fully as it should have been, with Ministers even dipping into the pot to cover shortfalls in their own budgets.We need a sea change — and that’s why we’ve partnered with Help for Heroes and Combat Stress to demand a Cabinet Minister takes the reins on this vital issue under a Johnson or Hunt Government.And that Minister mustn’t just be there to turn up for photo ops at far-flung bases. They must drive through a firmer commitment to the Military Covenant and, vitally, work with the Attorney General to end the persecution of veterans from former conflicts.Everybody who has served has put their le on the line for us — and their families have sacriced plenty, too.Time to deliver.EVERY time you think they can’t sink any lower, Labour’s leadership finds a way.This once great party is now run by a rabble of apologists for anti-Semitism, Marxists and bullies.They think nothing of spending their members’ cash on expensive law firms in an attempt to throttle the free press.And when it comes to policy, their combination of two-faced doublespeak on Brexit and a cripplingly expensive nationalisation programme would send the UK economy into a nosee it might never recover from.Yet still there are decent MPs on those Labour backbenches who think the tide will turn, that evenCorbyn was to enter Downing Street he could somehow be managed. Codswallop.It’s put up or shut up time for them.BOTH Tory candidates to be next PM have promised to deliver Brexit, deal or no deal.It’s the only hope the party has of remaining relevant.So when they take office, they have a mandate to deliver their promises in the leadership contest. Including those on the European Union.That means those Tory MPs who are still dead-set on crippling the Government’s Exit strategy by stopping a clean break are not just turning their noses up at their own members.They’re risking the future of the party.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Loads of people hadnt even bought tickets and were getting the free signatures.Queue jumping was a joke as the queues were bigger in the VIP section anyway and didnt amount to anything dferent to the standard tickets.I spent an extra  quid just on getting pictures taken with an owl and a snake which i thought would of been free and the wands which were £  each.The potions class was over crowded and we couldnt hear the speaker so had to leave plus the cosplay section was poor and they talked about cosplay in general not Harry Potter-themed.As a single mum who bought this as a birthday treat im highly disappointed.Another added: Absolutely appalled by today.  tickets bought at £ each to see it open to general public without tickets, overcrowded, and certainly not as advertised.The children are so disappointed today and I am £ down.

But this was not a battlefield, it was a housing estate. A lot of friends were killed.“When you are on tour in a conflict zone such as Northern Ireland you have to remain switched on the whole time. When you leave the Army there is no off switch.“There is supposed to be a covenant for the Armed Forces whereby the Government provides the support we need.“But lots of soldiers get into a vicious circle due to mental health issues because they don’t receive help.“When you were out on patrol the last thing you’d admit to is being scared, so soldiers don’t always ask for support. We need to make sure the authorities are looking for signs early on.“In many ways I am lucky, because I have my own house, I’m happily married, I have a day job running a post room and a weekend job as a singer.“But  years after I left the Army I started to get symptoms of PTSD, which my we recognised before I noticed anything.“I suffered nightmares, started drinking to excess and started to do things which were out of character, such as challenging people on the Underground and going to dodgy pubs on my own, looking for danger.“I think it was Northern Ireland coming to the front of my head. Eventually I agreed to go and ask for support, and the we found a charity called Combat Stress who were willing to assess me.“I was lucky I caught it early and I haven’t needed to go back for any therapy for five years.“But I know many veterans are not so fortunate to have received that kind of treatment.”SAS hero Bob Curry stormed the Iranian Embassy to rescue hostages – but last year he was refused a council house when he was made homeless.The -year-old, who helped to save  lives during the London siege in , had lost his house in Hereford after his business collapsed and he split up with his partner.He says: “When I lost my home the council wouldn’t even put me on the housing list – they told me I didn’t qualy. They were so arrogant.“In a private meeting one housing officer asked me, ‘Have you been out of the military five years ’ and when I said ‘Yes’, he threw his pencil across the table, held his arms and huffed.“In Hereford, because I had been out of the military for five years, I was no longer considered to be a veteran.“I said to them, ‘All of those men and women standing at the Cenotaph on the th of the th aren’t veterans any more ’ and he replied, ‘Not in Hereford, they’re not’.“Out of the homeless population in Britain,  per cent are veterans, and I believe there should be a dedicated officer for the ex-military in every council. I definitely back The Sun’s Veterans’ Pledge, because promises have not been kept.“Politicians talk about a covenant but when you start dealing with bureaucracy, no one cares. You have got to look after these people, because they looked after the country.“Lots of veterans on the street don’t have any paperwork. I had to prove everything three times – three lots of proof.“I was in a halfway house for a couple of nights, which was hell. I kipped on my daughter’s couch for a month and then the SAS Regimental Association paid for me to be put up in a BB.“Butit hadn’t been for them and The Sun, who campaigned to get me the bungalow I’m living in now, nothing would have happened.“I was  years in the forces. I did Northern Ireland, I did the Iranian Embassy and the Falklands. We need to do more for squaddies when they leave the service.“It starts with making sure they have a roof over their head and they have someone to talk to with the transition into civilian le.“It’s no wonder so many veterans wander off to the woods with a bit of rope.”LANCE Bombardier Ben Parkinson MBE is Britain’s most seriously injured veteran.The former paratrooper, who is now , lost both legs and suffered a broken pelvis and spine, as well as brain damage, when his military Land Rover hit an anti-tank mine in Afghanistan  years ago.He was initially awarded just £, by the MoD under its statutory compensation scheme for service personnel injured in combat.After a campaign it was increased to £,, which his family used to buy him a bungalow and fit it out with specialist equipment.Ben’s full-time carers, his mum Diane Dernie and stepdad Andrew, have valiantly battled for years to make sure his care is properly funded.Diane says: “I back The Sun’s campaign because we need to treat our veterans like heroes, just like the Americans do.The next Prime Minister needs to make this a top priority. We thought the Military Covenant had been enshrined in law, but it turns out it depends how your local area interprets it.“We also thought that veterans would get preferential referencing for medical services and things like that, but it also turns out that’s not the case. All that’s agreed is that they shouldn’t be disadvantaged.“Well, of course they shouldn’t be disadvantaged, there shouldn’t be any question of that. They should be advantaged. It’s one step forward and two back.”Diane, , adds: “The lawyers who launch witch-hunt investigations against veterans are making money out of other people’s heroism and service to their country. That’s unspeakable.“Ben left the Army this year. The bill for his rehabilitation is about £, a year and he gets £, towards that. That figure is under review but we consider ourselves lucky to have got that.“We had to threaten legal action to get it. Ben has a deep love of the Army and thinks everyone must have his best interests at heart.“Behind the scenes we’ve been fighting the MoD and it’s nearly finished me. We sold a property where we were going to retire to, to take legal action.“The funding is nowhere near enough. It’s a starting point and it gives us a chance to let Ben carry on. Ben’s happy when he’s busy but it takes a hell of a lot of support to make sure he has a le worth living.”But too often, this just isn’t the case.We hear from those we support about unacceptable waiting times for treatment, health services that don’t properly understand their needs and the sometimes devastating impacts on their wellbeing of leaving the military as a result of injury or illness.Most recently, we have been calling for veterans with complex rehabilitation needs to be given better access to the MoD’s state-of- the-art rehabilitation centre, Stanford Hall.An Office of Veterans’ Affairs would ensure all government departments are issuing policies which recognise their responsibility to those who have served, while having a Cabinet-level Minister would ensure the needs of our veterans are heard at the highest level.While the principles of the Armed Forces Covenant were enshrined in law in , there are currently no consequencesthe Covenant is not properly applied.We believe this needs to change, to properly deliver on the promise that no inidual should be disadvantaged as a result of their service in the Armed Forces.Help for Heroes has supported more than , wounded personnel and their families to date, but we know more can be done for them – which is why we believe it is vital for the Tory leadership contenders to be signed up to the Veterans’ Pledge and put the needs of wounded heroes back on the agenda.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But I had no idea how sneeringly “modern feudal” the whole circus was about to become.What a dismal little VIP gathering Archie’s christening has turned out to be. A PR disaster.Harry and Meghan insisted on conducting the whole thing in secret, refusing even to reveal who his godparents were.I don’t even care who they are —they are Robbie Williams or that plastic Canadian friend of Meghan’s who looks like a Love Island reject, I’d rather not know.But why make such a snitty point of it unless he’s trolling the very people who admire him It seems so unjoyful — the opposite of what a christening is meant to be.I know what his arguments are. He wants a “normal” le for Archie. He hates the Press and the paparazzi.But the truth is the royals get a huge amount of privacy. They have far more privacy than the average citizen.They are not snapped while picking their noses at a newsagent. They are not filmed going on holiday. No one knows where they go on holiday or even where they are when they are not performing their duties.No one sells stories on their private lives or punts pictures. No one takes pictures or follows them at all, because no newspaper would carry the images.Eventhey are spotted by someone, they have huge security teams, paid for by us, to keep us at bay.The royals do not want privacy, they want a private le in public, and no one has the right to that.In spite of this, Harry appears to have gone what I would describe as the full Hugh Grant. Last week it turned out that the actor has become so obsessed with the idea that the paps were following him he confronted an Italian official who was innocently filming rubbish dumped in the street.Everywhere Harry looks, he sees people who want to take advantage of him, which is not true and leads to this sad irascibility in which he forgets what is kind and decent —  and who is paying the bill.What has become of him  If you scan Meghan and Harry’s Instagram feed, you will see how distant the “people’s prince” has turned out. There is no shortage of cloying information on how much he “cares” about alpacas and Mothering Sunday and advancing his sanctimonious “monthly social awareness approach” on mental health or climate change. But it is extra-ordinary how detached from reality the whole thing feels — it is a syrupy, fantasist’s medley of posturing sub-Beyoncean baloney about animals in “gap yah” locations.But does he really care about any of this stuff It is almost ashe has picked a selection of vague, non-committal subjects specically engineered to give no idea what he is thinking, like Leonardo DiCaprio.The overall effect is truly insincere.While it is clear Harry loves the royal tradition of virtue-signalling, it is obvious he does not enjoy being a royal at all.

Carter Cooksonaposs parents said they felt like they had been hit by a bus for a second time after an inquest into his tragic death. Three-week-old Carteraposs plight went public earlier this year when the tiny boy was born into a race against time for a new heart.But a suitable organ was never found and Carter, from South Shields, was just  days old when he died at the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle on January , reports Chronicle Live .   Now an inquest has heard that after extensive tests and a post-mortem examination, the cause of the severe damage to his heart remains a mystery. Coroner Karen Dilks said Carter had suffered a sudden catastrophic event that caused damage to his heart around the time of his birth. But the underlying cause of it may never be known. It was a second tragedy for his parents Sarah and Chris Cookson, who lost their first son, Charlie, when he was just two years old.    The inquest at Newcastle Coroneraposs Court heard that when Carter was born by emergency c-section, there were no concerns other than his small size and transverse lie - when the baby is in a sideways position. The hearing was told he was initially well after delivery, but after three hours he was noted to have a low temperature, and at  hours, was noted to have a low heart rate and be struggling with breathing. Paediatric intensive care consultant Yamuna Thiru said Carter was transferred to the Freeman on December , where he was put on an Ecmo machine to pump blood around his body. Dr Thiru said Carteraposs heartnever recovered, and medics soon realised his only hope was to get a donor heart.    Carter was relying on the Ecmo machine to pump blood around his body, but when it needed changing again because of clots his weak body gave out. Unfortunately a donor heart didnapost become available in the last  hours before the disconnection of the Ecmo machine, Dr Thiru said. She added that none of the hospitalaposs tests were able to establish why Carteraposs heart was so badly damaged. Pathologist Dr Fraser Charlton said: An event had occurred around the time of birth that caused a large amount of the heart to die, probably very suddenly. He told the hearing that the damage was so extensive, there was nothing  that could have been done to treat Charlie, unless he had had a transplant.    Ms Dilks said: The sequence of events that led to Carteraposs death were that he had a sudden catastrophic event that led to severe damage to his heart. It was that, in combination with some complications of Ecmo which actually prolonged his le on one hand, but contributed to it on the other as the reason he died when he did. There is no other available conclusion than that it was a naturally occurring event. It must be so dficult from your perspective, the unanswered questions. Following the inquest, Carteraposs dad Chris said: Itaposs like weaposve been hit by a bus for a second time.

Alcoholic Victoria Parry, , had been told by a female judge at a previous hearing that,she had been a man, it would have been straight down the stairs to prison. Instead, she was handed a suspended sentence and slapped with a driving ban today by the same judge. A court heard she was dragged from the flaming wreck by other drivers on the A near Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, at around .pm on May , . A breathalsyer test showed she had  micrograms of alcohol per ml of breath - almost three times the legal limit of mcg.    Parry, of Stratford-upon-Avon, was handed an -month suspended sentence, and was banned from driving for  months in the sentencing at Birmingham Crown Court. Judge Sarah Buckingham - who sentenced her - previously sparked outrage when she had gave her a second chance on account of her gender. She told the court during the previous appearance: If Miss Parry was a man, there is no question it would have been straight down the stairs, because this is a shocking case of dangerous driving against a background of two previous convictions for excess alcohol. But this offence was committed in May  and she has not been in trouble since.  She has clearly got an alcohol problem. She is, whether she admits it or not, an alcoholic. When Parry was arrested she took a breath test at the police station almost two hours later and was still well over the legal limit. Prosecutor Tim Sapwell said: Her driving was such that she caught the rear bumper of a van, and she next hit the wing mirror of a Vauxhall Insignia, and then the side of a BMW very heavily. She hit it with such force that the BMWaposs rear wheel was knocked off and the car was written off. It caused her Fiat to spin in the road and go down the embankment into a wooded area where it caught fire. The court heard Parry had been banned from driving for three years in July  for her second excess alcohol offence.

The DraigCon event at The Printworks in Manchester had high expectations after a successful event last year. Hundreds of wizarding fans donned capes and hats to indulge their passion for JK Rowling’s world, reports the Manchester Evening News. Fans flocked to buy tickets for this yearaposs event, which promised to aposbe even bigger and betterapos. Organisers promised aposa Magical Market, wild and fantastical animals, plus some QA sessions with the Harry Potter actorsapos, autograph signings and more.   However the eventaposs Facebook page has been swamped with complaints from people who say it was aposnot at all what was advertisedapos.They said nobody was checking tickets at the entrances to The Printworks, so members of the public were allowed in without paying. They said the street itself was aposliterally a large market selling crap you can buy for half the price off the internetapos and despite paying upwards of £ for a ticket, you were being charged £ to hold an owl or a snake, and up to £ to get signatures from some of the actors. Lorna Bremner spent £ on two VIP tickets for her and her child and said she was aposabsolutely fumingapos. Loads of people hadnapost even bought tickets and were getting the free signatures, she said. Queue jumping was a joke as the queues were bigger in the VIP section anyway and didnapost amount to anything dferent to the standard tickets.  I spent an extra  quid just on getting pictures taken with an owl and a snake, which I thought would have been free and the wands, which were £  each. The potions class was overcrowded and we couldnapost hear the speaker so had to leave - plus the cosplay section was poor and they talked about cosplay in general, not Harry Potter themed. As a single mum who bought this as a birthday treat Iaposm highly disappointed. Louise Frankland said: Absolutely appalled by today. Seven tickets bought at £ each to see it open to general public without tickets, overcrowded, and certainly not as advertised. The children are so disappointed today and I am £ down. What a joke! I will be formally complaining. Allan Fouracre, who went there with his girlfriend and another couple, agreed, saying it was a aposwaste of moneyapos.    I wouldnapost , very poorly managed and cheaply done, he said. Merchandise stalls were full of cheap funko pops and other TV film series which had no association with Harry Potter. What we were entitled to as a ticket holder was boring and poor also very easily accessible to the general public who hadnapost paid for that experience. Staff were rude and had no idea were things where and what you were entitled to. He said: The general vibe was very unhappy yesterday. Lots of people were frustrated. The actors who appeared at the event included Chris Rankin , James Payton , Josh Herdman , Scarlett Byrneand more.    But visitors were unhappy with what was included in the ticket price. Jen Whittaker called it an aposabsolute waste of moneyapos and said she had aposthree very disappointed little boysapos. You had to pay extra for everything, she said. From £ to wear a sorting hat, to £ to hold and owl and the merchandise was overpriced and some not even Harry Potter related. Very poor. These were birthday presents for two of the boys and they were bored and disappointed. But not everyone was critical of the event. Kaye Houston travelled there from Lytham St Annes with her nine-year-old son Finneus and said they had a great time.  Brilliant day had by me and my son, she said. We enjoyed the potion making class, seeing the stalls, getting a few autographs and just the general buzz of it. Any stewards or staff we needed to speak to were really helpful in answering queries and everyone was very polite and nice. Thank you, youaposve really made my sonaposs year with this.  And Kerri Jones said: My second time at Draigcon and was not disappointed. We had an amazing weekend. Loved meeting all the actors actress they were all very friendly and happy to have a bit of a chat well they where doing the signings. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Everything was easy to find after studying the programme a little. Greg Dravenwas such a lovely bloke we got to sit down with him and had a lovely chat and find a bit more about him, his work and how he became an actor. Well done for another great event looking forward to the next one. A spokesperson for DraigCon said thousands of fans had visited The Printworks over the weekend and aposexperienced a multitude of magical attractions and experiencesapos.  They added: Weaposve had lots of fantastic feedback from people who attended the two day event and weaposre proud to be able to offer one of the lowest entry prices of any convention in the UK. We aim to deliver value for money to all of our ticket holders - this includes free autographsand access to many attractions.

Property landlord John Batrim recoils in horror as he lays bare the appalling state of the squalid Blackpool BB. Used needles and cigarette butts litter the dilapidated hotel which was forced to close down two years ago. The stomach-churning scenes will be shown in a new episode of Channel  series Nightmare Tenants, Slum Landlords tonight. In one horrying moment, Mr. Batrim notices that the illegal tenants had even used poo-smeared curtains as toilet roll.  “That’s just awful – covered in s**t and it looks like they’ve been using an old curtain to wipe their a**es on. The mind boggles,” says John. It’s not often I smell things like that.” John notices that the squatters had likely entered the property through the back door and then used its rooms as a place to shoot up.    In one scene, John encounters squatters who are told to leave - and they agree to depart without incident. John had been inspecting the property with a view to buying it and letting the rooms out as single bedsits. The bed and breakfast had once been a thriving business, due in part to its close proximity to Blackpool Pier.    But it closed down two years ago as its owners decided what to do with it and was subsequently seized by the squatters who used it as as drugs den. The episode lays bare the anti-social issues that plague the once-booming seaside resort. “Yes, there is an issue with drugs in Blackpool. You have to be vigilant when there are sharps lying around that could harm my colleague or I,” says John.

For while Savile’s vile criminal activities were not uncovered by the film-maker, the nasty views of the Westboro Baptist Church were there for all to see – often emblazoned on placards. The ultra-right, gay-bashing, Jew-hating congregation picketed funerals of US servicemen with banners saying “Thank God for dead soldiers” in protest at the lting of the ban on gay troops. Louis has now ed to the church to make another documentary. It turns out one of the newest members is not only British but was inspired to join by the original films.    “I saw myself as single for le until I watched your documentary and the Jeremy Kyle show about the church and I was very impressed with the Bible verses,” smirks misfit Simon Holroyd, a former postal worker from Bradford now reborn as religious fanatic Matthias. It was King James Bible verses about how women should obey men and submit to their husbands which prompted the disaffected young man to travel , miles to the close-knit Phelps family’s compound in the American Midwest. As Louis’s first documentary on the church in  and the second in  showed, at the centre of this holy hatred in Topeka, Kansas, was the firebrand founder Pastor Fred “Gramps” Phelps and his extended family. Phelps died five years ago but sadly the church still thrives. Having found his spiritual home among the cult’s  or so members, the new convert from Britain was swtly married to Gramps’ granddaughter Jael Phelps.    After defections by some of the young women rocked the family, marrying off those left to the few troubled souls who joined from the outside world was the most expedient way of making their escape virtually impossible. Brother Matthias and Jael have had three children since their wedding in . Deeply indoctrinated Jael says: “He was humble and modest and I felt that we could serve the Lord together.” Explaining the church’s rules for married couples, she adds: “The man dictates what the law in the home is and the we carries that out.” Unsurprisingly born-again hate-monger Brother Matthias didn’t fit in well in Britain and as a result is not a big fan of his home country. He says: “God hates the UK.” Taking a break from holding placards that spew bile, he claims Britain is doomed. He adds: “Things don’t look good for people in the UK. People hate each other. It’s a ided society between the  religion of Muslims and everyone .”    The brainwashed Brit, who was raised by his dad after losing his mum to cancer when he was , is no longer in contact with family back home. He says: “He’s not leading me down that path to hell any more.” His dad will be in good company, because it appears no one is exempt from the punishment of perishing with Satan unless they repent. Senior elder and social media guru Steve Drain says: “When someone dies of cancer, we call it a God-smack.” In the new BBC documentary called Surviving America’s Most Hated Family, Louis discovers the congregation has moved with the times. As well as the placard-waving, the Church is also spreading its poison using the power of social media. Nine days ago the religious zealots tweeted using the hashtags #filth, #shame and #repent to condemn the Pride march in New York. Media savvy elder Drain is the marketing brains behind the placards, videos and now cute dog memes on the internet. It is all aimed at pushing their vile homophobic and anti-Semitic philosophy around the world. Even British recruit Brother Matthias has joined the online ministry of hate, making films denouncing the UK for its decadent culture and attacking gay celebrities such as Sir Elton John.Using his Twitter account to add even more fuel to the fire, he has also added Theresa May , the Labour Party and the entire European Union to the seemingly endless list of sinners facing eternal hell and damnation.  The exceptions include Brother Matthias’ right-wing heroes Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg and Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, who will no doubt be thrilled to find their politics appeal to this bigot from Bradford.Before founder Gramps died in  aged , it was rumoured he had been excluded for having a change of heart. Since then a council of seven male elders has seized power, tightening their grip on the already subservient women members, and turning their female relatives into slaves. However, the cult claims the hottest part of hell is reserved for those who leave the family, like Drain’s daughter Lauren who escaped  years ago, and one of Pastor Phelps’ granddaughters, Megan Phelps-Roper who fled in .  Megan is now Westboro’s most prominent critic. She has a book on the way and a movie deal in the offing. Megan has even married outside the church and has a baby daughter. Now a writer and regular on the speaking circuit, the cult survivor tells audiences how she was indoctrinated by her family’s hateful preaching.

Emma Ravenscroft called  and told police Daniel Hall was threatening her with a machete. However, she forgot to hang up and could be heard saying aposIaposm blagging it — this will get him nicked.apos During the hoax call, which triggered a response by armed police, Ravenscroft told a call handler: Heaposs running around with a machete and Iaposm now hiding in the car with my boyfriend. Heaposs got a big machete in his hand and he just tried to get me with it — he held it against my throat.    Ravenscroft has now been convicted of wasting police time and criminal damage. But neighbour, Daniel, and his partner Kim Doughty, from Handforth, Cheshire, still have to live in the same street as the woman who tried to ruin their lives. Mum-of-one Kim, , says: It’s been an absolute nightmare. It all happened the week after Christmas but the goodwill was sadly in short supply in our street. Emma and I are still neighbours so I just try to avoid her as much as I can. She has caused us endless stress with her lies, for no reason at all.”    Kim and Dan met four years ago when he moved into her street. The couple began dating in December  and settled into a happy relationship. But problems began after they argued with Emma Ravenscroft, also a neighbour. Kim said: Emma moved in about three years ago and at first we were friendly. She seemed nice and she borrowed stuff and stopped for a chat, as neighbours do. But then, she offered me money to clean her flat and I refused. I have worked as a cleaner in the past. After that, she got the hump with me and she was very off-hand. She was quite abusive in the street and I tried to avoid her. I started staying over at Dan’s house because he lived further up the street. But on December  last year, Ravenscroft’s car was vandalised – and someone daubed bad language in bleach on it.    She wrongly assumed that Dan and Kim were responsible. Kim said: “I have no idea who damaged her car but it certainly wasn’t me. “Dan and I had just watched a Christmas film and we were turning the lights off, ready for bed around pm, when there was a loud smash and glass flying everywhere. Dan was shouting that someone had smashed the living room window and then we heard banging and screaming at the front door. When the police sirens sounded, I was really relieved – I thought they were coming to help us.” But when the shocked couple opened their front door they were confronted by a line of armed police. Kim said: “They were screaming ‘Put your hands up!’ at Dan. It was horrendous. We were the victims and we couldn’t work out why they were arresting him.  But it was so scary, because they had guns, so we had to do as we were told. “It was only after Dan had been searched and handcuffed and the house was searched that we were told Emma had made a complaint that he had threatened her with a machete. “Of course we don’t have a machete. Dan is not that sort of bloke he would never hurt anyone. “We had CCTV so that was checked too – and of course it was clear. It was a totally wild goose chase.” Ravenscroft appeared before Stockport Magistrates last week. The court was told she made the call after she found someone had used bleach to write the word on the bonnet of her car. Armed police were scrambled to the scene but realised it was a hoax when Ravenscroft failed to end the  call and was overheard admitting she had made it up.  Ravenscroft was ordered to complete a -month community order and was also issued with a year-long restraining order, fined £ and ordered to pay £ costs. She was cleared of assaulting Dan and Kim. Cheshire Police confirmed several officers attended due to the mention of a machete — but no weapon was found at Danaposs home or in the surrounding area. An officer who attended said Ravenscroft had left the line open after the  call and was heard saying she was going to get him sent to jail. One of the armed PCs said: The use of the word aposmacheteapos prompts an armed response. Emma came out when we arrived and started shouting about what she said had happened. I went into her house with her.

Prosecutors said police later found her friend lying drunk in -year-old Gary McBrideaposs north Belfast apartment. McBride, of Alexandra Gardens, faces charges of attempted sexual assault of a child and three counts of child abduction over the incident last week. Refusing bail, a judge at Belfast High Court said: I consider that this applicant is a danger and a risk of re-offending. Police investigating reports that two girls and a boy had gone missing spoke to the -year-old after she ed to her home in a distressed state on June , the court was told.  She then took officers to the apartment in a bid to locate her -year-old female friend. Crown lawyer Kate McKay said: They discovered she was there, fully dressed and in a highly intoxicated state, on the bedroom floor of the flat. McBride was located in the living room, smoking and drinking beer. Both girls had so-called aposlove bitesapos on their necks, according to Mrs McKay. She said the younger girl hugged her friend and apologised for having left her there. McBride told police he invited them and a -year-old boy back after encountering all three outside in the rain, claiming they had informed him they were . But according to the prosecution the -year-old girl remembered telling him her real age. She claimed McBride had grabbed her while she was on the settee and said: Come you with me into my room. It was alleged that when she resisted and refused to go he told her: Iaposm only messing with you sweetheart. During questioning McBride said he had been listening to music and playing pool with the youngsters before going to bed and leaving them in the living room. When he woke and found them still there he went out to an off licence, ing with beer, cider and vodka, the court heard. McBride claimed the -year-old girl then got drunk very quickly, resulting in him asking the boy to take her away. He said there was no sexual intention when he invited them to his home, Mrs McKay added. But opposing bail, she said police believe he poses a danger to the public.

There was ham that contained no ham, lamb doner kebabs without a trace of lamb and pork sausages that also had lamb and beef in them.    Experts also insist Tory cuts to public services are allowing dodgy meat to get through as trading standards officers are too stretched to carry out tests.

He added: “How would you know that the ham in your sandwich is not really ham ” Which  strategic policy adviser Sue Davies said: “It is concerning , six years on from the horse meat scandal, consumers are still being misled about meat they are eating.  “The ­Government and local authorities must clamp down on food fraud.” The Local Government Association’s Simon Blackburn added: “Signicant funding cuts are affecting council services, which include trading standards budgets and staffing being cut by half.  “The ending of dedicated Food Standards Agency funding for food sampling has also made it very dficult to maintain sampling levels.” Our Freedom of Information request to the FSA found retailers, ­restaurants and caterers had meat products that were not properly labelled. In , products including supermarket beef burgers and ready meals were found to contain horse meat, sparking outrage and leading to supermarket shelves being cleared.

But despite founding the hugely successful Primark chain, Arthur Ryan lived a tragic secret le blighted by death, heartache and fears he wold be kidnapped. The businessman has died aged , Primark has confirmed. Primark boss Paul Marchant said: Arthur Ryan was a truly gted retailer and a visionary leader. He was a true retail pioneer. He innovated and was never complacent, despite many successes.    He challenged us all to be the best we can be. His legacy will continue in the business that he founded and built. Those of us who worked closely with him will cherish his friendship and wisdom and he will be hugely missed by all of his Primark family.” He is believed to have been born in Ireland in , although even this is a closely guarded secret. Ryan began his career in retail after moving to London. He started out as a tie buyer for Swan  Edgar but soon moved to fashion wholesaler, Carr  McDonald.    After honing his craft in Britainaposs capital, Ryan ed to his native Dublin and began work at Dunnes Stores. Aged just , he opened his first Penneys store on Dublinaposs Mary Sreet in . Just  years later, the model had proved so successful Ryan took his brand global and opened his first shops in Britain. They were re-named Primark to avoid legal problems with the American chain, JC Penney. While always a staple on the high street, the storeaposs popularity exploded in  when it bought a huge number of Littlewoods outlets. This coupled with Primarkaposs close attention to what was on the catwalks - and ability to copy styles for a fraction of the price - cemented it as a shopperaposs favourite. It was even affectionately dubbed Primarni - a nod to how closely it followed designer brands.  But while his businesses were flourishing, Ryan was experiencing a very dark time in his private le. While he still visited stores once a fortnight - his le was lived in utmost secrecy. Few would recognise one of the most influential men in British fashion, who even after stepping down as Primarkaposs chief executive was still its chairman. He has appeared in just one promotional video for the chain and lived in one of Dublinaposs best protected homes. Ryan was rarely seen in public without his team of bodyguards and was said to have been terried for his safety. His concerns were not entirely unfounded. At the height of Northern Irelandaposs Troubles, Irish retail magnates were often targets for the IRA. Ben Dunne, a department store boss, was even snatched by the terror organisation in . But even after the Troubles ended, Ryanaposs preoccupation with safety and anonymity did not.  He was rarely seen out in public without a disguise, even though he was said to be the le and soul of the party when he was with his friends. And even though he had a retail career spanning almost more than  years, the first time he was photographed and spoke in public was at the Retail Week awards back in , where he was honoured with the letime achievement award. Very little is known about his private le. Married to former entertainer, Alma Carroll, the couple had one daughter, Jess Ryan. The retail boss, who is arguably more successful than Philip Green, also had four children from a previous marriage. Ryanaposs le has also been blighted by unimaginable tragedy. His son Barry and grandson Barry Davis, , drowned after they were pulled out to sea by a freak wave. They had been fishing with Barry Jnraposs girlfriend Niamh OaposConnor, who also lost her le, at Baltimore rocks in West Cork.  The young couple were swept out to sea by the wave and Barry ed in to help them but got caught up in it too. Barryaposs daughter Charlotte, then , witnessed the whole thing and spoke at their inquest about running to find help but coming back to discover they had all died. She said: Niamh was screaming. My dad told me to keep going. He swam out to Niamh. I thought as I was walking up the hill that they would be okay and I was making a big deal of it. I saw Barry was going backwards to the other side. Niamh and my dad were closer. I couldnapost see Barry. I started to panic. Two tourists who heard her cries for help called  but despite the fact the Baltimore Leboat crew were on the scene in less than  minutes it was too late to save Niamh and Barry Snr, whose bodies were found floating close to where they went in.

Mikeaposs sister Gabby Gregory says everything he did was for other people, and he refused to let anyone spend money on a funeral. Gabby said: He faced it once and he beat it. We thought he would get better so we didnapost have time to save for it.    He wanted a non-ceremonial cremation so we had to respect his wishes, we had to come to that decision.

Mike was first diagnosed with cancer in October  and following a bone marrow transplant and months of chemotherapy, he went into remission. But last August, the cancer came back and Mike was told he had between just two weeks and two months left to live. Gabby says he vowed to hang on for as long as he could, because he wanted to spend one final Christmas with his children. Mike made it to December, but sadly was in hospital on Christmas Day.

She now has a speech impediment and a constantly dry mouth.    Caroline said: My message to other people after what Iaposve been through would simply be, ‘Don’t smoke and look after yourself.apos After starting smoking when she was just , the -year-old admitted she had been feeling run down but thought it was just work stress. She used over-the-counter treatments for her ulcer but when it didnapost improve went to see her GP. Caroline said: I still wasn’t worried. I thought it was a bad ulcer and something like cancer never ever crossed my mind. It was there for about three weeks, so I went to the doctor to seethey could prescribe anything. The GP looked at it and referred me to the oral department at Truroaposs Royal Cornwall Hospital. Still I didnapost think cancer. I thought they might need to cut it out and then it would be fine. Four weeks late her oral surgeon gave her the devastating news that her tumour contained cancer cells.  Caroline said: “Still I was completely oblivious, I always associated smoking with lung cancer, never mouth cancer. “When I got the results it was a real shock, I think I was in total denial and was convinced they had made a mistake. “I went home and frantically searched the internet trying to figure out what was going on. I think I went through the five stages of grief - denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. “I looked up pictures of it and was totally horried.” She had surgery at the Royal Cornwall to remove the tumour in June , with the surgeon also removing a saliy gland and around  lymph nodes from her neck – five of which turned out to be cancerous. Caroline said: The operation lasted eight-and-a-half hours because they had to keep taking the tissue and sending it to the lab to seeit was cancerous, working away until they got to non-cancerous tissue. By the time they removed the tumour it was  to cm long. It was behind my tongue and between the floor of my mouth.” Doctors also discovered a hole in Carolineaposs mouth, which was allowing food and drink to go straight into her neck. She said: ! could feel drink going down my neck. It felt like air bubbling and I thought it was odd but I’d just had surgery and didn’t know it wasn’t normal,” she said.  “They fixed it but I spent three weeks on a gastric tube which I found really traumatising.” Caroline left hospital after three weeks and was able to eat and drink normally after five weeks, by which time she could swallow again too. But because the cancer had already spread to some of her lymph nodes, eight weeks after her operation she began a six week course of radiotherapy, targeting her tongue. She said: “It basically cooked me. The first two weeks were fine, but by week four I wanted to end it all. “I found it dficult to breathe and the inside of my throat felt like it had been burned. It was all swollen. I had lots of blisters inside my mouth which was agony. “From week five to eight I was able to drink about half a bottle of water a day, which was really painful and all I could eat was half a can of soup - which took me two hours - and a bit of watermelon. “I ended up losing three stone and at one point doctors said they would put a feeding tube in me. I was terried of the side effects of that and the impact it would have on my ability to swallow. “My mood was so low, I felt lethargic and dizzy all the time. I had to wear a special mask for radiotherapy which clips to the table and made me feel very claustrophobic.  I found the whole thing traumatising and have suffered with post-traumatic stress disorder because of it.” Now in remission, Caroline has toto hospital for regular six week check-ups, which will continue but gradually reduce over the next five years. She said: “I’m terried of the cancer coming back and killing me. I’ve spoken to people who have had it six times. I don’t think I’ll breathe a sigh of relief until I’ve had my last check up in five yearsapos time. “When I wake up I still have to do exercises with my neck every morning, because it’s really stf.

With your help we can give hundreds of children who’ve never been to the beach a holiday this summer. Maybe we forget the excitement of our first trip to the seaside… so to jog all our memories our brilliant writers have reminisced about the very first time they saw then sea! Kevin Maguire Blessed are those of us born by the seaside so it was as much a part of my childhood as a coal fire, glass milk bottles and the Daily Mirror. Golden sands, crashing waves and a shivery breeze blowing along the beach even in the hottest summers was a way of le. Mam would push the youngest bairn at any time in the pramalong the front with the older kids trailing behind. I can’t remember not seeing the sea so it’s painful to think one-in-every-five kids has yet to enjoy the relentless exciting power of tides coming in and going out. No sandcastle however high with moat no matter how deep is able to withstand waves heading up the beach. I love valleys, moors and mountains but nothing beats sea shores.  Sara Wallis To this day, my brother and I still refer to my -year-old grandmother as Grandma Boats. Or sometimes even just Boats. I’m not sure she’s thrilled about it, but what can you do  When I was little, she and my grandpa lived in Southend and the name stuck - even though she hasn’t lived beside the seaside for donkeys. So I was one of the lucky ones who visited the seaside on a regular basis. I don’t remember the moment I first clapped eyes on the sea as a tiny child, but I do remember walking along the beach, singing about the ‘Prom, Prom, Prom, Tiddely-om-pom-pom’. I also remember harassing my parents to visit Peter Pan’s Playground, Southend Pier’s er, top fun fair as it was known in the s. Freezing cold swimming  Soggy sandcastles  Fish and chips covered in sand  Most likely. But through these rose-tinted spectacles, they were the best days ever.    Anila Baig I must have been very small when I first went to Scarborough - I was young enough to wear a two-piece swimsuit - and I remember that everyone seemed in a good mood here in this magical place of sand and sun. It felt like I was in another country, I loved the feel of the sand under my feet and the smell of the sea air.  My dad rolled his trousers up and put a knotted handkerchief on his head and my brother and I built competing sandcastles. We would race giggling into the sea to wash ourselves then traipse back to our spot covered in sand again. When my niece was four she demanded we take her to the seaside- she was born in Japan- so we rocked up to Morecambe. It was about minus  and we nearly froze to death on the beach as we battled gales and tried to eat our sand encrusted fish and chips but, to my niece, it was the best day ever. She takes after me. Paul Routledge  I’m nearly three years old, with my mother on the sea front in Scarborough in . We came here on a train from pit-town Normanton, west Yorkshire, where the pigeons fly backwards so they don’t get coal dust in their eyes. All this lovely sand to play with my bucket and spade. The sea smells, it tastes bitter and it’s very cold. I don’t think I like it. The waves wrecked my castle.  We’re going back to our “digs” in St Sepulchre Street. Mam says we’re back to the beach tomorrow, andI’m good I can have some chips. With scraps. That makes up for having to paddle in cold water, where the sand scratches my toes. Mam says we’re lucky to be here, but she’s sitting among crowds of people and I’m scared I might lose her. And one day I did, and cried a lot. Bloody seaside, I bet she said.  Alison Phillips I’m not entirely sureit’s the first time I saw the sea.. but it’s definitely the first time I remember feeling the sea washing around me, as I tried to learn to swim. We’d gone - as we did every year - for a day trip on Biss’s Buses with my grandma and grandad to Frinton On Sea. It’s that stretch of the Essex coastline deemedto be posher than Portofino because it didn’t have a pub. Or a chippie. I know!  You could spend six hours in Frinton just waiting for a stretch of beach to appear big enough to spread out our tartan blanket and those stripey nylon chairs which your legs stuck to and sliced your fingers off each time you put them down. But it was aways worth the wait. That summer’s day I was determined to learn to swim and had decidedI lay in the water long enough, sooner or later it would just ‘happen’. Sure enough, it didn’t. Just as surely I spent the next three days with acute sunburn on my back. It was  and suncream hadn’t been invented in Essex. More than  years ago I remember the fun and freedom of that sunny day as clearly as the sunburn which followed. It’s a tragedy and an outrage one in four Brit kids aren’t having days like those .

In August last year, he became the first person to free climb the worldaposs tallest climbing wall, Bjoeks Climb Center, in Groningen, Netherlands - which is m high.  Then in October, he became the first person to free climb the UKaposs tallest climbing wall without any safety gear. But he said todayaposs ascent was the hardest heaposs done and the stunt is what his climbing career has been leading up so far. Speaking toMr King, of Oxford, said: When I was  I first saw the Shard and thought I have got to climb this. That planted the seed for me.    I have done a lot of preparing for this, I have just kept on working at it. I am speechless - It is unreal. Speaking to Mail Online he said:  It’s a totally remarkable experience. Euphoria is an understatement. It’s Godlike feeling, when your endorphins and dopamine are all firing at once. It’s indescribable. Mr King, who is also personal trainer, said his ascent of the building took  minutes. The daredevil said the most testing part of the climb as when he reached the buildingaposs pinnacle.  At the end it was a bit tiring. There are generators near the top of the building and there was a lot of dirt and grease on them, and I had to push on to the next level to get past them. The climber said he has worked hard on his climbing skills and doesnapost believe his behavior is reckless. Posting on his Instagram afterwards he said: In the past I’ve been called a daredevil, an adrenaline junkie, a reckless teenager and much more. I’ve always found that these names come from those who are ignorant or misunderstood about what I really do and why.  It takes years of training and careful preparation to be where I am today, and this practice is achievable only because I see myself as someone who has followed a respectable passion, albeit an unusual one. I believe that every single one of us has a gt. Your mission is to find that gt, make it your passion, and then make it your purpose. Mr King, who posted a video of his feat on his Instagram page, said he was spoken to by police after reaching the top of the Shard. A spokesman for the Met Police said: Police were called at :hrs on Monday,  July following reports of a ‘free-climber’ on the Shard, a politan Police spokesperson said.

I know what I have here and I work well with the staff.“I know how big a club this is and I am really happy to be here.“And what is important for me is I want to be one of those players who go in the history books of this club and say he was one who got promotion for the team.“I want to improve and learn every week. As a team I think we got better last season as the games continued and I think I got better as a goalkeeper.“We want to keep doing that this year and,we do, we will get back to where we want to be.“Everybody knows where this club belongs and everybody wants to be part of achieving that ultimate goal of getting promoted.“That’s a big point of incentive and motivation for all the players.”Siegrist admits a bonus for him as he ed to work last week was teaming up again in training with fellow-goalie Deniz Mehmet.He was at United until January and has ed with a view to signing up again.“We crossed paths before when we were younger, at international tournaments with Switzerland and Turkey.“Coming from clubs down south we also faced each other. We are competing for the same place but there is always the goalkeepers’ union that means we stick together and it is nice to be working every day with someone you like.”Very much one for looking forward, Siegrist refuses to dwell too long on the disappointing end to last term that saw United again miss out on promotion in the play-offs.And when he does look back, he takes the positives.“I think what happened last year is part of our motivation for this year but I don’t want to speak too much about it because we start from zero again for a new season.“You do every year. In terms of experience it is good that we have had big games, big occasions together and that will help us.“It is like money in the bank but this season is about doing it consistently and picking up points over the whole of the year.”Tonight sees the start of a busy weekend when the entire squad will be involved in a friendly at Brechin before heading for Dumbarton tomorrow to do it all again.Two games in less than  hours may seem unusual but, for Siegrist, it will be the perfect way to prepare for the start of the competitive action in the Betfred Cup at Hearts next week.“So far as fitness goes we are good and game time is the most valuable time you have as a player,” he added.“You can train all week butyou don’t have a game at the end of it you are not bringing everything you’ve worked

Preceding them was The Camans with a slew of classic covers to get everyone moving and across the field in the Brewers Lounge, Brian McColm delivered acoustic indie rock classics to a chilled tent of beer-enthusiasts.Sunday saw revellers recovering and the tunes become more relaxing. These ranged from the soulful country-tinged songs of Liam Somerville to the harp-infused blues from Avocet and Lochgilphead#s Bar None Choir.Fyne Ales managing director Jamie Delap said: #Despite everything the weather threw at us, we had a great weekend. It was a battle for everyone to set up camp in the heavy rain on Friday, but they were rewarded with the best line up of beers we have put on and the atmosphere in the main marquee for the Friday evening was amazing with Banjo Lounge  and the Massaoke getting everyone in the tent up dancing.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"monsters and magic come to lochgilphead booksigning","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead#s Argyll Book Centre is holding a book signing with Lari Don.The Secret of the Kelpie author will be in the indie book shop on Saturday June  to read her new book to eager ears and talk to readers about their favourite folk tales and inventing monsters.After a quick break, Lari willto read excerpts from her spellbinding Spellchasers trilogy to inspire you to imagine magical adventures of your own and tell one of your favourite myths.Born in Chile, Lari Don was brought up in Scotland where she has worked in politics and for the BBC.

An interim evaluation took place in December  with minor changes being implemented in January  to address some minor issues.ldquoA more detailed evaluation was conducted in April  which provided useful feedback from students, staff and parents from all nine high schools.ldquoThe vast majority of respondents highlighted the importance of having access to a library for reading, digital, research and study.ldquoThe feedback has been analysed and options for realising the decision of previous council to identy savings is ongoing.ldquoIt will also be critical to ensure that future library provision needs to be equitable across the authority.To which councillor Anderson: ldquoFor Galashiels Academy this has not been a good experience.

Inclusive Growth Deal.The deal is seeking to attract tourists to the area and boost business, and is the result of collaboration between the Westminster and Holyrood Governments and local authorities in the region.It is hoped that the investment will create more than , jobs within the Borderlands region.Infrastructure Secretary Michael Matheson said: ldquoI am delighted we have reached this important milestone in signing Heads of Terms for the Borderlands Deal.ldquoSuccessful delivery of the deal will create jobs, protect existing ones and extend the benefits of economic growth to even more communities across Scotland.ldquoAlongside the establishment of a new enterprise agency for the south of Scotland, and activities of the South of Scotland Economic Partnership, the Scottish Governmentrsquos pound million investment will deliver signicant and lasting benefits right across the region.A full cross border feasibility study in to bringing the Borders Railway to Hawick, Newcastleton and on to Carlisle also forms part of the deal.Transport agencies either side of the Border will work on a cross-border study for the A corridor as well as exploring an integrated transport system.The package of investment will also include broadband and mobile signal investment designed to bring the region up to UK wide levels of connectivity and a Borderlands Energy Investment Company to generate cheaper energy for the region and help the Borderlands become the first carbon neutral region in the UK.A pound million Mountain Bike Innovation Centre in the Tweed Valley aims to establish a world-class destination for research, development and tourism around mountain biking.John Lamont, MP for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk, said: ldquoThis is fantastic news for the Borders ndash this deal is packed full of projects which will boost the Borders economy.ldquoFor too long, the Border at Berwick has been viewed as this line which prevents collaboration.ldquoIt is great to see this deal ignoring this Border and looking at how the whole region can be better served, and the economy better supported.ldquoEvery penny of this pound million investment is set to benefit the whole Borderlands region by bringing in thousands of jobs, millions more visitors and improving connectivity.ldquoI am particularly pleased that the Borders Railway extension will receive this pound million boost for a full study into how we can bring the line to Hawick, Newcastleton and on to Carlisle.ldquoLess tangible but equally important is the investment in broadband, tourism, business and energy which the whole of the Borders is set to benefit from.Scottish Secretary David Mundell said:ldquoItrsquos fantastic news that the UK Government is to invest up

existing business, encouraging new ventures and bringing a wealth of improvements to people who live and work in the area and to visitors.ldquoThe Borderlands Deal has made huge progress in the last  months.ldquoId like to thank the five lrmlocal authorities who have worked so well together, along with the UK and Scottish governments, to achieve this.ldquoThe south of Scotland and northernmost

said: ldquoHaving been involved in the Borderlands since the beginning, Irsquom pleased to see this deal finally agreed as it has been a long time coming.ldquoThe five local councils deserve enormous

planning development on the foot of the Eildon Hills.Rural Renaissance, the contracting arm of Melrose-based JS Crawford property developers, wants to build  homes on the Croft, near Dingleton Road, Melrose.Some of the new properties would tower m about the height of Dingleton Road, and the council has so far received  objections and representations.However, councillors sitting on Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning and building standards committee, which met on Monday July , opted to stick with planning officerrsquos recommendation to approve the development.Speaking at the meeting on behalf of the lsquoDonrsquot Build on the Eildonsrsquo campaign group, Melrose resident Carrie Henderson told councillors: ldquoBad design has been compounded by certain stipulations made in the planning brief.ldquoThe requirement for a road to loop around the nursery, when combined with the awkward levels on the site, have results in plans for houses on the southern slopes being some  metres higher than the level of the road.ldquoBe in no doubt, this housing estate will be dominant, intrusive and jarring. It will be an eyesore.Philip Neaves, from Edinburgh-based Felsham Planning and Development, spoke on behalf of Rural Renaissance.He said: ldquoThe Croft is an allocated development site that was allocated in .ldquoThe reporter who allocated the site would have been well aware of the sensitivity of the site but has still allocated it.ldquoWhat we have is proposals for  houses for private sale and seven affordable housing units.ldquoThe site, when viewed from Melrose, appears as part of the settlement, not the countryside, and views of the site from the Eildons are limited.ldquoThere are signicant economic benefits to the development, not just for employment during the construction phase but for nearby residents as well.Nearly all of the councillors expressed reservations about the development, but only one, Galashiels councillor Sandy Aitchison, voted against the proposals.He told the committee: ldquoThe fact is the reporter has made a big mistake here and the land should never have been allocated for housing in the first place.ldquoFurthermore, I donrsquot like the fact wersquove got affordable housing as a token gesture, itrsquos not spread out in the site and there are no family homes.\"Do people who need affordable homes not have families ldquoThere are so many objections. Many are from where and they are asking us to step in and protect this site which we as a local authority are charged with protecting.ldquoI really object to this application for a number of reasons.Melrose and Leaderdale councillor Tom Miers, who chairs the committee, also criticised the proposals but said he believes it can be acceptedthe council imposes certain planning conditions: ldquoI have real problems with the design and concept. I think the houses at the back are much too high and they stick out too much.ldquoThe middle three in particular, which will be at the back of the site, should be reduced in height.He suggested that the houses be reduced, by way of a planning condition, from three storey houses down to two storey.All councillors except councillor Aitchison were in agreement, and as he failed to find a seconder for his motion to reject the application, the proposals were granted planning permission without the need for a vote.Speaking after the meeting, Ms Henderson said: ldquoOver  people objected to this development and yet in the end it felt like their opinion counted for nothing. Todayrsquos decision is obviously a huge disappointment for them.ldquoUnfortunately, the planning committee couldnrsquot, or wouldnrsquot, see past the fact that this site is in the local plan.ldquoThe arguments we put forward that the proposal for the Croft is sub-standard and would irrevocably scar the view of the Eildons fell on completely deaf ears and the committee happily waved it through.ldquoFuture generations will look back and wonder how it was possible that a housing estate was ever allowed to be built on the beautul Eildons. But by then, of course, it will be too late.ldquoThe members of the planning committee, bar the one councillor who objected, should be ashamed of themselves for the decision they made today."},{"url":null,"title":"homophobic-selkirk-man-ordered-to-pay-compensation-to-couple","story":"A LABOURER from Selkirk has admitted hurling homophobic abuse towards two men.Then a month later Andrew Gillie approached both and told themthey didnt drop charges he would kill them.The -year-old of Buccleuch Road, pleaded guilty at the towns sherf court to behaving in a threatening or abusive manner and making abusive and homophobic comments in Yarrow Terrace, Selkirk, on August .He also admitted a charge of threatening the two men in Bridge Street, Selkirk, on September .Procurator fiscal Graham Fraser said the first incident happened at .pm when the two men, who are in a relationship with each other, became aware of Gillie and a female standing on a pavement.Gillie made a homophobic comment about one of the men.Mr Fraser said: \"He is fed up being targeted about his sexuality and was alarmed at what had taken place.\"The fiscal said Gillie had been cautioned and charged over that but came across the two men at about .pm on September  when they were walking their dog.Mr Fraser said: \"He said you better drop the charges or I will kill you.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

Five minutes in a car can cover a distance which would represent a fairly long walk.Itrsquos kind of a simple principle, I know, but one I sometimes forget, as I did a couple of weekends ago. We set off from an event at Amisfield Walled Garden for a walk. My idea was to walk along the River Tyne to Hailes Castle and thenndash by car a -minute round trip.We had some supplies in the form of fruit in my bag and a little water. It was a sunny and warm day and so we set off on our adventure.We began the walk at the old Abbey Bridge which spans the Tyne close to Amisfield. As you walk under its ancient ribbed arches of this late medieval bridge, you get a real sense of its age and the beauty of its construction.The path beyond follows the river and it is almost impossible now to imagine that a great abbey once stood here, with connections to the infant Mary Queen of Scots. A ruined old mill of later centuries still stands here. I reflected on the stories of this location: a courageous nun who defied a flood in the th century and a gruesome murder in the th century and just visible in the near distance the old graveyard, now ringed with trees and almost unrecognisable as a resting place for the dead.A labourer once thought he saw a ghost at the graveyard, but it proved to be something , and I had a wry smile at that tale of a drunken evening over  years ago. These are all tales I have already told here, but they entered my head as we wandered to the gate that led along the northern bank of the river.Hailes Castle is on the southern bank of the river and I knew that there was a bridge that would takes us over. So we set off to find the bridge.But it took us over four hours.It was a stunning walk, with wild flowers and trees decorating the riverbank almost all the way. A grey heron seemed to follow us perhaps he was warning us that the walk was longer than Irsquod anticipated.It is a walk decorated with history too, of course. A stone in the corner of the field by the first gate caught my eye. Deeply ingrained groove marks on it intrigued me. I was later told that it could be the marks of a plough, as the tips of the plough have scraped over the stone a ploughman unwittingly leaving evidence of his unrecorded toil.Halfway along the walk we arrived at the small hamlet of Sandyrsquos Mill. The cottages and mill itself have been beautully restored. The th-century mill still has its waterwheel, although itrsquos now embedded in silt. The mill ceased working  years ago and was transformed into a residential property, but with much of the old machinery inside still intact. It appears to be a very sympathetic and sensitive restoration.It was beyond Sandyrsquos Mill that the distance began to take its toll. The young kids were tired and desperately looking for the bridge. I spotted Traprain Law some distance away and realised that I had badly misjudged the distance and time it would take with wee ones. We had to sit and have a rest and story, with that grey heron listening, to gather the energy to continue.The kids didnrsquot complain much as we wandered along the still-beautul path, now desperately looking for the bridge. As we had rested wersquod phoned for friends to come and lsquorescuersquo us at Hailes Castle with chocolate and water, and we knew they were there waiting for us.Irsquove never been quite so pleased to see Hailes Castle. It loomed suddenly from across the river. I had never approached it from this direction and it certainly did its best to impress. The bridge was just a wee way further and we finally crossed it with a sense of relief.When we arrived at the castle, the kids devoured the chocolate and water, in a way that reminded me of a scene in the movie Ice Cold in Alex. Thank goodness for good friends.Wersquod made it and what a sense of adventure ndash and an achievement!I sat with the kids and told stories as my we went with the friends to retrieve our car. Hailes Castle drips with history but they wanted tales about giants.The day was a lesson for me: to think more carefully about distance when setting on a walk! I thoroughly recommend the path, especially on a lovely summerrsquos day. But itrsquos going to take half a dayyou have kids. So prepare for that!Unbelievably, the kids later wanted to go to a playpark. ldquoWhere do they get the energy  my we asked.ldquoFrom us!

It is better than some human beings are treated ndash that is the sad truth.Mr Farnsworth was presenting an annual report on the racecoursersquos performance over the last financial year.The Beast from the East snow storm, an outbreak of equine influenza, and a long spell of dry weather all contributed to what he described as one of the worst years the course had been through in his memory.A number of key fixtures were cancelled and profits fell.In December, four horses died during one day of racing at the course but a subsequent review by the British Horseracing Authority ruled that the course and race organisers were not at fault.Councillor Gordon Mackett asked Mr Farnsworththe racecourse had been affected by animal welfare concerns.The course manager said: ldquoWe did have a horrible day when there were four fatalities however, these were all completely separate incidents.ldquoIn a sport like this you will get injuries and fatalities from time to time. It is horric for the people involved.Mr Farnsworth said that the public were becoming more aware of incidents like these through social media which, he said, ldquofuelled the debate around animal welfare.However, he said there had been no indication that it had had an impact on events at Musselburgh, which saw record crowds at its Easter Day racing this year and another sell-out Ladies Day.His report to the committee revealed that the racecourse had reported a loss over the last financial year after it paid over pound, of legal costs relating to the ongoing process by East Lothian Council to find new third-party operators to run the course.Councillor Kenny McLeod questioned why the costs were being met by the course and not the council itself.However, depute chief executive of the council Alex McCrorie told the councillor that the costs were charged to the racecourse because when the new operator was procured it would be the racecourse that benefitted.He conceded to Mr McLeod that, without the legal costs being taken from the coursersquos funds, it would have been in profit last year.East Lothian Council replaced the previous governance committee which oversaw the running of the course with a new committee last year after relations between members of the old committee badly deteriorated and the British Horseracing Authoritythreatening to suspend its racing licence.The new Musselburgh Racing Associated Committeendash which is made up of four elected councillors and two representatives of the racing industry, currently members of Lothians Racing Syndicate ndash has been overseeing the hunt for a new operator.However, the BHA has only granted temporary licences and extensions under the new committee as it continues to monitor its performance.Mr Farnsworth said that the introduction of the new interim committee had caused some problems too.

I have heard many dferent versions of this tale, and most recently come across one version in a book by Taffy Thomas, who is a renowned storyteller. Here is my version of the story, which I have titled lsquoThe Riddle Rulersquo:IT WAS to be the final race of the tournament. The two knights had been equally matched, and now they would race each other for the prize of a gold cup filled with gold coins.There was an air of excitement as the crowds gathered for this race. Sir John and Sir Harry arrived together, each mounted on their stallions. Sir Johnrsquos horse was called Lightning, while Sir Harryrsquos horse was named Spear.They were equally matched, both knights had won an equal amount of races, and both had won against each other. There was no favourite, everyone knew this race would be very close.The atmosphere was electric with anticipation.Then the kingrsquos storyteller leaned over to whisper in the kingrsquos ear: ldquoYour majesty, this race is the last of the tournament. I feel it should be a race with an extra challenge, so that the crowd are better pleased.The king agreed, but asked the storyteller what he thought the extra challenge should be.ldquoThe race should be a test of the knightsrsquo wits as well as their riding ability, replied the storyteller. ldquoSet them a riddle rule and see how they solve it.ldquoAnd what is the riddle rule to be  asked the king.The storyteller smiled: ldquoDeclare the rules of this race to be thus: the horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and coins for its owner.And so the king declared the riddle rule just before the beginning of the race: ldquoThe horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and gold for its owner.There was a murmuring amongst the spectators. The knights looked at each other, thinking.When the starter flag was lowered and the king cried ldquogo, both knights stayed at the starting line. ldquoYou go first, said Sir John to Sir Harry. ldquoNo, after you, said Sir Harry to Sir John. But neither knight was willing to leave the start line lest they be deemed to be first.Soon there were boos and clapping from the crowd, but the prize was too great for either knight to risk going first.ldquoThis race is no fun, said the king to the storyteller, annoyed now that hersquod agreed to the change in rules.ldquoGive them until this afternoon to find a way to race, replied the storyteller, ldquothere is a way but they must discover it. It will challenge their wits and also their riding skills.And so the king stood: ldquoThe race is postponed until pm this afternoon. The knights must find a way to race to the riddle rule, otherwise the prize will be forfeited.For the rest of the day there was an excited buzz as people began to discuss possible solutions to the riddle rule with the knights.ldquoWhy donrsquot you agree to cross the finish line together  was one suggestionldquoBut then they would be equal first and the prize would be lost, commented another.ldquoBesides, said Sir John, ldquoI do not trust Sir Harry not to pull his horse back at the last moment. ldquoI do not trust you either, said Sir Harry.The deadline was fast approaching and no solution to the riddle rule had been found.ldquoPerhaps being first is more important than winning the gold, said an old woman.The knights looked at each other, thinking about this. Then they both said ldquonaw and shook their heads.It was  minutes before the race and a child came up to the knights and said: ldquoI have an idea. Everyone looked down at the child and laughed. How could a poor child know the answer when the knights themselves and all the spectators were scunnered But the storyteller was walking by and overheard the laughter. ldquoChildrenrsquos wisdom is not to be laughed at, he scolded them.And so the knights asked the child for the solution.The child said two words to the knights.In a flash, the knights got mounted and prepared to race. When the starter flag was lowered and the king shouted ldquogo, both Sir John and Sir Harry raced as fast as they could, each being desperate to be first across the finish line. Their riding skills were well challenged by this race.Who won does not matter in this story. What matters are the two words that were said by the child. They were the answer to the riddle rule, and so made the race possible.What were those two words If you havenrsquot already worked it out then re-read the story carefully. If you still donrsquot know, and want to know the answer, then I will give it next week.Or perhaps you could ask a child.

History is the way we view and see things that happened in the past. That view is limited by a number of factors. The availability of surviving records and evidence is one.The vast majority of what happened in the past is inevitably lost to us. This is true even for our own personal memories. So history is the small tip of the iceberg of events and times gone by, brought to the surface by the survival of some accounts more than others.And these records are never unbiased. Often historical records and evidence are purposely partial, influenced by ideology and personal allegiances. But all are biased in some way, as the limited viewpoint and interests of those recording events is based on their experience or motives.As a result, we can only see historical events through a narrow keyhole, with most characters and goings on out of view. Itrsquos the common people who are most always invisible in history. Our own ideological preference and belief in what is important will then affect how we interpret the limited evidence we have.This is why history is often subject to furious debate, and rightly so. Irsquod say itrsquos almost impossible not to allow our own perspectives, interests and values to influence the way we interpret the broader meaning of historical events and their signicance for contemporary society.Such a debate is being had in East Lothian just now, as to the name of the new town to be built on the Blindwells site, between Prestonpans and Longniddry and just to the north of Gladsmuir and Tranent.The name can be romantically translated to mean lsquohidden springsrsquo and it was across this once-marshy ground that the Jacobites crept stealthily at night to mount a surprise attack on the Redcoats on September , . That famous battle lasted  minutes and was a victory for the Jacobites, and the launchpad of Bonnie Prince Charliersquos march into England.Consequently, the Scottish Battlefields Trust has submitted a petition, as reported in the Courier last week, to name the new community Charlestoun and build a statue of Charles.When I was at school, he seemed a dashing and heroic figure. The songs and stories about him are infectious and I totally understand how the stories told about him have created a romantic and thrilling image.But then I studied the topic in more depth, at both university and afterwards. The period has suffered from the romantic treatment but there are fascinating stories of loyalty and sacrice to a man who, in reality, saw the common people chiefly as cannon fodder for his personal and family ambitions.It is for this reason I feel there are enough name places and statues to aristocratic and powerful men whose main historical role was to make and wage war, evenhe has a famous and romantic reputation.This is not to say we shouldnrsquot remember the fascinating history of the area, including that fateful day of battle when the Jacobites crossed the land.But itrsquos how we commemorate it and who we include. What makes the Jacobite period truly fascinating is the tapestry of stories of the many people involved, on both sides. It was a brutal time, in which there was certainly deep loyalty on both sides, but there were many other reasons why people found themselves on one side or the other. It was a brutal civil war, brought on by the aspirations of the exiled Stuarts.Do we commemorate the memory of the man who caused that war or do we commemorate those who were caught up in it  Is it really the case thatwe do the former we do the latter  Irsquom not convinced.There are other stories to consider of course for the site. There was coal mining there for generations. The lives of mining families, men, women and children who toiled in horric conditions, still remains mostly unheralded by history. Maybe itrsquos not lsquoromanticrsquo enough. Likewise with farming, which was a constant economic activity in the area for generations.There was also another unusual underground activity on the site after the early mine closed. Smugglers made an illegal whisky still deep down in the mine shaft once it was disused. It took a while for the customs men to realise East Lothian had an illicit whisky-making enterprise deep below ground in the old mine workings. When they finally raided the mine, they found the still, but no sign of the makers of the whisky. It kind of gives new meaning to the name lsquohidden springsrsquo!It is suggested the children in schools should have the final say in the new name, which is a great idea. But let our children be introduced to all aspects of our local history and allow them to understand how the way history is taught influences what we believe is important in contemporary society as well, and that there is no lsquocorrectrsquo view on this.Irsquod love to be part of that discussion and debate."},{"url":null,"title":"parents-launch-petition-school-bus-operator-change","story":"Families whose children attend two secondary schools in East Lothian were stunned to discover that local firm PrenticeCoaches would no longer be used to transport the youngsters when schoolsafter the summer.The news was broken to them by Prentice, which is based in Haddington, last week, sparking a furious reaction from a number of parents.Now a petition has been launched calling for Prentice to have the contract, which has allegedly been awarded to a rival firm, given back.One mother whose children attend Knox Academy in Haddingtonand are bussed in from Gford said that she was shocked by the news.She said: ldquoPrentice have been looking after our children for  years and they are being replaced with no consultation or discussion.ldquoParents know the drivers and trust them to look after their children.ldquoIt is beyond belief that the council would simply put a dferent company in place without even consulting with the families affected.A petition calling for theof Prentice has collected more than  signatures since it was launched online.It says: ldquoPrentice provide a community service where parents feel reassured and comfortable putting their children on the buses.ldquoWe believe East Lothian [Council] has chosen to put cost over service and safety.ldquoThere is absolutely nothing wrong with the current service.ldquoThis is simply a cost-cutting exercise which could potentially put our children at risk.Prentice provided bus services for Knox Academy and North Berwick High School but has now lost the contract for those services.Ross Prentice, the company boss, admitted that he was ldquodisappointed by the councilrsquos decision.The company said: ldquoIt is a sad day.

Now its never. A flat no. Forget it. Youll have had your referendum.Both Boris and Hunt made clear at the Perth Hustings that there will be no independence referendum, eventhe SNP win outright in . Thats a sobering message for the independence movement, and for Nicola Sturgeon. She still regards the Section  route to a legally-binding referendum as the only plausible one. That is now road-blocked.There has been a dramatic hardening of rhetoric against Scotland during this campaign. Theresa May came to Stirling to proclaim that Nicola Sturgeon ldquocannot be trusted. That the Scottish government is incapable of negotiating ldquoin good faith. Why, Sturgeon had the temerity to portray the UK governments takeover of powers repatriated from Brussels as a ldquopower grab. You just cant deal with these people, May concluded.We all know what Boris Johnson thinks about Scotland. A nation of ldquofreeloaders. He described Scotland having free care and free tuition as ldquopretty monstrous. Jeremy Hunt has tended to be more emollient, but on Friday his gloves came off too. He condemned the Scottish Government as: ldquothe most bullying, isive, duplicitous, anti-business government Scotland has ever seen.Given that the Scottish National Party dominates the opinion polls, and has more seats in both parliaments than all the Unionist parties put together, this could be taken as an oblique criticism of the Scottish voter. I mean, are Scots so stupid that they dont realise they are being run by bullying charlatans  Its almost asthey cant be trusted to know their best interests, deluded as they are by the hypnotic rhetoric of separatism.This was all rather redolent of how British imperialists, like Churchill, used to talk about nationalist leaders in the old British colonies. They were all wily demagogues, up to no good. Cant trust them as far as you can throw them. The subtext was: the only language they understand is firmness. Just tell them what the score is and let them get on with it.This is very much the line taken in the Dailylast week by the Thatcherite former Scottish Secretary, Lord Forsyth of Drumlean. He says that the real threat to the Union comes from ldquogiving in to Nationalists demands. The Tories best bet is to tell them politely but firmly that they can stick their independence up their Great Glen ndash or words to that effect.All this is, of course, exactly what the SNP want to hear. There is nothing better for drumming up support for the Nationalist cause than hearing a phalanx of crusty Tory grandees telling Scotland to like the Union or lump it. Support for independence is creeping up ndash slowly but steadily ndash and is now % in the latest polls, and %Boris Johnson wins.True, demand for an early referendum on Scottish independence is certainly muted. But after Mr Johnson enters Number Ten ndash a racing certainty according to the latest YouGov poll ndash and a no deal Brexit looms, things could move fast. The SNP expect support for Yes, which has been stuck for five years, to jump dramatically. Possibly approaching that % which Nicola Sturgeon allowed the media to speculate back in  was the threshold for calling a repeat referendum.But its going to be messy. There is already disquiet in the party and in the wider Yes movement at the SNP leaders apparent lack of enthusiasm for leading the independence revolution. But after this Tory leadership campaign, she can be in no doubt that there has been a sea-change in attitudes to Scotland from the governing party. No more Mr Nice Guy. Scots will have to learn to love Brexit Britain or take the high road out of the Union.Yet, its a little odd that Scotland should have become such a touchstone issue in the Tory leadership race. There are hardly any Tory members in Scotland, after all, and it is they wholl be doing the voting in the campaign, which is now reaching peak empty promise as the ballot papers go out. But both contenders seem to have chosen to make the Union and Scotlands place in it central to their respective campaigns.They each claim, rather improbably, to have an almost religious attachment to the Union. Its blood-in-my-veins stuff for Hunt. The ldquomost successful Union in history according to Boris Johnson, clearly believing that the United States somehow fails to qualy as a union.Perhaps this relates to something deep in the Conservative psyche: that Great Britain needs to retain its subject nationalities to prove that it is still a going concern. Certainly, the loss of Scotland - taking with it a third of the UK landmass, most of its hydrocarbons and all of its nuclear weapons - would be a devastating blow to Brexit Britain. The UKs prestige, already diminished as a result of the three years of chaos and indecision, would take an even greater knock. It could lose its place on the UN Security Council, become an empty chair at G Summits...So, there was a bit of carrot to go along with the stick. Boris Johnson has declared himself ldquoMinister for the Union with the implication that devolution is now as important to the Prime Ministers role as First Lord of the Treasury . He is going to take Scotland well in hand, and ensure that all policies in future are stress tested for compatibility with all four nations.Jeremy Hunt too came bearing gts. Scotland is to become a ldquogreen Silicon Valley, a post-Brexit digital entrepocirct. He presumably avoided saying ldquoSilicon Glen because that would have reminded Scottish voters of what happened the last time Scotlands future was predicated on new technology, back in the days when the Tory George Younger ran the Scottish Office.At its height, in the early s, Scotlands technology industry made one third of all the computers manufactured in Europe. Not any more. They went where as the UK de-industrialised under Margaret Thatcher. Mr Hunt also hyped his proposal to slash corporation tax to .% - something Alex Salmond used to argue for. However, this is a policy for the UK as a whole, not Scotland, so there is no obvious comparative advantage, still less any promised to devolve business taxes.But the headline message from both Tory candidates in the Perth hustings was withering contempt for the independence movement. This will no doubt please Conservative members in the southern shires, who have already largely given up on Scotland and regard the Union with pointed indference. As YouGov discovered recently, the vast majority would willingly let Scotland goit meant saving Brexit.They may get their way sooner than they think."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-mp-joanna-cherry-qc-made-citizens-assembly-39-ten-times-harder-39-says-adviser","story":"Dr Oliver Escobar suggestedthecomment by Joanna Cherry QC last week wasso unhelpful it had made the forumswork ldquoten times harder.He told the Herald such commentsmade it harder becauseunderstanding of the Assembly was still in its infancy and it had yet to gain public trust.That meant people might not distinguish between Ms Cherry speaking as a politician with onepoint of view, and the entirely separate, independentorganisationofthe Assembly.Announced by Nicola Sturgeon in April as a way of thrashing out the long-term challenges facing Scotland, the Assembly has been dogged by claims it is a Nationalist front.Based on the Irish models which led to referendums legalising same-sex marriage and abortion, the Assembly will recruit its first  members and  substitutes over the summer, then deliberate over six weekends from later October to late April.In Ireland, cross-party buy-in and independence were vital factors in the exercisersquos success.However the Scottish Tories and Scottish LibDems have already said they will have nothing to do with the Scottish version, with Unionist campaigners urging a boycott.Last week its first co-convener David Martin, the former Scottish Labour MEP, appealed for cooperation and insisted the forum would be independent from the SNP Government.However a day later Ms Cherry, the SNPrsquos justice spokeswoman at Westminster, fuelled Unionist suspicions by saying the Assembly was part of a wider independence effort.In an online video, she described it as ldquothe perfect way to move Scotland on from the current state of Brexit paralysis created by westminster and to move us towards independence.:SNP MP Joanna Cherry QC says Citizens Assembly is perfect way to advance independenceHer Twitter post was advertising an Electoral Reform Society event at Edinburgh University tomorrow about the Assembly in which she and Dr Escobar will participate.Dr Escobar, an expert in public policy at the Edinburgh, has advised SNP Brexit Secretary Michael Russell on the importance of ldquobuilding cross-party support for the Assembly.Also expected to be the lead researcher on the body, he told Scotland and Sunday that Ms Cherryrsquos comment was ldquocompletely against the ethos of such assembles.ldquoIm kind of fuming around that, adding an open-minded and unbiased approach was the \"fundamental underpinning of the legitimacy of this body.He said: \"I wouldnt be involved in advising, and hopefully soon to be confirmed in doing research around this,I believed that this was an already forgone conclusion.\"So earlier this week, when comments were made by a very prominent member of the SNP, it was perhaps the most unhelpful contribution that has been made so far to this process.ldquoI understand why this happens - it happens because theyre talking to their own supporters, they frame it in a way that is appealing to them. But it completely goes against the ethos.\"The person who made these comments has actually nothing to do with the Citizens Assembly. Shes not involved in organising it, shes not involved in any of the advisory boards. Shes just someone who has advocated for Citizens Assemblies because shes been inspired by the Irish example.\"Professor David Farrell of University College Dublin, research director on the first Irish assembly, also told the paper that perceived bias was ldquoa serious risk to the new project.He said: ldquoI think theres a serious riskthere isnt some buy-in from most of the parties that it could undermine it. Thats a serious risk.\"In both of the Irish processes, pretty much all of the parties were able to buy in - and in some cases quite reluctantly in the beginning. But I think that was so important.ldquoYou can see it with social media commentary already that there are people who are seeing this as a stitchup which is what you get early on. The best way to reduce that criticism is to say Look, we have some buy-in from all parties.\"We had much the same when we were talking about abortion because that would have been similarly an extremely controversial topic.\"So whats really important is that its seen to be independent, objective, fully transparent.\":Citizens Assembly hit by recruitment delay amid Unionist calls for boycottDr Escobar told the Herald: ldquoWhat I really want to highlight is that there is a distinction, and itrsquos an important distinction, between public leaders like Joanna, who are advocates and supporters for this kind of methodology for involving the public, versus those who are actually impartial organisers who will have the responsibility to deliver this important process, and shersquos not part of that.\"I donrsquot think that thatrsquos a distinction that has been made properly.ldquoItrsquos all coming out as an attack on Joanna. To be honest, you know, these things very rarely get visibility, these kind of alternative forums of democractic engagement.ldquoTherefore it is important that leaders like Joanna and others come into that space and speak to their own supporters, which I think is what Joanna was saying when she said she was hopeful this is going to help the path to independence.ldquoBut the problem is that there is a public perception that this is just an SNP thing. But actually the Assembly is going to be independent from government.ldquoItrsquos important we are not mixing those who are advocates and public leaders who are calling for this, because they hope itrsquos going to help in their own cause, but that is not necessarily the agenda of the assembly, and certainly the organisers are a dferent sort of group.He went on: ldquoI do think that comments like that, because there is no public perception of the distinction between Joanna and the people actually involved in developing the Assembly, I think itrsquos true that these comments at this stage can make things much harder for people to really find some legitimate ground the Assembly to do its work properlywith public trust.ldquoBut, Joanna, you know, in that sense I donrsquot regret saying that. It does make it harder, until it will begin to distinguish between those who are speaking about the Assembly and calling for it, and those who are actually going to deliver an impartial process.Askedhe was concerned he had been misquoted, he said: \"Speaking to the Scotsman I never mentioned Joannarsquos name, but obviously it was between the lines.\"I did say last week there were unhelpful comments that are making things ten times harder because we are not yet at the stage [of]a mature public conversation about what the Assembly could accomplishgiven the chance.ldquoIt just comes across as very personal, but then again Irsquom not that naive not to understand how things come out.ldquoUnless the Assembly has the trust of everyone across the ideological spectrum then itrsquos not going to work. Itrsquos important that people like Joanne speak up, but itrsquos just about understanding that shersquos not speaking up for ious assemblies, shersquos speaking up from her elected politician position and public leader position rather than anything to do with the actual delivery of the Assembly.\"I welcome contributions from politicians, but itrsquos just about how they choose to frame it.In a series of tweets this morning, Ms Cherry said she stood by her comment, and said it was part of the ldquojoy of democracy that others might disagree.However she also called for people to approach the Assembly with an ldquoopen mind.A short positive thread on #CitizensAssemblies #She told the Herald: \"Of course Irsquom always interested in independence. Thatrsquos hardly a revelation. But the Citizens Assembly is about looking at policy issues which interest everyone regardless of their stance on Independence.

It was time to look ahead to what an administration led by Boris Johnson might look like, and what it would do. Interviews for positions have been open for quite some time now, but it is never too late to remind an incoming Prime Minister of onersquos worth as a television performer.Dominic Raab, former Brexit Secretary turned Boris defender cheerleader, was widely held to have acquitted himself well during the week on Peston. He must have enjoyed the verbal sparring, because he got up on a Sunday morning to do it all again on Ridge on Sunday.: Johnson campaign gaffe over pollHis only stumble came when he referred to Mr Johnson putting a Cabinet together ldquoafter he wins, which was quickly corrected to ldquo he succeeds.When it came to who would be around the table, Mr Raab preferred to see a ldquowide-ranging Cabinet, albeit one that was disciplined and where the principle of collective responsibility had been restored. So not that wide-ranging then.On The Andrew Marr Show the host was also keen to talk jobs. Not his own, for which, as the BBC annual report showed last week, he is paid between pound,-pound,. He was interested in the job security of David Gauke, the Justice Secretary and prominent Remainer, in any government led by Mr Johnson. ldquoHersquos going to sack you, isnrsquot he  asked the presenter with all the subtlety of a carnival barker.Mr Gauke, whose anti-no deal supporters have been dubbed the Gaukeward Squad, said he would jump before he was pushedbeing part of Team Johnson meant signing up to an October  departure come what may.

Taking the attack is the best defence approach, he questioned the balance and impartiality of the Panorama programme. But as the BBC was quick to point out, Mr Gardiner was criticising something he had not yet seen.Panorama is not Labourrsquos only headache. Apart from the continuing muddle over the partyrsquos Brexit position, those shadow ministers on media duty yesterday also had to comment on reports that war was raging between Jeremy Corbynrsquos unelected advisers and those MPs closest to the Labour leader.

Where on Earth could such stories have come from, then  Well-refreshed journalists, said Mr McDonnell, staggering from one summer reception to the next \"drinking some of the most nauseating wine ever produced from a grape\". A case of sour grapes, then, but only on journalistsrsquo part.As for the state of the Corbyn-McDonnell relationship, it was doing just fine, thanks for asking. \"Jeremy and I go back  years, were the closest of friends.

That said, Mr McDonnell was conscious of time pressing on. The Shadow Chancellor is in the camp that reckons Prime Minister Johnson could go for a General Election in September.That was not the vision swirling in Labour MP Ian Murrayrsquos crystal ball.

These are not bugs that glow in the dark.Using a mix of biotechniques and genetic breeding, the start-up develops high-performance strains of black soldier fly and selects traits such as protein content, growth rate, fat composition and temperature tolerance depending on clientsrsquo needs.The animal feed is then made from the highly-optimised fly maggots, helping to avoid environmentally damaging soy which has been blamed for deforestation and high carbon footprint.The black soldier fly larvae are particularly effective, thanks to an apparently insatiable appetite and astonishing ability to turn almost any kind of organic waste ndash from agricultural leftovers to faeces ndash into high-quality protein, helping to solve two environmental issues at once.While the fly larvae are currently on the agricultural menu, the start-up could also move into developing more efficient ieties of mealworms and crickets for human consumption, making the protein source more affordable.In the case of mealworms, laboratory adaption could help provide an alternative to environmentally devastating palm oil production ndash mealworms have been found to have healthy fatty acid properties similar to palm oil, but with the potential for faster and more efficient production.According to Farrugia, a key benefit of super insect-based animal feeds and fishmeal is that it has the potential to be produced in Scotland ndash avoiding the need to important soy-based feeds mainly from America.Meanwhile, there could also be spin-off benefits for healthier farmed products. ldquoFor example, more salmon are being farmed, and therersquos a need for more fishmeal, he adds. ldquoBut the limit for fishmeal is capped so each fish gets less, which means it takes in less Omega .ldquoWe now need to eat twice the amount of salmon now as we did  years ago to get the same Omega . So, wersquore looking at ways of adding Omega  to the insect product.The start-up, based at Edinburgh Universityrsquos Roslin Innovation Centre, is one of  businesses which was last year selected as part of the Scottish Governmentrsquos poundm challenge fund, Unlocking Ambition.Half were established businesses which have spent the past year being guided by mentors linked to Scottish Enterprise, while the remaining  young start-ups, including Beta Bugs, were introduced to the Royal Society of Edinburghrsquos Unlocking Ambition Enterprise Fellowship programme.:Mad cow disease confirmed on Scottish farmAmong them is a revolutionary robotic lawnmower business, which has introduced ground-breaking mapping technology to enable machines to work across large areas of land, such as golf courses and parks.Joan Kangro, the founder of Kingdom Technologies Ltd., says the robotic lawnmowers have been designed with multiple sensors and cameras to enable them to operate safely in public spaces.ldquoOther robot lawnmowers use reactive safety measures, sothey bump into an obstruction they will go in a new direction. But studies have shown thatrsquos not safe around children and pets, he says.ldquoOur robot sees when someone comes into close proximity and stops before it hits the object.The large terrain robotic lawnmowers are also designed to cut the lawnrsquos edges and close to obstacles ndash removing the need to trim edges of flower beds ndash and to operate using mapping technology, removing the need for boundary cables.Other businesses included in the RSE Fellowship include CogniCare, which uses machine learning to offer personalised support to people affected by dementia, Fodilicious which provides premium, lsquofree-fromrsquo convenience foods including low FODMAP, gluten-free and vegan, and ALICAS which gts bespoke clothing parcels to women in clothing crisis.Professor Dame Anne Glover, RSE President said: ldquoScotland has a global reputation for innovation, and we need to maintain that entrepreneurial spirit.

It is characteristic of our politics that sides were picked long before any details of the case were aired in courtWhile the two former friends largely avoided the media frenzy that would have been provoked by a public war of words, their allies and supporters were far from quiet.The ision between the two big beasts of the SNP gave cover to those elected representatives who were already growing frustrated with the top brass.The timing of a second independence referendum and the strategy for securing one has been an issue that has caused unrest within the ranks. There are those who are anxious for another vote as soon as possible. They say the SNP leadership has been too meek in its approach and has failed to capitalise on the shambolic Brexit process.In the Halcyon Days before Twitter, party disagreements would be confined to smoke-filled meeting rooms or whispered briefings to hungry journalists. Now, as is the nature and curse of social media, we say exactly whatrsquos on our minds.These debates and disagreements between the politicians are being played out on Twitter and in the media. When we consider the speed with which the disunity spread it is dficult to see how some will manage to find their way back to a place of restraint.It is the proposed reform of the Gender Recognition Actthat has provoked some of the most open and often hostile warring among SNP politicians. The reforms would give transgender people the right to self-declare their gender, easing what supporters of reform say is currently an unnecessarily intrusive and distressing process.SNP figures such as Joan McAlpine and Joanna Cherry have been openly critical of their partyrsquos stance.

Letrsquos focus on getting independence. #priorities\"Politicians will rightly speak up about issues which they care about and those issues will not always align, even within members of the same party. At this moment the SNPrsquos overriding priority should not be a futile quest to achieve universal agreement, but to gently remind its representatives of the political crisis we face. Social media spats in this moment of all moments look indulgent and counterproductive.A recent Panelbase poll for the Sunday Times showed that in the event of a Boris Johnson premiership, support for independence could rise to  per cent.

They won an election on a manesto which stated that should Scotland be dragged out of the EU against its will, we should have the option of holding a second independence referendum. The Scottish Parliament has voted in favour of Indyref.What has been thus far missing from the equation has been the polling showing that the public mood towards independence had shted. With Boris Johnson in Number , we could be moving towards a situation where ndash for the first time since  ndash we start to see clear and consistent polling showing a majority for independence.It is ironic ndash and deeply frustrating for those who support independence ndash that the SNP have chosen now to abandon party discipline.

Edinburgh was full of colour and noise, and there was a real sense of hope and expectation. Donald Dewar’s speech in the parliament’s first chamber was one of those moments where the hair stood up on the back of your neck. In my view – as someone in a dferent party to Donald, with very dferent views on the ultimate destination for Scotland – that speech was one of the finest speeches in modern Scottish history.How much of a privilege is it to run the country and how dficult is the top job There’s no doubt that being First Minister of Scotland has been the privilege of my le.

And like many people in senior positions, particularly women, I have had moments of self-doubt but I believe it’s important to be open about that and to be a role model to young people. But more than anything, I am grateful to have the opportunity to help make Scotland a better place to live.What is the Parliament’s biggest achievement in the last  years  Twenty years on there are so many achievements that we can be proud of, and that have made Scotland a better place to live, work, study and grow up in. From free personal care to the abolition of tuition fees, the ban on smoking in public places, a minimum pricing for alcohol and the introduction of equal marriage. There’s a long, long list of these inidual policies that wouldn’t have happenedwe hadn’t had a Scottish Parliament.Across the world there are other countries now looking to Scotland to learn from the globally ground-breaking things we’ve done on public health, on tackling climate change, and on the work we’re doing around renewable energy.But above any inidual policy, there is a much more fundamental achievement, and that is that,  years on, the parliament has reinvigorated Scottish democracy and become an accepted, established part of Scottish le. We should all take great pride in that.What has been the most dficult challenge the Parliament has faced and you personally The sad and unexpected death in  of Donald Dewar – the man who had driven through the Scotland Act and then become the first First Minister – was no doubt a moment of great uncertainty for all MSPs in the early days of the Parliament.On a personal level, I’d have to say assuming the office of First Minister was my biggest challenge. Despite having spent  years in frontline politics, and seven as Deputy First Minister, nothing can prepare you for the moment where suddenly you are the last word, where there is no longer anyone above you to seek a second opinion on somethingyou want it – everyone is looking to you.What is your most memorable moment There have been many memorable moments. The passage of the Equal Marriage Act and the Minimum Pricing legislation are two key ones for me. I also think the referendum campaign has to be one of them. It not only saw Parliament at its best – with robust debates and intense scrutiny – but also sparked an enormous outpouring of democratic engagement across the country. Although the result didn’t go the way I wanted, the legacy of a more politically involved country is one we should all cherish.I have a lot of memorable moments. It’s not the famous names or the big events, but the stories I hear from iniduals around the country that inspire me. I’ve spent a lot of time lately listening to the le experiences of Scotland’s care experienced young people. Their stories will stay with me forever and drive me to improve their lives and opportunities.In  years’ time, how do you hope the Parliament will have evolved It should evolve in line with the way people in Scotland want it to. The Parliament was established in large part because of the democratic deficit that opened up during  years of a Tory government which became more and more unpopular in Scotland. Despite devolution, Brexit in particular has demonstrated that Westminster is willing to ignore the views of people in Scotland and disregard votes of the Parliament. I have absolutely no doubt that by  we will have completed the powers of the Parliament and become an independent country. That means we will have established a genuine partnership of equals with the rest of the UK and will have ensured that people in Scotland always get the governments they vote for.Are there any people you would like to thank We should never ever forget those who campaigned for decades to see a Scottish Parliament – many of whom never lived to see it become a reality.Then there are those who have worked tirelessly behind the scenes. We couldn’t do our job without the work of the parliament staff, led by the Parliament’s chief executive, Sir Paul Grice, who recently announced he was moving on to a new job after  years. He might not be well-known by the wider public but, as someone who was there from the very beginning, all MSPs and staff owe him an enormous debt of gratitude.For me personally, I certainly would not be where I am today without the support of my mum and dad and my husband Peter.Everyone is invited to join the partySaturday, June ,  is gearing up to be a great day.From am to noon, the Queen will address Parliament and each of the party leaders will speak in response. The audience will include those young people who were born in  as well as finalists from a competition for student film-makers who produced a short film on the impact the Scottish Parliament has had in their area. There will also be a number of performances celebrating the best of Scotland’s culture and music and the Makar will perform a new piece of work.In the afternoon, the Parliament will open its doors for a day of celebration – a party everyone is invited to join from pm to pm.There will be a chance to sit in the Presiding Officer’s seat and see how it feels to take charge, as well as retro games like giant Jenga, Kerplunk and space hoppers. There will also be live music, dancers, face painting and caricaturists.And of course, there will be birthday cake and food too. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: “It will be a great day, full of colour and energy. Parliament always does these events well and brings in so many people from across Scotland. “I hope we spend the day not just looking back on what has been achieved, but focused on the work the parliament still has to do.“The public are often sceptical of politicians, but I hope people across the country will reflect on how far we’ve come with the parliament and the dference it has already made to so many people’s lives.”"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon the scottish parliament s greatest achievements","story":"The Scottish Parliament will celebrate its th anniversary today .Her Majesty the Queen will take part in the th anniversary celebrations today, with the iconic Parliament building in Edinburgh being open from pm to pm for visitors to join in the birthday celebrations.And in an exclusive QA, Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told us what she believes the Parliament’s top  greatest achievements are.The country’s top politician also shared her thoughts on Brexit and the future, sounding a note of caution for the UK’s next Prime Minister.Here, in her own words, Nicola walks us through the Parliament’s success story...Right from its earliest years, the Scottish Parliament showed that it was ready to take policy decisions substantially dferent to those at Westminster to help build a better country.A clear early example of this was the introduction of free personal care for the elderly. This was a substantial commitment but was vital for Scotland’s long term interests, preparing ourselves for the challenges of an ageing population. We’ve recently extended free personal care to cover all those who are assessed as needing it, no matter their age.MSPs also charted a dferent course when, following a change of administration in , parliament voted to scrap tuition fees in Scotland, restoring Scotland’s long and proud tradition of free education.Similarly, the decision to abolish prescription charges brought to an end what was little more than a tax on ill health. The NHS of course is the greatest, and most valued, example of a universal service where care is provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay. Our health service, like others across the world, faces challenges. But it is a real achievement of the Scottish Parliament that we have resisted the marketization moves south of the border while ensuring that under the current government Scotland’s AE departments are the best performing in theUK.On other occasions, the Parliament has led the UK in making bold policy choices, such as the ban on smoking in public places. Our Climate Change Act includedthe most ambitious emissions reduction targets of any legislature in the world and, as Health Secretary, I was heavily involved in the campaign to introduce a minimum unit price for alcohol, which we knew would play a key role in tackling Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with drink – another world leading measure.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.glasgowsouthandeastwoodextra webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"As the Scottish Parliament prepares to celebrate its th anniversary, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on both its journey and her own.\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on  years of the Scottish Parliament viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"GLAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"GLAS | Article Teaser\"It took a decade of hard work to make this policy a reality and I am personally very proud of the campaign, working with stakeholders, to persuade MSPs to back minimum pricing, as well as overcoming a legal challenge that went all the way to the Supreme Court.I am personally committed to making sure every child and young person in Scotland gets the best possible start in le. We have already delivered an increase in free, high quality childcare for all three and four year olds and extending entitlement to eligible two year olds and will increase it further before the end of this parliament.Scotland has also become a much safer society under devolution. Recorded crime has fallen to some of the lowest levels seen since the s. In particular, non-sexual violent crime has fallen substantially, thanks in no small part to the excellent work of the Violence Reduction Unit, which was established over a decade ago with cross-party support and is now being copied across the UK.In recent years, new powers have come to the Scottish Parliament and with those powers come increased responsibilities for MSPs to deliver for the people ofScotland.Income tax policy is now a key feature of the annual Scottish budget. We’ve used these new powers to introduce a fairer income tax policy, with most people paying less tax than they would south of the border – while continuing to raise revenue to support investment in the economy and public services.Last year Parliament passed the wide-ranging Social Security Act, paving the way for devolution of a number of benefits, as well as creating a number of newbenefits such as increased carers’ support allowance and best start grants for families with young children – and a new social security agency to deliver them. This new agency has a culture of dignity and respect at its heart and early feedback from service users has been overwhelmingly positive.I also appointed the first gender balanced Scottish cabinet and we are encouraging more women to stand for parliament, and bring a better balance to ourpublic le.Over the course of the Scottish Parliament consistent action has been taken to ensure communities have the opportunity to own the land they live and work on.Many communities have benefited from the right to buy that now covers rural and urban communities.Of course, the foundation of our country is a strong and resilient economy. That’s why we have slashed or abolished business rates for , premises –saving almost £. billion for our small businesses.We have invested in our infrastructure with all governments building new schools and hospitals and, of course, the iconic Queensferry Crossing.And, to help make sure we have the workforce we need for years to come, we have delivered just over a quarter of a million Modern Apprenticeships in the lastdecade.In April this year, new legislation to tackle controlling and coercive behaviour came into effect, giving Scotland some of the most robust domesticabuse legislation in the world.I’m also proud of the many steps we’ve taken to make Scotland a fairer society, including the introduction of equal marriage rights – attending one of the first same-sex weddings in Scotland is a memory that will stay with me for a long time.And we all worked together over many years to help Glasgow successfully host the  Commonwealth Games. This helped to inspire Scots to get more active,delivered new facilities and put Scotland on the world stage. It was a sight to behold.My final achievement is perhaps harder to quanty. There is no doubt that the re-establishment of Scotland’s parliament has profoundly changed our political culture for the better, with our nation’s lawmakers much more accessible to those they represent. It has also enabled us to have conversations we wouldn’t have had and to debate our own future, with the  independence referendum generating an increase in democratic engagement.Looking ahead, we now face the signicant challenges posed by Brexit which, of course, Scotland’s people and parliament overwhelmingly oppose. Given the long-term damage that Brexit will cause to Scotland, and the material change in circumstances this represents, I believe it is only fair that people are given the choice of whether to become an independent country. Indeed, the current SNP Government was elected on a clear manesto commitment that people should be offered that choice should Scotland be taken out of the EU against its will. Polls consistently show that people living here believe the decision on whether to hold a referendum should be a matter for Holyrood and not Westminster. Twenty years after it came into being, that is an important measure of the way people in Scotland view the Parliament and one that the new UK Prime Minister would do well to heed."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : pmTwo outstanding young Orcadians were thwarted in their attempts to secure Island Games medals with two fourth-place finishes on day two in Gibraltar.

It is disheartening to have received a counter-offer from Prospect that is beyond our affordability.“Over the past eight months, we have discussed ious options with the union and have been clear throughout that any proposal must be affordable and within the terms of Public Sector Pay Policy. Prospect are aware of HIAL’s budgetary restrictions and our latest offer constituted compromise to accommodate trade union demands within the bounds of the pay policy.“We remain committed to resolving the dispute and our latest offer of a retention allowance of £, over a five-year period remains on the table. The continued industrial action is having a signicant impact on our communities and the airlines operating from our airports.

The results are people with dementia and their families falling victim to this dreadfully broken system.ldquoLike the families in our exhibition, hundreds of thousands of people affected by dementia in this country are facing financial punishment, just because they happened to develop dementia and not some other disease.ldquoThe evidence of the gross inequity continues to pile up, and yet still the Government does nothing.ldquoWe need an immediate cash injection through a dedicated Dementia Fund, while the Government works out a long-term solution to finally end this crisis in care.copy -.

A week does not seem to pass without someone appealing for a gentler, kinder style of politics. Well,my own experience this week is anything to go by it will be a long time coming. Indeed it is probably a forlorn hope. I am just back from attending the first meeting of the ninth session of the European Parliament held in Strasbourg. It was an eventful experience and one that, unlike my colleagues, I am able to contrast and compare against the eight years I served in the Scottish Parliament. While the parliaments are dferent in a iety of waysthere was enough in my first week to give me a taste of what to expect. Sadly I can testy the nature of political discourse has deteriorated signicantly. Thus far it is not the behaviour of the parliamentarians that is especially dferent, but the relationship between politicians and the public that has changed. Politicians the world over and from all political colours can be pompous, ignorant, isive and rude – and courteous, inspiring, witty and magnanimous – or a combination of both – but that has always been the case. What I found this week was that in my  years away from professional politics as an elected servant of the people, the mood of the public appears to have changed dramatically for the worse.• : Outrage after new MEP Anne Widdecombe compares Brexit to emancipation of slavesIn my past le as a Tory MSP, I witnessed all sorts of stunts by opponents and colleagues, and took part intentionally or inadvertently in a few myself, but I cannot recall anything other than a handful of letters of complaint, never mind abusive language, in that time. Now there is an instant reaction that, courtesy of the internet, reaches elected members in a wide iety of forms – from text messages, emails,tweets and presumably Facebook posts . Some of it is vile, and the quantity surprised even an old dog like me.One particular example was the opening of the European Parliament itself, where the -plus members were told to stand for its “national anthem” before proceedings officially began. The Brexit Party MEPs had been sitting down at that point but had agreed amongst ourselves thatasked to stand we would do so with our backs to the dais.For us it was a quiet and dignied way of showing our rejection of the idea of a European superstate with its own flag, embassies, diplomatic corps, army – and an anthem that had already been rejected by prime minister TonyBlair and in referendums on the proposed EU constitution by the French and Dutch.As a statement, it did not require brightly coloured T-shirts with offensive slogans rejecting the UK’s democratic choice, or placards for MEPs to hold up in chamber– or causing a commotion or storming out in protest. It was just a silent rejection of an example of empire-building that has caused Europeans of all nations, but especially the British, to say we’ve had enough. After this short moment we then turned, sat down and participated in the remaining proceedings.Within minutes the messages were pinging into our phones, the emails were arriving and the media, receiving and witnessing the same, only wanted to talk about that one “disrespectful” event. For all but a few exceptions the Liberal Democrats’ “Bollocks to Brexit” t-shirts were ignored unless we made a point of asking why. • : MPs step up plans to block no-deal Brexit amid leadership contestEmails calling me a iety of epithets that would peel the nish of my mother’s front door soon reached my inbox. A suspicious swarm of similarly worded emails then flew in – berating me in emotional terms that would make those of a gentler disposition wish to seek solitude in a dark room.Former BBC politics journalist Gavin Esler tweeted we “shamelessly copied” the Nazi Party in s Germany who turned their backs on a Jewish speaker in the Reichstag – insinuating we share some political DNA them. This was somewhat ironic given the anthem, Beethoven’s Ode to Joy was one of Hitler’s favourites and played to him on his birthday. More importantly Esler’s reaction completely ignored the lineage that turning one’s back is a form of political protest and signalled the double standards of so many of those criticising it on this occasion.As City lawyer Alex Deane pointed out, British POWs turned their backs on Japan’s Emperor Akihito in  as he passed down the Mall with Her Majesty the Queen. In  and  members of the public – co-ordinated by campaign groups including Hope Not Hate and Prayers for Peace – turned their backs on English Democratic League rallies held in Bradford city centre. In  some members of the public turned their backs on the funeral cortege of former prime minister Margaret Thatcher as it passed on its way to St Paul’s Cathedral. Likewise, later that same year hundreds of NYPD officers turned their backs on a speech by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio at a funeral of two officers killed on duty. More recently women turned their backs on Canadian premier Justin Trudeau protesting against his “fake feminism” and the same protest has been used against President Trump. Were those people borrowing their form of protest from the Nazis, did those protests receive condemnation from our liberal intelligentsia or be ridiculed by BBC staff, past and present, as my colleagues and I were  As the week moved on so did the media attention – but not the faux-outrage of social media victims. Quite correctly the media wanted to know what we thought of the EU’s backroom dealing to agree the candidates for ious positions including the parliament’s own president, president of the European Commission, the president of the Council of Ministers and president of the European Central Bank. While we pointed to the democratic shortcomings of that process, that is just one symptom of the EUs centralised and secretive government, the communications parading the personal upset over our back-turning just kept coming – without any reference to the EU elite’s disrespect to their own people.A gentler, kinder style of politics  If it ever existed I don’t think it’s ing soon. Social media’s anonymity has undoubtedly allowed greater guerrilla tactics and binary referenda have ided the country like never before. Politics has toto meat and two veg issues again.

This is only the start.”Topher Dawson, treasurer of the Scottish Coastal Rowing Association, said: “Stranraer is a perfect combination of sheltered water, lovely beach and sea front, and all the accommodation and cafes, bars and local services that you could possibly want.”Scottish tourism secretary Fiona Hyslop said: “Scotland has a renowned reputation both as a fantastic destination for adventure tourism and as a host for major sporting events, and that is evidenced this week in Stranraer.“It is little wonder that so many people want to come here to watch world championship rowing in a stunning setting, enjoying competitive sport whilst boosting local businesses and the wider economy.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow based kilt company to launch world s first vegan tartan","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...A Glasgow-based company has announced that they are set to launch what is considered to be the worlds first vegan tartan and kilt.Woven only in animal-free materials, the kilt is designed to celebrate those Scots and tartan enthusiasts from around the world that follow a vegan lestyle.

The -strong body will get under way in October with a series of meetings until next spring with a broad remit to respond to the challenges of Brexit and information needed to make “informed choices” about Scotland’s future.“This assembly is going to try and change the tone of the debate in Scotland – it’s about a respectful discussion about where Scotland should be in future,” said Mr Martin who will co-chair the body.“Given some of the coverage of this, I want to emphasise this will be completely independent of government. Of course the government will set it up and it gives it credibility that the government has set it up, because that gives it status. “But once established I have had unequivocal assurances from the minister responsible, from Mike Russell, that the two co-chairs will be independent and will manage the process themselves– no external political interference.”Mr Martin, speaking an Electoral Reform Society event, said the assembly’s remit is “quite broad” and he will be seeking to the “narrow the question down” during its deliberations.But he added: “It is not going to decide whether Scotland should have a second referendum because that’s a matter for the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Government.

It’s not a matter about when the timing of that will be, because that’s a matter for the Scottish Government and the government to negotiate.“It’s not even a matter for what the question will be, it’s not also a matter of whether Scotland should be an independent country.”The Tories and Liberal Democrats at Holyrood, along with the Scotland in Union organisation have already announced they won’t take part and urged supporters to boycott the Assembly, but Mr Martin said he hoped “they will changed their minds”.Nationalist MP Joanna Cherry hardened attitudes among pro-union parties recently when she claimed it would help pave the way to independence, but sought to clary her position last night.“It will come as no surprise to anyone that as an SNP MP I hope that Scotland will be an independent country, so from thatperspective I see engagement with issues that need to be tackled in Scotland and discussion about them as a way that might move us forward towards independence,” she said.“But other people are coming to the Citizens’ Assembly from a dferent perspective and will see it dferently and there are many issues that we could discuss that usefully that could unite those of us who want independence and those of us who don’t.”The Edinburgh South West MP has been a long-term campaigner for aCitizens’ Assembly and said it should help defuse the “tribal and political affiliations” of Scottish politics. ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"wings over scotland blogger ordered to pay legal expenses to dugdale","story":"A pro-independence blogger has condemned a court decision to award former Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale full legal costs in a failed defamation case.Wings Over Scotlands Stuart Campbell lost a £, defamation case against Ms Dugdale earlier this year.Mr Campbell brought the case after the politician accused him in her Daily Record column of making homophobic remarks.Now Mr Campbell has branded the courts decision to award full legal costs, plus a  per cent uplt, to Ms Dugdale as incomprehensible.He claims on his website that the final bill for the legal costs could be around £,.

Daily Mail!! grow up. Ask yourself the following question, how does today#s GlobalWarming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age  Anyone who cannot answer that question is too ignorant to hold an informed opinion on today#s climate change.Stops PC Plod and the band of merry men, from going in with batons to quell the grown-ups waffling on about, why their leader Comrade Corbyn inspires them with his words.How about giving them a half decent education concentrating on sciencesubjects.

If gted they may even go on to contribute with useful research and technological ideas so unlike are present green, ignorant and wholly ill-informed flock in thecouncil chamberAn area of industry which has not been looked into with any proper statistical information is thisof Agriculture. This industry produces more green house gases than the all of transportation. In fact, it is several times greater than transportation. The catch  scenario is this industry has had no regulation or legislation is regard to reducing greenhouse gases, infact, due to population growth, the pollution created by agriculture is vastly on the increase. Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form. One of mine wanted to go, the other didn#t. One asked a question at the Town Hall and I am very proud # not that she had to protest # but that she had the courage to do so, and silence many there.Well done young folk # out of the mouths of babes as they say.It hardly takes any courage to join a protest, especially one being encouraged and congratulated onby so many folk! The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view. Jumping headlong onto the bandwagon is easy, understanding the science and striving to do something about it the hard bit. Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid.Especially a meaningless strike from school, what child would not love a day off among mates  No doubt the pig ignorant and stupid will be so impressed. A bit like supergluing yourself tp a bus or train, outstanding!!!I didnt say it took courage to join a protest, I said it takes courage to speak at the Town Hall. Andit was about time off school, they all would have gone. Please have more respect for our bairns and young folk.And these bairns are, for your information, studying the stem subjects at school.It is not a case of having respect for the bairns, Johan Adamson. It is just a case of having absolutely no respect whatsoever for those who politicise them and drive them like sheep. Primary children used in a political strike!! Repulsive behaviour, you should be ashamed, so socialist, child exploitation is the words that come to mind.They had to complete a form, primary children! What next, form a political Union and become militant  Little Orwellian sheep bleating for the Pigs.These were AHS pupils Ian, not primary pupils, and no one has politicised them.Educated them yes, but then I forgot you have the monopoly on climate change education and stem subjects.The organisers were I think over , so young adults.The fact is I will always criticise revolting behaviourand ignorance and I am not referring to the children.Yes I do believe sixth year pupils are capable of organising thisWhy do you assume Ian that these bairns are not studying stem subjects and that only you know about climate change then Ian Infantile comments  Pot kettle springs to mind.Now just who printed these forms the children had to fill in  Which teachers OKed the strike and arrange for Brae and Aith schools also took part, as well as bairns from the Sound Primary School and organised and paid for transport  I do not believe that was AHS sixteen-year-olds for one second.Whether by accident or design this provides a very convenient fig leaf for the council#s lamentable performance on child poverty.Much was made of the #children#s march# at the SIC#s education committee meeting today however in a news report about the part of the same meeting that dealt with the council#s child poverty action report, it was clear that the council have done next to nothing since the Shetland Inequalities Commission reported in March .know. All these admirable young citizens are guilty of is taking a stand based on commonly accepted information. I could ask what special knowledge does Ian think he has that allows him to lord it over them# but nerves fail me.On Ian’s earlier point, it is self-evident thatwe need some people with a high level of competence in STEM subjects who can take critical stand on matters scientic. Gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included! Learners on this path can also become alert to common logical fallacies. Even those who like Ian, with a preference for physical sciences, can benefit. Happily don’t need to be much of a scholar to spot an ad hominem attack. With all due respect for Ian’s past achievements in the physical sciences, it would be nicehe could make his points without belittling others #kids included. That’s a normal standard “of decency and tolerance” btw.I so agree with these word #gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included!#. You do so hold yourself in such regard high Peter, now go glue yourself to a train or bus to prove your point!But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of- #Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!# It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse ”.And what are you doing Ian to save the planet And what would you suggest the AHS and the SIC do Ad Hominem attacks # playing the man not the ball # are often used by those who don’t have much of an argument to begin with. Instead of dealing with whether the young people have a point or not, generous-spirited Ian opted to have a go instead.Logical fallacies show lazy thinking, masking an absence of creativity and independent thought. Ian’s trollswipe above looks Ad Hominem in approach st first, but he is also using the Tu Quoque Fallacy. This is where you accuse the opponent of hypocrisy to avoid answering their charge. Self-effacing Ian thus avoids addressing the possibility of his own hubris or lack of self-knowledge.Should I have made things easier for him and asked what his actual beef with the climate protestors was  He says “Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid”and demands that everyone should be able to answer “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ” before taking a view. Perhaps he will educate us by answering his own question # sticking to terms that demonstrate tolerance and decency of course. Nuclear Free Council, Declair Climate emergency,climate justice what a load of utter bunkum. Especially stop allowing political activists to exploit our children.I put forward the question : Is nuclear power the only solution to stop greenhouse gas emissions and the only way to stop climate change progressing further  It may be the worse case scenario in terms of our power demand solution, but what are the alternatives to our demand for energy without causing further environmental and ecological damage to the planet by in using fossil fuels or cleaner alternatives like wind or solar   It has been suggested the Sahara Desert could be used for solar energy to power Europe, but how much land would be required and could this be expanded  The alternatives to fossil fuels may be cleaner, but how would this affect global weather patterns or the depletion of species due to the destruction of natural habitats being replaced for energy production Very sadly the SG SNP has committed to wind energy with its catastrophic environmental damage and only intermittent supply, but that is the policy of the scientically ignorant and utterly stupid.Thank you for your comments, Ian. I fear humanity will have no choice but to go nuclear for its energy production in the future.Alternative resources, like wind or solar, may be the short term answer, but as mentioned, the downside to this is the large amount of land which will be required with the ability to vastly expand as demand increases. What would be the environmental damage and the destabilization of le on the planet have in the long term with such technologies  There is also the issue of economics dictating progress on future energy production, and would this be counter-productive due profits taking priority over progress and the reduction of the pollution into the environment  I agree with your comments Ian, in regard to nuclear based energy production. However, like many issues to do with progress, something catastrophic will have to take place before we realize we should have acted sooner.There it is again, the abusive and arguably ignorant use of that word “stupid”. Having reread all contributions above it seems Ali denies there’s a problem by saying there are dangerously low CO levels, John distracts by arguing the council should care more for child poverty, and Ian disparages, disparages and disparages again. Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet Ian’s singular approach is getting between him and his key message. I’ve long been puzzling as to what makes the good doctorso determined to overuse petty insult so freely, but it would be helpful to know just whathis specic problem with climate change protests is. If he could but answer his own Ice Age question to Brian , his motive might become a little clearer. And apologies in advance to Ianhe has already made his point and I’ve missed it, but it wasn’t me who thought it smart to surround it with invective. Wouldn’t it be just lovelyIan could contribute tolerantly without using putdowns  It’s almost as though he needs them to build himself up# Oh. Hold on# Eureka!#Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet # What a plonker, Peter, just cannot resist going political. Is thisLabour or SNP talking, he often points in both directions or is he now Green Maybe the characters on here who hate the idea of young people protesting about climate change should head down to the school and start shouting some of this stuff over the wall.But, then again, that might make them see . . . well . . . insane.Folk writing to the paper to have a go at the protesters is one of the most depressing contributions to local public debate imaginable.Hopefully, though, the usual naysayerswill only encourage them to do it more.There#s nothing wrong with anyone, of any age, having an opinion on whatever they like, and expressing it. But in their own time, only.The problem with this is that participation in this protest was permitted and facilitated,not encouraged by the education authority, which by default is an endorsement of the opinion being expressed in the protest and the timing method by which the protest was made, by the education authority.Education authorities and schools are supposed to be impartial, by granting #authorised absence# status to a politically motivated protest, that impartiality is now seriously called in to question and a dangerous precedent has been set.There was no reason other than a cynical publicity stunt for this protest to take place during the school day. If those still at school feel strongly enough to organise a protest like adults do, that#s fine, let them, but also like adults, it#ll have to happen in their own time, or they suffer the consequences of #unauthorised absence#, for it to be taken seriously.If they want to play in the big bad world, they play by the big bad world#s rules, not by special favours like this was.Only a few nutters are #impartial# about climate change these days.Do you mean that civil disobedience would have been better Well said Mark! The evident concern trollingis intended to deligitimise the voice of young people who, lets remember, are meant by right to have a say in matters that concern them. Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens. Therefore no one involved in supporting the reported protest has done any wrong, other than in the eyes of seemingly knee-jerk reactionaries who may well be hiding their true motives. Artfully comparing these identiable young people to Orwell’s unthinking farm animals, in order to subvert their point# well it more than lacks sensitivity and compassion. It is desperate, pitul and contemptible in equal measure. It may well also fall foul of observing normal standards of decency and tolerance that contributors to these pagesare meant to adhere to. Those joining the protest were not “stupid”, as has been claimed above. The overuse of that intolerant word may be though. I note you mention #Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens.# now could you explain how taking time off school and striking for the declaration of aclimate emergency makes the child an active and responsible global citizen  I rather feel they are being played by our Greeny ignoramuses and SNP political propagandists!

I just dispute the best way to combat it.Deft footwork here from Ian. His, and his hero Farage’s position # not that he cares to own up to it # is not that there is no climate change. Obviously the climate changes over time. What he is conveniently avoiding are the questions around cause and appropriate response.Please do not make up speculative little stories porkies Peter. Farage is not my hero, however, I find him infinitely preferable to Corbyn and Salmond, however, here is not the place to digress further.Will Hell freeze over before Ian tells us what he presumes the protestors are ignorant of  Answering the question he posed Brian is not too mammoth a task for him surely. I suspect he is trying to dodge it for a reason.Read and weep Peter. If your intellect stretches that far. !! In the most simple of Science, It is set out below. The protestors are ignorant of the very most basic understanding of carbon capture and the prevention of climate change. Trees!! Only the very most utterly stupid, like yourself cannot see the wood for them!It is not clear the protest had a position on biomass, however Ian has firmly stated the need for those taking any position to be able to answer #how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age #Ian has thus far excitedly cited three articles, none of which reference any ice age. The first: #Tree planting ‘has mind-blowing potential’ to tackle climate crisis#, has Professor Crowther emphasising #it remains vital to reverse the current trends of rising greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and forest destruction, and bring them down to zero# this is needed to stop the climate crisis becoming even worse and because the forest restoration envisaged would take - years to have its full effect##Reafforestation, necessary as it is, isn#t no silver bullet, nor a speedy enough solution, though many on the protest would likely love to plant some trees.The second and third articles focus on biomass, which is contested.To help Ian make his point, does he mean the Cryogenian, the second last ice age or the Little Ice Age  Again, other than to spread scorn and belittle, what is Ian#s actual point Sorrymy point is beyond you Peter. My question # “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ”That would require a thesis at post-graduate level to answer. Hardly space here! My point was that these children simple to not have the science to have a considered and informed opinion based on knowledge. The science is actually simple, I suggest you look it up and read it.Lest anyone thinking of studying the sciences, physical or social, be put off, Ian’s approach to advancing a scientic argument is far from typical. Thomas Kuhn made a very useful contribution by proposing that as a science advances some innaccurate claims will inevitably be made and indeed built on, but will later be corrected as sufficient contrary evidence emerges. Hawkins himself corrected some of his own foundational work. A settled consensus generally emerges over time through reasonable and reasoned dialogue and argument in which peer reviewed sources, research evidence and the thinking they provoke are made apparent.This is perhaps one reason why the Shetland Times asks contributors to observe normal standards of decency and tolerance for the opinions of others. It helps to bring forth the truth.It is, however, more than unusual for anyone taking themselves seriously to make a strong central scientic claim then refuse to back it up, clary it’s meaning or intent# unless of course Ian is proposing rhetoric, cant and distracting insult are now sciences, in which case top marks are due to the happy fellow.What a load of pretentious twaddle. You have outdone yourself here Peter. The word Science simply means knowledge, no more no less. It is just as simple as that.Whilst he remains intent on running away from clarying and substantiating his own point, here is an easier question for Ian: Why does he call Greens lunatics  There must be some point of disagreement between him and them, in his own head at least..."},{"url":null,"title":"yell ferry daggri could be out of service for up to two weeks ","story":" will be taken out of service for up to a fortnight in early July in order for essential mechanical work to be done.According to Shetland Islands Council, inspections during the recent annual refit had highlighted an issue with the shaft bearings between each main engine and the propulsion thrusters.Parts were not available at that time and the vessel would now need to be taken out of service to carry out the repairs, which could take up to two weeks..Bookings and timetable on the route would operate as normal but with a reduced capacity for vehicles, the SIC said, apologising for any inconvenience caused. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"amaryllis takes top prize at shetland race first leg reception ","story":"The prizes for the Bergen to Lerwick leg of the Pantaenius Shetland Race were handed out at a civic reception at Mareel on Friday evening..

Calum McAuley, an apprentice with Braid Electrical Services, won ‘Apprentice of the Year’.And Jordan Haggan, apprentice electrician with Alexander Bonar  Co, was highly commended in the same category. They were nominated for the accolade alongside another three of their College colleagues. The Northern Ireland Electrical Awards, which represent the pinnacle achievement for the electrical industry in Northern Ireland, recognise and reward the achievements of those working in the province’s erse electrical sector. Organised by the Electrical Magazine and judged by an independent  of respected industry experts, the awards collectively recognise the achievements of both companies and iniduals. Sean McAleese, Training Manager at Northern Regional College, said they are thrilled that the hard work and talent of so many of their apprentices are being recognised at these awards.“We have worked closely with local employers over many years to ensure we are equipping our students with industry-level skills, and these invaluable relationships help us to ensure our students receive training at the very highest level,” he said.Apprentice of the Year Calum, who is currently enrolled on a Level  electrical installation programme, said he always wanted to be an electrician.“I’ve always tried, both in College and on-site, to achieve the very highest standards, in everything I do,” said Calum. “It’s great to have all that hard work and effort recognised with an award like this one.”Jordan Haggan, , said from the outset of his career he spent a lot of time working alongside electricians.“But it took me a while to make the leap of faith and pursue it as a career myself. I thought it was too late to start but the apprenticeship has opened new doors for me, and I really enjoy the work I do and am proud of the new skills I’ve developed,” he said.“This award is really just the icing on the cake for me and it means a lot to be recognised for my hard work.”The  Electrical Awards took place recently at the Crowne Plaza Hotel, in Belfast.

If someone living with sight loss has a positive experience when they are out and about with any service provider then they are going towith their loyalty and spending power.“We’re quite fortunate here in Northern Irelandthat businesses are supportive on the whole, but we just need to keep that message current and keep it at the forefront of people’s mind. Businesses need to be actively welcoming visitors with disabilities because it isn’t just the right thing to do, it also makes business sense.”While there is still plenty of work to be done in making the North of Ireland disability friendly, Guide Dogs NI have helped drive through some vital changes. “We’re somewhat dferent to our counterparts across the water because they’re still campaigning on some of the things that we already have such as audiovisual on buses and disability awareness training for taxi drivers here,” Hannah says.“We have those things in place, so we are lucky in that respect. One of the big things we’re working on at the minute is our pavement parking campaign. Parking is a problem throughout the country but because of rising congestion levels it’s getting worse. It can really negatively impact on somebody’s day when someone un-thoughtfully abandons their car and that visually impaired person then has to turn back or make the decisionthey should walk into the road to complete their journey. That’s a level of stress and anxiety that nobody should have to deal with.”Training guide dogs is, of course, a key part of the charity’s work, but they are now asking for volunteers to become sighted guides for people with visual impairment. “A guide dog sometimes isn’t for everyone and that’s why My Guide is our free service that enables people with a vision impairment to get out of their homes and into the community,” Hannah explains.“With a volunteer as their sighted guide, they can overcome challenges presented by unfamiliar places or crowded areas, enjoy exploring and becoming involved in their local communities and ultimately become more independent. “We provide all the volunteer trainingand ask for a commitment of a few hours once a week to help someone with a visual impairment to get out and about. There are people located across the whole of Northern Ireland currently waiting for a volunteer and it is truly such a rewarding role to take on.”If anyone is interested becoming a sited guide or wants to find out more, they can get in touch with the Guide Dogs NI team at Belfast@guidedogs.org.ukThe Master*Chef grand finale will take place as part of Féile an Phobail at the Balmoral Hotel on Wednesday th of August .For more information, see: balmoralhotelbelfast pro-masterchef"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"the miami dance hall days are back","story":"SHOPPERS and workers on Great Victoria Street did a double take this week as the writing team and cast from the Miami Showband Story struck up a few classic numbers outside the Grand Opera House.Martin Lynch and Marie Jones along with showband man George Jones and West Belfast Miami member Des Lee entertained city centre shoppers ahead of the show’s premiere on August .Penned by Marie Jones and Martin Lynch, the team that wrote the George Best musical Dancing Shoes, the Miami Showband Story will take audiences through the joyous dance hall days of the s through to darker times and the atrocity of the murder of Fran O’Toole, Brian McCoy and guitarist Tony Geraghty on July  .The production will entertain audiences on a ten-night run at the Grand Opera House before embarking on a four-week tour of Ireland concluding at Dublin’s Gaiety Theatre in September.For ticket information visit www.goh."},{"url":null,"title":"limited sharing of brexit information shows uk total indifference to northern ireland","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It suggested communication between the department in Northern Ireland and officials in London was not adequate. \"Northern Ireland officials have limited visibility of Brexit information even in areas that are critical to Northern Ireland interests,\" the review said.It went on to say as the original March Brexit deadline approached communication improved.Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard said the revelations showed \"the total lack of concern in London regarding the impact on people here\".“Despite the fact that the north will be hardest hit by this disastrous policy, we continue to see London’s total indference and disregard for the consequences of Brexit in Ireland.“We are being driven toward a disastrous no deal Brexit.

You either play ball with us or you wont be part of the negotiations on behalf of the industry.\"The RHA has acknowledged that discussions with the Government have continued after the voicemail message was sent.A Department for Transport spokesman said: \"The RHA has been heavily involved in our EU exit preparatory work and we will continue to involve them at every stage of our planning.\"It is extremely unfortunate when details of private conversations held in confidence are made public in a press release.\"The documentary will also feature an interview with the former permanent secretary at the Department for Exiting the European Union, Philip Rycroft, who said a no-deal Brexit is something the public should be \"worried\" about.Mr Rycroft said: \"I think everybody should be worried about what happens in a no-deal situation. We would be taking a step into the unknown.\"He added: \"Its not in the UKs interest to have no-deal, its not in the EUs interest to have a no-deal. The rational outcome over the next few months is to get a deal because that is overwhelmingly in the economic interest of both the EU and the UK.\"Mr Rycroft was in charge of Brexit planning for  months before stepping down just before the March Brexit deadlin e.He said there are around \", civil servants whose jobs are dedicated to Brexit-related issues\", in what he called \"the biggest exercise across Government weve seen over the last few decades\".He added: \"The planning I think is in good shape, absolutely... but of course what that doesnt mean is that there wont be an impact from Brexit, and particularly a no-deal Brexit, because that is a very major change and it would be a very abrupt change to our major trading relationship.\"The BBC Panorama programme No-Deal Brexit: Are We Ready  will air on BBC One tonight at .pm"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He then drove back home and picked up his we Phyllis, collected his mother and father-in-law and drove to Buncrana where they played a round of Pitch and Putt. The family then asked looked around the Inishowen town for holiday accommodation for later in the summer before ing to Derry.That evening, they all had a fry for their supper and then Sammy drove his mother and father-in-law home before ing to William Street again. Sammy watched television until midnight and headed for bed about .am. Mrs Devenny followed him up around .am and recalled that Sammy “was in the best of form.”As she got into bed Phyllis said Sammy said “oh dear” and was panting and wheezing. She wasted no time in calling a priest and a doctor and her neighbour Mrs Myra Doherty. When Fr Mulvey and Fr McCullough arrived, Mrs Devenny left the room.  Sammy Devenny died around .am on July , just as Dr Clarke arrived at the house.Mr Devenney’s remains were formally identied by his son Harry and the Post Mortem examination was carried out by State Pathologist Dr TK Marshall on the day of the death.The cause of death was established as coronary atheroma and old thrombosis. The central question surrounding the death of Sammy Devenny has always been whether it was caused by the injuries sustained during the RUC assault.When conducting the Post Mortem examination it was noted by Dr Marshall that in , Mr Devenney had complained to his doctor of aches in his left shoulder and lower left side and the back of his chest but nothing sinister had been found at that time.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshAs a result the Pathologist did not state that the death had been caused the injuries taken during the attack. Also, Dr Pantridge at the Royal Victoria Hospital believed that death occurred from natural causes and the assault was not a contributory factor.And, Dr Vine, Consultant at Altnagelvin agreed with the others and suggested thatthe heart attack was the result of the attack by the RUC it probably would have occurred immediately.But, Dr Clarke, partner in the practice of Dr Kinsella, the Devenny family’s practice said that the assault on Sammy Devenny and his children and the acute nervous tension arising from contributed to the heart attack.The Inquest into the death of Sammy Devenny was opened on July ,  and was conducted by Coroner MF Leslie who recorded that: “The jury, having heard all the evidence and in accordance with the medical evidence placed before them,a verdict of death by natural causes.”By occupation, Sammy Devenny was an undertaker and hearse driver for the firm of McClafferty and Sons in Derry. He was regarded by everyone as a quiet and mild-mannered man and had never been involved in any political agitation.Newspaper reports recorded that his funeral was one of the largest the city had ever seen and was attended by an estimated , people.CAPTION: The remains of Sammy Devenny being carried past his home in William Street."},{"url":null,"title":"llanidloes town council responds severn porte park upkeep critics","story":"Severn Porte, Llanidloes.

Others recruited and trained the teams of young people or provided legal, financial and insurance support for the project.On the afternoon of June , , , young people mdash aged between  and  mdash assembled at Delamont to finally pull the largest megalith in the United Kingdom and Ireland into place.Over the preceding months, the volunteers, recruited from schools and youth groups from all over Northern Ireland, had attended numerous training sessions in preparation for the event..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch student has a royal date with duchess  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH teenager who battled mental health issues celebrated his th birthday with the ultimate party mdash a date with the Duchess of Cambridge at Kensington Palace.Cathal McCann, who attends St Malachyrsquos High School in Castlewellan, was invited to the palace after he was helped through a mental health crisis by Action for Children Northern Irelandrsquos Blues Programme.His mum, Mandy, said: ldquoHe wouldnrsquot even be here todayit wasnrsquot for Action for Children so to celebrate by meeting Duchess Kate is the icing on the cake.ldquoHe was very low and even self-harming.

Both batsmen set about the task in a positive manner with Campbell especially hitting out.Lindsay was eventually bowled for  runs and that brought Conor Moag to the wicket, scoring a quick seven, getting out to a good catch.

That is why we have arranged tonightrsquos meeting and I hope it will be well supported by the people of Downpatrick, across the district and further afield.Mr Morgan claimed many people he has spoken to want change and have an appetite for a new Assembly comprising independent members, not established political party representatives.He continued: ldquoTonightrsquos meeting is the next stage in the campaign and we are approaching this on a county by county basis.

He also pointed out that gold was more common in Ireland during the Bronze Age than in most other parts of Europe.The jury concluded that the fastener had been intentionally hidden or concealed and therefore declared it treasure trove.Although young Elizabeth is likely to receive compensation for discovering the fastener, the coroner ruled that it becomes the property of the Queen and will be handed over to the Treasury.ARDGLASS mdash A verdict of death by misadventure was recorded on a  year-old man whose body was found washed up at Ardglass in February this year after the boat on which he was fishing sank.An inquest jury at Downpatrick on Thursday heard how James Edward Greer, of Elmfield Park, Donaghadee, had been held up in the water for about  minutes by his skipper, who eventually had to let go of him.The badly decomposed body of Mr Greer, who could not swim, was washed up at Sheepland Begg on February .The skipper of the boat said he held the deceased for about five minutes after their vessel was hit by a big wave off Peel in the Isle of Man.He tried to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, but Mr Greer was unconscious and after another ten minutes he had to get him go because he himself was in danger.

The long range forecast reckons that the warm, dry spell may continue.BALLYGOWAN mdash Two hundred workers at the ropeworks factory in Ballygowan will lose their jobs within the next three months.A spokesman for the Belfast Ropeworks Company Ltd, the owners of the factory, says that heavy losses have been sustained in recent years and therefore all production will have to be brought to a halt.The workers, both male and female, will be declared redundant during the course of the next  weeks. The marking and selling activities of the company will be unaffected and customers will continue to be supplied.The company spokesman said he regretted that it had become necessary to cease the manufacture of rope and twine products and carpet fibre at the local factory.ldquoThe cost of production at Ballygowan has consistently exceeded what the market can bear, while the remoteness of the factory from its principal market in Great Britain imposes a further burden in respect of prohibitive transport costs, particularly for finished goods, he added.DOWNPATRICK mdash Downpatrick Young Farmers had a very successful day at the th annual Young Farmersrsquo county rally on Saturday. Out of the  clubs Downpatrick gained maximum points to won both the Farm Tasks Shield and the Rally Shield.Overall, the club achieved a high number of placings, including a second from Pat Turley in weed identication and a first from Vincent MacNabb in soil assessment.STRANGFORD LOUGH mdash The Department of Energy has no future plans to use Strangford Lough as an experiment centre in the battle to harness wave energy as a source of power.More than  months ago scientists gained valuable information for a sea trial buoy which was built at the marine biology station in Portaferry and nearby at Marffield Bay.A Department of Energy official has informed the South Down MP, Mr Enoch Powell, that no further tests at Strangford Lough are planned at present.The official was answering a question raised by Mr Powell in the House of Commons asking whether the Department had taken into account the experiments in the lough.During the experiments scientists monitored radio signals from the buoy which experienced a wide range of weather conditions during a one-month period.The device was small scale, but it gave scientists enough information to produced a design for a full scale device. It is thought that a chain of such buoys could one day be one of our main sources of power..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Irish Street open again after three month delay  ","story":"DOWNPATRICKrsquoS Irish Street finally reopened to two-way traffic last weekend after a protracted environmental improvement scheme took twice as long to complete than originally planned.Contractors removed barriers to allow the flow of two-way traffic on Friday evening but traffic lights at the Market Street junction mdash which were permanently on red during work on the pound, public realm project mdash were not adjusted.Motorists arriving at the bottom of the street were left confused and had to carefully ease across the busy junction and while the traffic lights remained stuck on red the following morning, they were finally adjusted.The street is scheduled to be closed to all traffic this weekend as the final touches are put to the environmental scheme which will see the road between the Market Street and John Street junctions resurfaced.The Department for Infrastructure, which managed the scheme on behalf of the Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council, has admitted that the delayed public realm scheme had a ldquonegative impact on trading across the town.In addition, government officials also conceded that more should have been done to keep the business community affected by the overrunning project better informed.In May, business owners and traders took part in a protest at the delay in completing the environmental revamp to provide new granite paving, street lighting and furniture. The scheme was originally due to complete at the end of March.Signicant problems which delayed the scheme which the government department described as ldquounforeseen works issues included the discovery of asbestos piping by BT Openreach along both sides of Irish Street, delaying progress by eight weeks.Contractors also encountered problems with the foundations of the old blast wall at the former PSNI station and part of the Irish Street sewerage network.While traders were fully supportive of the regeneration scheme, they expressed anger that the project took more than twice as long to complete than originally planned and that they were not better informed by the government department.In addition, many have expressed surprise at the design of the scheme which has resulted in the narrowing of one of the townrsquos main streets at its junction with John Street and a loss of parking spaces.A number of traders have also questioned why a second footpath has been provided on one side of Irish Street given one was already in place.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said traders, shoppers and residents will be pleased that Irish Streetrsquos two-way traffic flow has been reinstated and hoped that ldquovaluable lessons will have been learned by all those involved with the public realm scheme.Ahead of work on a planned upgrade of the Collinsrsquo Corner junction in Downpatrick, which is due to start shortly, he also hopes businesses and residents affected by the work will be provided with regular updates.Five roads converge at the busy junction where roads officials plan to upgrade traffic signals and introduce a new one-way system in Lower Stream Street.The Killough Road merges with Pound Lane, Stream Street, Irish Street and St Patrickrsquos Avenue with Cllr Curran hoping disruption will be kept to a minimum.ldquoGiven the nature of this particular junction and the huge volume of traffic it handles on a daily basis, disruption is inevitable, he said.ldquoWhile it is important that road users remain patient and obey any temporary traffic flows which may be in place, roads officials must keep people informed.Cllr Curran added: ldquoWhat happened in Irish Street must not and cannot be repeated. Lessons have surely been learned and keeping people better informed must be the priority.ldquoThe Collinsrsquo Corner upgrade is vital and I hope that once this scheme has been completed a lsquoserious lookrsquo will be taken at addressing the congestion problem in nearby Edward Street which is a major health and safety issue..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Lynch excels at Spelga race  ","story":"NEWCASTLE ACrsquos Seamus Lynch won race seven of the NIMRA Championship, which took place at Spelga Dam on Saturday,, the aptly named Spelga Skyline.Typical Mourne weather of passing showers and fog did not deter the  entries.

If Fascism hadnrsquot been beaten we would be living in a very dferent world today. ldquoWe would be living in fear of a regime which would not tolerate any descent. We are very lucky and should be thankful to those veterans who risked all and gave their tomorrow for our today.Cllr Hanna said the districtrsquos surviving veterans were small in number and well into their nineties, and that society owed a debt to them for their part in the battle to secure the freedom people enjoy today.He said he included the Merchant Navy in his proposal because many risked their lives on merchant ships to ferry supplies which helped win the war.ldquoThis was a cruel war where many lost their lives and I really hope we never have to face anything like this again. Those from Northern Ireland who fought and served during World War Two came from all sections of the community.ldquoBefore it is too late, I believe this council should acknowledge what these brave people did for us all by presenting surviving veterans with a silver poppy at a cross community service in November, said Cllr Hanna.He added: ldquoI hope that the council will support this motion as a mark of respect for the generation which has given us freedoms we take for granted.The SDLPrsquos Declan McAteer said he was ldquosomewhat dubious about the suggestion for the council ldquoto go out on a limb and procure silver poppy medals.ldquoI fully respect the sentiment of those wishing to identy with what is essentially a British symbol which wonrsquot by endorsed by all Irish men or women. The poppy, for better or worse, is associated with all conflicts that Britain was involved in from the First World War right through.ldquoI would say that perhaps thatwe do anything around this we take a lead from the British Legion in Ireland which decided on a shamrock poppy which has been worn by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.Cllr McAteer proposed that the issue be referred to the local authorityrsquos Good Relations Forum, with Sinn Feinrsquos Mickey Ruane in agreement.Cllr Ruane said he was respectful of the motion Cllr Hanna and his party had tabled, suggesting the Good Relations Forum was the ldquoideal committee to send the issue to.He added: We need to look at this issue and decide what event we are going to have and come to a respectful decision.At the debate conclusion, Cllr Hanna reaffirmed he had no issue referring his proposal for further debate, highlighting the need for the matter to be dealt with quickly.He also said he had no dficulty with awarding veterans a shamrock, suggesting that they could perhaps be offered the chance of being awarded this or a poppy..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New civic amenity centre set to open in Downpatrick  ","story":"DOWNPATRICKrsquoS new civic amenity centre is scheduled to open later this month.The new site at the Flying Horse Road on the outskirts of the town will replace the nearby Cloonagh Road facility which has been struggling for some time to keep pace with increasing demand.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is building the new centre which is larger than the current facility and will be able to handle considerably more waste.

The second thing has been watching people grow in their faith and use their gts for the Lord as well as seeing how amazing they become under God’s transformation”..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p Phyllis is keen to acknowledge the role that her husband, David has played in her le and work.She said: “He was already a member of the congregation although it took me a while to find him! I must say the best thing that ever happened in my le was marrying David. He has become a real partner not only as my husband but in the ministry as well and I really couldn’t have done this job without his support over the years.”Phyllis admitted that she will miss the ‘fantastic’ staff team at West Church.She said: “I will miss the day to day things of ministry, particularly visiting people at home and in hospital. Those relationships are very special and precious. People make le what it is so often through the relationships you build with them. It is a privilege to be part of people’s lives and to have them trust you enough to share their inner-most thoughts and confidences.“I would love to thank all of the congregation who have made me part of the family at West. They have given me such joy and a peace in my work every day as I spend time with them.”The retiring Deaconess had particularly warm words for Rev. Daniel Kane, who has led the Ministry Team at West Church for  years.She said: “Daniel has been the best boss any Deaconess could ever have. He is a great man of vision but more than anything he enables staff to grow in their faith and to use the God-given gts with which they have been supplied.

I say this as somebody who is saddened to say it – I do not want to wake up and find myself a subject of the United Kingdom of England and Wales.”DUP MP Sammy Wilson said that Mr Hoare’s comment was “exactly the sort of language that Sinn Féin want to hear because of course the trigger for a border poll in the Belfast Agreement is a belief that there is a change in the views of the people of Northern Ireland”.Mr Hoare responded to DUP claims that they would win a border poll by saying that “it’s rather risky, I would suggest, to risk something as precious as our Union to that thing called a border poll”.He claried that he was not speaking “to give succour” to those hoping for a border poll.Ulster-born Labour MP Kate Hoey announces she will stand down after  years as Vauxhall MP Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingWillie Frazer funeral -  photographs as mourners bid final farewell to victims campaignerMan dies in tragic incident on major N.I. roadPeople injured and hospitalised after three vehicle collisionN.I.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

I had hoped to work constructively with them and take their concerns on board.ldquoThose who were elected as Conservatives but have chosen to betray the faith that was shown in them by their constituents should have the courage to resign and face by-elections. They should defend their decisions at the ballot box.ldquoAn establishment stitch up between these councillors and Labour is not in the interest of residents of the Vale of Glamorgan. They have explicitly argued that they know best and that the public should be ignored.ldquoI will be proposing a minority Conservative administration at the Vale Councilrsquos AGM with a plan that delivers on the priorities of local people. I will challenge other councillors to back it.Earlier on Wednesday, Cllr Gray made a statement to Vale of Glamorgan Councilrsquos Conservative group to say he was resigning.In his statement, he said he had ldquoabsolutely no issue with the manner in which Cllr Bailey was elected as the new leader of the Conservative Group,But he said he is ldquoat least partially at odds with Cllr Bailey on three issues ndash the proposed lsquoclosurersquo of Llancarfan Primary School, the Dinas Powys Bypass and the incinerator in Barry.On the Llancarfan School proposal, which would see the primary moved to a new building in Rhoose, he said: ldquoI seconded a motion to have the executive reopen the issue consultation and this was ignored by the then cabinet but now that this dficult decision has been made I fear that any attempt to articially prop up Llancarfan School will take funding away from the budgets of Penarth schools which is something I will not tolerate.Cllr Gray said heremained ldquounconvinced that the proposed bypass around Dinas Powys, linking Cardf to Barry, ldquois an issue with a large base of support in my ward, and the efforts to give it even more prominence and funding would I believe be to the detriment of the residents of my ward.Vale council has been waiting for more than a year for Welsh Government to decide whether the Barry incinerator needs to carry out an environmental impact assessment before it can operate.Cllr Gray said any efforts to ramp up the councilrsquos rhetoric on the incinerator ldquowould do a disservice to those residents who are passionate about the subject.ldquoRaising  hope for headlines is not the reason I stood for local government and I donrsquot want to mark my success by how many column inches we are able to achieve on a wedge issue, he said.       ,params: .pushHe added:ldquoThe structures around the group that Vince is proposing seemed to be geared up to act as an opposition party and not to focus on the work of delivering core services for the benefit of the most vulnerable members of our society.ldquoI donrsquot expect everyone to agree with my decision and I donrsquot take this decision lightly ndash I am sure that there will be a great number of people who have an opinion on whether I have done the right thing or not.ldquoI need to remain true to myself and my belief in acting as a positive advocate for the residents in my ward ndash the issues that get me out of bed every morning to work hard for the residents in my ward are not the way the press views me but how I can make a positive dference to peoplersquos lives. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people.

The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

According to the charity, people with dementia typically spend pound, on their care.Jeremy Hughes, chief executive of the Alzheimerrsquos Society, said:ldquoThis shocking sum of money spent by people with dementia over the last two years trying to get access to the care and support they desperately need is utterly unacceptable.ldquoAnd the amount and quality of care theyrsquore getting for it ndash those who can afford it ndash just isnrsquot good enough. The results are people with dementia and their families falling victim to this dreadfully broken system.ldquoLike the families in our exhibition, hundreds of thousands of people affected by dementia in this country are facing financial punishment, just because they happened to develop dementia and not some other disease.ldquoThe evidence of the gross inequity continues to pile up, and yet still the Government does nothing.ldquoWe need an immediate cash injection through a dedicated Dementia Fund, while the Government works out a long-term solution to finally end this crisis in care..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: People with dementia  uhave spent almost  xAbn of their own money u article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/bbobb.jpg","title":"coffee chain bob and berts creating  new jobs","story":"Posted on Monday  June  by John Mulgrew A Northern Ireland coffee shop chain is creating  new jobs as its expands it reach across the UK with eight new stores, it has emerged.
