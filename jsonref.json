And the availability of EU tradesmen is reportedly dwindling ahead of Brexit. Chief executive at the FMB, Brian Berry, said: ‘When looking to appoint a builder, alarm bells should ring if they say they can start next week. \u0027If homeowners want a new extension fully completed in time for Christmas, they should be contacting builders for quotes by May – at the very latest.’The shortage also suggests that customers face paying a premium if they want to ensure their builder has a strong record and employs trained staff.          Chief executive at the FMB, Brian Berry (pictured) said: ‘When looking to appoint a builder, alarm bells should ring if they say they can start next week. If homeowners want a new extension fully completed in time for Christmas, they should be contacting builders for quotes by May – at the very latest.’Research by the federation puts the average annual salary of a trained bricklayer at just over £42,000. However it says those in areas of high demand can earn around £90,000 a year. The UK average for a plumber is £48,675 and £47,265 for an electrician.Mr Berry said: ‘We need to be training more UK-born apprentices to reduce future reliance on migrant workers from Europe, or else the construction sector will grind to a halt.’The Construction Industry Training Board estimates the UK needs an extra 35,000 builders and tradesmen each year between now and 2020.The National Federation of Builders warned new immigration proposals – restricting people who earn less than £30,000 a year from coming to the UK – will block foreign tradesmen."},{"url":null,"title":"Unruly British tourists New Zealand revealed gypsy controversy escalates","story":"    The identities and relationships of the British travellers who have sparked uproar in New Zealand can be revealed.

Pope Francis accepted Zanchetta\u0027s resignation in August 2017, after priests in the remote northern Argentine diocese of Oran complained about his authoritarian ruleHe said he made the complaints: \u0027When the situation was much more serious, not just because there had been a question about sexual abuses, but because the diocese was increasingly heading into the abyss.\u0027Adding: \u0027In 2015, we just sent a \u0027digital support\u0027 with selfie photos of the previous bishop in obscene or out of place behavior that seemed inappropriate and dangerous,\u0027 he told reporters afterwards in an email. \u0027It was an alarm that we made to the Holy See via some friendly bishops. The nunciature didn\u0027t intervene directly, but the Holy Father summoned Zanchetta and he justified himself saying that his cellphone had been hacked, and that there were people who were out to damage the image of the pope.\u0027          While other colleagues reported to the Vatican alleging abuses of power, inappropriate behavior and sexual harassment of adult seminarians, said the former vicar, the Rev. Juan Jose ManzanoFrancis had named Zanchetta to Oran, a humble city some 1,025 miles northwest of Buenos Aires in Salta province, in 2013 in one of his first Argentine bishop appointments as pope. He knew Zanchetta well Zanchetta had been the executive undersecretary of the Argentine bishops conference, which the former Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio headed for two successive terms, from 2005-2011.And by all indications, they were close. Manzano said Bergoglio had been Zanchetta\u0027s confessor and treated him as a \u0027spiritual son.\u0027All of which could explain why Francis named him to Oran despite complaints about alleged abuses of power when Zanchetta was in charge of economic affairs in his home diocese of Quilmes, which is in the ecclesial province of Buenos Aires which Bergoglio headed.  (A girl stands outside the Church \u0027 San Cayetano\u0027 in Oran, Argentina) The Rev. Juan Jose Manzano of the church said he was one of the three priests who made a second complaint about Bishop Gustavo Zanchetta to the Vatican\u0027s embassy in Buenos Aires in 2017 Earlier this month, the Vatican confirmed that the new bishop of Oran had opened a preliminary canonical investigation into Zanchetta for alleged sexual abuse. But Vatican spokesman Alessandro Gisotti stressed in a January 3 statement that the abuse allegations had only emerged at the end of 2018, after Zanchetta\u0027s resignation and nearly a year after Francis created the new position for him as \u0027assessor\u0027 of the Vatican\u0027s financial management office.At the time of his resignation, Zanchetta had only asked Francis to let him leave Oran because he had difficult relations with its priests and was \u0027unable to govern the clergy,\u0027 Gisotti said in the statement.\u0027At the time of his resignation there were accusations against him of authoritarianism, but there were no accusations of sexual abuse against him,\u0027 the statement said.  A plaque with the image of Bishop Gustavo Zanchetta is seen outside the cathedral in Oran, Argentina, on Wednesday, Jan. 16, 2019. Earlier in January, the Vatican confirmed that the new bishop of Oran had opened a canonical investigation into Zanchetta for alleged sexual abusesManzano said the Vatican had information about sexually inappropriate behavior starting in 2015, with the naked selfies, and reports of alleged misconduct and harassment in May or June of 2017, though he noted they didn\u0027t constitute formal canonical complaints.After the 2015 report, Francis summoned Zanchetta to Rome, Manzano said. He returned to Argentina \u0027improved, to the point that no one even investigated how those photos got to Rome.\u0027But as the months passed, Zanchetta \u0027became more aggressive and took impulsive decisions, manipulating facts, people, influences to reach his goals.\u0027 (Oran city, Argentina) Pope Francis accepted Bishop Gustavo Zanchetta\u0027s resignation in August 2017 after priests in this remote northern Argentine diocese rebelled under his authoritarian ruleManzano said Zanchetta started coming to the seminary at all hours, drinking with the seminarians and bringing a seminarian with him whenever he visited a parish, sometimes without asking permission of the rector.\u0027The rector tried to keep the students in order, being present when the bishop appeared, but the monsignor looked for ways to avoid his attention and to discredit him in front of the young guys,\u0027 Manzano told reporters in an email. \u0027The bad feeling was aggravated when some of them left the seminary. It was then that the rector investigated and warned of harassment and inappropriate behavior.\u0027In May or June 2017, Manzano, the rector and another priest presented their concerns to the No. 2 in the Buenos Aires nunciature, Monsignor Vincenzo Turturro, \u0027who moved it forward fabulously,\u0027 Manzano said.   (A man prays during a Mass in Oran, Argentina) The Vatican received information in 2015 and 2017 that former Bishop of Oran Gustavo Zanchetta, close to Pope Francis, had taken naked selfies, exhibited \u0027obscene\u0027 behavior and had been accused of sexually abusing seminariansManzano said he reported about Zanchetta\u0027s alleged abuses of power with the clergy, while the rector reported about the alleged sexual abuses in the seminary. Manzano said he didn\u0027t know the details of the alleged abuses, but he ruled out any acts of rape.The pope summoned Zanchetta again in July 2017. Returning home, Zanchetta announced his resignation in a July 29 statement saying he needed immediate treatment for a health problem.Zanchetta spent time in Corrientes before leaving for Spain, where he is believed to have met with one of Francis\u0027 spiritual guides, the Rev. German Arana, a Jesuit to whom Francis had sent another problematic bishop, the Chilean Juan Barros.Zanchetta largely disappeared from public view until the Vatican, in an official announcement December 19, 2017, said Francis had named him to the new position of \u0027assessor\u0027 in APSA, a key administrative department which manages the Holy See\u0027s real estate and financial holdings.  (A motorcycle drives past the seminary building in Oran, Argentina)Zanchetta has not publicly responded to the allegations against him. The Vatican has not provided information when asked, other than to say he is not working while the investigation takes its course.Manzano defended Francis\u0027 handling of the case, saying the pope himself should be considered a victim of Zanchetta\u0027s \u0027manipulation.\u0027\u0027There was never any intent to hide anything. There was never any intent of the Holy Father to defend him against anything,\u0027 Manzano said. He denied there was any contradiction in the Vatican\u0027s Jan. 3 statement, distinguishing between a report about alleged sexual abuse and a formal complaint.The current bishop of Oran, Bishop Luis Antonio Scozzina, declined to speak to reporters on camera, saying he wanted to keep silent until the investigation was in the hands of the Holy See.   (People sit outside the Cathedral in Oran, Argentina)He has issued a statement urging victims to come forward and provide testimony. But he told reporters he didn\u0027t want to create a media circus that might compromise the rights of both victims and accused.A catechist in the diocese said church leaders had told staff and volunteers not to speak to the media about the allegations at the seminary.The mother of one seminarian said her son had told her that the allegations of sexual misconduct involving some of his colleagues in the seminary were true. \u0027Unfortunately yes, he told me when I asked him about this,\u0027 she said, speaking on condition of anonymity to protect her son.The scandal, which was first reported by The Tribune newspaper of Salta, has taken its toll in Oran, a deeply conservative community near the Bolivian border.\u0027I feel a great pain, because as a Christian how can we let these things take place?\u0027 asked retiree Hector Jimenez. Teacher Gianina del Valle Chein said the Vatican should have treated Zanchetta like \u0027like any normal person who did something, and not hide him, take him away to somewhere else so that he can keep doing the same thing.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"The Queen braves cold arrives church","story":"    The Queen failed to wear a seatbelt for the second time in 48 hours as she was chauffeured to the church service in a black Bentley today          Royal passenger: The Queen arrives at St Peter\u0027s church in the back of a car after both she and her husband were seen apparently driving without a seatbelt this week           Queen Elizabeth II attends a service at St Peter\u0027s church in Wolferton this morning just days after her husband\u0027s crash  The Queen (left) wrapped up warm for today\u0027s church service, while her son Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, joined his mother at the church near the Sandringham estate where the royal family spent Christmas together The church is just over a two-mile drive from Sandringham House, and dozens of well-wishers gathered behind a rope fence to see her arrive. The Queen was spotted driving her Range Rover without a seatbelt on Friday a day after Prince Philip\u0027s crash, little more than a mile from the scene of her husband\u0027s accident. Police have spoken to the Duke after he was pictured driving a new Land Rover alone and without a belt just 48 hours after his crash. A Norfolk Constabulary spokeswoman said the force was aware of the pictures of Philip driving and that \u0027suitable words of advice have been given to the driver\u0027.   \u0027I\u0027m lucky to be alive\u0027: Mother-of-two, 45, who broke her...Now police give defiant Prince Philip, 97, an official...Police launch investigation into Prince Philip crash as it\u0027s...Share this articleShe learned to drive with the Army in 1945, before she became Queen, and does not need a licence.Under UK law it is compulsory to wear a seatbelt if there is one fitted but the Queen is immune from any civil or criminal proceedings. Buckingham Palace insisted earlier this week that the monarch was careful to ensure she privately complied with the law.  The crash on Thursday afternoon happened as Philip\u0027s Freelander pulled out of a side road on to a stretch of the A149 and collided with a Kia.             The Queen was spotted driving her Range Rover without a seatbelt on Friday a day after Prince Philip\u0027s crash, little more than a mile from the scene of her husband\u0027s accident    The Queen waves from the back of the Bentley as it drives her away from church following the Sunday morning service          Prince Andrew and the Queen wave as they head back to Sandringham after attending church on Sunday morning The Queen speaks to a clergyman (left) and smiles outside the church (right) as she attends the Sunday morning service          One of the Queen\u0027s aides opens the door for her while a clergyman waits to greet her after the monarch was driven to the church service near Sandringham on Sunday morning     Prince Andrew was later pictured  driving on a public road near Sandringham on Sunday afternoon -

The Estate\u0027s properties include the iconic posh Annabel\u0027s nightclub and the Clermont club and casino founded in 1962 by John Aspinall with original members including five dukes, five marquesses, almost twenty earls and two cabinet ministersAlthough he was not down to work that day, he was called in by CEO Giles Easter and had to rearrange care for his wife who was dying from ovarian cancer and had just weeks to live.But his email was read by Mr Kheriba, who said he did not like its tone and claimed it indicated defiance.Ruling that he was unfairly dismissed, Employment Judge Sarah Goodman said: \u0027Duncan Ferguson was invited to meet Giles Easter at the office on 29 September when no one else would be working.\u0027His wife was now dying of ovarian cancer, and his reply involved explaining he had to rearrange his wife\u0027s care to make the meeting, as he thought he would not be at work that day.\u0027Mustafa Kheriba, seeing this, said he did not like his tone.\u0027He explained to the tribunal he meant he thought it was not the right way to respond to a supervisor\u0027s summons to a meeting, and indicated defiance.\u0027In the view of the tribunal the email about care arrangements is businesslike, appropriate and compliant, nor does it seem Giles Easter read it any other way.\u0027Mr Kheriba\u0027s reading was a cultural misunderstanding, but not without significance if Mustafa Kheriba was involved in the decision to dismiss.\u0027Revealed: Grand Designs families are cashing in on the show...Share this articleThe tribunal was told that following the meeting in which Mr Ferguson was described by Mr Easter as \u0027aggressive, negative and confrontational\u0027 and following a discussion with Mr Kheriba and the lawyers they decided to dismiss him.Mr Kheriba reported to Mr Jassim al-Seddiqi of the Abu Dhabi Financial Group, which owned Astrea.Employment Judge Goodman said: \u0027Duncan Ferguson told him (Mr Easter) of the history of bad blood with Mr al-Seddiqi, and that 11 staff would transfer from Lancer.\u0027He concluded with \u0027welcome to the viper\u0027s nest\u0027, and reported to his co-directors he had been \u0027blunt\u0027.\u0027Mr Easter recalls being pressed to say whether ADFG owned Astrea, because \u0027the staff wouldn\u0027t want to learn they were working for ISIS\u0027.\u0027Of Lancer\u0027s four directors, two of them, Byron Pull and Andrew Lax were not transferred to the new company and CEO John Kevill was sacked after his transfer but before he started after all the directors were accused of changing their contracts to give themselves \u0027golden parachutes\u0027, 15 percent pay rises and 50 percent bonuses after being told of the transfer.Although Mr Ferguson was implicated in this, Astrea transferred him on the basis that they needed someone with his intimate knowledge of the estate.Employment Judge Goodman added: \u0027Any complicity by Mr Ferguson was not blameworthy it would have been clear he was a follower, not a leader, ether in the contracts, or in the withholding of information to the owner, not did the recorded discussions show him speaking contemptuously of the owner of Astrea.\u0027Other claims for disability and part-time work discrimination by Mr Ferguson failed.

The overturned SUV that was bring driven by 97-year-old Prince Philip after the crashThe sense of astonishment has been genuinely palpable. On social media, 24 hour television and radio phone-ins, Royal watchers were talking of little else. ‘Inexcusable, reckless, arrogant’, ‘Please tell him to stop driving before he kills someone’ and ‘I have so much respect for the Queen, but this is terrible’ are just three of the hundreds of messages I have received via Twitter.Yesterday the elder passenger in the other car, Emma Fairweather, poured fuel on the PR fire when she claimed that she has yet to receive any kind of apology, bar a somewhat clunkily-worded message via the police that the Queen and her husband wanted to offer their ‘well-wishes’.One senior royal source insisted to me yesterday that the household had, in fact, made numerous attempts to contact the victims, both via the police on Friday and in person on Saturday – and even continued to try yesterday, so far unsuccessfully.So why has the normally sure-footed Royal Household got it so badly wrong? Royal insiders – both past and present – insist the issue lies with the duke himself.A caustic character (albeit one far more sensitive and caring than his image belies), Philip will take advice from no-one. Members of staff he would once have listened to, such as his respected former private secretary Miles Hunt-Davis, and Dick Griffin, his delightful, no-nonsense ‘old school’ former police chief, are either dead or long retired.Current right-hand man, Archie Miller-Bakewell, was sniffily described to me yesterday as ‘charming, old school, Establishment – and completely wet’. A source said: ‘Dick was an old-style copper and, along with Brigadier Hunt-Davis, was the only person able to stand up to the Duke.‘He would have taken the duke’s keys away from him rather than let him drive, and Miles was just about the only person, aside from his wife, that could have made him realise was a damn fool he has been.’ Most of the day-to-day work concerning anything to do with the prince’s private affairs is dealt with by the deputy master of the household and equerry to the Queen, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Richards, an immensely capable man – but not one in a position to tell the duke ‘what’s what’.When I asked one former senior courtier yesterday why Philip would have been insistent on getting back behind the wheel just hours after causing such carnage, they snorted: ‘He’s such a difficult, belligerent man and has always been intent on pushing the boundaries of what is acceptable. \u0027Most of the time it is harmless and often actually welcome. He’s a fiercely intelligent, enquiring inidual, even now, who has actually been a huge force for good when it comes to modernising the Royal Family. \u0027But then something like this happens, which just brings out the worst of him.’Another courtier added: ‘The thing about the royal family is that they live in a traffic-free world. Think about it. Whenever they go out in car, whether it be in a convoy or driving themselves, the roads are cleared for them.‘They don’t normally have to face the hazards that the rest of us do. It gives them a sense of entitlement and invincibility. Add that to the duke’s age and stubbornness, it’s a potentially dangerous combination.’Asked whether Philip has ever passed his driving test – a question that Buckingham Palace has so far been unable to answer – they explained that many royals, especially the older ones, had simply been taught by police protection officers on their private estates, – but could not confirm whether that was the case for the duke.They did, however, express the opinion that it wouldn’t have been surprising if Philip had headed out without any police officers with him, recounting numerous stories of how the Queen’s husband would drive his Scotland Yard team frantic with worry after stubbornly heading off on his own.No-one, by the way, even attempted to defend the Queen and her husband’s decision to drive without their seat belts, let alone in the aftermath of such a serious accident – over which the duke could yet be prosecuted.The royal mantra of ‘never complain, never explain’ – which has been their trusted stock in trade for so many decades – has never looked so out of place."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/03/20/09/4A339B6800000578-0-image-m-21_1521539300496.jpg","title":"Hundreds Britons buy KIDNEYS black market overseas traffickers charging 30 000","story":"    Thousands of people are said to be currently on the waiting list to receive a new kidney in the UKNurses and doctors say that, despite their attempts to stop patients illegally buying kidneys abroad, many regard it as a quicker option.A Daily Mail investigation into transplant tourism discovered:- A ‘kingpin’ international organ trafficker based in Nepal who sells kidneys to Britons in packages costing £30,000- A British woman whose brother died after contracting hepatitis C from a kidney op abroad says she knows of at least 20 other friends and family who had gone overseas to get one- NHS staff are having to use hard-hitting brochures to ‘scare off’ patients thinking of buying a kidney abroad- Brokers for overseas clinics are routinely using Facebook to target potential customers in the UK- Poorly educated donors are tricked into thinking their kidney will grow back.The World Health Organisation estimates there are 10,000 black market organ operations a year worldwide.

It contributes to 45,000 early deaths every year.NHS figures show almost 400 UK residents have received follow-up support after a transplant abroad over the past 16 years. But medics say the true number is likely to be higher because most are advised by brokers not to tell the NHS what they have done.Lisa Burnapp, lead nurse for living donation at NHS Blood and Transplant, said NHS staff faced a ‘challenging’ battle to stop Britons going abroad.She said: ‘Ultimately you can’t stop people doing it, but you can warn them what they are getting into.‘There’s a significant risk in it. Very often they do come back with infections and there’s also long-term implications.‘It’s a challenge to stop it because some people ultimately don’t want to wait for a transplant. They see it as an easier and quicker option to go abroad.’NHS staff are using a hard-hitting brochure urging patients thinking of buying a kidney abroad to ‘Stop’.Illustrated with a stark traffic sign, it warns of the dangers of paying for an organ which is ‘illegal in almost all countries in the world’.It warns of ‘very high rates of infection and death’ adding: ‘The donor may not have been properly screened.

Asif just wanted a life and felt he couldn’t wait as he’d been ill for so long. He was determined to go.’Mr Chohan, from Manchester, contacted a middleman in Pakistan after another family member also bought a new kidney there. He flew to a clinic in Lahore.Mrs Ghurki said: ‘In Britain when Asif had dialysis we were not allowed in the room to keep it hygienic but in Pakistan it was dirtier and families ate in the rooms. Asif caught hepatitis C and we had to bring him home.’ She believes it was because staff did not clean dialysis machines properly and a previous patient had the disease.Back in Britain, Mr Chohan needed treatment from the NHS for the disease and later developed pneumonia, dying from complications in 2013, aged just 36.Mrs Ghurki said: ‘We all totally regretted trying to buy a kidney. Asif told me before his death “It was not the right thing to have done – the universe is telling me something”.’ She insisted: ‘It is an evil trade preying on the poor.‘We agreed to buy a kidney for £20,000 but I’m sure the donor wouldn’t have got more than £1,000. It’s a massive trade – I know up to 20 people in Britain as well as Germany who have bought kidneys.’                                                      The 5ft gangster who\u0027s a giant in £1bn worldwide transplant tradeHe stands at under 5ft tall, but Prem Bajgai is a giant in the global organ trafficking trade.The softly spoken gangster – once told he was too small to sell his own kidney – masterminds a racket involving doctors, lawyers, forgers and people smugglers to peddle them across three continents.Now, after being released from a three-year jail term for an earlier organ trafficking scheme, he is selling kidneys to British patients, and says the market is booming.He flies patients to Nepal and India and pays off politicians, government officials and doctors to perform illegal transplants in private hospitals.

Scolaro swears at photographers as she leaves Southwark Crown Court In London last month\u0027Again, very similarly there were five of these caps on sale at a shop called Park Lane Collections. Three of the caps were on sale for £450 and two of them for £300.\u0027Customs officials seized another shipment of eight caps and another large bag made of illegal skins was stopped at Heathrow Airport on March 8, 2017, \u0027again, very simply addressed to the defendant and that was seized directly by customs.\u0027Scolaro was interviewed by police on the same day and gave a no comment interview.\u0027Following the interview with police, the investigating officer was forwarded two documents which purported to be export licenses covering the importation of some of these goods from Indonesia,\u0027 the prosecutor continued.          Scolaro and her family regularly fly by private plane to homes in Monaco, Ibiza and New York\u0027Both of these documents have been checked and both are forgeries.\u0027All of the investigation has been by the police from the website and the Instagram account and without any cooperation from the defendant in finding these articles or where they had been placed on sale,\u0027 explained Mr Mckinley.\u0027There are some 35 of these baseball caps and if we take the retail value as was suggested by the defendant herself of about £350, the value of these hats come to £12,215.\u0027The large bags, which were intercepted, were advertised on her website at £2,800 each. Looking at the large bags and the hats together, that comes to £17,815.\u0027  She was interviewed by police after a shipment was seized and gave a no comment interviewScolaro advertised the goods on her website \u0027SS Python\u0027 and sold snakeskin accessories from Rogue Menswear in Bexleyheath and Park Lane Collections in Mayfair between December 2015 and February 2017.She is also charged with keeping specimens of python leather at her luxury home in Marylebone on March 8, 2017.Scolaro has more than 85,000 followers on Instagram, where she posts images of herself in exotic locations across the globe.Scolaro – known as Stephy – and Lana attended Mill Hill School in North London, where boarding fees are £33,717 a year, and regularly fly by private plane to family homes in Monaco, Ibiza and New York.          Scolaro  posts images of herself in exotic locations across the globe on her Instagram accountLana, who designs diamond jewellery, once claimed she spent £15,000 a month on clothes and shoes.Stephanie told The Mail on Sunday\u0027s You magazine in 2016: \u0027I think the first time I was really aware that we were rich was in my early teens.\u0027We were taking a private jet to Monaco and eating sushi from Nobu and something told me that regular kids didn\u0027t do that.\u0027She said she planned to launch a brand of caviar \u0027because there\u0027s, like, a real demand, you know?\u0027. "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f801e3bc94841285c8235258f5e2831fa05d05a9/17_201_4140_2484/master/4140.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad42fd6539815a79f51208fffc323b4a","title":"bauhaus at 100 its legacy in five key designs","story":"The aesthetic of the German art school has influenced everything from typography at airports to iPhones.

Producers also often worry that passing on the increases in their cost of production could lead to weaker sales.However, the sharp rise in costs connected to the weakness in sterling after the vote presented manufacturers with the choice: accepting lower profit margins, raising the price of their products, or reducing the amount they sold while keeping prices steady.Sarah Coles, a personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “The effect of price rises are pretty stealthy. We don’t notice prices creeping up a few pence here or a couple of pounds there: we just suddenly spot that somehow our money doesn’t quite go as far as it used to.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ccdd77946d6d9ef4ca5042065b39f8b9bde9be1/55_430_6648_3989/master/6648.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3fed0ca4434b7d39ce643a9a7b0c0d3e","title":"over 23000 shops and 175000 high street jobs predicted to go in 2019","story":"Value of retail property will slump as shift to online giants continues, says reportA further 175,000 jobs will be shed from struggling UK high streets this year and the value of retail property will slump as the boom in online shopping and rise of giants such as Amazon continue to take their toll, research warns.More than 23,000 shops are forecast to close in 2019, according to the findings published on Monday in an annual report from the real estate adviser Altus Group.The figures suggest this year will be even worse than 2018, when a series of high-profile company failures and store-closure programmes claimed nearly 20,000 stores and 150,000 jobs. They include both multiples or chains as well as independent stores and – in the hospitality sector – restaurants and casual dining outlets.Many high streets are struggling with fewer customers and the shift to online shopping. The most recent official figures available showed the number of shops, pubs and restaurants lying empty soared in the first six months of 2018.Last year was a difficult year for the retail sector, with a long list of high street failures, including House of Fraser, Evans Cycles, Maplin and Poundworld, while other chains including Mothercare and Carpetright, together closed hundreds of underperforming stores. Retailers planning to close stores this year include Marks \u0026amp Spencer and Debenhams.Separately, the Royal Institution for Chartered Surveyors has taken the unusual step of instructing valuers to be “aware of the potential for significant changes in value” in retail properties – effectively a wake-up call for listed landlords and owners of major shopping centres such as Intu Properties and Hammerson.“Retail of the future will use bricks-and-mortar spaces in a very different way mixed in with leisure and lifestyle residential spaces” the Altus Group managing director, Guillaume Fiastre, said. “The most successful retailers – the survivors – are learning to draw in their customers with the promise of a personalised experience. Technology makes that all possible but it still needs a strong human element.”The warning about plummeting retail values comes after the Postings shopping centre in Kirkcaldy, Fife, was put up for sale last week for £1."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f19225530e702d3d73c497a5b142d54e024338c/41_209_3943_2365/master/3943.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=714af3e4197b34a0ba187b0df441071d","title":"world 26 richest people own as much as poorest 50 per cent oxfam report","story":"The growing concentration of the world’s wealth has been highlighted by a report showing that the 26 richest billionaires own as many assets as the 3.8 billion people who make up the poorest half of the planet’s population.In an annual wealth check released to mark the start of the World Economic Forum in Davos, the development charity Oxfam said 2018 had been a year in which the rich had grown richer and the poor poorer.As a result, the report concluded, the number of billionaires owning as much wealth as half the world’s population fell from 43 in 2017 to 26 last year. In 2016 the number was 61.Among the findings of the report were:Oxfam’s director of campaigns and policy, Matthew Spencer, said: “The massive fall in the number of people living in extreme poverty is one of the greatest achievements of the past quarter of a century but rising inequality is jeopardising further progress. “The way our economies are organised means wealth is increasingly and unfairly concentrated among a privileged few while millions of people are barely subsisting. Women are dying for lack of decent maternity care and children are being denied an education that could be their route out of poverty. No one should be condemned to an earlier grave or a life of illiteracy simply because they were born poor. “It doesn’t have to be this way – there is enough wealth in the world to provide everyone with a fair chance in life. Governments should act to ensure that taxes raised from wealth and businesses paying their fair share are used to fund free, good-quality public services that can save and transform people’s lives.”The report said many governments were making inequality worse by failing to invest enough in public services. It noted that about 10,000 people die for lack of healthcare and there were 262 million children not in school, often because their parents were unable to afford the fees, uniforms or textbooks.Oxfam said governments needed to do more to fund high-quality, universal public services through tackling tax dodging and ensuring fairer taxation, including on corporations and the richest iniduals’ wealth, which it said were often undertaxed.A global wealth tax has been called for by the French economist Thomas Piketty, who has said action is needed to arrest the trend in inequality.Oxfam said that in addition to tackling inequality at home, developed nations currently failing to meet their overseas aid commitments could raise the missing billions needed to tackle extreme poverty in the poorest countries by increasing taxes on extreme wealth.China’s rapid growth over the past four decades has been responsible for much of the decline in extreme poverty but Oxfam said World Bank data showed the rate of poverty reduction had halved since 2013. In sub-Saharan Africa, extreme poverty was on the increase.Oxfam said its methodology for assessing the gap between rich and poor was based on global wealth distribution data provided by the Credit Suisse global wealth data book, covering the period from June 2017 to June 2018. The wealth of billionaires was calculated using the annual Forbes billionaires list published in March 2018."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55ebf0e85b7bbc08228adeb5c4e1c3d4fc024021/0_288_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=192ca901a65c9a9df8455916d5f9e902","title":"from snake soup to sorcery the street traders of hong kong in pictures","story":"Many of Hong Kong’s traditional street trades are on the verge of dying out.

Investing in mummies is one solutionMuseums teach us to dream. Since the Victorian age it’s been Egyptian mummies – matched only by dinosaurs – that have captivated children. Being taken to see the mummies is a rite of passage, and one accessible across the country, not just to those in London who have the British Museum on their doorstep. But local authority culture budgets are being slashed, so how can regional arts institutions survive? What should they do about the pressure to return looted objects? And how do they show their relevance to modern audiences?I have been exploring the history of three northern Egyptian museums, which have four remarkable Victorian women at the heart of their story. For those looking for entries for one of those currently popular anthologies of plucky rebel ladies from history, they all fit the bill.They are Amelia Edwards, who founded the Egypt Exploration Fund (EEF) and funded the first university chair of Egyptology at University College London in 1892 and three northern mill family heiresses, who put the freedom afforded by their wealth into travelling to Egypt to bring back treasures for their local towns. Amelia Oldroyd used funds from Dewsbury’s branch of the EEF to bring back mummies and grave goods including a rare intact papyrus mummy covering or cartonnage, housed eventually in the Dewsbury Museum Annie Barlow, whose family fortune came from processing Egyptian cotton in Bolton mills, did the same for her city while Marianne Brocklehurst, the daughter of silk manufacturers, built the West Park Museum in her home town of Macclesfield to house the mummy cases and artefacts she brought back. There’s a strong claim that Edwards and Brocklehurst were doubly pioneering, as lesbian women – Brocklehurst travelling on her expeditions down the Nile with her companion, Mary Booth – at a time when women were still struggling to gain status outside the home. Brocklehurst’s diary sketches are some of the best contemporary records of dig sites before they were disturbed.But Dewsbury Museum was shut in 2016 along with others by Kirklees council. And Oldroyd’s collection is now in the Bagshaw Museum in Batley which has no expert curators on staff and short opening hours, although it has invested in a beautiful tomb display. Brocklehurst’s purpose-built museum is also currently shut as Macclesfield merges its Egyptology displays to a central site, though there are plans for a major refurbishment.And there are serious questions about how to present the treasure, mummies in particular. Both Edwards’ and Brocklehurst’s diaries reveal a cavalier land grab of acquisition as rival museums such as the Louvre and the British Museum, and private collectors jostled with each other and colluded with corrupt local officials to smuggle out what they could not obtain officially. “Once we were safely boxed up,” wrote Brocklehurst, “we devoutly hoped it, the case only, might escape the prying fingers of the dreaded police who are waiting for us at Cairo and Alexandria, everywhere. And we feared lest the cook in particular, doubtless acquainted with the peculiar mummy bouquet, might sniff him out and bring us all grief.” They ended up discarding the body of a 15-year-old temple girl, possibly in the Nile, but kept the beautiful mummy case. It sits in a cabinet in the Old Sunday School Museum in Macclesfield with no clue as to its grisly provenance. Next to it a cabinet contains objects from Brocklehurst’s study, including two mummified unlabelled human hands, in a glass cabinet, like souvenirs.“There is a key word in every single diary that you read from,” says Egyptian-born archaeologist Heba Abd el Gawad, who co-curated the Beyond Beauty exhibition in London, drawn from these collections, two years ago. She believes the diaries reveal women who knew they were on thin moral ground. “It’s the word ‘rescue’. They are there to rescue the artefacts from the Egyptians.” El Gawad believes that while repatriation isn’t always the end goal, “part of the job of museums is to bring social justice, not only to the visitors, not only to allow everyone to enjoy a public museum, but to bring social justice to the people of the past. Museums should never be neutral.”Bolton Museum shows how it can be done. Annie Barlow herself is put into context in a refurbished gallery labelled “Bolton’s Egypt” which features a photograph of her in the 1930s with Mahatma Gandhi. Daylight floods into the main gallery, where the objects are part of a celebration of the real life and landscape of ancient Egypt. Only then do visitors enter a reconstruction of the tomb of King Thutmoses III, housing a real mummy, and signage acknowledging the sensitivity of displaying human remains.Watching crowds of children pouring in to Bolton Museum, some almost overwhelmed with their passion for the Ancient Egyptians, is a reminder that honest, modern presentation and far-sighted, cultural investment can revitalise towns that have lost their industrial past with a very real, modern pride.• Samira Ahmed’s documentary The Victorian Queens of Ancient Egypt is on BBC Radio 3 on Sunday 3 February at 6.45pm"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8484244b1d301226efd5fb8b2d290474c2dfa484/0_272_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb55ad0d64a6911ccd929d38e8e5e946","title":"martin luther king jr day legacy radical","story":"King was a champion of the poor and oppressed. If we want to truly honor his legacy, we’ll struggle to finish his workMartin Luther King Jr is useful to just about everyone nowadays. For President Donald Trump, celebrating King is a chance to tell everyone that he shares “his dream of equality, freedom, justice, and peace”. For Ram trucks, it’s a chance to, well, sell trucks.This wasn’t always the case. In 1983, 15 years after King’s death, 22 senators voted against an official holiday honoring him on the third Monday in January. The North Carolina senator Jesse Helms undertook a 16-day filibuster of the bill, claiming that King’s “action-oriented Marxism” was “not compatible with the concepts of this country”. He was joined in his opposition by Senators John McCain, Orrin Hatch, and Chuck Grassley, among others.Reagan reluctantly signed the legislation, all the while grumbling that he would have preferred “a day similar to Lincoln’s birthday, which is not technically a national holiday”.And guess what? He had a reason to be hesitant. The real Martin Luther King Jr stood for a radical vision of equality, justice, and anti-militarism that rebelled against Reagan’s entire agenda. Today more than ever, we need to rediscover that champion of working people.The Disneyified version of Dr King begins and ends with his role as a civil rights leader, who summoned Christian teachings, as well as Gandhian tactics, and told us of his dream that “one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: ‘We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal.’”Martin Luther King Jr was a part of a much wider movement, standing alongside socialists such as Ella Baker, Bayard Rustin, and A Philip Randolph in not just attempting to dismantle the Jim Crow system, but replacing it with an egalitarian social democracy.Despite President Lyndon Johnson’s shepherding of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965, ending legal apartheid in the United States, King became even more radical as the decade went on. As he put it in 1967: “We aren’t merely struggling to integrate a lunch counter now. We’re struggling to get some money to be able to buy a hamburger or a steak when we get to the counter.”King wasn’t willing to drop his internationalist commitments in to achieve this change. He had long been a supporter of anti-colonial struggles in developing countries and in an April 1967 address at Riverside church in Harlem, he alienated his liberal allies by challenging the slaughter in Vietnam and the broader system of imperialism that made poor people, black and white alike, “kill and die together for a nation that has been unable to seat them together in the same schools”. Despite rebukes from more than 160 newspaper editorials the next day and his permanent alienation from liberal allies in the Democratic party, he pressed on.Now calling himself a democratic socialist, through his Poor People’s Campaign, King was set to create the kind of movement that could fight for not just political but economic freedom for all. He wasn’t just a civil rights activist, he was a tribune for a multiracial working class – people who faced poverty, racism, and joblessness, but who when banded together could wield tremendous power.King traveled to Memphis in April 1968, where he was assassinated by the white supremacist James Earl Ray, to support striking sanitation workers. His advisors warned against the trip. There were the threats of his life, and there were other campaigns and commitments too. But King knew he had to be there. He knew what side he was on.Martin Luther King Jr wasn’t a prophet of unity. He was a champion of the poor and oppressed. And if we want to truly honor his legacy, we’ll struggle to finish his work."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/042ff46095b9fbd18f4b66498a7358d8953e61ab/0_979_2218_1330/master/2218.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42e2e9cbe74fb2086fd3f82926d71061","title":"no deal brexit wiped out theresa may","story":"That’s where a bruised prime minister is leading us – what a horrifying epitaph it will make. It’s time to ask the people againIt is nothing less than despicable that, when our opposition and our government can clearly see they need to work together to get us out of this Brexit chaos, they are refusing to do so. And that means Theresa May could quite conceivably allow Britain to exit the EU without a deal, without any serious plans in place, and without reference to parliament. To prevent a no-deal outcome requires MPs to proactively replace this legal default position with something else.If the court case I brought against the government over article 50 was about anything at all, it was about parliamentary sovereignty. That meant the will of the overwhelming majority of our MPs should prevail on the major issues of the day. It is their duty to represent their constituency, their party and the interests of the country. It is a tenet of representative democracy that MPs are not delegates for their constituents. This means that their decisions and actions are ultimately governed by putting the best interests of all their constituency before all else.There is a distinct possibility, some would say a likelihood now, that in just 67 days May is going to allow the will of a tiny minority in her party to prevail and, without reference to anyone, set in place a no-deal Brexit. It will be her decision alone, and what a horrifying epitaph it will make.So as we approach the current legally binding exit day of 29 March, let’s be clear what no deal means. There is a raft of some 800 pieces of legislation that needs to be passed to ensure leaving with no deal is legally executed. Some commentators say this is impossible in the time left. This is not strictly true as under the European Union (Withdrawal) Act, passed by MPs, May and her ministers have wide-ranging powers to amend the statute book – the so-called “Henry VIII powers”.However, such a vast delegation of powers does entail constitutional risks – especially as they are predicated on the fact a deal has passed through parliament. The legislation appears silent on what happens if there is no deal, thus leading to constitutional and legal chaos.There would be no transitional period. We would face immediate WTO tariffs, and border checks for customs and agricultural products. It is also important to remember the WTO works on consensus of its members – and there are 164 members and 23 observer governments. So if you think getting 27 countries to agree is tricky, think about this.But the biggest problem for the UK will be to decide whether to apply EU tariffs to the rest of the world – effectively keeping agricultural protection – or no tariffs to anyone. And even if the EU, UK and Ireland do not want to put up a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, WTO members will insist on checks.Moreover, what is extremely worrying is that we would be leaving all the EU institutions and agencies when we do not have replacements in place – on aviation, energy, medicines, chemicals, banking and the environment.Neither are we prepared on a practical level. The dress rehearsal we saw to prevent lorry congestion in Dover was an expensive shambles and shows the lack of joined-up thinking at the heart of the government. The plan had been for Manston airport to be used as a parking facility for 6,000 lorries, but only 89 – each driver paid £550 by the taxpayer – participated. What the Road Haulage Association said of that exercise holds good for government and private sector planning across the board: “Too little, too late.”Among my contacts across the City there is still, generally speaking, a prevailing view that May will ultimately pull back from the brink: that is what Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has reportedly been briefing. But I don’t share this optimism. I would argue that the vast sums of money May has started to randomly spend in areas where she has suddenly realised there might be a problem show her clear intent. Dredging has already started at Ramsgate port to ease the pressure on Dover (when additional crossings will suddenly become a matter of life and death for people who depend on the import of drugs). It has also been announced that army reservists are being placed on standby. It seems the mantra in this Dad’s Army world we are now entering is “don’t panic”. It would be laughable if it weren’t all so tragically unnecessary.Amid all the noise, May needs to listen to her more principled MPs such as Damian Green, Dominic Grieve, Kenneth Clarke, Justine Greening and her former adviser Lord Heseltine. And now more than ever the prime minister has to think beyond the traditional party ides: the current political argument has no respect for them whatsoever. And she should talk to the people who we can still call our European partners. Indeed, I was in Paris last week – invited as a concerned citizen with some knowledge of the process we are involved in – to give evidence before the French senate’s Brexit working group. May has been unwilling to talk to people who don’t agree with her but, behind the scenes, at events such as this, there has been genuine dialogue, and a desire to understand. These were people who know their stuff, who are actively reaching across their traditional lines, and my overwhelming sense, talking to them, is that they care about Britain and the future of its people every bit as much as those of France and the other member states.Ultimately, of course, whether we leave the EU with no deal will be May’s decision. She does not have to heed anyone – not parliament, not the opinion polls, and not, unless she chooses to have another vote, the democratic will of the people who now know so much more about what leaving the EU means than when they voted two and a half years ago.That is an awesome responsibility for anyone, let alone someone bruised and battered by treacherous colleagues, who’s suffered one humiliation after another and is no doubt physically exhausted by a gruelling few years in office. It is too much responsibility – way too much – for any one inidual to bear. If those around the prime minister cannot clearly and decisively make a decision about how to end this chaos, let the people help.• Gina Miller is the founder of endthechaos"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/021cbc211fee74fd881d5a63dd38c64f1f9886ba/0_19_2908_1745/master/2908.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1e23c91bb92afaaa5dfa9cb30d29ebb","title":"where george clooney co sudan needs them","story":"The people are rising up. But the western celebrities and the human rights industry that fought for this are absentIn 2017, a US law firm signed a contract with the Sudanese government, to assist in efforts to lift the economic sanctions that had been suffocating the country since 1997. Within weeks, George Clooney and John Prendergast, veteran activists for human rights in Sudan, wrote a letter in Time magazine, objecting to this. They asked rhetorically, did the law firm’s senior ranks, filled with ex-senators and congressmen, not know that president Omar al-Bashir’s regime had committed mass atrocities? That it was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of civilians in Darfur? That it persecuted Christians? “The question of their firm working in the service of such a brutal and vile regime can only be answered by the simplest of terms,” they concluded. “Probably, they just don’t know.”The sanctions were lifted, but it made little difference. The world had forgotten Sudan and was in no rush to be reminded. All that was associated with the country, ticked off neatly in the ClooneyPrendergast letter, was unsavoury. So allow me to remind you. For the past four weeks, Sudan has been seized by a popular uprising on the part of a people that has been suffering under a brutal dictatorship for 30 years, and from the effects of the global human rights machine that cut them off from the world for 20.In late December, protests at rising inflation started, small but angry, then spread. As the momentum increased, the government’s response grew more thuggish. Intimidation of protesters turned into imprisonment and beatings, tear gas turned to live bullets. Last week, the shooting of a young doctor assisting injured protesters drew a mob outside the hospital in which he died. The crowd swelled with anger and mourning until the small hours of the morning. At his funeral the next day, instead of fear, there was more determination, as his wake turned into another protest.Every day brings fresh tales of bloodshed and loss, videos of mothers wild with grief when their children’s bodies are brought home, and yet every day the Sudanese people leave their homes and workplaces and march into a storm of bullets and tear gas. It is no longer about inflation. For the past 30 years, corruption, ethnic ision, impoverishment to the benefit of a networked few, and religious oppression have gripped the country. And death. So much death. In wars in the south, east and west of the country, in the government’s own “ghost houses” and torture cells, and in the wards of hospitals, where babies have died for want of an oxygen canister. The rising anger has burst its banks and has nowhere to flow but into the streets, deluging the government and its security forces, and seriously threatening its survival for the first time.And yet, the Sudan human rights community that secured an international criminal court arrest warrant for Bashir on charges of war crimes, and lobbied to the last minute against the lifting of sanctions, does not seem as exercised by these developments. This is the closest the government has come to collapsing, and those who supposedly fought for this for years are missing in action.Over the past two decades, an entire human rights industry has thrived around Sudan and its volatile government. There was no more fashionable cause. The government’s brutality was parcelled off into neat little David and Goliath narratives, each with its own infrastructure of funding, advocacy and massive media campaigns. The Christian south had to be saved from the savage, Muslim north, and so Christian lobby groups and celebrities midwifed the birth of South Sudan.So, in Darfur, an ethnically purist Arab regime victimised African tribes. It happened in other parts of the country too, such as the Nuba mountains and Kordofan. The ArabAfrican binary was boosted by the government’s association with Osama bin Laden in the 90s, which landed the country with the super pariah “terror sponsor” designation. And so western governments mobilised, economic sanctions were slapped on the country, South Sudan seceded, and the human rights caravan moved on, content with having done its moral duty in ejecting the Sudanese government from polite global society. It didn’t matter that those sanctions were doing nothing but empowering Bashir and slowly choking the people.And now, when those people finally rise up, paying with their lives to remove a government that several western campaigns have failed to vanquish, the moral market seems to be closed. There is no narrative, you see, no ethnic angle, no religious angle, no duality that an advocate can wedge themselves between and sell. It’s just a good old fashioned uprising in a dusty Saharan country where the virtue idends for an intermediary are low.This might seem bloodless and cynical, but consider this simple fact. In 2008, the collective Sudan celebrityhigh-profile politician vehicle formally coalesced into an Africa monitoring organisation called Not On Our Watch, whose name came from a chant at Darfur rallies in the mid-noughties, the biggest of which, in 2006, attracted the attendance of then-Senator Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi. Alongside two others, it was founded by Clooney and fellow actors Matt Damon, Don Cheadle and Brad Pitt. The last update on its website is from 4 December 2018, an item about a new book on the Congo, featuring photographs by Ryan Gosling.The question of their organisation making no mention of Sudan’s uprising, and the deaths of protesters at the hands of such a brutal and vile regime can only be answered by the simplest of terms. Probably, they just don’t know."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b26b728f875648673c23b1794ab7532a4a33743/0_0_900_322/master/900.jpg?width=685\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8ad2c0150dec5f1527ab92cb8d3f7859 1370w","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of short","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘short’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘short’.Share your photos of what short means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 23 January at 10am.

Well then treat yourself to some old Smack the Pony clips. Not only is the sketch show that Fiona Allen, Doon Mackichan and Sally Phillips made together between 1999 and 2003 still hilarious, but it seems particularly well suited to a second life on YouTube even if that title does risk stumbling on some unexpectedly explicit search results.Still, for many in the comedy establishment, that realisation was slow in coming. Being a woman working in comedy had long meant becoming proficient at “feeding” or playing the foil to a star-billed male performer. “I don’t think any of us would have pitched an all-girl sketch show ourselves,” says Phillips. “I found the guys happy to employ girls but reluctant to pair up as equals.”The impetus for the show came instead from Channel 4 commissioner Caroline Leddy, herself the veteran of an all-female comedy troupe, the Millies, alongside Jo Unwin (now a top literary agent and wife of Chris Morris) and Donna McPhail. Leddy has been involved in enough hits (Brass Eye, The Inbetweeners, Derry Girls) to prove that her judgment is flawless, and she believed in the format enough to set Pile to work on the pilot in 1997. Pile brought Allen, Mackichan and Phillips on board and the team then had six tense but exhilarating months to develop their style. “It very much felt that a series was dependent on the quality of the pilot,” says Phillips.In place of all they had rejected, Smack the Pony featured the kind of observational humour that has always been the foundation of successful comedy, made fresh and surprising via a simple twist: the laughs came from a female perspective. Pile, who went on to create Green Wing alongside some other STP alumni, says that even 20 years later it’s these details she constantly thinks back to. “I am always finding myself doing things that we identified on screen – drinking wine by the box, holding one’s breasts whilst running up stairs, humming Fleetwood Mac whilst trying to park in a tight spot … ”The observational humour was also set alongside a thick strain of surrealist silliness that places Smack the Pony within a more specifically British tradition. A short skit featuring Sally Phillips running a relay race in high heels might be STP’s answer to Monty Python’s Ministry of Silly Walks. And then there’s Fiona Allen’s favourite, The Matador and the Bull, about an unlikely cross-species romance: “Being half Spanish it was like performing with one of the family,” she says. “Also, if l was going to die that day – health, safety and any form of protection was nowhere to be seen – ending up squashed by a bull in a matador’s outfit from Madrid with sparkles would have been very funny.” These two strands were also often brought together, as in the recurring Dating Agency Videos, an endlessly adaptable format for character comedy and home to some of the show’s best-remembered oddballs (Mackichan’s facelift denial is an oft-cited favourite). It is easy to trace a straight line from what Smack the Pony was doing 20 years ago to the more recent likes of Inside Amy Schumer, Fleabag and Broad City.STP also helped launch multiple comedy careers by accepting submissions from sketch writers outside its core team. Jesse Armstrong, Sam Bain, Richard Ayoade and John Oliver all have writing credits, while Orlando Bloom and Miranda Hart make early pre-fame appearances in a couple of sketches (Sally Phillips returned the favour by playing a supporting role in Hart’s hit BBC One sitcom). “It was a brilliant outlet for writers, male or female, who didn’t know where to voice their often fairly peculiar thoughts,” says Pile. Crucially, though, it was the women who got all the best lines. “That was the overriding mission. Not to banner-wave or trash men, but to promote women as being as good as or better than! In the context of opportunities for funny women on TV at the time, this was a vital task.”It is this that seems to have made the deepest impression on the young, aspiring comedians watching at home. Standup Tessa Coates recalls acting out sketches, aged nine, with her six-year-old sister: “I only remember us bringing down the house. I can see it now, me playing a surgeon, delivering news to a patient that I’ve given her spoons for arms, with my sister hiding her arms inside her T-shirt and holding two wooden spoons so they stick out like arms. You can see why we were such a huge hit.” While still at school, a teenage Lolly Adefope (Damned, Taskmaster) refused to let a YouTube ban on the library computers prevent her from watching clips during lunchtime. “Being a little hacker, I discovered the joy of ‘proxies’ and managed to find a back-end route. I remember watching the songs at the end of the episodes and realising that all my favourite things could be combined in a career: women, women being funny, and music videos. It definitely showed me that women could be so silly, and influenced what I try to do in my comedy.”All Smack the Pony fans seem to agree that the show has hardly dated – but is this due to the depressing fact that life hasn’t changed all that much for British women in the intervening years? Perhaps in part. The show featured a running gag about ogling attractive men in public that seems to work as an evergreen comment on sexual harassment, gender dynamics and the way ordinary female sexuality is cack-handedly co-opted by advertising – yet from the beginning the show’s appeal was much wider than just “feminism, but funny”. The first two series each won an Emmy and all three were nominated for a Bafta. Phillips, who went on to play the prime minister of Finland on HBO’s Veep, says it’s also travelled well. “I’ve found comedy writers in the States have watched them all and used our comedy as a reference point. The show was bigger in Scandinavia than here, too, and when I work there it usually comes up.”Unsurprisingly, given the affection that still surrounds Smack the Pony, a reunion has been mooted every few years since the show first came off air in 2003. There was a retrospective as part of the BFI’s Queens of TV Comedy season in 2012 and a Red Nose Day Special in 2017, but never a full series. With the Spice Girls embarking on their own comeback tour in May, could this be the year? Allen confirms they are “currently working on reunion projects”, and Phillips is even ready to share a few ideas: “I think the time has perhaps come for an entirely period-based sketch show: The Big Red One. We used to joke about that. No, I’m still joking.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a73f7ed52c921c374b135731c33ece2b4acb1ac/0_339_5104_3062/master/5104.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=120919c19f3994818db5caebba9005c2","title":"what can we do right now about climate change","story":"Calamitous weather events and warnings from scientists that the planet is warming faster than previously believed are causing alarm.

Just add cheeseI like the idea of a small amount of full-flavoured cheese used more as a seasoning than a principal ingredient. A recipe where the cheese plays a supporting role to vegetables, cured meat or fruits. A vegetable tart perhaps, where sautéed roots – swede or parsnip – are layered with gruyere in a crumbly pastry crust a fruit loaf made especially for eating not with butter, but with blue cheese or possibly a buttery roast onion with a mild taleggio sauce trickling over its golden layers. The recipes that follow make use of mature, soft and fresh cheeses, working quietly in the background.I hold much store by cheesy-things-on-toast, especially those that are spiked with the heat of mustard or horseradish. Beetroot likes horseradish too, which is how this little delight came to be. A substantial snack, though, rather than full-blown dinner.Makes 2 roundscooked beetroot 150gcider vinegar 2 tspcornichons 6horseradish 2 tsp, finely gratedrosemary sprigs 1caerphilly 100g, coarsely gratedsourdough 2 large, thick slicesHeat the oven grill. Coarsely grate the beetroot into a bowl. Sprinkle over the cider vinegar and toss gently together. Slice the cornichons in half lengthways and add to the beetroot, then stir in the grated horseradish. Finely chop the rosemary needles and stir through the grated cheese.Place the slices of bread side by side on a baking sheet and brown lightly on one side under the heated grill. Remove from the heat, turn the bread over and ide the grated, seasoned beetroot between the slices of toast, then scatter over the grated cheese, partially covering the beetroot.Grill till the cheese is bubbling and serve immediately.You could make all manner of complicated cheese sauces and use every pot, sieve and whisk in the kitchen, but I don’t think they come much better than those made by simply melting soft cheese in warm cream. OK, I have seasoned it with thyme and a little black pepper, but this is nevertheless a fine cheese sauce for spooning over soft, golden baked onions.Bring a large, deep pan of water to the boil. Set the oven at 200Cgas mark 6. Peel the onions, keeping them whole. Add the bay leaves and peppercorns to the boiling water, then lower in the peeled onions. Leave them at a brisk simmer for about 30 minutes, until they are soft and yielding.Lift out the softened onions with a draining spoon and place them in a baking dish. Pour a little olive oil over the onions, add the butter, the leaves from half of the thyme sprigs and a little black pepper, then bake for about 40 minutes, basting once or twice as they cook.Warm the double cream in a small saucepan over a low heat. Cut the taleggio into small pieces, then leave to melt, without stirring, in the cream, adding the remaining sprigs of thyme.Serve two onions per person together with some of the taleggio thyme sauce.I like the informality of a free-form tart, baked without the restriction of a tart tin.

Introduce enough water to produce a soft, rollable dough. Turn out onto a floured work surface, pat into a ball, flatten the top then wrap in greaseproof paper and refrigerate for 30 minutes.For the filling, peel the swede, cut in half lengthways and then each half into quarters. Cut each piece into thin slices.Chop the bacon into roughly 3cm x 3cm squares, removing the rind as you go. Pour two tablespoons of the oil into a frying pan, add the bacon and cook till lightly crisp before removing to kitchen paper to drain. Set the oven at 200Cgas mark 6. Place an upturned baking sheet or pizza stone in the oven to heat up.Cook the pieces of swede in the bacon fat, turning them as they brighten and soften, adding a little more oil as necessary. Grate the gruyere into a large bowl, then add the bacon and swede. Season generously with black pepper.On the floured board, roll the pastry out into a large, rough-edged circle approximately 30cm in diameter, and transfer to a parchment-lined or flour-dusted baking sheet. Pile the filling in the centre of the pastry, leaving a wide gap of bare pastry around the edge. Fold the edges of the pastry over the filling leaving the middle open. Brush the edges of the pastry with beaten egg then place the whole baking sheet on top of the hot sheet or stone in the oven. Cook for 25 minutes till the pastry is pale gold and the filling has crisped on top. Leave to settle for 10 minutes before slicing.A cold winter’s afternoon, almost dusk, is the time I need a slice of malt loaf. Cut thick and buttered, it is deliciously nostalgic. It occurred to me that the basic loaf could be embellished with seeds and more dried fruits, to give a treacly, almost cake-like bread suitable for eating with cheese, in the way fruit cake can be eaten with cheddar.Makes 1 loafmalt extract 150glight muscovado sugar 100gblack treacle 2 tbspplain flour 250gbaking powder 1 tspsalt a pinchrolled oats 50gprunes 100g, stoned weight eggs 2black tea 125mlsultanas or raisins 100gpumpkin seeds 5 tbsplinseeds 4 tbspTo finishmalt extract a little more pumpkin seeds 1 tbsplinseeds 1 tbspfull-flavoured blue cheese to serveYou will need a deep, rectangular cake tin measuring 20cm x 9cm lined with baking paper.Preheat the oven to 160Cgas mark 3.

Combine the flour, baking powder, salt and oats in a large mixing bowl. Cut the prunes into small pieces and stir them in. Make the tea. Break the eggs into a small bowl, beat lightly with a fork.Pour the warm malt and sugar mixture into the flour together with the tea and the beaten eggs. Then fold the sultanas, pumpkin seeds and linseeds into the batter.Scoop the mixture, which will be soft and runny, like a gingerbread batter, into the lined cake tin. Bake for 60-75 minutes until risen and lightly springy. Remove from the oven and leave to cool in the tin. While the cake cools, brush the surface with a little more malt extract and sprinkle with the extra pumpkin seeds and linseeds. Leave to thoroughly cool before slicing and serving with blue cheese.One of the joys of living near an Italian deli is the almost year-round supply of panettone. I adore its soft vanilla scent and the jewels of candied peel. Good though it is on its own, I like the soft, open-textured loaf spread with a mixture of ricotta and chopped candied fruits, of which there are still a few left from Christmas.

The Spaniard has had to muddle along with an imbalanced squad but has shown he can make important tactical interventions on several occasions. He certainly got the better of Maurizio Sarri, disrupting the Chelsea manager’s attempts to build from the back by using an energetic high press, and his switch to a midfield diamond demonstrated Arsenal have become more flexible since parting company with Arsène Wenger. Emery’s side played with snap and bite from the start, with the tone set by Lucas Torreira’s waspish performance, and the impressive Aaron Ramsey. Jacob Steinberg“Exceptional achievement from a world-class player,” was Jürgen Klopp’s verdict on Mohamed Salah reaching the milestone of 50 Premier League goals. The Egypt international hit the half-century in 72 games. Only out-and-out strikers Ruud van Nistelrooy, Alan Shearer and Andy Cole got there in fewer games. “Maybe he would have scored more and earlier if I hadn’t played him on the right wing so often,” Klopp added. “My fault.” The forward’s anticipation, awareness and improvisation earned the reward but rather less appetising was his theatrical attempt to win a first-half penalty under pressure from Mamadou Sakho. Salah was affronted by Luka Milivojevic’s angry reaction to the tumble but didn’t have a leg to stand on. Theoretically and literally. The slight on Salah’s reputation was self-inflicted. Andy Hunter“Tactical” was the explanation from Pep Guardiola when he was asked about Riyad Mahrez, Manchester City’s record signing, not even warranting a place among their substitutes for the 3-0 win at Huddersfield Town. Others might see it as perplexing that the £60m man has drifted out of the squad and was an unused substitute in their previous two Premier League games against Wolves or Liverpool. For Mahrez, who was bought from Leicester, it must clearly be a worry. More than anything, however, it is probably a reminder of City’s immense resources rather than anything the player has particularly done wrong. And there can be no guarantees, with Kevin De Bruyne fit again, Leroy Sané and Raheem Sterling excelling on the wings and the two Silvas, David and Bernardo, also to factor in, that it was only a one-off. Daniel TaylorFulham scored first for the third match in succession but all three of those games ended in defeat. That their defending is hapless is one of the 2018-19 season’s leading statements of the bleeding obvious. It was in painful evidence during one of their most organised displays since being promoted and what should have been one of their better results this was the squandering of a golden chance to take points off a tired, diminished Tottenham. Tim Ream’s disorientated swinging at fresh air created the chance for Dele Alli to equalise just as it seemed a frustrated visiting side could be kept at bay and then Joe Bryan lost Harry Winks for the injury-time winner. As someone who honed his managerial art in the Serie A of the 1990s, Claudio Ranieri’s instinct is to sit back on leads but he does not have the players for that to be viable at Fulham. John BrewinSuccess for Everton is finishing seventh but despite being just three points off their Valhalla, they look a long way from being the best of the rest. Marco Silva’s side have come under heavy scrutiny following a summer of investment, which has failed to provide a stable defence or regular goals. This defeat means they have won back-to-back Premier League games once this season. A battling win over Bournemouth will have given fans hope but losing to Southampton again proved their inability to put together two good performances consecutively. Failing to recover from going behind does not help James Ward-Prowse’s opener was the 10th time this season Everton have conceded first and they have only procured two points from those games, a sign of their inability to fight back, a problem management rather than money will need to resolve soon. Will UnwinAndy Carroll’s jaw-dropping miss against Bournemouth sparked derision although, at some level, one could be forgiven sympathy for a player who badly needs something to go his way. Saturday’s game was only his 61st league start since joining West Ham permanently five and a half years ago and, while there was the odd glimpse of the intelligent hold-up play and aerial power he can provide, the way forward seems unclear. Carroll is 30 now and the chances of things getting much better are receding. Assuming Marko Arnautovic departs there will surely remain a role in Manuel Pellegrini’s squad between now and the end of the season, even if a regular starting place seems unthinkable. Carroll is out of contract in June and it is hard to see who would bank on him these days as an option to count on at the top level. Nick AmesJavi Gracia is not a man who is prone to hyperbole. But as he celebrates the first anniversary of his appointment today, the Watford manager has every reason to feel proud of his efforts since replacing Marco Silva. Despite failing to find a way past Burnley on Saturday, Watford have created a strong identity under the Spaniard and now look strong contenders to finish seventh. The reward for that could be the Europa League, and their squad could be better suited to handling the extra workload that brings than Sean Dyche’s men – they failed to reach the group stages last August, losing in the play-off round. “I’m very pleased but not only for me,” Gracia reflected on his first year in charge. “When I arrived it was because the owners trusted me and after one year I can say they are happy with our work and the position we are in.” Ed Aarons"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04267b9df5d31c69dcab86e5d0f8e3d95b9c9e39/0_107_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef90bce3b4c19835f45beb1339f7ea9d","title":"serie a returns with a reminder that it can be beautiful too","story":"After its grim end to 2018, Serie A returned from the winter break with an entertaining round of gamesThe crowd at San Siro was the smallest it had been for any game in this Serie A season, yet also perhaps the most uplifting. Inter’s match against Sassuolo was originally supposed to be played behind closed doors, as a punishment for racist abuse of Kalidou Koulibaly by supporters at the stadium last month. Club officials persuaded the footballing authorities to let them distribute 11,000 tickets to schoolchildren instead.They filled a part of the stadium’s lower tier, with the remaining seats covered over by gigantic banners upon which ‘BUU’ had been printed in various fonts. That spelling is used by Italian journalists to represent monkey noises directed at black players during games. Inter were inviting us to reinvent the letters as an acronym – to be written, not said – ‘Brothers Universally United’ against discrimination.The young audience cheered both teams: showing a great enthusiasm for attacking football in general. Such a convivial atmosphere stood in contrast not only to that game against Napoli but also the stark silence of Inter’s Coppa Italia win over Benevento on 13 January – when the full stadium ban was in force.Sadly, neither team could give the kids a goal to celebrate. Saturday’s game finished 0-0, with Sassuolo enjoying slightly the better chances.There was no shortage of scoring elsewhere, though. After its grim end to 2018, Serie A returned from the winter break with an entertaining round of games: from Roma’s helter-skelter 3-2 win over Torino to Atalanta’s 5-0 rout of Frosinone and a defiant 2-1 victory for a short-staffed Napoli over Lazio.If those kids in the stands at San Siro offered hope for the future, then so too did a 19-year-old on the pitch at the Stadio Olimpico, Nicolò Zaniolo climbing off his backside to improvise an opening goal for the Giallorossi. His namesake Nicolò Barella, 21, has been running games for Cagliari all season but highlighted his performance against Empoli with some precocious acts of inidualism as well.Most absorbing of all was the match between Fiorentina and Sampdoria at the Stadio Artemio Franchi. Both teams begin 2019 with aspirations of qualifying for Europe, or perhaps even – given the underwhelming form of Lazio, Milan and Roma – of seizing a place in the top four.Toward that end, Fiorentina signed Luis Muriel on loan from Sevilla at the start of this month. The Viola had been frustrating to watch in the first half of this campaign: a young team blessed with abundant creative talent but lacking the quality up front to capitalise on it. Only Torino, in the top half, had scored fewer.Muriel might seem a curious choice in that regard. Although likened to the Brazilian Ronaldo by reporters throughout his previous stint in Italy, he has never been especially prolific. Only twice in his career has he made it to double figures – scoring 11 Serie A goals for Udinese in 2012-13, then the same number for Sampdoria in 2016-17.He did furnish a further nine assists during that latter campaign, though, prompting Sevilla to make him their most expensive signing of all time. Muriel departed for Spain, talking of a desire to “make that step forward towards the top five or six teams in Europe”.Plainly, things did not work out as he envisaged. Muriel was unfortunate to join Sevilla in what would become a period of constant upheaval, the club rotating through four managers in less than a year, but he also frustrated fans with erratic performances and drew criticism for his fluctuating weight. He had played just six league games this season, and only one as a starter.His impact for Fiorentina, however, would be immediate. Muriel opened the scoring against his former club with a memorable goal: picking the ball up just inside the Sampdoria half and sprinting 30 yards before slipping the ball between two defenders and easing a side-foot finish into the far corner just as a third arrived to close him down.He declined to celebrate, as he would again after producing an even more special strike midway through the second half. The game had turned against Fiorentina in the interim. Edimilson Fernandes was sent off for a second booking and Gastón Ramírez equalised before the interval.The visitors were pressing for a second goal, when Federico Chiesa played a ball out of defence towards Muriel on the edge of the centre circle. The Colombian took one touch to spin past Joachim Andersen and one more to evade the challenge of Nicola Murru. Nobody else could catch him as he sprinted half the length of the pitch to finish across the goalkeeper once again.For Fiorentina supporters, it was a goal that evoked memories of Roberto Baggio’s coast-to-coast against Napoli in 1989. Still, Muriel would only hold his hands up in apology. An act of deference towards Sampdoria’s fans, but perhaps also their manager, Marco Giampaolo, whom he credits as the first coach ever to truly show faith in him.Muriel chose Fiorentina ahead of Milan this January in part because he got the sense that Stefano Pioli might become the second. “You’re the only one who reminds me of Ronaldo, O Fenomeno,” the manager is reported to have told him. “Now prove it.”Sunday’s game represented a pretty good start, even if it still was not enough to secure three points. Sampdoria have a phenomenon of their own in Fabio Quagliarella, who struck twice in five minutes to turn the game on its head. In doing so, he extended his personal scoring streak to 11 consecutive games in Serie A – the joint-longest run of all-time, matching Gabriel Batistuta’s run from 1994.Football in Italy had shown us its ugliest side at the end of 2018.

Her other advice is to “get rid of the word ‘should’”. People can put a lot of effort into what they think others want or expect from them, which they may have misjudged – a recipe for unhappiness, she says.Aiming for too-ambitious a goal can be setting yourself up for failure, knocking your self-confidence even if you have taken big steps towards it. A sense of accomplishment is key to maintaining your pride, says Blair, who suggests setting short- to mid-term goals.Although keeping to your comfort zone can offer short-term relief, it can backfire in the long term, says Chris Williams, professor of psychosocial psychiatry at the University of Glasgow. “It teaches you the unhelpful rule that the only way to cope is by avoiding things.” Think of that boost you feel once you tick off a challenge.Low self-esteem can sometimes lead to neglect of physical health. The mental health charity Mind recommends considering any negative impacts on your life of stress, exercise, sleep, diet and drugs and alcohol. Finding ways to relax and addressing any issues you may have with your diet or substances can have a significant effect on your sense of self-worth.Physical activity has been found to positively influence self-esteem and wellbeing. A 2016 study found that physical activity, perceived physical fitness and body image play an important role in self-esteem, and recommended that “regular physical activity should be promoted, in particular among adults reporting lower self-esteem”.Research published in the Journal of Public Health in 2015 found that just one session of gardening in an allotment yielded significant improvements in mood and self-esteem.

Get to know the bustling hive of activity with our insiders’ guide, courtesy of locals Oliver Press and David WilliamsWhether up close or far away, Liverpool is a city with impressive vistas. We’ve got beaches, parks, seafront and rooftops – but it’s not just the views keeping people enjoying the city. A fun-loving spirit, full of character and characters, it’s a city in the midst of a cultural renaissance, exploding with independents who keep us all eating, drinking and dancing.Liverpool is a city of makers and dreamers and it never feels more apparent after visiting the Wild Loaf. As well as supplying half the city with bread, it also has a small shop down an unassuming alley where you can buy fresh bread made that day, alongside its city-famous fresh doughnuts. For food on the go, Bakchich on Bold Street offers the best Lebanese food this side of Beirut.For a fancier dinner, it’s worth checking out Oktopus, which specialises in European small plates and craft beer, with a focus on fresh fish and seafood. Speaking of small plates, Maray and its beloved “disco cauliflower” on Bold Street is practically unmissable. As is Salt House Bacaro’s Italian-style tapas, which includes favourites such as ox-cheek lasagne.For something out of the city, get to Belzan (if you can get a seat, that is), located in the student area of Smithdown Road. It’s a classic neighbourhood bistro slinging out some of the best food in the city. If you’ve got room after, grab a wood-fired pizza from Little Furnace just opposite it. Hafla Hafla, a middle-eastern inspired restaurant, has just opened on Lark Lane. Its halloumi fries are worth travelling for alone. If sitting down and knives and forks aren’t your thing, head to Homebaked Anfield – the co-operative bakery opposite Liverpool FC’s home ground, with a queue down the block most days.All that eating can be thirsty work. If it’s wine you’re looking for, pop into Bunch, Liverpool’s first natural-wine bar. On Berry Street, it specialises in off-the-shelf, small-batch wines you’d struggle to find anywhere else. A small stumble a couple of doors down and you’ll be at Berry \u0026amp Rye, the city’s premiere speakeasy – a blacked-out joint with no sign, which can be missed in the blink of an eye. If you find the door, walk in for the bluesy prohibition-era atmosphere and a whisky collection impressive by just about anyone’s standards.In a time where pubs are closing so frequently, many of the local boozers that are surviving have started doing things a bit differently. The Caledonia, a pub in the Georgian Quarter with a great history, has set up its own community library and recently switched up its menu to be completely vegan. It has been attracting students and hungry hipsters ever since. Just around the corner is Peter Kavanagh’s, a pub full of curios and characters that is also definitely worth a visit. For something grander, head to the Philharmonic Dining Rooms, a beautifully ornate – and gigantic – boozer that is very popular for pre-theatre drinks.Meanwhile, the Merchant on Slater Street, with its Scandi-cool decor, is a great place to dance with an Aperol spritz in hand. For a night of sophisticated tunes and drinks, head to Frederiks on Hope Street – one of Liverpool’s top jazz bars – or Kazimier Garden, a beautiful urban oasis where you can catch an eclectic programme of live music and imbibe from a list of great craft beers.If alcohol isn’t your thing, 92 Degrees Coffee will provide your caffeine fix they roast the coffee beans themselves so you’ll smell it before you see it. For tea, don’t miss Leaf on Bold Street, one of Liverpool’s most popular independents specialising in loose-leaf tea.If you’re hoping to take a bit of the real Liverpool home with you, you could do worse than to pay a visit to Matta’s, again on Bold Street – a family-run business for more than 30 years and the city’s premiere shop for international, vegan and healthy foods. In other words, Matta’s is a Liverpool institution. Vinyl heads, make sure you check out Probe Records and Dig Vinyl. For clothes, Resurrection on Bold Street has some great bargains and Outsiders will provide you with all the latest streetwear. If you dream about pastry, visit Artisane on Bold Street for Parisian-style baked goods or pop into the family-run Rough Handmade at the Albert Dock for their famous pillowy pita breads. If you fancy something off the beaten track, stroll on down to Queen Avenue, known as Liverpool’s Diagon Alley among the locals, with its cobbled paving and olde worlde shop facades. Pop in and see wine merchant Devin Stewart at R\u0026ampH Fine Wines for a bottle of something special.Liverpool was once famously described as the kind of city where people go out on a Monday night and couldn’t care less about the Tuesday morning. Never does that feel more apparent than at Camp and Furnace, where the phenomenon began. Thursdays are the new Friday, well at least according to the twins behind Shit Indie Disco, a weekly club night helping revellers relive the golden era of indie. If you’re more into your electro and techno nights, check out Abandon Silence. Constellations in Baltic Triangle and Invisible Wind Factory in the North Docks are also very well known for their wide range of weekly blockbuster events.If you fancy dancing like nobody’s watching, there’s nothing quite like a night at Jenny’s Bar – it’s a disco den with one of the most stunning interiors. The Jacaranda has always been famous for music and all those decades later you can still get a taste of the local music scene.It’s no secret that Liverpool is blessed with some stunning buildings and public spaces, so it’s a damn good thing that it’s also easy to get around the city. The good public transport and bike-rental schemes are loved by the locals, but the city is also highly walkable. And getting the train into the city couldn’t be easier with London Northwestern Railway, which runs plenty of services from Birmingham, London and elsewhere. Plus, there are savings to be had if you book in advance.We may have bias, but the waterfront and the Three Graces are up there with the best when it comes to said buildings and public spaces. At the stunning Sefton Park you’ll find the Palm House – a dome-shaped Victorian palm house with lush flora, and a regular venue for events. Liverpool Cathedral, St George’s Hall and Central library are all musts. For great exhibitions, check out the Museum of Liverpool, Maritime Museum and World Museum. If you get chance and fancy admiring Liverpool from a different angle, Everton Brow offers a view like no other.If you fancy seeing the waterfront from a different angle, climb on board a ferry across the Mersey for picturesque views. For something a bit different, go on a Shiverpool tour, the award-winning ghost tour of the city’s Georgian Quarter. Once you’ve seen the sights, relax at Sugar \u0026amp Dice in the Baltic Triangle – it’s Liverpool’s premiere board-gaming cafe and offers the perfect respite from the modern world.Liverpool’s got loads of amazing art. We’re talking world-class paintings, modern works that make your head spin and street pieces worth seeking out. If you’re by the Three Graces, drop into Open Eye Gallery – a photography gallery with great exhibitions. The Bluecoat is the oldest building still standing in the city centre and houses bookshops, art galleries, plant shops and more. For theatres, check out The Everyman \u0026amp Playhouse, Liverpool Philharmonic Hall, Royal Court, Unity theatre or Hope St theatre for something more cutting-edge. The Baltic Triangle is the area in Liverpool everybody’s talking about and it’s become quite famous for the street art, especially the Liver Bird Wings by Paul Curtis.

This Londoner’s guide will help you avoid some potential clangersThe tubeFor something whose sole aim is to get people from A to B, the tube is fraught with potential faux pas. One main rule is that you should always stand on the right on escalators. If you dare to break this, you’ll be met with a lot of muttering and eye-rolls, although no one will dare to berate you personally. You must also never, ever make eye contact with a stranger on the tube, or, worse, smile at them. This invades the Londoner’s sense of private space, even if you’re standing in a different carriage.Pigeons come sprinkled with a touch of glamour when they’re gathered en masse in St Mark’s Square in Venice not so much when they’re in Trafalgar Square on a drizzly Tuesday. Do not feed them, do not encourage them to come near you, and do not interact with them at all. They’re known as flying rats for a reason.London may not quite be New York – although we’re certainly trying to keep up the skyscraper count – but it still loves its bagels. A fierce rivalry exists between the city’s two classic purveyors on Brick Lane in-the-know purists head to Beigel Bake at number 159 for its hot salt beef with mustard, while its neighbour at number 155, Beigel Shop, does a mean smoked salmon with cream cheese. Beigel Shop has been here since 1855, while upstart Beigel Bake only started in 1974, but both are open 24 hours – and, boy, the service only gets better from two in the morning.Oxford StreetTo outsiders, it’s still seen as a shopping nirvana: over a mile of high-street stores and the odd independent boutique. Londoners, however, know there are better options nearby for the shopper uninterested in souvenir stores (although hats off to Selfridges, a true gem). Try Spitalfields for an East End market buzz, or Dover Street in the West End for high fashion and price tags to match.The Tower of LondonNot many Londoners have actually ever been inside this, but they do know that it’s brimming over with history, stuffed with ravens, and there are some rather nice crown jewels inside. Oh, and that there are a couple of princes still stuck in the actual tower, although we’re not exactly sure what they’re doing there.Crossing the riverOnce you are friends with a Londoner, your allegiance is not only to him or her, but to the area north or south of the river where they live. If you are loyal to someone from the north, you must never go south, and vice versa. Crossing the river is something Londoners only do in an emergency (or for work, if their job happens to be on the opposite side of the Thames from where they live), and weekends must be spent not only in one’s designated compass point, but also bad-mouthing the other.A Londoner will raise his or her head from theirs only if he or she is literally about to be run over by a bus. Otherwise, forget it. Walking down a London street is a bit like playing a game of Frogger, only you’re on a pavement, and the “cars” are phone-obsessed pedestrians. Don’t expect anyone to come and help if you’re looking lost, or start chatting if you’re in a pub everyone will be on their phone, browsing Tinder, booking an Uber, or playing whatever the modern version of Frogger is.One of London’s finest traditions is the illustrious black cab, immediately recognisable by their yellow illuminated signs, shuddering, noisy diesel engines, and adorably knowledgeable drivers, who love nothing better than to get into a debate about their favourite football team, and the performances of its starting eleven over the weekend – you can bank on the fact that each one would have played better if the driver himself was their manager, of course. It’s up to you whether you get involved in the conversation, although this may also depend on how many pints you have sampled at that other Great British institution, the pub.PubsLondon pubs tend to be full of history this also sometimes means they are full of threadbare carpet, peeling wallpaper, and musty cellars. Don’t let that stop you buying a pint of possibly overpriced lager, however, because that atmosphere does not just contain damp it also contains the breath of a thousand London icons – actors Peter O’Toole and Diana Dors, painters Francis Bacon and Lucian Freud, gangsters such as the Kray Twins, and musicians from Dizzee Rascal to David Bowie.Sometimes it’s nice to leaveAs cosmopolitan and fascinating as London is, sometimes it’s nice to explore beyond it. London Northwestern Railway is your gateway to thriving centres such as Birmingham and Liverpool, with the advantage of free wifi throughout the whole train, as well as free online entertainment, so you can pass the time by watching the latest blockbuster or box set.For the best value tickets, with no booking fee, visit londonnorthwesternrailway"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ff736998db552449ecc576f29db7c185a93fe2f/0_335_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e47f75f1c6ca026f89244a410185cee1","title":"the diary of a brummie 24 hours in birmingham","story":"It’s the second most populous city in the UK and attracted 42 million visitors this year. Here’s author  Mike Gayle’s guide to the top things to see, eat and drink in the Midlands cityBirmingham may be known as the UK’s “second city”, but when it comes to my home town’s vibrant galleries, cafes, shops and Michelin-starred restaurants, it’s nothing less than first rate. Slap-bang in the middle of the country, it’s perfectly located for an easy weekend getaway. London Northwestern Railway does great off-peak return tickets at around £20-£30 – so you don’t have to book months in advance to get a good deal. And now that you’re here, let me show you some of what my city has to offer. I was born here and, after a spell in the capital, returned when I became a full-time author. It’s now where I live with my wife and daughters, aged 15 and 12. Brum, I promise, has got it all going on. So if you’ve only got 24 hours to spend here, it’s definitely going to be action packed. Here’s a rough itinerary to help you make the most of your day:9.00–10.30Spend the morning getting to know the city centre. It’s an often mocked but nonetheless true fact that Birmingham has more miles of canal than Venice, so why not see some of them for yourself? Sherborne Wharf offers a variety of city centre jaunts. Afterwards, get in a few quick cultural hits with a visit to the new library (stunning views across the city from the sixth floor) and then follow through to Brindley Place to Ikon, an internationally acclaimed contemporary art gallery. Here, you can also find a branch of local indie cafe, Yorks, where you can enjoy a well-earned cuppa and a slice of homemade cake.10.30–12.00If you’re up for a spot of retail therapy, you’ll be spoilt for choice. Head to the Bullring and Grand Central for stores such as Selfridges and John Lewis, or if you’re after something a little more cheap and cheerful, try the Rag market for stalls selling everything from sari material to vintage punk clothing. For those in the mood to splurge, head to the Mailbox for Harvey Nichols, Heal’s and Paul Smith. If shopping isn’t your thing, however, there are plenty of museums to explore, too. The Museum and Art Gallery is free to enter and now the permanent home to the world-famous Staffordshire hoard. If you prefer your museums on the quirky side, try the Coffin Works (an award-winning independent museum dedicated to the production of coffin furniture!), or the Pen Museum, the only institution in the UK devoted to the history of pen making. Peaky Blinders fans should head to the National Trust property, the Back to Backs. Here, in the city’s last surviving court of 19th-century back-to-back houses, you can see firsthand the homes that served as the inspiration for the hit show’s set designer, Grant Montgomery.12.00–13.30After all that exploring, you’ll probably need to refuel. If you’re on the Jewellery Quarter side of the city, head for the chilled vibes of Otto, an authentic pizzeria famous for its Neapolitan-style pizzas. Afterwards, take a stroll across leafy St Paul’s Square, the city’s only Georgian square, to wash down your lunch with the perfect flat white at Saint Kitchen. For veggies, the revamped Warehouse Cafe is a must, or if you’re looking for something more Instagrammable, 1847’s visually stunning, plant-based delights will certainly fit the bill.13.30–15.00If you’re feeling ready for an afternoon nap after all that food, heading down to Digbeth will wake you up. Once known mainly for its coach station, Digbeth is now seen as one of the coolest places to live in the UK. Start in the Custard Factory, a complex of cafes, shops and galleries located within the hallowed walls of the old Bird’s Custard factory. Here, you can catch a cult film at the Mockingbird Cinema, treat yourself to a couple of craft beers from Clink, indulge in a spot of retail therapy (anything from vintage fashion at Cow Vintage to boards and accessories at Ideal Skateboard Supply), and if that’s not enough, how about a game of crazy golf with an urban twist at Ghetto Golf just around the corner?15.00–16.30By now, you might be in the mood for something a little different. Grab a cab and head 20 minutes south of the city to Cannon Hill park. Covering 81 hectares (200 acres), you can take a swan boat out on the lake, enjoy a woodland walk or a ride on the land train. Cannon Hill is also home to Birmingham Wildlife Conservation Park. Here, you can see red pandas, European lynx, lemurs, cranes, snakes, lizards and family favourites such as goats, guinea pigs and sheep. And if that’s not enough, Cannon Hill is also the site of the MAC, a space for galleries, cafes, theatre, cinema and concerts.16.30–18.00It might be a good idea to zip back to your accommodation for a quick regroup (andor power nap). While there are tonnes of great places to stay on Airbnb, there are some fantastic independent hotels and apartments, too. Fancy a room with curved walls and some of the best views of the Brum cityscape? Head to Staying Cool at the iconic Rotunda for its one- and two-bedroom serviced apartments. In the mood for a Shoreditch-style boutique hotel? Then Saint Pauls House in the Jewellery Quarter is for you. And for those on a tighter budget, Bloc Hotel Birmingham has some great budget rooms with a designer vibe.18.00–19.30So you’re refreshed (or as refreshed as you’re ever going to be), but you’re not feeling hungry yet and you’ve had enough coffee to keep an elephant awake. A trip to an escape room could be just what you need. Exciting Game Birmingham comes highly recommended on TripAdvisor, as does Escape Reality. Alternatively, how about a trip to Tilt, a cool cafe bar that’s home to a collection of more than 20 working vintage pinball machines? In the mood to try something more physical? Head to Rock Up climbing centre at Broadway Plaza, or Boing Zone, a trampoline park just a short taxi ride away from the city centre.19.30–21.00It’s finally dinner time and you’ll be glad to know there are all manner of culinary treats to choose from. Prefer to stay in the city centre? Look no further than the Digbeth Dining Club, a ticketed street food event that takes place every Friday and Saturday, featuring music, entertainment and a rolling cast of street-food vendors. Alternatively, get yourself over to the cornucopia of delights known as the Balti Triangle. Make a beeline for the Ladypool Road area, where you’ll find mouthwatering and authentic Indian, Bangladeshi and Kashmiri cooking, of which Shababs and Al Frash are particular favourites. Most of the restaurants on this strip are BYOB, so you’ll be able to save a few quid on booze. If curries aren’t your thing, there’s Antep (Turkish), Al-Bader (Lebanese and Moroccan) or Jerk \u0026amp Twist (Caribbean). And if you still have room for pudding, there are plenty of dedicated shops to chose from, Artisan desserts (run by Ali Imdad, former Great British Bake Off contestant) being one of the best.21.00 – 02.00By now, you may be getting your second wind. If so, grab a cab and venture to York Road in Kings Heath, a great location for hip places to drink. Start off at the Juke, a bar that has a neat line of craft ales, as well as a 30-year-old jukebox imported from Chicago.

I am a deputy head teacher. My partner and I are having strong arguments over me stopping my pension, which I want to do so that I can get the best possible mortgage by providing three payslips clear of pension contributions. We are looking to increase the size of our house in north London as we have a young family. My partner doesn’t have a pension as she thinks they are the devil. She is freelance and so her payslips won’t be contributing to the mortgage process. It appears most mortgage firms do not overlook your pension payments. What should I do? MWA To repeat what I said in May 2015, I most certainly wouldn’t advise anyone to cancel their pension contributions for a few months to boost their chances of getting a mortgage. Besides, there may be no point as a significant number of lenders don’t ask about pension contributions. In addition, lenders ignore pension contributions deducted from salary – as I assume yours are – because they are already taken into account in the net pay figure on payslips, which areused to assess affordability. In addition, stopping contributions won’t bump up the net pay figure by as much as you think because your tax bill goes up.Rather than stopping pension contributions, you should concentrate on reducing what you owe on other loans, including credit card debts. Also, if your partner fills in a tax return every year – which she should if she doesn’t pay tax through the PAYE (pay as you earn) system – she can provide evidence of income to a prospective mortgage lender in the form of HM Revenue and Customs tax-assessment forms. So it doesn’t make sense to exclude her from the mortgage process as her income could increase the amount you can borrow.Finally, I’ll repeat what I said about using a mortgage adviser if you think your pension contributions are going to be a deal-breaker since an adviser can point you in the direction of a lender that will not take them into account.

On Thursday, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said house prices were falling at their fastest rate in six years, and that the outlook for sales was the weakest in two decades.London is the area most obviously affected by the uncertainty, given the influence of wealthy foreign buyers, and Your Move said there had been big falls in a few key boroughs at the top of the market.Recent high-end sales in Westminster included a mansion on Belgrave Square bought for £60m. The five-storey stucco-fronted property had been on the market for almost a decade and was first listed at £100m.Earlier this month, one property firm said sterling’s slump since the Brexit vote had turned the UK into a goldmine for foreign investors seeking a bargain.However, prices in 10 London boroughs were up over the year.Oliver Blake, the firm’s managing director, said that amid the political and economic uncertainty, “it is understandable why buyers and sellers may be taking a ‘wait and see’ approach to the property market”. However, he added that this meant homes may become more affordable to more people.Rightmove said the UK market had undergone a muted and patchy start to 2019, with the lowest monthly price rise seen at this time of year since January 2012.It added that in London, a larger than usual seasonal fall had reduced average new seller asking prices to below £600,000 for the first time since August 2015. It said the capital had seen a slow start to 2019, with price falls, the uncertain political backdrop and the costs of moving apparently deterring some owners from coming to market."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9278a320430c89bc1aff9031d131707a8601f16a/1811_209_2211_1327/master/2211.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7777e40ad54923c641b427c6f6f944f3","title":"lady gaga says mike and karen pence are worst representation of christianity","story":"Pop star criticises US vice-president’s wife who teaches at a school that discriminates against LGBT students and parentsLady Gaga has criticised the US vice-president, Mike Pence, and his wife, Karen, over her role teaching art at a school that excludes LGBT students and parents.On stage at her Las Vegas concert residency, Gaga said: “You say we should not discriminate against Christianity you are the worst representation of what it means to be a Christian. I am a Christian woman and what I do know about Christianity is that we bear no prejudice and everybody is welcome. So you can take all that disgrace Mr Pence and you can look yourself in the mirror and you’ll find it right there.”Karen Pence is to return to Immanuel Christian School, Virginia, to teach art two days a week. She worked there for 12 years before her husband became vice-president. The school has a “parent agreement” that states the school can “discontinue enrolment” of a student if they or their parents “are in opposition to the biblical lifestyle the school teaches”. This definition includes “supporting or condoning sexual immorality, homosexual activity or bisexual activity”.Following criticism of the policy, Mike Pence said in an interview with Christian television station EWTN: “To see major news organisations attacking Christian education is deeply offensive to us.”Gaga also criticised Donald Trump’s shutdown of the US government. “Please put our government back in business,” she said. “There are people who live paycheck to paycheck and need their money.”Gaga, who defines as bisexual, has long been a champion of gay rights.

Released in 1958 by Native American guitarist Link Wray, the track – all dirty chord progressions and blistering guitar – was an omen of the impending 60s rock revolution, and is widely credited with inventing the power chord that would become essential to rock, metal, thrash and other tangential genres. Sixty-one years after its release, Rumble remains the only instrumental track to be banned from American radio, for fear it would incite youth violence.But this wordless call to arms did get through to the masses, and certain members of the audience to which it spoke would internalize Rumble’s sound and spirit and with them create a new and fantastically unholy genre of larger than life guitar music.“Jeff Beck told me that he and Jimmy Page used to jump around the bedroom at his mom’s house playing air guitar to Link Wray,” says guitarist Stevie Salas. “To visualize these guys that are like, the Mount Rushmore of rock stars playing air guitar to a Shawnee Indian, it just blew my mind.”Indeed, Link Wray, the leather-clad rocker prowling the stage with mega-bravado, grew up poor in rural South Carolina in the days when the Ku Klux Klan would ride by his house in the middle of the night, and when the Klan was just as likely to come after you for being Indian as for being black. He’s one of many Native artists – Jimi Hendrix, The Band’s Robbie Robertson, jazz vocal icon Mildred Bailey – whose heritage was largely hidden, even as they shaped musical history.Wray’s most famous song thus serves as the title of Rumble: The Indians Who Rocked the World, a documentary exploring the Native American presence in, and influence on, popular music. Released last year, Rumble makes its US television premiere on 21 January and in it, Steve Van Zandt calls Rumble “the soundtrack to juvenile delinquency” while Iggy Pop preaches that the track “ did help me say ‘fuck it, I’m gonna be a musician.’”But Rumble’s narrative goes far deeper than teenage impulses, tracing a path from rock ‘n’ roll to jazz to the blues to the music of pre-colonial America, before European immigrants and Federal government began their systematic decimation of Native people and the vibrant musical traditions they carried. Through exhaustive research backed by the Smithsonian, Rumble makes a case that the blues, the oldest form of American popular music, was influenced by even more ancient Native styles of playing and singing.In particular the film points to Charley Patton – “the father of the Delta blues” who’s believed to have Choctaw ancestry – as a key artist who melded traditional tribal rhythms with the then burgeoning blues. The scene in which TuscaroraTaíno musician Pura Fé demonstrates the Native influence in Patton’s Down the Red Dirt Road will likely give you chills.“That’s Indian music with a guitar,” Fé says, her eyes lighting up, “that’s where it went.”Patton’s style influenced other blues artists and, eventually, the British rock and rollers like The Rolling Stones, The Who and Zeppelin who would bow at their feet in the ‘60s. Rumble features a 1965 clip from the American musical variety show Shindig! in which the Stones host a performance by Howlin’ Wolf, who was deeply influenced by Patton. With such footage, Rumble fleshes out the DNA of popular music, which has for centuries been incomplete due to the suppression of Native people.“As we started to find out the depth of it, we were so excited and also felt a tremendous amount of responsibility to do it properly,” says Rumble’s director Catherine Bainbridge. “It’s a nuanced thing, and it’s not about over-claiming anything. It’s just about saying there’s a part of that history that got buried, and that you should know because it was important.”Rumble took four years to make and was filmed in 28 cities throughout North America – from the deep south to the mountainous west – with the film-makers often spending days with families of the musicians they were investigating, gathering stories and digging through old photo albums.Ultimately, they gathered over 10,000 pieces of archival materials and did 178 hours worth of interviews with musicologists, historians, journalists, poets and rockstars. Rumble’s cast features Pop, Van Zandt, George Clinton, Martin Scorsese, Steven Tyler, Dan Auerbach, Taj Mahal, Jackson Browne, Slash, Buffy Sainte-Marie, Robbie Robertson, Metallica’s Robert Trujillo, Wayne Kramer of the MC5, Taboo of the Black Eyed Peas and other musical luminaries talking about each artist in question with unmistakable deference.“I was completely influenced by Mildred Bailey,” Tony Bennett gushes. “She sang perfect, for me.”The A-list cast was largely a function of the film’s executive producer Stevie Salas, a venerable rock guitarist who’s toured with Rod Stewart and The Rolling Stones. Salas and Bainbridge felt it was key to have famous musicians proclaiming the importance of Native artists in order to make the case for their importance and add weight to interviews with subjects including Fè and the late Santee Dakota author, musician and activist John Trudell.“To me it was important that it wasn’t just Native people praising these musicians, but the biggest rockstars in the world,” Salas says. “If I got on screen and said, ‘Jesse Ed Davis was the greatest guitar player,’ you’d say, ‘Okay, whatever.’ If Eric Clapton tells you, you’re a lot more inclined to believe him.” Salas’ rock Rolodex also helped open doors when requesting interviews.The idea for Rumble came to Salas after he worked with the Smithsonian Museum of the American Indian on Up Where We Belong: Native Musicians In Popular Culture. Based on Brian Wright-McLeod’s 2000 book The Encyclopedia of Native Music, this 2010 exhibition displayed artifacts from Native musicians including Jimi Hendrix, Robertson and Sainte-Marie, and hosted record crowds in Washington D.C. and New York. In this era, Salas was spending time on reservations and had witnessed he says, “what seemed to be a lack of role models. People to look up to Native Americans from 100 or 200 years ago, the Sitting Bulls and Geronimos. I wanted to do something to show Native American people that Native American musicians were really influential and fantastic.” He decided to make the exhibit into a movie.Collaborating with Bainbridge was an easy fit, as the Canadian director had made the 2009 film Reel Injun, which documented Hollywood’s portrayals, and misportrayals, of Native people. What the filmmakers and their team found as they researched was, to them, nothing less than a revision of history, so much so that a curriculum has been developed around Rumble so it can be taught in schools. Meanwhile, last year Rumble found wide release in hundreds of theaters throughout North American and Europe. (Of using the controversial label “Indian” in the title, Salas says: “The goal was to get as many people to understand what the film is, so they’d see it and learn the information. If that meant using a word people are more familiar with, the end justified the means.”)In 2017, Rumble was named one of the year’s best Canadian films at the Toronto film festival and won the world cinema documentary special jury award for masterful storytelling at the Sundance film festival. Salas couldn’t attend Sundance, as he was on tour in Japan recouping some of the money he spent making the movie. Meanwhile Bainbridge and her husband, who is First Nation, had mortgaged their house to help finance the film.For the duo, the steep investment of time and money has paying off not only in praise, but more so in the opportunity to shine a light on Native American heroes who, until now, have been largely left out of the mainstream.“What makes me so proud about the film,” Bainbridge says, “is that now all of us can know this history, and once we know that, we know there are other things we don’t know. That’s where we are right now in our history of decolonization—all the stories are being retold.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ecd5387895d5c379a2b0037128832d6bdd6fcf9/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6daf115c8fab76cbfbb224493f6b9e36","title":"how brexit unravelled today in focus podcast","story":"In a disastrous week for Theresa May’s Brexit agreement, her former director of strategy, Chris Wilkins, and the ’s Daniel Boffey chart where it all went wrong.

Readers have been debating Brexit the morning after the prime minister survived a confidence vote I think the prime minister just wants to do this “reaching out” as a PR exercise at the end of which she can announce “I tried, but no one else came up with another answer that respects the referendum... So you have accept my deal.”Her notorious rigidity is a major part of the problem. She fundamentally lacks the qualities to move this forward. Although she cannot be removed, she has to be circumvented to allow other options to be explored. SnagaThe purpose of May’s little speech last night was to play to the gallery of Daily Mail readers and to set the scene for blaming Brexit on the Labour Party. At a time when she needed to speak to the nation she was as isive as ever. GiantrobotThis is possibly the most abject failure of the British political system since the civil war. It’s the very definition of a constitutional crisis. The fact that Parliament can claim to have confidence in the government says that Parliament itself is broken. The citizens of the UK need a means of dissolving Parliament. helicanIt appears that May wants to have talks but doesn’t want to concede anything. Of course a second referendum should be on the table. The talks may conclude that it shouldn’t happen, but surely that is the whole point of talks.On Jeremy Corbyn’s refusal to meet unless she ruled out no deal, she said, “the door is always open.” Well, there’s no point having an open door if she doesn’t have an open mind. BellaTheCookCorbyn and the shadow cabinet absolutely right to insist the dangerous, flailing and failing May takes no deal off the table before they engage in any talks. May is totally responsible for this disaster and in the power of the DUP whose agenda cares nothing for the well being of the whole nation.The contempt with which May and the likes of Michael Gove talk of Corbyn is disgusting considering the harm created by Tories to our declining economy. They have made us the laughing stock of Europe. SissyJupe20May has no idea how to compromise and isn’t about to start now unless her hand is forced. The opposition parties should now unite behind Corbyn’s refusal to have a dialogue until no deal is taken off the table. At the very least they could extract from her a binding vote on it in the Commons.Ultimately though, we saw yesterday that the DUP can call time on her leadership whenever they want, so I assume they’ll be telling her what to do from now on. smazakIt’s time for Theresa May to abandon her red lines. Otherwise she’s merely trying to share blame. Without some gesture from her to indicate a willingness to actually change something, “nothing has changed”. PaulB1I don’t agree with Corbyn’s stance on Brexit but his insistence on Maybot taking “no deal” off the table is absolutely right. Impossible to talk while this vile dictatorial PM arrogantly refuses to listen to anyone except her rapidly shrinking team of sycophants. darquangeI am absolutely furious, that a bunch of self important, over privileged MPs are trying to strip young people of the same opportunities that I had. Its what you expect from the Tories who have always been the party of grumpy old men and busybodies who want to control everyone else. But what with Labour? SporadicWitIt’s beyond disingenuous to claim that Labour don’t have a plan. During the transition period, Labour want to remain in the customs union and the single market, abiding by the rules of both. Longer terms they seek to negotiate a new UK-EU customs union to avoid tariffs and prevent a hard border in Ireland. That seems like a sensible approach – maintain the status quo, but leave, allowing us time to transition slowly. We would be able to leave the customs union at any time, once we’ve begun the separation process. SharkcustardWell over 500 MPs want a no deal taken off the table. For the first time in this Brexit mess May should show good faith and stop the bullying. If she doesn’t then the short to medium problems will affect those with a bit of money dissatisfied with the increased hassle and cost of travel – and all of the other problems that come with a no deal. Those with no money will be worse off in the longer term. So many of her natural supporters will be immediately affected and they will punish her if her brinkmanship doesn’t work, as it’s only in her power to take a no deal off the table. jonniestewpot"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05962d1a8f3daaea8f2b6ae05251a1366a856cd9/808_173_2070_1243/master/2070.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d1ea4b928a09af3dffa1971c5fa977f","title":"theresa may cross party consensus brexit backstop tory split","story":"Statement on Monday expected to focus on finding a remedy to issue that threatens to split Tory partyTheresa May is expected to reject calls to forge a cross-party consensus on Brexit when she lays out her plan B to parliament on Monday, choosing instead to back new diplomatic efforts in Brussels to renegotiate the Irish backstop.The prime minister held a conference call with her bitterly ided cabinet from the country retreat of Chequers on Sunday evening.Cabinet sources said the consensus on the 90-minute call was to renew efforts to find acceptable changes to the backstop arrangement but that the conversation was light on specifics. One said there were “no actual solutions” proposed during the call.“It is difficult to know – as ever – what she will do,” another said. “But the broad agreement is on the need to bring DUP and Tory rebels on board.” Despite her claim in the wake of last week’s significant defeat in parliament that she would speak to “senior parliamentarians” from all parties to seek a compromise, government sources insisted her overriding priority was to prevent a historic split in the Tory party.Several senior Conservative MPs have suggested they could form a breakaway party if May opted to support a customs union – one of Labour’s central demands, which is also backed by Tory supporters of a Norway-style soft Brexit.Whitehall sources said the prime minister’s chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, had counselled her to consider a customs union after last week’s catastrophic defeat, when her deal was rejected by an overwhelming majority of 230 votes.But when the government tables a formal statement on Monday, setting out its next steps, it is instead expected to focus on seeking changes to the Irish backstop in order to win over Jacob Rees-Mogg’s European Research Group and the DUP.The prime minister could then travel to Brussels as early as Monday evening – though Downing Street denied it would be that soon.May’s move comes as fresh polling evidence suggests the public are sanguine about the possibility of a no-deal Brexit.A poll by ICM conducted after last week’s government defeat and seen by the  asked voters what should happen next.Earlier on Sunday, Liam Fox said it was “the overwhelming view” among party colleagues that the prime minister’s deal was salvageable if she could get change on the backstop.“That seems to me to be the area that we’re coalescing around,” the international trade secretary said. “A lot of my colleagues in the House of Commons have said that if we make changes on the backstop we’d be willing to vote for the agreement.”However, Downing Street and Irish government sources poured cold water on reports that the government was considering the possibility of a joint UK-Irish treaty that would replace the backstop.The plan is favoured by some hard Brexiters, including the former cabinet minister Owen Paterson, and was given some weight by Fox, who said he favoured a “different mechanism” to prevent a hard border.“Of course both Ireland and the United Kingdom have both said that we don’t want to see a hard border and the Irish prime minister has said in the event of no deal, he wouldn’t want to see a hard border,” Fox said. “Now given that we’re in that same place that should be the area that we need to look to find some compromise.”However, a Downing Street source said the plan was “not one we recognise”. Irish sources said the government would reject any approach from May for a bilateral side deal, calling the idea a “non-starter” and saying the EU was very clear the withdrawal agreement could not be reopened unless May changed her red lines.A No 10 source also dismissed reports that the Good Friday agreement could be amended to add a clause pledging there would be no hard border, saying it was not under consideration and had not been discussed on the call.The Irish foreign minister, Simon Coveney, said: “I can assure you that the Irish government’s commitment to the entire withdrawal agreement is absolute, including the backstop to ensure, no matter what, an open border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, and the Good Friday agreement, are protected.”“The solidarity in the EU is complete there, as Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker made clear: they are waiting to see what Theresa May’s plan B is,” an Irish government source added. “From our perspective, a bilateral deal is just not a credible proposal.”Heiko Maas, the German foreign minister, was sceptical on Sunday that British attempts to push Dublin to accept changes to the backstop would bear fruit for the UK. Asked by the German ZDF television about reports of talks between Britain and the Irish government, Maas said the UK’s goals were “a mystery”.“All 27 members must agree. In the last few days there have been relatively clear statements that there are many who are not ready to and there are some that are open to it. We have to wait to see what the Britons suggest.”No 10 has repeatedly denied that it is preparing for a general election to break the deadlock, but the Conservative MP Huw Merriman became the first Tory to admit the possibility was likely on Sunday.“When parliament can’t pass laws, not just on Brexit but on other matters, and the government cannot govern through that, then that’s normally when you have a general election,” he told the BBC.Tory chair Brandon Lewis emailed all Conservative members on Sunday asking for donations with the subject line “Corbyn wants an election,” though he later insisted the party was preparing for local elections in May.Former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown has stepped up his calls for article 50 to be extended for a year, so that a series of citizens’ assemblies could be held to determine what should happen next.“Parliament must inflict a second defeat on the government – by voting next Tuesday to extend article 50 for a year. Not as a delaying tactic but for a purpose: to enable a process of nationwide consultation and reflection,” he wrote in the .“Key to this would be a series of citizens’ assemblies whose thinking would then lead to constructive reconsideration by parliament of our relations with Europe, including the options of a renegotiation followed by a referendum. The direct engagement of the British people is now essential to address the triple challenge of a government defying the sovereignty of parliament, an evermore ided country, and mounting distrust between parliament and people,” he wrote."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b81986ae1360a4c71622336b9f68146b8cbba6de/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4eee09d79fa9b9a14a111bd56c3ccd62","title":"eu citizen registration in uk could become new windrush say migration experts","story":"Critics warn many could be left without legal status to stay if settlement scheme failsMigration experts have warned that the post-Brexit system for registering EU citizens living in the UK could become a new “Windrush scandal” as the scheme to register an estimated 3.5 million EU citizens living in the UK begins.From Monday, the third phase of testing will open to EU residents in the UK, who will be able to register for the new post-Brexit “settled status”. The Home Office is extending its live trial to all EU citizens who hold a valid passport and any non-EU citizen family members who hold a valid biometric residence card.Critics have warned that thousands could be left without legal status to remain in the UK if applications are not processed quickly and effectively.Maike Bohn, founder of the3million which campaigns for EU citizens in the UK to retain their existing rights after Brexit, warned trust in the government was low.“The Windrush people trusted the Home Office and many of them got deported because they were citizens but couldn’t prove it,” she said.The expansion of the scheme follows two “private” test phases. The second phase saw 29,987 applications submitted with 27,211 decisions made. Of those, no cases were refused. However, the second phase was open to 250,000 people in selected universities, health and social care bodies.The immigration minister, Caroline Nokes, said: “From the very beginning we have been clear that securing the rights of EU citizens living in the UK is our priority.“The report into the second private test phase of the EU settlement scheme shows clearly that we are well on track to deliver a system that will make it easy and straightforward for EU citizens to obtain status once we have left the EU.“We are now in a position to proceed with the wider public testing of the scheme, which will provide us with further valuable insight before the full launch of the system by the end of March. We are grateful to those iniduals and organisations that have participated in the testing so far.”The rollout comes weeks after a series of bugs were exposed in the phone app, which does not work on iPhones, including complaints that the passport recognition function did not work on all Android models.Politicians, migrant thinktanks and charities have warned the UK could face “another Windrush” if the settled status scheme fails.Chai Patel, legal policy director at the joint council for welfare of immigrants, said: “EU citizens who do not pay to apply for settled status by 2021 will lose their right to live in the UK and become undocumented.“This is a major obstacle in the way of achieving the government’s promise that every EU national currently in the UK will be welcome after Brexit. By charging a fee and by setting a time limit for applications the government is making it certain that some people will not get settled status.“We therefore urge the government to do everything in its power to make sure everyone’s rights are protected after Brexit. Instead of creating a system that defaults to removing rights if a person does not pay for an application, the government should today grant a free and permanent legal right to stay to all EU nationals resident in the UK.“The Home Office should then provide a free and simple process by which people can obtain documents proving that right.”Jill Rutter, director of strategy for British Future and co-author of the report, said: “The Home Office must invest in getting the EU settlement scheme right from the start. Failure to do so could cause massive problems in years to come, on a far bigger scale than the ‘Windrush scandal’.“The application system should work simply and efficiently for the vast majority of EU citizens. But there will always be more complex cases where people find it harder to navigate the system or to prove their residency – and the sheer scale of this task means even a low rate of failure equates to tens of thousands of people.“The Home Office needs to make sure that people hear about the scheme, that it works well and that errors are remedied quickly when they are made. It must also overcome a legacy of mistrust created by the previous permanent residency scheme. “This is an important test for the Home Office. The stakes are high. Get it right and the UK sends a strong message that EU citizens are welcome and the government is in control. Get it wrong and the consequences are dire.”Ed Davey, Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, said: “No one seriously believes that the Home Office will be able to grant settled status to everyone who’s eligible within two years. Thousands will be left effectively undocumented and subject to Theresa May’s hostile environment.“Liberal Democrats demand better for the Europeans who’ve made their lives here and contribute so much to our economy, our public services and our society.

She said she had also been told Bruce made unpleasant remarks about her before the recording began.The BBC said it was “sorry” to hear of Abbott’s concerns and had sought to reassure her team that social media claims made about the warm-up, which have gone viral, were false.“We are appalled by the treatment of Diane Abbott on BBC’s Question Time,” a spokesperson for the MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington said. “It was clear that a hostile atmosphere was whipped up, propped up by reports of inappropriate and sexist commentary in the audience warm-up session.“A public broadcaster like the BBC should be expected to be a model of impartiality and equality. The BBC cannot claim anything of the sort when analysis of the programme shows that the only black woman on the panel was jeered at and interrupted more times than any other panellist, including by the chair herself.“The media must stop legitimising mistreatment, bias and abuse against Ms Abbott as a black woman in public life. The BBC should be ashamed that their programming is complicit in such behaviour.”The BBC has acknowledged Abbott was right about the polling figures however, Labour has said it wants an on-air apology. The shadow home secretary is a regular on Question Time, having appeared at least 29 times over several decades, according to her office.A Labour source said: “We want to see the warm-up footage because of these claims from audience members and we want an on-air apology over the polling.”Following Thursday’s Question Time and the criticism directed at the BBC, the corporation said in a post on Twitter: “We’ve reviewed what was said re polling on @bbcquestiontime. A YouGov poll published on the day of the programme suggested a lead for the Conservatives. Diane Abbott was also right that some other polls suggested Labour either as ahead or tied, \u0026amp we should have made that clear.”In a further statement, a BBC spokesman said: “Diane is a regular and important contributor to the programme.“We firmly reject claims that any of the panel was treated unfairly either before or during the recording.”In September 2017, it emerged that Abbott alone received almost half of all the abusive tweets sent to female MPs in the run-up to the general election, according to Amnesty International, much of which was racist and sexist.Last month, the shadow home secretary said she experienced more racism now than at any time in her 35 years in politics."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb9788087d8bf9f546fdb102bf5009066b751e98/0_274_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=476276999eb370211a3f5116aedfc0e8","title":"lorry drivers calais brexit frontline no deal trade queues","story":"In the first of a new series, Lisa O’Carroll joins a British driver to navigate the ‘frictionless trade’ of the French portSimon Wilkinson, a British lorry driver, is surveying about 1,000 lorries amassing at the “queue for the queue” about half a mile from a French port. “This is frictionless trade on a Thursday afternoon in Calais,” he said.Wilkinson runs a small haulage company in Kent that specialises in transporting frozen food. Like all hauliers, he is looking ahead to the possibility of a no-deal Brexit – and the customs and animal checks that could come with it – with some trepidation. “This is what it is like before you throw the ner in the works,” he pointed out.About 15 minutes earlier, Wilkinson took a detour from his pickup point in Belgium to see the site earmarked by France for the new border inspection post, where food and animals coming from the UK will be subjected to mandatory health checks.But at the port’s planned border inspection post, no work has been done. It is an open field off the A16, the main road between Dunkirk and Calais, where there is no hard shoulder but there is evidence of people recently living on verges, where rain-sodden duvets and clothes are compacted into the dirt.As we head to the port of Calais, the scale of the commercial operation unfolds, with lorries grinding to a halt in the “buffer zone” ahead of the four controls before the ferry.Hard-sided refrigerated lorries are segregated from soft-sided curtain trailers, which range from small lorries carrying goods ordered the night before on Amazon and eBay to 44-tonne vehicles such as Wilkinson’s, which is carrying 24 tonnes of frozen vegetables from Belgium destined for British pubs, restaurants and schools.After one-and-a-half hours snaking through a sea of lorries, we get to the weighbridge – the first check – then the “heartbeat machine”, which checks for stowaways, followed by British and French immigration controls, and finally a shipping office to register for the next available ferry.There we will wait a further two-and-a-half hours. That we are queueing up with 11 other lorries in lane 155 – one of more than 500 lanes – illustrates how big a pinch point Calais is in the supply chain that keeps Britain’s car plants moving and supermarket shelves full.Number of ferries crossing channel a day: 50Number of lorries going through Dover per year: 2.6mNumber of lorries going through Calais per year: 2m“I wanted to make it common knowledge how congested Calais already is. It runs smoothly, but sometimes you can wait up to nine hours,” said Wilkinson.“This is pure luck it only took an hour-and-a-half. A few hours later and it would be gridlock,” added Wilkinson, who runs a fleet of refrigerated lorries from Kent across the Channel every day, then brings food back.For tourists accustomed to rolling on and off cross-Channel ferries, this is another world.“When people complain that delays in Dover are going to impact their holiday plans, that’s small beer,” Wilkinson said. “This is my living 365 days a year.”Wilkinson runs a fleet of 18 lorries at Harrier Express, employing 25 drivers. A day’s delay costs him £400 per lorry and potentially more if frozen cargo is left to rot at the side of the road.What frustrates and angers him the most is the disconnect between Westminster and hauliers on daily business on the border – the Brexit frontline.“At Manston, what on earth were we doing?” asked Wilkinson, referring to the recent government trial at a disused airport in Kent of an emergency traffic system in the event of Brexit gridlock in Dover.In the event of a no-deal Brexit, French authorities have warned a two-minute delay at the border could lead to 27,000 vehicles queuing on both sides of the Channel.With so much uncertainty, Wilkinson is making his own contingency plans, and has been trialling a new route from Zeebrugge to Purfleet with “unaccompanied” lorries – where one driver takes a lorry to the ferry and another drives it off at the other end.“But I’m hoping that we won’t be sitting on any motorways anywhere, that there will be proper lorry parking with toilets,” he said.Between 6,000 and 10,000 trucks cross the Channel every day, and all checks – bar those of passports and for fraud and smuggling – are carried out on the French side because of limited space at the cliff-edged port of Dover.While Brexiters have said Britain can choose to keep checks on goods and food to a minimum, those in the business are sure this will not be the case in the long term.But the best-laid plans could be undone by language issues, with knock-on delays as haulage is now dominated by Polish and Romanian-licensed lorries, with many drivers unable to speak French or English. In time, Wilkinson and his colleagues fear, queues of 1,000 lorries may seem a lot shorter than they do today."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03103a1b19848989eef53818730929ba1766e8e3/1457_614_1921_1153/master/1921.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f593ee451fdfc7e3211133fc55735af1","title":"may wants parliament to rule out no deal brexit yvette cooper article 50 extension","story":"Labour MP claims Tories want article 50 extension but party politics prevents open supportA senior Labour MP leading a backbench effort to rule out a no-deal Brexit has argued that much of the government, including Theresa May, privately want this to happen, and are relying on parliament to take action.At the start of a political week in which the prime minister is likely to rule out any cross-party efforts to push ahead with a variation of her rejected Brexit plan, Yvette Cooper said it was time for MPs to act. Cooper, who chairs the home affairs select committee, is to table an amendment to a government motion on Monday which would seek to extend article 50 if a no-deal departure on 29 March was looking likely. The move is also the brainchild of the former Tory minister Nick Boles, and has backing from other senior Tories Sir Oliver Letwin and Nicky Morgan.Another backbench proposal from the former attorney general Dominic Grieve could lead to indicative votes being held in the Commons to scope out a consensus, or to the prioritising of proposals from a minority of 300 MPs from at least five parties.The junior business minister Richard Harrington urged May to rule out a no-deal Brexit, saying it would be an “absolute disaster” for the UK.May held a conference call with her cabinet on Sunday evening and will make a statement to the Commons on Monday in which she is likely to announce that she will seek fresh concessions from Brussels before putting her plan to MPs again.Cooper conceded that the idea of backbenchers trying to exert their power was “uncharted territory”, but said her planned amendment was limited in scope.It would decree that if no agreement had passed parliament by the end of February, the government would have to bring forward a binding motion seeking an extension of article 50 “so that we don’t go crashing over the cliff edge”, she said.Blaming May for consistently avoiding cross-party talks on Brexit since losing her majority in the 2017 election, Cooper said she believed much of the government wanted the extension option but could not seek it for political reasons.“My sense is that there are government ministers, including cabinet ministers, and I suspect even the prime minister herself, who want parliament to do this,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.“She knows that she should rule out no deal in the national interest, because it would be so damaging. She’s refusing to do so, and I think she is hoping that parliament will do this for her. That is not leadership.”Cooper said she believed the EU would extend article 50 if asked: “I think they would take very seriously something that has come from parliament in this way. This would not be simply the prime minister just prevaricating and going round in circles.”Speaking earlier on the programme, Harrington refused to rule out backing a proposal such as Cooper’s. “I don’t know what the bill will be, or the mechanism. But all will change in the next couple of days.”Harrington, who has pledged to resign if May pushes for a no-deal Brexit, said the option would be “an absolute disaster for the country, and it’s supported by a minority of a minority of people”.He said: “She should in my view say: ‘We are responsible people, we are going to do our duty to Britons and we’re going to rule out no deal.’”Asked why a no-deal Brexit concerned him, Harrington said: “I’m afraid of Jaguar closing, Mini closing, the life sciences industry closing, and all the other things, because we’ve had no agreement that represents the way these businesses are integrated. It’s irresponsibility and we’ve got to stop it.“I’m not prepared to sell people down the river for other people’s dogma.”Stephen Laws, formerly the head government legislation lawyer, told Today he was concerned that backbench plans to control the Brexit process could cause a constitutional crisis.Arguing that parliamentary rules “give a clear veto to the government” over any bills involving significant spending, Laws said that if MPs forced through a measure, May could ask the Queen to decline royal assent.“I don’t think it’s a fanciful speculation, because if the rules aren’t applied as they should be, that’s what will happen,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6321879597003f6396d29aac12d5ca0624e54891/0_133_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c317d27949be7a215090b2ada7e35c63","title":"china steps up bid to win the lunar space race","story":"Successful Chang’e 4 mission reveals nation’s ambitious attempts to thwart its rivals As Apollo 11 sailed above the moon, mission control in Houston suggested the astronauts should keep an eye out for a “beautiful Chinese girl called Chang-o”, who, according to legend, had ascended to the moon thousands of years previously, taking along a large rabbit as a companion.“I’ll look out for the bunny girl then,” Buzz Aldrin joked in reply, shortly ahead of his and Neil Armstrong’s historic touchdown at the lunar surface.Nearly 50 years on, an astronaut gazing down from orbit might glimpse a hi-tech homage to the ancient folk tale. China’s Chang’e 4 probe this month became the first to land on the lunar far side, and nearby, hibernating during the lunar night, the Jade Rabbit rover is exploring this uncharted territory.The mission showcases China’s ambition to become one of the world’s major powers in space exploration. The country has made the moon exciting again by beaming back the first close-up images of its mysterious far side. Beijing does not disclose how much is spent on its space programme, but aims to build a space station and a base on the moon, as well as send a probe to Mars by 2020 and carry out a mission to Jupiter by 2029.Possibly spurred on by China’s plans, other space agencies are showing a renewed interest in the moon, and landers from the US, India, Japan and Russia are planned over the next decade. So what is driving the renaissance of lunar exploration?James Carpenter, a project scientist on the European Space Agency’s lunar exploration team, believes that the latest interest goes beyond purely scientific goals. “There is a long-term motivation which is about sustained human presence in space,” he said. “If we ever want to live and work in a permanent, economically sustainable way off Earth, this requires that we learn to use the resources we find there.”The motivations for heading into space for longer periods include extracting valuable resources from the moon or asteroids, as well as a preparing for a “lifeboat scenario” where the world becomes uninhabitable.At a press conference, officials said there would be three more missions after Chang’e 5, a mission to return samples from the moon. By Chang’e 8, China hopes to lay the foundation for a research base, including possibly building houses on lunar soil using 3D printing.Wu Weiren, the chief designer of the Chang’e mission, told China’s state broadcaster CCTV: “It is human nature to explore the unknown world. China is on the road to becoming a strong space nation.”Preparing for living in space is a large element of the Chinese programme. Chang’e 4’s payload included experiments to investigate the presence of water in the lunar soil, as well as a miniature greenhouse to test the ability of plants and insects to survive in weak gravity.Back on Earth, students at Beihang University in Beijing ran a year-long experiment, Lunar Palace 1, in which students were housed in lunar-like conditions. Inside a module they grew potatoes, wheat and vegetables, and relied on oxygen and water that were recycled within the “bioregenerative life support system”.China is not alone in its ambitions on the moon. A Russian lander, scheduled for 2022, will attempt to drill into the south pole region and look at the potential for resource extraction, while ESA is planning experiments to harvest water and oxygen. Nasa is planning its first crewed mission around the moon in half a century for 2023.The prospect of China, the US and Europe competing to establish outposts and exploit the moon’s resources has led to talk of a new space race, with some suggesting that China is now ahead.However, John Logsdon, professor emeritus of political science and international affairs at George Washington University, said that many have overstated China’s recent accomplishments. He describes them as relatively modest when compared to Nasa’s New Horizons mission, the first to perform a fly-by of a Kuiper Belt object, or Japan’s Hayabusa 2 mission, set to land on an asteroid next month and return samples to Earth. “China’s achievement is impressive, but it is not something fundamental or different from what other countries are doing,” he said.For Logsdon, the key question in how the next phase of space exploration plays out is whether China becomes a collaborator with other countries or continues to compete. “It’s really a broader question of Chinese-US relationships overall,” he said. “Will the two countries become peer competitors in military, economic and technical terms, or will they find ways of working together? What happens in space just dramatises that.”Experts say other countries are likely to remain cautious about collaborating with China, despite some positive steps such as the inclusion of instruments aboard Chang’e 4 developed by teams in Sweden and Germany.“China’s reputation for stealing technology hurts chances for cooperation,” said James Lewis, senior vice-president and director of the technology policy program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “China sees itself as competing – when they drone on about the need for win-win, it’s a sign that they think we are in a zero-sum game, where there can be only one winner.”Because the Chinese military, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), oversees the majority of what China does in space, there are also concerns about China’s goal to deploy space systems to more effectively gather information than their adversaries – or block their adversaries’ ability to do the same.Whichever way diplomatic relations in space play out, Carpenter said that nations and commercial players should be working to establish ground rules for the exploration of the moon and beyond.He added: “Something we’ve learned from working on Earth is that we have to learn how to manage resources in a sustainable and ethical way. This is something that is certainly going to be part of the discussion – how we do this in a way that is responsible in the future, and how we create the rules and governance and legal framework to ensure we do that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a98e2e1b914aa467e8afa51f06314d63a7292af/0_186_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d5b9fd39c323a167ff7823767c38dc1","title":"faecal transplant researchers identify super pooper donors","story":"Study finds stool transplants from some donors are far more effective than othersResearchers looking into the success of faecal transplants believe they have identified why the poo of certain donors produces better results than others – so called “super-donors”. A team at the University of Auckland examined results from previous studies on faecal transplants – when faeces, and the microbes it contains, are taken from a healthy gut and used to “re-set” the gut of the recipient – to understand why poo from certain donors resulted in a better success rate in treating certain conditions.The transfer of faeces from one inidual into another has become a useful treatment for recurrent Clostridium difficile (C Diff) infections, a debilitating condition that causes diarrhoea and tummy pain. However, the procedure is also showing promise for a host of other conditions, including ulcerative colitis (an inflammatory bowel disease), that have been also been linked to the microbiome of the gut– the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi found there – being out of kilter.Studies have shown that while success rates for procedures to treat C Diff are similar regardless of the stool donor, some conditions – including ulcerative colitis – were improved depending on the donor.In one study the remission rate for ulcerative colitis was twice as high among recipients whose transplant included stool from one particular donor. Such results have fuelled the emergence of an unlikely sounding hero: the super-donor.Writing in the journal Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology, Dr Justin O’Sullivan and colleagues say while recurrent C Diff infections are down to the overgrowth of a particular type of bacteria, a more complex shift in conditions seems to be present in ulcerative colitis where a “super-donor effect” is seen.By looking at closer at what makes someone a super-donor, O’Sullivan said, it is possible to delve deeper into what is behind the recipient’s recovery, and could eventually allow experts to administer only certain bacteria or chemicals to treat a condition. Looking at previously published studies in the field, O’Sullivan and colleagues say a stool from a super-donor often has a greater ersity of microbes. However, they add for some conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease, specific components are important such as whether the stool is richer in particular bacteria – such as those which produce certain chemicals.In other studies, it has been suggested the presence of viruses in the stool might play a role in resolving certain conditions. “We think the super-donors differ depending on the condition you are trying to treat,” said O’Sullivan. The team added that compatibility between the donor and recipient is another key factor, not least the immune reaction of the recipient to the donor stool, and which species and strains are present in the recipient’s gut before transplant.What’s more, for the procedure to be a long-term success, O’Sullivan and colleagues say factors including the diet of the recipient is important – previous work has shown what we eat shapes the community of microbes in the gut.The researchers conclude there is no “one stool fits all” approach, however, and that a more personalised approach, with better matching between donors and recipients,could improve the chances of a faecal transplant being a success – and widen the procedure’s use for other diseases, such as asthma."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b4d298fe66488c6c5ae768a32b59678f32e9f69/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57e4827ec731b5e21e45fb43de7941b7","title":"rugby union talking points from the weekend action european champions cup","story":"Dan Robson’s display is silver lining for Wasps, Tadhg Beirne outmuscles Exeter while Saracens look Leinster’s biggest threatDan Robson’s performance for Wasps was one of the few shining lights on what was a difficult day for the home side, even if they avoided the thrashing they received in Dublin. He looks back to the kind of form he began the season in before the injury that denied him a first cap in autumn struck.Robson’s try, selling Andrew Porter a fine dummy before racing to the line, was a demonstration of what he can bring, most likely off the bench, for England and Eddie Jones, who was watching in the stands. Bath can take heart from their performance in a scrappy match at Toulouse, even if the French side may have had a reason to avoid pressing for the bonus points. Both English sides have much to do in the Premiership, though, so will be somewhat relieved that forgettable European campaigns are over. Gerard MeagherEddie Jones remarked last week that rugby tended to oscillate between eras of contest and continuity, with the former currently in vogue. Exeter have based their success in the Premiership on being able to retain possession for long periods but have struggled to make the same impact in Europe where the breakdown is more of a contest. Their latest campaign came to grief at Thomond Park in a match that was unsparingly physical and played at a furious pace. Exeter were on the front foot for long periods but were undone by Tadhg Beirne at the breakdown. Munster’s victory made it eight wins in nine for Irish sides over the Premiership ahead of Leinster’s win at Wasps. Paul Rees• All ties to be played 293031 MarchSaracens matched the pool tally of their first European title in 2016 with 28 points out of 30, a figure also achieved by Clermont and Harlequins in 2013. Only Biarritz have registered more, 29 in 2007. Second to them that season were Northampton, whom they drew in the quarter-finals. Northampton beat them. Second to Saracens here are Glasgow whom they play in the quarters in late March. Glasgow now are better than Northampton were then. Still, a Glasgow win would register as a significant upset. Saracens look the team best equipped to challenge Leinster. The Blues flickered but too fitfully. Lyon played the role of uninterested French team. Michael AylwinFor both Scarlets and Leicester to end up losing five of their six pool games is a sign of the European times. The Tigers have now failed to finish in the top half of their pool for three successive seasons there is also no Welsh representation in the last eight of either of Europe’s two competitions this season. Scarlets, gallant 46-33 losers in Paris in round six, scored the same number of pool tries as Ulster but the Irish province won no fewer than five matches en route to the quarter-finals. A free-wheeling Racing side are proving a spirited exception to the rule but, for the most part, a resilient set-piece and a tight, well-marshalled defence are key to success in the modern Europe. Robert KitsonThere would rarely be a dull moment if Richard Cockerill were appointed England’s next head coach. It remains an unlikely proposition but Cockerill’s work in the Scottish capital cannot be overstated. Montpellier have a hulking pack but Edinburgh scrummaged them off the Murrayfield park and responded superbly to going behind early in the second half. They advance top of the pool and earn a home quarter-final to boot, a fine achievement considering the pool contained the three-times winners Toulon and a Newcastle side who won their first two matches. The Falcons slipped to a narrow defeat but there were signs of recovery for the Premiership’s bottom side. Gerard MeagherTeam of the weekendQuote of the weekendConsidering the number of concussions I have suffered, and above that the amount of time it takes to shake off the symptoms afterwards, it is better to avoid the risk of further head injuries.

Such one-sided matches are not a good look for anybody and raise a number of questions, not least over player welfare. The two teams on the receiving end – Timisoara Saracens and Enisei-STM – were the two two qualifiers from the Continental Shield, a tournament struggling to get enough teams to take part.Artificial pitches point up contrastFour matches this weekend took place on artificial pitches and yielded 30 tries, six more than were scored in the other six on grass. It is too simplistic a view to put that statistic entirely down to the playing surface – Munster versus Exeter was hardly going to be a try-fest – but it is not completely coincidental either. In English rugby’s recent injury audit it emerged that players are at more of a risk on artificial surfaces, a concerning trend indeed, but the benefits are also clear."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a06f9003fe4e05b6bc9e733e998fb955deb9dd1/0_36_2672_1604/master/2672.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7da9f27bccde61706cbe148eb533e943","title":"tom brady new england patriots kansas city chiefs super bowl nfl","story":"The New England Patriots quarterback stepped up with his team’s season on the line and time running out on Sunday. Then he did it again in overtimeDid you feel the inevitability? Tom Brady in overtime, needing to put together a drive to win the game and send the New England Patriots to their ninth Super Bowl. And, of course, he delivered, because Brady always delivers. He marched his team down the field with the confidence and presence of the greatest to ever play quarterback.It wasn’t an easy night for Brady, Bill Belichick and the Patriots. The Kansas City Chiefs pushed them to the brink in a game that took more twists than a dodgy M Night Shyamalan flick: there was a muffed punt controversy a catch-no catch an abysmal roughing the passer penalty, when Chris Jones dared to touch Brady’s shoulder pads a blatant illegal interception leading to a score and it was all capped with a bone-headed neutral zone infraction to extend the game. Chiefs pass-rusher Dee Ford lined up in the neutral zone as time wound down in the fourth quarter, negating what would have been a game-clinching interception.And then there was Kansas City’s young quarterback Patrick Mahomes, that delightful magician, who went toe-to-toe with Belichick, the greatest defensive mind in league history, and kept producing haymakers. The 23-year-old, in his first full season, unleashed some of those rare, dimension-altering throws that only he appears capable of conjuring:The final two minutes of the fourth quarter were a masterclass in quarterback play from both sides. Brady and Mahomes exchanged clutch drives. First, Brady led one of his classic two-minute drills, putting the Patriots up 31-28 with under a minute to go. Then Mahomes led his team to a field goal with seconds left to force overtime. What was incredible was that neither man showed nerves with the season on the line. And if either Brady or Mahomes did have nerves, they were channeled into making them play even better.The NFL’s overtime rules dictate that if the first team who possesses the ball scores a touchdown, the game is over. When Brady was given the ball after New England won the toss, he obliged. Three third-down conversions thrown to his most reliable lieutenants – Julian Edelman and Rob Gronkowski – helped seal victory. Brady led the team to the four-yard line before Rex Burkhead plunged into the end zone to set up a date with the Los Angeles Rams in Atlanta in two weeks.Already recognized as the greatest player to play the position, Brady is now rubbing it in. His ninth Super Bowl trip is more than the Steelers, Cowboys, 49ers, Broncos, and Packers have had in their entire histories. It is hard to overstate how absurd that is. These are not run-of-the-mill franchises. It’s a who’s who of sporting institutions. They are the founding fathers of the game, and Brady’s history bests them all.New England haven’t been at their clinical best this season. They have struggled on the road and been fortunate to play in a poor ision – posting a +100-point differential in the AFC East and +1 out of it. But the team aren’t ready to relinquish the throne just yet. Belichick remains the league’s greatest difference-maker. And even at 41, Brady can muster a heroic drive or three when a season is on the line.“I felt pretty good about our chances,” team captain Matthew Slater said postgame. “Because we have Tom Brady as a teammate.”It wouldn’t be a high-stakes NFL game without an officiating debacle:On one play, the officials in the Saints-Rams game missed two egregious penalties: a pass interference call and a blatant helmet-to-helmet hit. Rams cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman didn’t just arrive a beat early, he obliterated Saints receiver Tommylee Lewis.“Just getting off the phone with the league office. They blew the call,” Saints coach Sean Payton said after the game. “I don’t know if there was ever a more obvious pass interference call.”The NFL has resisted expanding replay to so-called judgment calls – like pass interference. Technology is improving and we have better looks available, faster than ever before. More calls should be challengeablereviewable. The Canadian Football League adopted challenges for pass interference back in 2015. The NFL should be a leader on this subject, not a follower.“Listen, it’s tough to get over it,” Payton concluded. “We’ll probably never get over it.”For the first time in the Super Bowl era, both Conference Championship games went to overtime. The Drake curse appears to be alive and well. With the Rams and Patriots triumphing, we will now get our second LA v Boston match-up for a championship in four months, after the Dodgers and Red Sox played for the World Series.Tom Brady is the greatest quarterback of all time. He knows it. Every player in the league knows it. Give me this Brady at a podium, dripping with arrogance, and unafraid who knows it, rather than the cliché spewing robot we’ve become accustomed too.Tony Romo, CBS Sports. The former Dallas Cowboys quarterback may be the biggest winner from Championship Sunday. He owned the AFC title broadcast, cementing himself as the very best analyst in the NFL, and possibly all of sports.The beauty of Romo’s analysis is that it feels like he’s in on the fun with you. He’s not an outsider who spends 60 minutes reminding you of his past glories. He’s here to inform and entertain and watch great football.Romo often knows what’s going to happen based on formations and motions and pre-snap hand gestures, minute details only someone with his experience at quarterback could possibly comprehend. Then he gets as excited as a kid. It’s the perfect combination.• The NFL’s outdated overtime rules cost us an exhilarating end to the Chiefs-Patriots game. Winning a coin toss should not be such a decisive factor in a game of such importance. The argument that a team should just “play defense” is a valid one. Yet as football continues to favor offense, not allowing both sides an opportunity to possess the ball becomes more nonsensical. Instead, the league should adopt college football’s overtime rules. They are fairer and more exciting.• Saints super fan The Whistle Monsta (yes, that’s a real person) dominated the Saints-Rams broadcast. He drew complaints online during Sunday’s game for his piercing whistle, which was picked up throughout by Fox’s in-stadium microphones. Quick note: if you ever find yourself, in any situation, sporting or otherwise, wondering if whistling can improve it, the answer is no.• Is there a greater gap at a position between the best and second best than Aaron Donald at defensive tackle? No other player is even close.• The Cowboys fired offensive coordinator Scott Linehan over the weekend, a week after saying his job was safe. Former Dallas backup quarterback Kellen Moore is in line for the gig after spending the year as the Cowboys’ QB coach.• Bill Belichick will compete in his 11th Super Bowl as a coach in Atlanta against the Rams, nine as a head coach and two as a defensive coordinator. Dare I say: it may be time to consider renaming the Lombardi trophy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ffe63ec60df84d44eb8d4518e19fca94d1c6468/148_86_1395_837/master/1395.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c873ee2c0eb32171098c96321a2bf478","title":"talking horses amazing recovery to win by jockey michael sweeney","story":"‘Perhaps there was some ine intervention,’ says trainer after young Irishman miraculously avoids hitting the turfI’ve seen some amazing recoveries in the saddle in my time but the one achieved by Michael Sweeney at the final fence of Killeagh point to point on Sunday is as good as any of them. He was clearly on his way to the ground after his mount, Ask Heather, jumped into the final fence instead of over it when holding a narrow advantage and favourite-backers knew perfectly well they had done their money.Sweeney ended up dangling from the mare’s neck for several strides but gravity must have been looking the other way because somehow the rider managed to wrestle his way back into the plate. He then asked his willing mount for a final effort and she sprinted forward, winning handily in the end.You can see what happened from the footage in this tweet. Thanks to IRIS Racing and Killeagh point to point committee for allowing us to repost the film on here.“It’s unbelievable,” the winning trainer, Declan Queally, tells me. Queally wasn’t present for the most unlikely success of his career but has seen the film plenty of times and been regaled with the tale by several of those who saw it first-hand.Of the jockey, Queally said: “He’s a great young fella, turned 20 last week, works hard. To do that when you’ve got Derek O’Connor breathing down your neck … On the flip side, he got unseated two races later, but we’re not complaining.“He’s from a little place called Cappoquin, near the monastery at Mount Melleray, so perhaps there was some ine intervention. We don’t mind who’s praying for us if we’re winning!”Whatsdastory, who was challenging Ask Heather when she made her blunder, really ought to have won in the circumstances but for some reason did not run on when she found herself in front, despite O’Connor’s best urgings, and was eventually pipped for second. It looked to me as if she has her own ideas about the game.Anyway, congratulations to Sweeney and perhaps we’ll see him on these shores at the Cheltenham Festival in a couple of months.When I was at Warwick on New Year’s Eve, I saw a remarkable winning performance by the Jonjo O’Neill-trained His Dream, who, in a race sponsored by his owner, fairly bolted up, despite having been pulled up on his previous two outings. The runner-up, Captain Cargo (2.40), didn’t see which way he went but in the circumstances I’m still inclined to think he ran well on that handicap debut, beating 13 of his 14 rivals and having essentially no chance against the winner.Yes, it’s annoying to be raised 3lbs in such circumstances but Caroline Bailey’s runner has more to offer and I’ll take him to prove it today over the same course and distance at 7-2.In Sedgefield’s opener, Domestic Diva (1.15) is 15-8 from the opening 11-4 after a promising first effort over fences at Catterick last month. She’s improved on each of three runs since joining Jennie Candlish from Ireland and this could be her moment.I’m hoping Candlish will have a good day because she also runs the nap, Star Ascending (6.55), at Wolverhampton. He’s on his lowest all-weather mark since he won a couple of races last spring and showed renewed promise last time when third here. Joe Fanning, six times a winner on Star Ascending, returns to the saddle and the pair can be backed at 9-2."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5c30f1616d87d58c0e4da72e9b7d1abbc37c304/0_149_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=738a5a60d12a362e9c83f305effd858d","title":"novak djokovic v daniil medvedev australian open last 16 live","story":"Second set: Djokovic* 6-4, 4-1 Medvedev (*denotes server): Medvedev looks like a man who’s running out of ideas. Djokovic, meanwhile, is cruising, holding to 15 with an ace.Second set: Djokovic 6-4, 3-1 Medvedev* (*denotes server): Medvedev has a worried look on his face when Djokovic leads 30-40. Is this about to be another epic game? Nope. Djokovic pulls Medvedev into a grinding baseline rally. It always feels like a Medvedev error’s on the way - sure enough, the Russian eventually loses patience with trying to break down the wall and nets a weary forehand.Second set: Djokovic* 6-4, 2-1 Medvedev (*denotes server): Is Djokovic going through a little dip? He double-faults to make it 15-30. But after all that drama, Djokovic isn’t messing around. He wins the next three points to hold.Second set: Djokovic 6-4, 1-1 Medvedev* (*denotes server): Too many errors are creeping into Medvedev’s game. He pretty much hands Djokovic a break point, though he saves it with a big serve. Djokovic shakes his head. He thinks he should have made the return. He earns another chance with a clever drop shot, but Medvedev saves again. Then the young Russian denies Djokovic with an ace. Djokovic doesn’t slow down, though, earning a fourth chance with a searing forehand that clips the baseline. Medvedev stands firm with another fine serve. Djokovic gets break point number five Medvedev somehow clings on with some outstanding defence, hanging in the rally before making Djokovic pay at the net. It’s outstanding from both players, but how Medvedev needs to get out of this game safely. Eventually he does, capitalising on a couple of errors from Djokovic.Second set: Djokovic* 6-4, 1-0 Medvedev (*denotes server): This Djokovic gives you chances, as Medvedev noted before the match, but he also takes them. It will be tough for the young Russian to come back from this, though let’s not forget that Stefanos Tsitsipas beat Roger Federer from a set down yesterday. There’s hope yet for the young pretender. But not yet. Djokovic holds to love.And with that I shall hand you over to my colleague Jacob Steinberg to take you through to the close. Medvedev is standing so wide on his first serve and it initially paid idends, the angle proving just too much for the Djokovic return. Some of the time, anyway, because the Serb isn’t a six-time Aussie Open winner for nothing and he can adapt and think on the fly. That game management sends it to deuce and a double fault earned the world No1 set point. He sealed it, bursting to the net and picking his spot in the corner. An up-and-down game from both player’s perspective but it’s Djokovic who has first blood. Medvedev breaks! Well then. The 22-year-old came to the net on the first point with Djokovic’s drop shot not precise enough and the Serb then sent a lob too long. The Russian again seized the initiative, moving forward to crunch a backhand winner at the T. All of a sudden it’s 0-40 and while Djokovic saved the first, a monster rally, which saw the world No1 test his challenger with some really deep groundstrokes, ended with the Serb finding the net and Medvedev is very much back in the set, and the match itself, you would imagine. Not one, bit two Medvedev forehand winners! His serve looked solid again and Djokovic could only tee them up for the Russian to smash home a succession of points. Over to you, Novak. Medvedev initially looked unsettled and a little downcast after being broken but his backhand is so potent, and his own happy place he can always return to. It keeps him in the game and a slightly overhit Djokovic forehand after a long-ish rally sends it to deuce. That said, Djokovic foxed him with a deep slice that he could only send into the net and the slim chance he had of breaking disappeared with another slice from the Serb which he, again, can only find the net. Medvedev is playing uphill when he looked fully in control of the situation earlier on. That’s what Djokovic can do to you. Djokovic breaks! The backhand has been the choice of weapon from both players but Djokovic’s forehand is heating up. A delighted winner down the line levels the game at 15-15 and then he takes a 30-15 lead with more focus on the shot. The world No1 wins two breaks points and only needs one of them as Medvedev’s feet a little slow to responding to a smart return. Big game now for the young Russian. Bit of a mixed bag in that game, including back-to-back Djokovic unforced errors on his backhand, both tamely finding the net. Maybe Medvedev had a point after all. That enabled the Russian to claim his first break of the match but after the Serb looked irate at some shouting in the crowd after a bungled first set he then held with some trademark defence and attack, getting Medvedev on the move and testing his shot-making. At deuce, more variation, with the Russian content to rally from deep and struggling slightly when asked to change pace and direction, and then an ace to finish things off. Signs, both of Medvedev’s enduring threat and Djokovic’s tactics in dampening that threat. Some fine returns from Djokovic in that game, although at 15-0 Medvedev was inches away from pulling off an outrageous backhand winner, low to his left. The world No1 had a glimmer of a break at 15-30 but an ace restored parity. A booming serve and backhand (becoming a feature) gave him daylight and then he levelled the set at 2-2 with another ace which zipped past the Serb. The game was briefly halted for the umpire to replace his microphone. The hilarity! Djokovic looked good, though, coming to the net, forcing Medvedev to mix up his shot selection and then striking some tidy winners. This is shaping up to be a very good match. The first rally of the match – and at 35 shots it’ll take some beating – saw Djokovic test just how flat Medvedev can keep his backhand, the players barely moving from the centre of the baseline. Pretty flat, as it goes, flat enough to win that little skirmish. Thereafter the Russian ripped through the game, winning to love. His first serve accurate, solid and befitting of a man standing at 6ft 6in, not that you’d necessarily know it in the way he plays. Djokovic breezed through the first two points but then sent a wide forehand, well, wide of Medvedev’s backhand before a real kick of a second serve troubled the Russian and then set him nicely at 40-15. Fully in control, he sends the 22-year-old scampering round the court before Medvedev stretched to barely reach a forehand which was low and wide. This is what Medvedev said about Djokovic in the buildup to this match.What I can only say is that probably he is not playing as he was before. Before, when he was young, I was just watching on TV but it was just something insane when he was playing Andy (Murray) or somebody for five hours and you couldn’t see one down (level), it was only up.It isn’t the same now, you always have more chances to beat him and that’s why he’s lost three times to ‘next-gen’ players in the last year.I mean he has a *a point* but it’s still some statement to make give his comparative light CV when it comes to Slams. Djokovic to serve first. Good morningevening everyone, wherever you are. No Federer, no Zverev, no Cilic, no Anderson and, er, no Murray, only three remain of the men’s top 10 seeds. And Novak Djokovic is one of them as he takes on young Russian Daniil Medvedev, part of a clutch of young Russians on the rise.Djokovic, unsurprisingly, is 2-0 up in their head-to-head having beaten Medvedev at Nottingham last year and in the Davis Cup, when the Russian claimed the first set before retiring hurt later in the match. The 22-year-old was mightily impressive in beating David Goffin in the last round in straights (and is yet to drop a set in the tournament) while some, including Medvedev (some call), have claimed their are sufficient chinks in Djokovic’s armour to consider him beatable. This is already Medvedev’s best performance in a grand slam as he takes on a 14-time major winner and a victory in Melbourne six times. The players are on court and warming up. Start is imminent.

But while glamour fades, talent endures – letting these supporting stars win the long gameWhen the actor Paul Chahidi was leaving drama school, he met a seasoned agent. Suit and tie, leather chairs, schooner of white wine at 3pm. Old school. “He sat down, a bit too close to me,” Chahidi remembers, “and said: ‘Three things you should know about yourself – one, you’ve got a funny foreign name two, you’re losing your hair three, you’ll never play Romeo. But you can act – and with that we can go a long way.’” Chahidi was too surprised to take offence. “And it turned out he was right.”Star players often begin as winsome, floppy-haired Romeos or Juliets. But pretty doesn’t always endure – for longevity, look to the odd. “I was a character actor from the very beginning and not really sold as pretty,” Susan Sarandon told the  in 2017, “which is probably what’s allowed me to survive as long as I have.”What makes a character actor? Consider a litany of cherished survivors: Julie Walters and Alison Steadman, Toby Jones and Jim Broadbent, Imelda Staunton and Timothy Spall. They play the un-cheekboned, the anti-suave, the awkward stumblers through life and love. No wonder they are so often beloved: they speak for people like us. Chahidi’s precision work on television (buoyant vicar in This Country), film (quivering apparatchik in The Death of Stalin) and stage (Maria in the Globe’s all-male Twelfth Night) might seem the essence of character acting but he’s no fan of the term. “It does seem a little bit dated, and sometimes you sense there’s something reductive in it,” he tells me. “Is Meryl Streep a character actor? Mark Rylance? In a sense, who cares? You can either convince as the character or you can’t. In my mind it comes down to whether they are transformative or not.”The earliest instances of the term in the Oxford English Dictionary date from the mid-19th century and suggest actors noted for idiosyncratic and eccentric roles. As a concept, it is far older – theatre historian Gilli Bush-Bailey traces it back at least to the Restoration, where particular actors specialised in fops, bumpkins or harridans, and believes that the mid-20th century repertory system solidified the notion.Weekly rep, with minimal rehearsal, had no time for left-field casting. People were required to play to type. Bush-Bailey’s parents were both actors whose careers were shaped by precisely these notions. Her mother, “very tall and quite gawky”, was brought up in upper-middle-class society, presented at court and “could not do accents to save her life” yet she was repeatedly cast as barmaids and charladies.The rep system set expectations for drama schools and the wider profession. Chahidi points me towards vintage editions of Spotlight, the actors’ directory. Actors are ided not only into gender but also “Leading and Young Leading” actors or “Character MenWomen and Comedians”. Character players stress their versatility, often through contrasting snapshots: ease with accents (“fluent cockney”), traversing class (pairing photos in top hat and flat cap) and age. A young Warren Mitchell presents himself in street-savvy denim and as a dinner-jacketed old duffer. Joyce Hemson advances her “character comedy – tarts, barmaids, charwomen, etc”. No wonder modern actors bridle at a term that seems mired in Britain’s class system.In 1966, the character sections housed “the world’s most travelled TV cat impersonator” alongside emerging comic stars such as Penelope Keith and Nigel Hawthorne. There too, gazing moodily from the pages, is a youthful Brian Cox. “It’s such a long time ago,” the star of Succession sighs on the phone from New York. “In the 1960s, there was this differential. But then came people like Albert Finney, Tom Courtenay and Alan Bates. They’re all characterful men, so it was very much the thing to be.”Now in his 70s, Cox has “always believed in the long haul,” he says. “I never thought of myself as a juvenile leading man.” He did play classical leads – Titus Andronicus at the RSC, Lear at the National – but then aimed at US cinema. “Film is an egalitarian medium,” he says. “Even if an actor is only on set for one day, that’s their day … I like to be a commando: going in and getting out.” Even his protagonists, as in the recent film The Etruscan Smile, may “carry the story, but are very much character roles”. He rebuts any stigma attached to the term. “Any actor worth his salt is a character actor.”Samantha Spiro, bright-eyed and crackle-voiced, is worth an awful lot of salt. She has triumphed as the bittersweet heroine in a West End run of Lady Windermere’s Fan, as the brassy matchmaker in Hello, Dolly! and as a memorably agitated Lady Macbeth at the Globe in London. “Every part you play, whether it’s near to you or not, is a character,” Spiro reflects. “Sometimes you speak in your own voice and walk in a similar way – whereas it’s more obvious if you’ve got a hunchback and a wig. Actually, it’s the same process. You want to get away from yourself. As far away as you possibly can.”With that distance, Spiro used to feel most comfortable. “When directors at drama school would try to make me more of a juvenile lead, I felt incredibly vulnerable. It felt as though they wanted to close me down.” Even in musicals, “I couldn’t sing unless I was in character. I know that sounds crazy, but I honestly don’t feel I know what my voice is. If you put me in character, I feel the freedom to sing as her. Mad.”Burrowing within or hurling yourself beyond – each is essential to finding character. “Transformation is essential to an actor,” insists Joanna Read, principal at the drama school Lamda. “Good actors are all character actors, and any actor should be able to play any part.” She doubts that the term still has currency among drama students. “This generation won’t put labels on themselves, quite rightly, and we don’t want to limit them. We advise them on how to engage with the industry – and crucially on how to make their own opportunities. The type of career they have should be down to them.”Yet drama school can be where problems begin. “My drama school found it very hard to place me,” says Chahidi. “I would get out and out comic roles, or old men. On one occasion I was asked to play a Pakistani janitor – I’m not Pakistani.” Pigeonholing is, he thinks, a peril of the profession, especially in castings for film and TV, where “people will make up their minds about you extremely quickly, as soon as you walk through the door. In theatre, you have more leeway to convince people.”“Screen castings might define you more by appearance,” Read concedes, “but we encourage students not to simply accept that. The way the industry will change is by voices challenging received ideas.” I love this idealism – but is it how the industry actually operates? Casting director Sophie Parrott cautions that “particularly on screen, the reality can be very different. A homogenised beauty can dominate. I enjoy working in theatre as I feel there is often more flexibility as to what constitutes a lead – physical appearances are less important.” But Parrott also notes that in Hollywood, conventional stars no longer reliably produce profit. “The industry has had to reconsider its approach to casting. This has allowed character actors to step into the fore and become ‘leading’ in their own right.”Character actors thrive in a world without heroes. Bilge Ebiri, in the New York Times, charted their ascendancy. Don Cheadle or Michael Shannon play complex leads in lower-budget movies, while “in mega-films (especially superhero ones), they are relied upon for their ability to bring soul to underdeveloped, potentially cliched parts”.Age, scourge of the pretty, can unleash an actor’s quixotic glory – see Hugh Grant’s late flowering as Jeremy Thorpe and Paddington’s nemesis. As Parrott argues, “age sometimes allows us to widen the box in which we see an actor, and opens up their range of roles”. Or, as Spiro has it, “it’s such a relief when you don’t have to just look lovely. For a lot of people in this business, growing older is really tough. But actually, being released into lack of vanity is extremely liberating. You can act.”So, does Spiro think of herself as a character actor? “As long as I work, I don’t care what people call me,” she declares. “But somebody said recently that I was part of a group of ‘character leading actors’, and that felt like a real compliment. I hadn’t heard those words put together until then.” And how about Chahidi? “If you mean it as a compliment, I’ll take it. If not, screw you.” This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Here’s how Thrones can bow out on a highConsidering what a bunch of entitled, vegan sausage roll-eating brats we apparently all are in 2019, there’s a fair chance the final season of Game of Thrones will satisfy exactly no one.Finales, after all, are notoriously tricky to get right. Some shows nail their farewells with a flourish (Breaking Bad, The Sopranos). Others bisect their fanbase right down the middle (Battlestar Galactica, er, The Sopranos) and become the launchpad for petty online spats with strangers for decades to come. Given that season seven of Game of Thrones was its shakiest yet, season eight could feasibly fall into the latter camp.In order to prevent a backlash of such magnitude that it may knock the Earth off its rotational axis, Game of Thrones must ensure it sticks the landing, for the sake of us all. And it can, if it keeps to some very simple principles.For everything it did well, season seven required whopping suspensions of disbelief, as characters zipped around the world in the blink of an eye, or acted entirely against their established personalities in order to further the plot. If you’re desperately invested in a show with dragons, zombies and Kit Harington being northern, and it’s geographical inconsistency that is getting you riled up, something is very wrong indeed. The characters and world used to feel real, constrained by rationality and reason. They need to again.Tentpole action sequences are what Game of Thrones does better than any other TV show in history – and most movies, for that matter. The Battle of the Bastards remains the zenith, a chaotic, claustrophobic tour de force, with last season’s Battle of the Goldroad or season five’s Hardhome not far behind. But as anyone else who overindulged on creme de menthe and stilton over Christmas will attest, too much of a good thing will make you quite sick. Battles need breathing space. We don’t need one giant face-off an episode. Rein it in.If you cast your mind back to season one, there were no epic battles whatsoever. This, admittedly, was for budgetary reasons, but working within such a rigid framework forced the show to get creative. Battles occurred off-screen. “OMG” moments were based on human drama. Plots were knotty. Backs were stabbed. Skulls were duggered. One of the best scenes of last season consisted of an old lady drinking some wine. This scheming and politicking is what made people fall in love with Thrones in the first place. Hopefully there’s still room for it among the wars, fire and widespread incest of season eight.If you cast your mind back to season one again, barely a conversation could be uttered without someone flashing their delicates at the nearest camera. At one point, Littlefinger had some exposition to get out of his system, but was in his brothel at the time, so inexplicably did so over the sound of Ros and Armeca groaning upon a chaise longue. It was gratuitous, and all a bit embarrassing. Luckily, the show has come a long way since “tits and dragons” could be hurled at it as a pejorative, and isn’t as desperate to prove its adult credentials these days. Hopefully it won’t backslide too much.Jon v the Night’s King. Cersei v Dany. Theon v Euron. An ice-zombie dragon v a non-ice-zombie dragon. A direwolf v literally anything, we don’t mind. And the Hound v the Mountain. Come on, we’ve been waiting for that since 2011. Cough up.Another criticism lobbed at more recent seasons is the show’s reluctance to mercilessly cull its cast in the laissez-faire way it did in its pomp. There hasn’t been anything as shocking as Ned’s death or the Red Wedding for what seems like an age. Not all of our main players are going to be around to the bitter end that much is certain. But the show needs to bring back the constant tension of no one being safe. What if the good guys – or as close as Thrones gets to good guys – don’t win? What if the world just, well, ends? What if Bronn murders everyone and claims the Iron Throne for himself? Give us the unexpected. It’s what we want, whether we know it or not."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c37ad225c6539d68f8f1c6d2b69a26018426f4f/0_171_4534_2721/master/4534.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eef3dc7430714293fbebd5d687b511e6","title":"south africa weird sinister apartheid mercenary saimr keith maxwell","story":"A South African militia that claimed to be behind the murder of a UN chief was involved in deadly work across the continent, its members sayKeith Maxwell, the self-declared “commodore” of the South African Institute for Maritime Research (SAIMR), liked to dress up on special occasions in the garish costume of a 18th-century admiral, with a three-cornered hat, brass buttons and a cutlass. Ordinary members of his organisation were expected to show up in crisp naval whites.Gathered together in upmarket restaurants, or the quiet of the Wemmer Pan naval base in south-central Johannesburg, they had the air of eccentric history buffs. Maxwell talked about the group’s roots in a Napoleonic-era treasure-hunting syndicate, and told outsiders it was still focused on deep-sea exploration.But appearances were deceptive. Beneath the bizarre trappings lurked a powerful mercenary outfit that members claim was entwined with the apartheid state and offered soldiers for hire across the continent.“It was clandestine operations. We were involved in coups, taking over countries for other leaders,” said Alexander Jones, who has detailed his years as an intelligence officer with the group. SAIMR’s leaders described themselves as “anti-communist” to him at the time but the group was underpinned by racism, he said. “We were trying to retain the white supremacy on the African continent.”And among its leaders’ most dramatic claims was that it was behind the mysterious 1961 plane crash that killed UN secretary general Dag Hammarskjöld and 15 other people.Last week the Observer revealed evidence linking an RAF veteran, Jan van Risseghem, to the tragedy. Now new documents and eyewitness accounts shed light on the alleged role of SAIMR, which claimed responsibility for the crash in secret papers and its own recruitment drives.It is not clear if Van Risseghem, who told a friend he had shot down Hammarskjöld’s plane without knowing who was on board, had any ties to the group. Any command could have come through an intermediary.But Jones was clear that SAIMR liked to claim ultimate responsibility for killing the UN chief. Photos of the crash site and wreckage, with purported members of the group standing nearby, featured in a presentation made to potential members when he joined three decades ago, he said.“They didn’t tell us at that point in time that it was Hammarskjöld they just said that they had taken out a very high-profile political opponent,” Jones told filmmakers investigating the crash.Maxwell himself apparently also claimed SAIMR had brought down the plane, in a handwritten memoir about the group that ended up with the family of an SAIMR veteran.Hammarskjöld’s death came amid a post-colonial race for resources in Africa. A champion of decolonisation, he made powerful enemies with his support for newly independent states and opposition to white minority rule.On his final flight, he was heading for a secret meeting to try to broker peace in recently independent Congo. The country was on the brink of collapse after its Katanga province – key to national wealth because it held most of the country’s rich mineral deposits – declared independence. Western mining interests backed the rebels.Jones claims he answered a SAIMR advertisement in a South African newspaper three decades ago and served for several years. He decided to speak out because he felt he needed closure and because young South Africans should know the truth.“Anybody that resisted any white form of manipulation on the African continent, SAIMR was prepared to go and quell those for a price,” Jones said. “And that is one thing that Dag Hammarskjöld was totally against. He wanted every country for the people of that country. He was killed because he was going to change the way that Africa dealt with the rest of the world financially, and he was a threat.”Jones was tracked down by the makers of a new documentary, Cold Case Hammarskjöld, who were looking into SAIMR because of documents handed to South Africa’s truth and reconciliation commission by the country’s National Intelligence Agency two decades ago.Unveiled at a press conference by the commission chair, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, they purported to detail how SAIMR had masterminded the crash in coordination with UK and US intelligence services. Investigators were never able to examine the papers, though, because soon after they were returned to the archives, and the South African authorities have been unable or unwilling to retrieve the originals. The United Nations, which has reopened its investigation into Hammarskjöld’s death, has criticised South Africa for its lack of cooperation in finding the file.Investigators have been working from poor quality photocopies of just eight documents, and for years there were questions about whether SAIMR even existed. In the UK, the Foreign Office suggested the papers were hoaxes planted by Soviet agents in a disinformation campaign, and added that British spies “do not go around bumping people off”.But South Africa was a known recruiting ground for mercenaries who fought in coups and conflicts across much of Africa over the second half of the last century, from Congo and Sierra Leone to Angola and Mozambique.And over the years growing evidence of SAIMR as a real, and dangerous, entity has emerged.Investigative journalist De Wet Potgieter interviewed Maxwell for an article in the 1990s. He took the only known picture of the “commodore”, and also collected a cache of papers from Maxwell.Those papers included a section of his autobiography and purported lists of recruits for several operations, which the filmmakers used to track down former members. They called dozens, but only two agreed to talk.Clive Jansen van Vuuren said he spent two or three months training with the group, which he thought had ties to the security forces. “I know it’s linked to the intelligence bureau of South Africa, but we were never given specifics,” he said.He had kept a certificate that names him as a petty officer and carries the same slightly bizarre emblem as all other SAIMR papers – the figurehead of the British ship the Cutty Sark. But he said he never went on operations.Jones claims to have had a more senior role, over a much longer period, and describes the group as a powerful militia. “SAIMR was not a Mickey Mouse organisation. We were not just a group of guys that got together in the weekend and decided to go do some military exercises and stuff. That was a living, breathing body,” he said.He was recruited as an intelligence officer, after serving in a similar position with the South African armed forces, and participated in several operations. “I was definitely in the frontline: operational frontline, hand-to-hand frontline, fighting frontline. Leading operations, if you want to call it that.” Asked by filmmakers if he had killed people himself, he said “yes”.Jones says he left SAIMR shortly before the advent of majority rule, and destroyed all evidence of his membership.Maxwell commanded SAIMR the whole time Jones served. A strange character, charismatic and idiosyncratic, he wore naval whites at all times unless he was in his admiral’s uniform, van Vuuren, Jones and Potgieter remember. But he was also extremely dangerous. “If he didn’t like you, and if you posed a threat, he would take you out,” Jones said.The penchant for dressing up was confirmed by a doctor, Claude Newbury, who met him through anti-abortion advocacy. He told the filmmakers Maxwell invited him to join SAIMR, describing it as a group focused mostly on hunting for lost treasure. At a private dinner, they had something “a little bit like a ceremony – he had dressed up like an admiral in the British navy from 250 years ago, with a tricorn hat, and a cutlass, and a naval uniform with lots of buttons.”He also confirmed that Maxwell was involved in violence in South Africa, forcing a doctor who was performing abortions to leave the country.“He went down and visited this Dutch abortionist and said to him, you are not welcome here, and killing of babies is an unacceptable pastime, and for the sake of your health I advise you go back to the Netherlands. Which apparently the chap did.”South Africa’s former head of military intelligence, Tienie Groenewald, appears in some of Maxwell’s papers. In an interview recorded before his death in 2015, he claimed he had never heard of SAIMR but remembered meeting the “commodore”.He described Maxwell as an intelligence operative with suspected links to foreign spies, who wanted to meet him in the dying days of apartheid to discuss an armed uprising to block the advent of democratic rule. Maxwell offered both men and arms, claiming “he had resources, to use violence, and to supply weapons, and so on and so forth”.Although Groenewald said he declined the offer, he described Maxwell as the credible leader of a mercenary group. “He appeared to be someone who was in authority … He obviously had a background in intelligence,” he told the filmmakers. “I couldn’t prove it but I was convinced that he was financed and directed by MI6.”Groenewald, who had served as air attache at the South African embassy in London, added: “After spending three and a half years in Britain, you get to know some people involved in the intelligence field. And certain of the names which are mentioned in our discussions were familiar to him.”Maxwell died in 2006, but a lurid account of his life and SAIMR ended up with relatives of an ex-recruit, who shared them with the filmmakers. The handwriting matches other documents written by Maxwell and its authenticity has been attested to by Jones. Maxwell had already handed a few dozen pages of a memoir to Potgieter around 1990, and they were repeated in the new cache, but it also included over 100 pages of new material.Some sections on SAIMR included episodes that he may not have personally witnessed – by his own account he did not join the group until 1964 – and there are some names and details are altered. Still, the episodes are described vividly, from the perspective of an eyewitness.And one details the alleged plot to bring down Hammarskjöld – an account which matches the plan laid out in the papers revealed by Tutu. “This operation has to be arranged as an accident or a heart attack,” the commodore of the time tells his team. “Without any pathologist throwing a ner in the works and making Dag and his colleagues into martyrs.” He asks for three workable plans to take out the UN chief.Maxwell does not say what these were, but details a technician loading a bomb into the wheel well of Hammarskjöld’s plane in the Congolese capital Léopoldville (now Kinshasa) with a beating heart, and his frustration at watching it take off without the bomb exploding.The memoir switches back to SAIMR’s planners, sitting round a table later that evening, disappointed by the failure of the bomb. But according to the truth and reconciliation commission’s papers, SAIMR then dispatched an “eagle” to target Hammarskjöld.In Maxwell’s account, just as the commodore tells them to get some rest, there is a knock at the door. “A lieutenant entered, saluted and handed a slip of paper to the commodore. ‘What’s this? Oh my God, it worked’.”Göran Björkdahl and Calla Wahlquist contributed reporting"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a15fd3e6457a0ad2ed28442ed57e1f68aae59665/31_0_922_553/master/922.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=807c1bd05c1b4ba3587333f60c8cf5fa","title":"spice girls comic relief tshirts made bangladesh factory paying staff 35p an hour","story":"Workers producing tops sold to raise money for Comic Relief receive far below a living wageSpice Girls T-shirts sold to raise money for Comic Relief’s “gender justice” campaign were made at a factory in Bangladesh where women earn the equivalent of 35p an hour during shifts in which they claim to be verbally abused and harassed, a  investigation has found.The charity tops, bearing the message “#IWannaBeASpiceGirl”, were produced by mostly female machinists who said they were forced to work up to 16 hours a day and called “daughters of prostitutes” by managers for not hitting targets.Money raised from sales of the £19.40 T-shirts will be donated to Comic Relief’s fund to help “champion equality for women”. The charity is due to receive £11.60 for each of the T-shirts, which were commissioned and designed by the band, but said it has yet to be given any money.Announcing the partnership, the Spice Girls said the cause was important to them because “equality and the movement of people power have always been at the heart of the band”.But one of the machinists at the factory that produced the garments – modelled on social media by the TV presenter Holly Willoughby, the singers Sam Smith and Jessie J, and the Olympian Jessica Ennis-Hill – said: “We don’t get paid enough and we work in inhuman conditions.”A spokesman for the Spice Girls said they were “deeply shocked and appalled” and would personally fund an investigation into the factory’s working conditions. Comic Relief said the charity was “shocked and concerned”.Both said they had checked the ethical sourcing credentials of Represent, the online retailer commissioned by the Spice Girls to make the T-shirts, but it had subsequently changed manufacturer without their knowledge. Represent said it took “full responsibility” and would refund customers on request. The band said Represent should donate profits to “campaigns with the intention to end such injustices”.The company behind the factory that made the T-shirts, Interstoff Apparels, said the findings would be investigated but were “simply not true”. However, a catalogue of evidence about conditions faced by the employees was uncovered, including allegations that:The revelations shine a light on the risks of complex supply chains and will add to longstanding concerns over conditions at manufacturers of garments sold at considerable markups by British retailers.Saying the conditions appeared to be “far beyond the normal illegalities” at factories in Bangladesh, Dominique Muller, the policy director at the campaign group Labour Behind the Label, added: “It is absolutely essential that celebrities, charities and brands ensure that their goods are made in factories which pay a decent wage and provide decent work.”The Spice Girls are “deeply shocked and appalled” by the ’s findings, according to a spokesman for the band, who said they found it “heartbreaking to hear about the treatment that these women receive”. The band had sought assurances from Represent, the online retailer that sold the T-shirts, that the garments would be ethically made, and said the manufacturer was changed without their knowledge.The band pledged to personally fund an investigation into the factory’s working conditions and demanded Represent donate profits to “campaigns with the intention to end such injustices”.A Comic Relief spokesman said the charity was “shocked and concerned” and had also checked the ethical sourcing credentials of the supplier, which was then changed without its knowledge. The charity was due to receive approximately £11.60 for each £19.40 T-shirt sold but had yet to be given any money, the spokesman added.\u0026nbspRepresent said it would refund customers on request, calling the reported conditions at the factory “appalling and unacceptable”.A spokesman said: “Represent has strict ethical sourcing standards for all of our manufacturers, and we had felt confident printing on blank shirts from StanleyStella for this campaign due to the brand’s strong reputation and leadership within the Fair Wear Foundation.“To clarify, Comic Relief and Spice Girls did everything in their power to ensure ethical sourcing, and we take full responsibility for the choice of StanleyStella in this campaign, and confirm that this is something that we didn’t bring to the attention of Spice Girls or Comic Relief.”The factory\u0027s co-owner Shahriar Alam, a Bangladeshi foreign affairs minister, said he did not think it was “right from a journalistic point of view to add my name to this story”. He admitted being a part-owner and co-founder of the company behind the factory, Interstoff, but said he resigned from the board five years ago.Interstoff Apparels\u0027 director, Naimul Bashar Chowdhury, confirmed the factory produced blank T-shirts for StanleyStella. He said Alam was “a mere shareholder of the company” and was not involved in the management of the business.He said the company would investigate the ’s findings but also described them as “simply not true”, adding that Interstoff has a “zero-tolerance policy on harassment and use of any slangs or abusive language”. However, he admitted there had been “single incidents” in the “long past where verbal abuse have resulted to employee dismissal”.He said no complaints had been received about excessive targets and the company adhered to the government’s legal minimum wages. It has a “participation committee” elected by workers to voice complaints, he said, adding that the factory is regularly audited.“The living wage is a debatable and subjective issue we for ourselves can say our basic pay is as per the local law and we have over that different performance-based financial incentives,” Chowdhury added.He pointed out the company employs 80 disabled workers, staff are trained about harassment and abuse, and a medical centre at the factory provides healthcare. Pregnant workers are given monthly checkups, Chowdhury said.Bruno Van Sieleghem, the sustainability manager at StanleyStella, said the brand was investigating the findings and “strongly committed to help this country and his workers to improve their welfare”. The Fair Wear Foundation, a organisation funded by brands that works to improve standards, audits Interstoff every three years, he said, adding that the company\u0027s team is “closely monitoring” FWF’s “corrective action plan”.He said StanleyStella was aware that machinists at Interstoff work overtime until 9pm, but not that they stayed on until midnight. He said the brand had received no reports about employees complaining of harassment at the factory.He said the brand, which received approximately €5 (£4.40) for each T-shirt, was committed to improving standards for garment workers in Bangladesh, but admitted it used factories in the country because they offer a “competitive price”. The T-shirts were printed by a company in the Czech Republic, Van Sieleghem added.FWF said it inspected the factory in December, interviewing 30 workers off-site. The organisation said some “non-compliances” were discovered, but the interviews “did not reflect the allegations of harassment in the factory”. However, the foundation acknowledged that this “does not mean this did not happen”.It described the hours at the factory as “excessive”, but FWF said it found workers are “free to refuse overtime”. It said it supported staff being paid a living wage.The factory was employed to produce the T-shirts by the Belgian brand StanleyStella, which claimed to closely monitor operations. But Muller warned: “The evidence coming out of this factory clearly shows the failure of auditing and current brand monitoring. StanleyStella claim to have monitored all their Bangladesh factories, and yet the evidence shows gross violations of labour laws and human rights. Brands must step up their game.”Bruno Van Sieleghem, the sustainability manager at StanleyStella, said the company was investigating the findings and remained “strongly committed to help this country and workers to improve their welfare”.The T-shirts were produced at Interstoff’s factory in Gazipur, about three hours’ drive from the capital, Dhaka. The company is co-owned by Shahriar Alam, a Bangladeshi foreign affairs minister, and makes garments for a number of British retailers. Interstoff exported £4.3m of goods and made a £2m pre-tax profit in 2014-15, according to accounts filed with Companies House in the UK. In 2013-14, it made a £2.5m pre-tax profit.Alam, whose government has been accused of cracking down on free speech by arresting reporters, said he did not think it was “right from a journalistic point of view to add my name to this story”. He admitted being a part-owner and co-founder of Interstoff, but said he resigned from the board five years ago. Interstoff said he was not involved in the management of the business.A campaigner in Bangladesh, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals from the government, said: “The women who are producing these clothes are getting poverty wages. They don’t have a dignified job. What kind of gender justice is that?”According to the Asia Floor Wage Alliance, a global coalition of trade unions, workers’ groups and human rights organisations, the monthly living wage for Bangladesh in 2017 was 37,661Tk. Another report, produced by academics for ISEAL, a non-profit group, set the living wage for Gazipur at 13,630Tk in 2016. In 2014, Comic Relief pledged to pay all its employees a living wage.But workers in Gazipur, whose ID passes were seen by the , face a different reality.Speaking on condition of anonymity, a machinist who has worked at the factory for more than five years and earned 9,080Tk a month, including an attendance bonus, said: “We hardly get anything. The wages we get are very minimum. It’s barely enough to survive.”• Machinists at the Interstoff factory in Gazipur stitch the garments together for about 35p an hour.• The T-shirts are shipped to the Czech Republic, where another company prints the #IWannaBeASpiceGirl slogan.• The Belgian brand StanleyStella, which oversees the production process, receives approximately €5 (£4.40) for each T-shirt from the US crowdselling platform Represent.• The Spice Girls, who have announced that proceeds from the T-shirts will go to Comic Relief, appear on The Jonathan Ross Show in November, with the host proudly holding up one of the garments to the camera.• Represent, which had been commissioned by the Spice Girls to get the T-shirts made, puts them on sale online for £19.40 each plus postage and packaging.• Comic Relief said about £11.60 from the sale of each T-shirt was given to the charity.The machinist, who has neck problems from being hunched over a sewing machine, struggles to get by and provide for her seven-year-old son.“Inside the production manager’s office, they use very bad, abusive language, like ‘this isn’t your father’s factory’, ‘the door is wide open, leave if you can’t meet the production goals’,” she said.“Sometimes they use more obscene language like ‘khankir baccha’ (daughter of a prostitute), and many more that I can’t even say.“Sometimes many female workers can’t bear the insults and pressure from the management, and they quit. Even last month, a few of my colleagues left because they faced very bad behaviour and they were shattered.”Machinists at the factory, which employs about 4,000 people, work from 8am until 5pm six days a week, including an hour’s paid lunch break a day, but are regularly forced to do overtime, workers claim.The overtime is understood to be paid at a higher rate to regular shifts. The mother-of-one, who lives in a small room with her husband and child, said: “If the management wants us to do overtime then we don’t have any other choice but to do it.”She estimated she has to work overtime in the evenings for half the days in the month. Last year, the machinist added, a colleague who was three months’ pregnant quit after she was forced by management to work until midnight despite vomiting.She also claimed employees often faint in the heat of the factory, while many experience neck and back problems.Another machinist, who has worked for Interstoff since 2013, said she was forced to take out loans to get by.The single mother-of-two earns 8,450Tk a month including an attendance bonus. She recently had to borrow 20,000Tk from her brother.“The amount I get paid is not enough at all. You see I am the only breadwinner of the family. I singlehandedly have to pay for my daughter’s education and also have to meet the expenses of the family as well,” she said.“Our supervisor is very intimidating and scary. We always try avoiding any confrontation with him we don’t want to face him. They always set the target production so high that we practically could never hit them. I don’t remember when was the last time we hit the target goal.”In 2013, 1,134 people died when the Rana Plaza building collapsed due to structural failures.Additional reporting by Redwan Ahmed"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e9cf3cf00593421afacbcea395e0d8fbfcd9ee9/0_607_3657_2193/master/3657.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9bd805ed8d6303522640f2a67600089","title":"israeli military strikes iranian targets inside syria","story":"Damascus rocked by explosions on second night of attacks, reportedly killing 11Israel has struck several targets in Syria as part of its increasingly open assault on Iran’s presence in the country, shaking the night sky over Damascus with an hour of loud explosions in a second consecutive night of military action.Damascus did not say what damage or casualties resulted from the strikes, but a war monitor said 11 people were killed, while Syria’s ally Russia said four Syrian soldiers died.The threat of direct confrontation between Israel and Iran has long simmered in Syria, where the Iranian military built a presence early in the civil war to help Bashar al-Assad fight Sunni Muslim rebels seeking to oust him.Israel, regarding Iran as most dangerous enemy, has repeatedly attacked Iranian targets in Syria and those of allied militia, including Lebanon’s Hezbollah, without claiming responsibility for the attacks.But with an election approaching, and with the US vowing more action on Iran, Israel’s government has lifted the lid on strikes that it would previously have preferred to keep quiet, and has also taken a tougher stance towards Hezbollah on the border with Lebanon.It blamed Iran for a rocket attack on Sunday.In Tehran, the air force chief, Brig Gen Aziz Nasirzadeh, said Iran was “fully ready and impatient to confront the Zionist regime and eliminate it from the Earth”, according to the Young Journalists Club, a website supervised by Iranian state television.Assad has said Iranian forces are welcome to stay in Syria after years of military victories brought most of the country back under his control, though two large enclaves are still held by other forces.His other main ally, Russia, worried about the consequences of Israeli strikes on the wider pursuit of a war that is entering its ninth year, has provided Syria with air defence systems.The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who is hoping to win a fifth term in elections on 9 April, last week told his cabinet Israel had carried out “hundreds” of attacks over recent years to curtail Iran and Hezbollah.“We have a permanent policy, to strike at the Iranian entrenchment in Syria and hurt whoever tries to hurt us,” he said on Sunday.In a highly publicised operation last month, the Israeli military uncovered and destroyed cross-border tunnels from Lebanon that it said were dug by Hezbollah to launch attacks during any future war between them.The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has vowed to expel “every last Iranian boot” from Syria and a senior US official in Lebanon last week criticised Hezbollah over the tunnels.Israel last fought a war with Hezbollah, on Lebanese soil, in 2006. It fears Hezbollah has used its role fighting alongside Iran and Assad in Syria to bolster its military capabilities, including developing an arsenal of rockets aimed at Israel.Tensions have also risen with Israel’s construction of a frontier barrier that Lebanon says passes through its territory along the contested border.The Israeli military said its fighter jets had attacked Iranian targets early on Monday, including munitions stores, a position in the Damascus International airport, an intelligence site and a military training camp.Its jets targeted Syrian defence batteries after coming under fire, the Israeli military said. Russia said four Syrian soldiers were killed and six wounded. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based war monitor, said 11 people had been killed.Russian-supplied Syrian air defences had destroyed more than 30 cruise missiles and guided bombs, Russia’s defence ministry said, according to the RIA news agency.Syrian state media, citing a military source, said the country had endured an intense attack through consecutive waves of guided missiles but had destroyed most “hostile targets”.Israel’s target was the Iranian Quds Force, a special unit in charge of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps overseas operations, the Israeli military said.It followed a previous night of cross-border fire, which Israel said began when Iranian troops fired an Iranian-made surface-to-surface missile from an area near Damascus at a packed ski resort in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.Iran has yet to respond to the accusation.The Israeli military spokesman Lt Col Jonathan Conricus said the area it was fired from was “an area we were promised the Iranians would not be present in”, in an apparent allusion to Russian reassurances to Israel.Syria said it was Israel that had attacked and its own air defences that had repelled the assault."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de0017320425c0968e662c49d904ed3ff5d077f6/426_492_2786_1672/master/2786.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7052e2343d60847c6dd95c68dbf18828","title":"monday briefing may to present brexit plan b","story":"This is Alison Rourke with today’s briefing as Theresa May prepares to set out her Brexit Plan B.The PM is expected to reject calls for a cross-party consensus on Brexit when she addresses parliament today and instead back new diplomatic efforts in Brussels to renegotiate the Irish backstop.

He also says he expects to “hear from God through other people with words of knowledge or prophecies – some of which I am unsure about, others I can sense there being something of the spirit of God”. “Words of knowledge” and “prophecies” are believed to be revelations from God about people or future events. Both are common in Pentecostal and “charismatic” evangelical churches.Lunar eclipse – Stargazers in parts of Britain have been treated to the spectacular sight of the super blood wolf moon. One  reader in Stratford-upon-Avon wrote: “Clouds have rolled back and a great view of the eclipse.” Cloudy skies over parts of London obscured the event for others. The rare celestial event takes places when moon is positioned slightly closer to earth than normal, and appears slightly bigger and brighter than normal. At the same time, the moon gave off a coppery red glow as it slipped into Earth’s shadow.

In Close’s powerful speech when she won a Golden Globe for the role, she urged women “to find personal fulfilment”. “I’ve been floored by the response,” she says. “People are coming up to me in airports to talk about my speech.”In The Wife, the opening sex scene was the first thing they shot. “We arrived on set in our jammies,” she chuckled. Asked if it feels revolutionary to see two actors in their 70s having drowsy, vocal, pleasurably filthy sex together, she agrees: “It’s one of the great myths that you lose your sexuality as you get older.” Right now, she believes she is in her prime. “I feel as free and as creative, as sexual and as eager as I ever have.

Each year, about 60,000 climbers and guides visit the Chinese north side of the mountain, which China refers to by its Tibetan name, Mount Qomolangma.China has set up stations to sort, recycle and break down rubbish from the mountain, which includes cans, plastic bags, stove equipment, tents and oxygen tanks.On the Nepalese side, organisers of mountaineering expeditions have begun sending large waste bags with climbers during the spring climbing season to collect refuse that can be winched by helicopters back to base camp.Several people die on Everest each year, often in the “death zone” above 8,000 metres, where the air is too thin to sustain human life.In 2017, 648 people reached the summit of Everest, including 202 from the north side, according to the nonprofit body Himalayan Database. Six people were confirmed to have died on the mountain that year, one of them on the north side."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6297e9d09132327a741fe8e34bff7403087bf7d/229_52_3732_2240/master/3732.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c020679f93bc71478d2d5b509ac2d012","title":"philippines muslims vote in referendum on new autonomous region","story":"Vote seeks to solve half a century of unrest and counter new wave of extremist attacksMuslims in the southern Philippines are voting in a referendum on the proposed creation of an autonomous region that the government hopes will end nearly half a century of unrest and prevent a new wave of attacks by Islamic State-inspired militants.The vote caps a tumultuous peace effort by the government in Manila and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), the main rebel group, to seal a deal signed in 2014 but which had languished in the Philippine congress until it was finally approved last year.Bloodshed on Mindanao island, including the siege of Marawi city by Isis-linked militants in 2017, and other bombings and attacks in the south, threatened to derail it.“This is the first time I have voted in an election,” 70-year-old Murad Ebrahim, the chairman of the MILF, said on Monday as he showed off his ink-stained finger. “This solidifies the transformation from armed struggle to democratic politics.”Under the deal for Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), the rebels gave up their goal of an independent state in exchange for broad autonomy. Their 30,000-40,000 fighters are to be demobilised, ending a decades-long separatist rebellion that has killed more than 100,000 people.Murad was confident of a landslide victory for autonomy in most areas. “The Bangsamoro Organic Law will be ratified and the Bangsamoro government will be established,” he said.More than 2m ballots have been printed and a result is expected by Friday. The president, Rodrigo Duterte, last week urged voters to approve the plan and show they wanted peace, development and a local leadership that “truly represents and understand the needs of the Muslim people”.Centuries of conquest, first by Spanish and American colonial forces followed by Filipino Christian settlers, have gradually turned Muslims into a minority group in Mindanao, triggering conflict over land, resources and the sharing of political power.Uprisings seeking self-rule have been brutally suppressed, feeding resentment. The peace process that began in 1997 has been disrupted through the years by violent episodes, including an all-out war between the military and the MILF in 2001.Regional conflict escalated in in May 2017 when Isis militants took control of the Mindanao city of Marawi. It took five months for the Philippine army, backed by US and Australian surveillance aircraft, to quash the militants in a conflict that left 1,200 people, mostly Islamic fighters, dead and the city in ruins.Carlito Galvez Jr, the former chief of staff of the armed forces, said the creation of the Muslim region would be an important antidote to extremism in the region.“Beyond the economic and other fiscal incentives the law aims to provide, the BOL is, first and foremost, a document of peace,” said Galvez Jr, who will oversee the decommissioning of the rebel forces.“The BOL will ensure that those who use armed violence will become irrelevant because the law will provide people with greater incentive to choose the path of peace and development,” he said.He said the creation of the region would also facilitate better cooperation between the military, police, and the rebels in addressing other armed groups.Despite the fall of Marawi, the threat of Islamic extremism remains a major concern in Mindanao.  reported last year that an estimated 40 to 100 foreign fighters travelled to Mindanao to provide training and galvanise Isis support. This was reiterated in a document submitted to the Philippine supreme court this week that states that more than 200 villages in Mindanao are under threat from Isis-inspired groups who have the support of a growing number of foreign fighters.If approved, the new region of Bangsamoro will replace an existing poverty-racked autonomous region with a larger, better-funded and more powerful entity. An annual grant, estimated at $1.3bn (£1bn), is to be set aside to bolster development.Another vote is scheduled on 6 February for additional areas that might want to join the new Muslim region.

Photograph: Hannah McKayThe coming week sees further efforts to achieve a cross-party consensus on Brexit in London, while Tánaiste Simon Coveney travels to Brussels for a series of meetings, including with Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator.After the thumping defeat in the House of Commons last week for the Brexit withdrawal agreement, Theresa May is expected to table a neutral motion in the House of Commons on Monday and give a statement on her next moves.Groups of MPs will table amendments, with one calling for the article 50 negotiating period to be extended, and others seeking to give MPs the power to put forward their own Brexit plans.At the centre of debate, as usual, is the backstop, the insurance clause that seeks to avoid a hard border in Ireland if the EU and UK cannot agree a post-Brexit trading relationship. In effect, the backstop would see the EU and UK maintain a common customs territory, with add-ons – in both customs and regulations – for Northern Ireland to keep the Border open.With the House of Commons still unable to decide what it finds acceptable, the risk of a crash-out Brexit at the end of March grows. As do calls for the Government to give ground on the backstop.One proposal repeatedly floated in London is for the backstop to be time-limited for a number of years if it is ever invoked.However, sources in Dublin repeatedly insist there will be no change to the backstop as set out in the withdrawal agreement struck between the EU and the UK government last November. The message is being delivered in public and in private from both Dublin and Brussels to London.That message was reflected in language used by both Philip Hammond, the UK chancellor, and Keir Starmer, the Labour Brexit spokesman, in recent days.Hammond has been in consistent contact with Government figures and Coveney is known to keep lines of communication open to Starmer.In a recorded conference call held last week with British business leaders, and leaked to the Daily , Hammond said: “Very clearly removing the Irish backstop arrangements cannot be negotiated.”Speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, Starmer also acknowledged for the first time that the backstop was needed for a deal.“At this stage, any deal probably does require a backstop and we’ve got to recognise that,” he said. “There are problems with this backstop and we have got to recognise that but, because we are in this stage of the exercise, nearly two years in, the chances now of a deal that doesn’t have a backstop are very, very slim.”Yet Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Coveney and others across the EU say that if the UK is to change its red lines, they will reciprocate.The not-too-subtle hint is that this could be done by a move from London to a much closer post-Brexit relationship between the EU and UK, ie permanent British membership of the single market and customs union. Another British red line is that Northern Ireland must not be in a different customs territory to the rest of the UK, but this is extremely unlikely to change.The final Brexit deal contained two elements: the 485-page, legally binding withdrawal agreement and the accompanying, looser, political declaration sketching out the post-Brexit relationship between the EU and UK.The political declaration was designed to be a document that could be rewritten to reflect changing priorities from London.One Dublin source said that a change in London would most likely mean an adjustment of the political declaration “or perhaps some addition to it, addendum etc”. The withdrawal agreement “is seen as a settled text by EU side and which will still be needed, including the backstop”, the source said.While some in Dublin are unwilling to spell out how the EU could formally reciprocate if London moves, the only thing – given the insistence on the withdrawal agreement and backstop remaining untouched – that can be offered is a new wording in the political declaration.It could be rewritten to give concrete expression to the view that a much softer Brexit means the backstop would never be invoked. But the backstop would remain in place in the legally binding withdrawal agreement, even if it is never used.This scenario requires the House of Commons to support the so-called “Norway-plus” post-Brexit relationship, which would mean May accepting the free movement of people – and breaching her red line of restricting immigration.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Sarah SilbigerNew York TimesAfter I’d been writing a column for a few years, a male boss gave me a T-shirt depicting the Furies swooping.He didn’t mean it as a compliment.The three sisters, the “infernal goddesses” of ancient mythology born from the blood shed by Uranus when he was castrated by his son, were known for relentlessly hounding men. But the Furies took vengeance on wicked men who hurt women and swore false oaths.So I took it as a compliment.The capital has suddenly been infused with the spirit of the Furies. After many false springs and discouraging backlashes, we are finally experiencing a revolutionary assertion of women’s power that is transforming Congress.Kill Bill-style, the fiery Democratic women keep coming, driven by vengeance against the wicked man in the White House with the history of hurting women and swearing false oaths.Swooping toward 2020, the moment of truth for Donald Trump that is also aptly the centennial of women’s suffrage, the women are gathering force at a giddy speed.This was not a good week to be a dude in politics.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and her girl squad – fellow freshmen lawmakers Katie Hill of California, Lauren Underwood of Illinois and Jahana Hayes of Connecticut – tracked Mitch McConnell to petition him to have a vote to reopen the government. The Senate majority leader has been trying to lie doggo as Trump thrashes after pulling the rug out from under him.It was another jangly AOC media stunt that irritated some of her colleagues but fired up the meme factory. She broadcast the scavenger hunt on Instagram with the hashtag Where’s Mitch?When AOC tweeted that a Getty photo of the women storming the halls of Congress looked like a Spice Girls album cover, Hill tweeted back her own remix of the Britpop girl-power anthem Wannabe: “I’ll tell you what I want . . . What I really really want . . . 800,000 government employees to be able to pay their bills.”AOC picked it up, tweeting another verse: “Now don’t go wasting our precious timeIf they get their act together we could be just fine.”The day before, at a nearby hotel, Bernie Sanders sneaked in through an employee entrance to listen in agonising detail to women who had worked for him in 2016, as they levelled charges – under the watchful eyes of three female facilitators – about sexism, harassment and sexual violence on his campaign. The disgusted women, fed up with Sanders’s deflections, made it clear that if he didn’t take their stories seriously, he might be sitting out 2020, an election cycle that will be shaped by the #MeToo movement.As Kirsten Gillibrand, Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris dominated 2020 talk, Beto O’Rourke tried to get out of his “funk” and reclaim his mojo as the Democrats’ main crush.But his southern border road trip and Livejournal stylings – not to mention his Instagramming of his teeth cleaning – were widely mocked as a lame odyssey of self-discovery. When asked by Washington Post reporter Jenna Johnson what we should do about immigration, O’Rourke, who represented a Texas district on the border for six years, rambled.CNN’s Nia-Malika Henderson pointed out that a woman, a parent of three – could “never, ever” get away with such a “navel-gazing, self-involved rollout” – much less “a road trip adventure to clear her head”.After three weeks of Nancy Pelosi out-trolling Trump on the government shutdown, polls showed an erosion of his base. “We are getting crushed!” Trump told his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, according to the Times.With her taunt that the president could make his state of the union address in his own office, Pelosi continued the strategy of denying the attention addict attention. With his cancellation of her trip to Afghanistan, Trump simply underscored that Pelosi has been to our war zones many times while Trump has only been to Iraq once after being shamed into it.Asked if Trump was retaliating after her threat to cancel the address, Pelosi offered the perfect sly riposte: “I don’t think the president would be that petty, do you?”With Pelosi and the legislative Spice Girls providing the contrast, with the ranks of House women depleted in the GOP and with Steve King getting his comeuppance for racist comments, the Republicans look more than ever like a 1950s mahogany-panelled, smoke-filled, bourbon-and-branch-water party.Suburban Republican women, who turned on Trump in the midterms, won’t be lured back by the news that thousands more migrant children had been separated from parents at the southern border and by images of the president beaming in to the annual march against a woman’s right to choose at the National Mall Friday. The vice-president and his wife were on stage at the mall, and Karen Pence started a new job teaching art at a Virginia Christian school that is intolerant of LGBT students and LGBT parents.Trump had no clue about how much harder his life would be with ided government. But his greatest shock will be that his election woke up the wrath of the Furies, who are unceasing until they get their man. – New York TimesRead more about the Donald Trump administration"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3765090.1548061500!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"world s richest 26 people hold same wealth as poorest 50","story":"The charity Oxfam has issued a report highlighting the increasing ide between the world\u0027s poorest and richest people.

Photograph:  Jim WatsonAFPBillionaires watched their fortunes increase by nearly $2.5 billion (€2.2 billion) per day last year, as the wealth of the world’s poorest dwindled by 11 per cent, according to an Oxfam report.The world’s 26 richest people now hold the same wealth as the poorest half of the global population, down from 43 in 2017, the charity said.Its Public Good or Private Wealth? report said the wealth of the world’s billionaires increased by $900 billion (€791 billion) in 2018, while 3.4 billion people still survive on less than $5.50 (€4.83) per day.Governments must fund better public services and reform tax policy, including tackling tax dodging, to bridge the widening equality gap, the charity said.Key recommendations from the report include delivery of universal free healthcare, an end to “under-taxation” and more policies to support women and end gender inequality.The report has been criticised by the Institute of Economic Affairs (IoEA), a right-wing think tank, which said the findings “misrepresent poverty” and Oxfam is “obsessed with the rich”.Oxfam’s director of campaigns and policy, Matthew Spencer, said: “The massive fall in the number of people living in extreme poverty is one of the greatest achievements of the past quarter of a century, but rising inequality is jeopardising further progress.“The way our economies are organised means wealth is increasingly and unfairly concentrated among a privileged few while millions of people are barely subsisting.“Women are dying for lack of decent maternity care and children are being denied an education that could be their route out of poverty.“No one should be condemned to an earlier grave or a life of illiteracy simply because they were born poor.“It doesn’t have to be this way – there is enough wealth in the world to provide everyone with a fair chance in life.“Governments should act to ensure that taxes raised from wealth and businesses paying their fair share are used to fund free, good-quality public services that can save and transform people’s lives.”Oxfam said many governments are “exacerbating” inequality through a lack of investment in public services.The report said an estimated 10,000 people die every day because of a lack of healthcare, while 262 million of the world’s children cannot attend school.Failing to tackle the problems now will make it impossible to achieve the UN’s goal of ending extreme poverty, measured as living on less than $1.25 US dollars (€1.10) per day, by 2030, according to Oxfam.It calls for measures to tackle the estimated 16.4 billion hours of unpaid care work carried out globally every day, mostly by women in poverty.The report warns: “Governments face a stark choice today — a choice between a life of dignity for all their citizens or continued extreme wealth for a tiny few.”Describing billionaires as having “more wealth than ever before”, it said the world’s richest man, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, could fund the health budget of Ethiopia with just 1 per cent of his estimated $112 billion (€98 billion) fortune.It also said the poorest 10 per cent of people in Britain now pay a higher proportion of their incomes in tax than the richest 10 per cent.Criticising the report, Kate Andrews, associate director at the IoEA, said inequality and poverty are “wholly different issues” with “radically different antidotes”.She added: “Capitalism has the best track record for lifting people out of poverty. The past few decades alone have seen hundreds of millions of people benefit.“Demonising capitalism might be a fashionable activity for the affluent but it would be a travesty, especially for the poor, if calls to overthrow it were allowed to succeed.”– PA"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

On the retailer’s website, there is an advertisement for a black tie event at Wentworth, hosted by Mark Siddle, who runs Burgundy vineyard Domaine Bertagna along with his wife Eva Reh.Tasting wines include the 2000 Vougeot Blanc, Premier Cru, which retails at around £500 for a case of six, as well as the 1999 Vosne-Romane, Les Beaux Monts, Premier Cru, which costs £1,200 for six bottles.According to The Sunday Times, Mr Songhua said the claim about his stewardship of the wine was “without merit” and that it was a “pure tactical play to put more pressure on me”.He added that, while some of the wine had been used for entertainment, most of the bottles were still in storage.This is the latest chapter in the long-running feud between Mr Songhua and Mr Ruayrungruang, who is one of Asia’s richest men with a fortune estimated at $11bn.Wentworth golf club has upped its fees despite resistance from its membersThe pair have sued and counter-sued each other over the management of Reignwood in recent years. Their relationship soured in 2016 after Reignwood proposed to cut the number of members from 4,000 to just over 800, and those invited to remain would be charged a one-off payment of £100,000 before annual fees were taken into account.Those plans were abandoned after uproar from members, but fees have since risen from £8,000 to £13,500 per year, while membership is said to have declined by 40 per cent in the past two years.Famous faces at the club include former England cricket captain Kevin Pietersen and broadcaster Sir Michael Parkinson, who has been a member for more than 25 years along with his wife, Mary.In 2016, he spoke out about changes at Wentworth, telling the  that the new owners “came in without any regard for the traditions or feelings of members of the club”.He said: “A lot of members will go elsewhere. Maybe that is what Reignwood want. Maybe they will get their car park full of Lamborghinis. It seems to be the super-rich golf clubs I have visited are soulless places used by oligarchs.”Mr Songhua alleges that Mr Ruayrungruang reneged on a series of promises to reward him for buying overseas assets for the group, and told the Financial Times: “I think Chanchai is very good at getting people to trust him and do projects for him.“But when the time comes to pay up, then he goes cool on you, and you find the deal is not what you thought you had.”When questioned about the litigation, Mr Ruayrungruang told reporters in China: “Listen, the things you are asking about, it’s like a small dog biting your pant leg. “It is not a big thing. It is a small matter.”Neither Mr Songhua nor Mr Ruayrungruang could be reached for comment.Prince Philip crash: passenger who broke wrist claims police haven\u0026#39t asked her for statement four days onWill MPs seize control of Brexit from Theresa May?

Could exchange controls be imposed one night with little warning? Fanciful? Not really.How on earth could this happen? Here is how.The first step requires a messy Brexit, an election and a Labour Party victory. Not completely out of the question I trust you will agree.Next, a hard-left dominated Labour Government begins implementing key elements of its manifesto. Nationalisation of the railways first mail services and public utilities to be determined.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialPersonal income taxes are raised various forms of wealth taxes follow.Foreign owners of UK property are targeted for additional levies. Corporate taxes are increased sharply in one form or another. Shareholders in nationalized enterprises receive newly issued Gilts (UK government bonds)\u0026nbspin exchange for their shares. Government determines the value of their shares.The consequences? UK-bound international investment ceases. UK-based businesses and iniduals move money abroad. The UK stock market tanks. Sterling plummets. UK borrowing costs rise. Inflation is forecast. Gilt prices plunge – and with it the value that shareholders in now nationalized enterprises received in forced exchange for their shares.This is what day one of a no-deal Brexit could look likeThe Prime Minister calls an emergency session of the cabinet following which he appears in front of Number 10 to announce the following: “Our country,” he explains, “is faced with a crisis. Unscrupulous businesses are transferring abroad the wealth of our Nation – monies that were earned on the backs of the average citizen. The rich who profiteered from a rigged financial system are absconding with their ill-gotten gains.Once again, the favoured few are plundering the wealth of the people who produced it.\u0026nbsp I therefore announce that effective midnight tonight all money transfers out of the United Kingdom will be subject to State control. For businesses, prior approval will be required. Violations will be severely punished. Meanwhile, inidual UK citizens will be permitted to acquire and carry foreign currency up to a prescribed maximum. These measures will remain in effect as long as is deemed necessary to meet the threat. We will give more details in the days ahead.”Reaction? Experts forecast doom, gloom and a return to the 1970s. Iniduals with short memories andor those fed up with a system seemingly skewed in favour of the elite, applaud the decisive action – with albeit concern for their European holiday travel.Meanwhile, interbank trading with UK based institutions grinds to a halt pending answers to the following questions: will the UK domiciled counterparty be able to deliver the countervalue of a trade? Will UK based banks be permitted to repay foreign interbank borrowings? Will fund redemptions by foreign nationals be honoured and transferable abroad? The Bank of England schedules an emergency meeting to discuss.So, there you have it. A few additional observations. We have been there before. Capital controls generally and exchange controls in particular were a long-time feature of both the UK and inidual European countries in the post war period. Just because the generations who oversee today’s capital flows have no personal experience with such regulation does not mean they might not one day have the pleasure.A second point is that this scenario requires that Britain first leave the EU. Why? Because many of the actions described above would run counter to EU regulation. Hence the ambivalence of many on the far left of the Labour Party to the UK’s membership in the European Union. EU membership imposes constraints on anti-capitalists as well as regulatory burdens on business. Thus it was in the run-up to the Britain’s 1973 accession to the EU that members of Labour’s left wing opposed British membership. \u0026nbspPlus ca change…Robert Jenkins is a member of the Board of Governors of CFA Institute.

It was vital for the wellbeing of the nation, she said, that more people like her, a state-educated Northerner, were able to get on, to be presented with opportunity and fulfill their ability.When it came to questions, a hand went up. Social mobility was all very well, said her interrogator, but what did she feel about the closure of the Putney branch of Marks \u0026amp Spencer? There were murmurs of approval in the room –\u0026nbspthis was a subject dear to the audience’s heart. What was particularly galling, it turned out, was not only that the southwest London suburb was losing its cherished store, but that Putney was bracketed with a host of industrial towns in the North and Midlands that were being dropped by M\u0026ampS, the once bellwether of prosperity. It was shaming, humiliating.M\u0026ampS has just announced another raft of shops earmarked to go: Ashford, Bedford, Boston, Buxton, Cwmbran, Deal, Felixstowe, Huddersfield, Hull, Junction One Antrim Outlet, Luton Arndale, Newark, Northwich, Rotherham, Sutton Coldfield and Weston-super-Mare. The one in my hometown of Barrow-in-Furness, where my parents shopped for fresh food every day, is also on the list.The 17 proposed closures are part of the clothing, homeware and food retailer’s plan to shut more than 100 stores by 2022. So far, before this round, 30 stores have closed and another eight had already been named.M\u0026ampS announces next 17 stores to close down with 1,045 jobs at riskM\u0026ampS, Debenhams and John Lewis reveal disappointing Christmas salesNot just any tattoo: M\u0026ampS fan gets chain’s logo inked on forearmMarks \u0026amp Spencer profits grow as drastic store closure plan beginsThere will be more –\u0026nbspmany in the long-run beyond the 100. M\u0026ampS now has 979 stores in the UK, of which 615 sell only food. It’s the other 364, the larger branches that carry food, clothing and homeware, that are at risk.M\u0026ampS makes 75 per cent of its profits from just 70 of its shops. That gives some idea of the agonies that lie ahead for Steve Rowe, the chief executive and his management team, as they grapple with an estate that grew in a different age, when M\u0026ampS could do no wrong, when there was only M\u0026ampS and competition was not what it is today, when shoppers did not have cars and out-of-town did not exist, when they had to journey by bus to the high street and lug their bags and online had not been invented.But deciding to shut an M\u0026ampS store is not a simple act of putting a red line through a name. Of course, it entails loss of jobs, the erasing of a presence, the scrapping of community relationships, and harm to the neighbouring retailers who feed off the M\u0026ampS. It’s much more, though. To the places affected it’s seen as signifying rejection, that somehow they are not deemed “good enough” to have an M\u0026ampS.In many of those locations, the local M\u0026ampS is the lasting symbol of a formerly buzzing town centre, a sign of its aspiration and middle-classness. Often it’s the only such name left standing or there’s still a Debenhams or a House of Fraser, but they’re not likely to be around much longer.The folk in headquarters in London, have ruled they’re not fit for M\u0026ampS. That’s how they see it, that’s how the Putney people saw it.Closing an M\u0026ampS is to deal a devastating punch. There are other chains that have pulled down the shutters and in some cases vanished completely. M\u0026ampS, however, was still there, the icon that had catered for families for decades. While there was an M\u0026ampS there was a high street that looked recognisably like the high street of yesteryear there remained hope as well of a bustling, rich future. Not now.Of Marks \u0026amp Spencer’s profit comes from just 70 of its storesWhich is why, when an M\u0026ampS goes, all hell breaks loose. The MP gets involved, as do the council, local media, retail and business groups, community action campaigners, and inidual customers. The latter regard M\u0026ampS as theirs. To shut a shop is to drop them inidually.It’s not the same as a Boots, New Look, Topshop, WH Smith –\u0026nbsppick the departure of any brand, possibly with the exception of House of Fraser, and they do not have the same impact.An M\u0026ampS closure has to be handled sensitively. It’s not a case of issuing a bland statement from a regional director, and saying there will be a new food store opening nearby. This is what happened in Barrow’s case, where the town was told an M\u0026ampS Foodhall was coming to Ulverston seven miles away. Good for Ulverston, but of little compensation to the inhabitants of Barrow. It’s about researching how much the people understand about the reasons for closure, what would make up for their loss, discovering the language that helps them feel more positively, what could be done to soften the blow, to make them feel they were not being dumped (a much smaller Foodhall in Barrow, maybe, with click \u0026amp collect for online clothing and homeward purchases, or managing the property portfolio more imaginatively –\u0026nbspwhatever might be practical). And it’s about joining up those findings with discussions with the MP, council, local media and the rest.That’s not to be critical of M\u0026ampS. The retailer, more than any other, is caught in the bricks and mortar versus online battle. It’s not business in isolation, it’s capitalism with a conscience, a CEO and colleagues who must be politicians, diplomats, social workers, as much as naked pursuers of a idend.It’s an extremely current, modern position to hold. Gone are the days when businesses merely had to keep their shareholders sweet. Today, it’s about satisfying a whole gamut of stakeholders, who, thanks to the internet, are in easy receipt of information and have an instant, fierce voice. M\u0026ampS may be on troubled times but those times are shared by others. In that sense it remains very much the bellwether.

No one should be condemned to an earlier grave or a life of illiteracy simply because they were born poor,” said Mr Spencer.Economists generally agree that the level of global inequality is large and many agree with Oxfam that redistributive wealth taxes are warranted.But many analysts also stress that in recent decades the share of the world population living in poverty – surviving on less than $2 a day – has fallen sharply from 44 per cent in 1980 to 9.6 per cent in 2015 according to World Bank data.This is largely due to economic growth in large poor countries such as China and India as they have opened themselves up to global commerce.Branko Milanovic, the pre-eminent researcher on global income inequality, has estimated that international income inequality (as opposed to wealth inequality) fell between 1988 and 2008 for the first time since the Industrial Revolution.The Credit Suisse analysis upon which Oxfam bases its estimate of the fortunes of the bottom 50 per cent of the world population also shows a slightly different story about the trend in the wealth share of those at the top.It found that the share of wealth of the top 1 per cent declined slightly in 2018, from 47.5 per cent to 47.2 per cent.“While it is too early to say that wealth inequality is now on a downward trend, the prevailing evidence suggests it may well have levelled out, albeit at a very high level,” Credit Suisse’s team wrote.Estimating the wealth of those at the very top of the wealth pyramid – not the top 1 per cent but the highest 0.1 per cent, 0.01 per cent and beyond – is difficult because the super-rich do not tend to participate in the surveys that national statisticians use to estimate the broad distribution of wealth.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Protesters take part in a demonstration near the Greek Parliament against the agreement with Skopje to rename neighbouring country Macedonia as the Republic of North Macedonia, in Athens.

Since March last year the MSCI Index of world shares has fallen by around 5 per cent, which will likely have dented the net worth of many dollar billionaires.An\u0026nbspinidual would need\u0026nbspnet assets of $4,210 (£3,300) to be among the wealthiest half of the world population in mid-2018, according to Credit Suisse, meaning the majority of people in the UK would be in this category.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Chief among them is an activity known as credential stuffing, where the logins are plugged into a wide variety of services in a fast and automated way, in the hope of finding websites where people have re-used the stolen emails and passwords.Security experts advise people to use different passwords and change them regularly, so that stolen passwords cannot be used.

On first glance, the clan at its centre are just like any other, but their impulsive decision to take in a missing girl begins a series of rug-pulls you wouldn’t expect from a film such as this. A complex heartbreaker, albeit one that starts out looking like the more modest family dramas Kore-eda is known for.  “We knew there was a bad version of this movie that could exist,” said Game Night’s co-director John Francis Daley (the kid from Freaks and Geeks). This certainly isn’t it. Starring Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams as a competitive married couple who mistake an actual kidnapping for a particularly immersive role play game, Game Night is snappy, witty and fully committed to its brilliant, tonally unsettling conceit.  315 13. Isle of DogsAny Wes Anderson film is likely to be offbeat, fastidiously stylish and shot through with the auteur\u0027s understated drollery. Isle of Dogs is no different. A stop-motion story of abandoned canines taking on a corrupt human government, it\u0027s set in a futuristic Japan and deals with some pretty heavy themes (fascism, ethnic cleansing). Funny and full of heart.Peter Jackson’s First World War documentary is a remarkable step-forward for historical filmmaking. The Lord of the Rings director breathes new life into black and white archive footage from the Imperial War Museum, digitally restoring and smoothing the grainy source material before adding colour and sound. The result is a stunning cinematic experience that vividly brings the past into the present. By using the voices of veteran British soldiers interviewed about their experiences in the trenches, Jackson also includes a fascinating narrative that’s both gripping and informative. A wonderfully apt way to mark the centenary of the Great War. Nobody knew if Paul Schrader still had it in him to make a film as angry or as barbed as First Reformed. There is the same raw power here as found in his earlier features about tormented loners. Cinephiles will delight in the (sometimes a little self-conscious) references to Ingmar Bergman and Andrei Tarkovsky, but you can’t help but relish the intensity and intelligence in Ethan Hawke’s performance as the tormented, guilt-ridden priest.There were two Marvel films released this year, one of which – Avengers Infinity War – was an over-crowded, if ambitious, sequel. The other was a landmark film – not just for Marvel, but for cinema. Black Panther was fit to bursting with selling points, all combining to deliver the studio’s best film: Michael B Jordan’s standout villain, scene-stealing performances from Danai Guria and Letitia Wright, plus the direction of Creed’s Ryan Coogler who proved an inspired appointment. Wakanda forever, indeed.Pawel Pawlikowski’s Cold War, shot in the sleekest black and white, is an effortlessly stylish and romantic drama set in a period of political convulsion. It offers everything from Polish folk music to the sultriest Birth of the Cool-style jazz. Pawlikowski includes moments of reckless hedonism alongside scenes of exile and imprisonment. Best of all, the film has a truly wonderful performance from Joanna Kulig as Zula, the free-spirited young folk singer turned femme fatale.There are no two ways about it: Bradley Cooper\u0027s rock star Jackson Mane inviting Ally – a small-town waitress played by Lady Gaga – onto stage to sing her song in front of thousands of his fans is movie magic. Regardless of your stance on the film\u0027s back half and pretty maudlin ending, A Star is Born is an old-fashioned success story with an intensity that brings up the hairs on the back of your neck.Director Chloé Zhao took a gamble casting a real-life family in this modern-day western about a cowboy named Brady Blackburn (Brady Jandreau). It pays off – this an authentic portrait of contemporary rodeo life in South Dakota. From her amateur cast she somehow coaxes performances more memorable than most pros manage in their entire careers. As moving as it is bold, The Rider also offers an all-too-rare female perspective on masculinity. Eight years after Winter’s Bone made a star of Jennifer Lawrence, Leave No Trace – director Debra Granik’s first feature film since then – should rightly make a star of Thomasin McKenzie too. Based on the book My Abandonment by Peter Rook, Leave No Trace is virtually a two-hander between McKenzie and Ben Foster. They play a PTSD-suffering war veteran and his daughter, who live in the forests of Oregon, fending for themselves. Even when the two are arrested and placed in government housing, the film refuses to be anything other than understated and is all the more beguiling for it.1115 5. The Shape of WaterLoneliness can sometimes feel like your soul has been chained to the bottom of the ocean, at other times it can feel like you’re speaking a language no one else understands. Guillermo del Toro beautifully illustrates both these nuances in his Oscar-winning fantasy romance, in which a mute woman (Sally Hawkins) unexpectedly falls for a strange aquatic creature (Doug Jones), the only one who sees her as she truly wants to be seen. Theirs is a love so mystical, so overwhelming, that it can only be communicated through the language of dreams. Lady Bird will always be close to our hearts. There are times when it feels less like a film, more like a hand tracing delicately through memories, of what it felt like to grow up, to say goodbye, and to find one\u0027s own place in the universe. Greta Gerwig’s story of a teenager, played by Saoirse Ronan, desperate to escape her hometown and seek the intellectual haven of the East Coast colleges (“where the culture is”, she argues) may be specific in its layout, but it is universal in its emotions. Whenever Lynne Ramsey attaches her name to a film, you know to expect something special. You Were Never Really Here marks a career-high for the British auteur, who manages to condense the violent story of a former military man searching for a stolen girl into a viciously edited 90-minute thriller. Joaquin Phoenix makes for the perfect enigmatic leading man, while Jonny Greenwood’s mechanical, piercing score adds to the decidedly eerie atmosphere.Should Phantom Thread really be Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film, then the actor can retire knowing that Reynolds Woodcock ranks among his greatest roles. Day-Lewis plays the egomaniacal fashion designer with a childish whimsy, but there\u0027s also a spectral quality to him that looms in every scene. Lesley Manville’s deliciously funny Cyril and Vicky Krieps’s superbly sharp Alma offer two cunning counters to Reynolds’s growing appetite for self-destruction, making for some wonderfully heated confrontations. Paul Thomas Anderson’s direction allows each character to blossom on screen, in a film that makes for a masterful study of poisonous relationships.Loosely based on his own childhood, Alfonso Cuaron\u0027s follow-up to the Oscar-winning Gravity is a gorgeous piece of film-making, a quiet paean to the women who raised him. It\u0027s a neorealist masterpiece, shot in 65mm black and white, and built from detailed vignettes of domestic life in early 1970s Mexico City, a time there of great social unrest. Savour every scene: the camera takes it all in, as we follow a young Mixtec woman named Cleo (wonderful newcomer Yalitza Aparicio) who looks after a well-to-do family she comes to think of as her own. It\u0027s about love, grief and resilience: it will slay you.Japanese filmmaker Hirokazu Kore-eda’s Shoplifters could be the year’s most disarming film.

Regardless of your stance on the film\u0027s back half and pretty maudlin ending, A Star is Born is an old-fashioned success story with an intensity that brings up the hairs on the back of your neck.Director Chloé Zhao took a gamble casting a real-life family in this modern-day western about a cowboy named Brady Blackburn (Brady Jandreau). It pays off – this an authentic portrait of contemporary rodeo life in South Dakota. From her amateur cast she somehow coaxes performances more memorable than most pros manage in their entire careers. As moving as it is bold, The Rider also offers an all-too-rare female perspective on masculinity. Eight years after Winter’s Bone made a star of Jennifer Lawrence, Leave No Trace – director Debra Granik’s first feature film since then – should rightly make a star of Thomasin McKenzie too. Based on the book My Abandonment by Peter Rook, Leave No Trace is virtually a two-hander between McKenzie and Ben Foster. They play a PTSD-suffering war veteran and his daughter, who live in the forests of Oregon, fending for themselves. Even when the two are arrested and placed in government housing, the film refuses to be anything other than understated and is all the more beguiling for it.1115 5. The Shape of WaterLoneliness can sometimes feel like your soul has been chained to the bottom of the ocean, at other times it can feel like you’re speaking a language no one else understands. Guillermo del Toro beautifully illustrates both these nuances in his Oscar-winning fantasy romance, in which a mute woman (Sally Hawkins) unexpectedly falls for a strange aquatic creature (Doug Jones), the only one who sees her as she truly wants to be seen. Theirs is a love so mystical, so overwhelming, that it can only be communicated through the language of dreams. Lady Bird will always be close to our hearts. There are times when it feels less like a film, more like a hand tracing delicately through memories, of what it felt like to grow up, to say goodbye, and to find one\u0027s own place in the universe. Greta Gerwig’s story of a teenager, played by Saoirse Ronan, desperate to escape her hometown and seek the intellectual haven of the East Coast colleges (“where the culture is”, she argues) may be specific in its layout, but it is universal in its emotions. Whenever Lynne Ramsey attaches her name to a film, you know to expect something special. You Were Never Really Here marks a career-high for the British auteur, who manages to condense the violent story of a former military man searching for a stolen girl into a viciously edited 90-minute thriller. Joaquin Phoenix makes for the perfect enigmatic leading man, while Jonny Greenwood’s mechanical, piercing score adds to the decidedly eerie atmosphere.Should Phantom Thread really be Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film, then the actor can retire knowing that Reynolds Woodcock ranks among his greatest roles. Day-Lewis plays the egomaniacal fashion designer with a childish whimsy, but there\u0027s also a spectral quality to him that looms in every scene. Lesley Manville’s deliciously funny Cyril and Vicky Krieps’s superbly sharp Alma offer two cunning counters to Reynolds’s growing appetite for self-destruction, making for some wonderfully heated confrontations. Paul Thomas Anderson’s direction allows each character to blossom on screen, in a film that makes for a masterful study of poisonous relationships.Loosely based on his own childhood, Alfonso Cuaron\u0027s follow-up to the Oscar-winning Gravity is a gorgeous piece of film-making, a quiet paean to the women who raised him. It\u0027s a neorealist masterpiece, shot in 65mm black and white, and built from detailed vignettes of domestic life in early 1970s Mexico City, a time there of great social unrest. Savour every scene: the camera takes it all in, as we follow a young Mixtec woman named Cleo (wonderful newcomer Yalitza Aparicio) who looks after a well-to-do family she comes to think of as her own. It\u0027s about love, grief and resilience: it will slay you.A final surprise arrives when it’s revealed that the footage of David and Kevin’s superpowered exploits, captured on the facility’s security cameras, was secretly\u0026nbspdownloaded by Mrow Glass and sent to Elijah’s mother (Charlayne Woodard), Joseph, and Kevin’s former victim-turned-ally Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy).\u0026nbspMr Glass may have paid with his life, but it allows the three to upload the footage online and finally let the world know that superheroes are real.\u0026nbspGlass is out in UK\u0026nbspcinemas now.Follow\u0026nbspIndependent Culture\u0026nbspon Facebook for all the latest on Film, TV, Music, and more.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She is now a painter.“I always felt like one of the Brits, I never felt different,” she said.“I was fully integrated and I had done all my study here – it was such a slap in the face to realise that you were now ‘the other’.”Mrs Wright said many people in her situation were concerned about giving the Home Office permission to share their personal data with other agencies in the UK and abroad while they cannot access the data the Home Office holds on them.Home Office ‘risking repeat of Windrush scandal for EU citizens’Fears for elderly Iranian couple as Home Office denies leave to remainShe also voiced her frustration at the fact the Home Office’s\u0026nbspsettlement\u0026nbspscheme app does not work on iPhone and iPads – the devices she owns.“You can ask someone to borrow their device but that alone is going to take more than half an hour,” Mrs Wright said.From her involvement with groups set up to advise EU nationals living in the UK during the Brexit process, Mrs Wright has met many older people with limited computer skills who she said were very concerned about the application.She said: “Some of them don’t even have a mobile phone and there are people who live in care homes, what are they supposed to do?”She added: “The entire application process is in digital format and if successful, applicants are not given a printed card or letter confirming their settled status.“The absence of written proof is another worrying aspect.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Other registration methods are available.Chai Patel, legal policy director at the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said: “They say they are doing advertising,\u0026nbspthat they are doing outreach and free events for people – but it’s completely inadequate for the situation at hand.“If politicians meant it when they said EU nationals could stay, they would have made\u0026nbspsettled status a legal guarantee and said\u0026nbspeveryone who is currently a resident in the UK as an EU national has a permanent right to remain.”Mr Patel accused ministers of using the scheme as a way to appear to\u0026nbsp“take back control” and remove a subset of people who they want to deport, but to the detriment of vulnerable iniduals who will not be aware of it, or\u0026nbspnot have the means to apply.“Ministers want it to be a political taking back control. They do not want to be seen to be granting settled status to people who are ‘undesirable’,” he said.“But it means that we’ve got as a matter of absolute certainty at least tens of thousands of people who will end up being here illegally afterwards, just because they didn’t apply for the status – and that is going to be a problem.”Created with Sketch.

Chief executive of charity More United,\u0026nbspBess Mayhew, said: Asking EU citizens who have lived here for years to pay to stay in their homes isn’t right.These people are our friends, family and colleagues who deserve to be treated better. We hope there is still time for the Home Secretary to reconsider.Liberal Democrat MP Sir Ed Davey\u0026nbspsaid: “No one seriously believes that the Home Office will be able to grant settled status to everyone who’s eligible within two years. Thousands will be left effectively undocumented and subject to Theresa May’s hostile environment.”Those who have lived continuously in the UK for five years can apply for settled status under the scheme, meaning they are free to go on living and working in the UK indefinitely.People who do not have five years’ residence can seek to stay until they have, at which point they can apply for settled status.Applicants are asked to prove their identity, declare any criminal convictions and upload a facial photograph. Officials then check employment and benefits data to confirm proof of residence, while all applications are run through UK criminality and security databases.It is estimated that the total number of applications could run to more than 3.5 million.A Home Office spokesperson said:\u0026nbsp“The EU Settlement Scheme will ensure all EU citizens living in the UK will have a status granted by the Home Office which they can use to demonstrate their right to work, housing and benefits.“It will be simple and straightforward for EU citizens to get the status they need. They will only need to complete three key steps – prove their identity, show that that they live in the UK\u0026nbspand declare any criminal convictions.“We have completed two successful private testing phases with tens of thousands of applications and customer feedback was overwhelmingly positive.“We are working in partnership with vulnerable group representatives, local authorities and other experts to make sure we reach everyone.”Asylum and ImmigrationOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If they go back to Iran it’s difficult for British citizens to visit Iran, they can’t just fly over as if they were going to Spain or France.”“They are showing lots of signs of old age physically and mentally and they just want to be with their family,” he added.“If they go back to Iran they will be two old people living alone whereas here they are living in Edinburgh with all their family around them.”A Home Office spokesman said: “All UK visa applications are considered on their inidual merits, on the basis of the evidence available and in line with UK immigration rules.”Ian Murray, Labour MP for Edinburgh South, has voiced his support for the family.He tweeted: “I’m working with the family \u0026amp their lawyers to try \u0026amp persuade the Home Secretary to do the decent thing.”“This is our family,” she wrote.“We depend on them and they depend on us.

If we’re to get the agreement through, we absolutely have to do that. The question is how we find a way to do that.”Asked what such a compromise might involve, he said: “It’s getting an agreement with Ireland on an alternative\u0026nbspmechanism to ensure that we don’t get friction across the Norther Ireland-Ireland border.”Mr Fox said both the UK and Irish government shared a desire to preserve an open border in Northern Ireland, adding: “The question is can we achieve what the Irish government wants and\u0026nbspwhat we want by a different mechanism.”The government will “explore ways” to “find an alternative mechanism to ensure that we give the Irish government what they want, which is that we end up with no hard border”, he added.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by Parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentDublin moved swiftly to pour cold water on the suggestion.And an Irish government source told the Sunday Times that a bilateral treaty “doesn’t sound like something we would entertain”.Ms May’s chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, has reportedly told cabinet ministers that, if the plan fails, the prime minister could seek to secure more support for her deal by announcing she will step down in May.\u0026nbspMs May briefed her cabinet on her next steps during a conference call on Sunday afternoon.The latest twist comes as a cross-party group of backbenchers prepares to try to amend whatever plan Ms May puts forward in order to give parliament the right to seize control of Brexit.The proposal, led by former attorney general Dominic Grieve, would remove the government’s power to choose what\u0026nbspparliament debates and instead prioritise any motion backed by 300 MPs from at least five parties – significantly less than a Commons majority.A separate plan being worked on by senior parliamentarians, including Labour’s Yvette Cooper and former Tory ministers Nick Boles and Nicky Morgan, would force the government to delay Brexit if a deal is not approved within weeks.A Downing Street spokesperson said: “The British public voted to leave the European Union and it is vital that elected politicians deliver upon that verdict.“Any attempt to remove the government’s power to meet the legal conditions of an orderly exit at this moment of historic significance is extremely concerning.”In a sign of growing concern\u0026nbspamong Eurosceptics that the amendments could lead to Brexit being delayed or reversed, leading Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, a vocal critic of Ms May’s deal,\u0026nbspsaid it would be better to leave the EU on the terms of the prime minister’s plan\u0026nbspthan not leave at all.\u0026nbspWriting in the Mail on Sunday, he called on the Conservatives to “come together in the national interest”. He added:\u0026nbsp“If I had to choose between no deal and Mrs May’s original accord, I would have no hesitation of opting for no-deal Brexit, but even Mrs May’s deal would be better than not leaving at all.“Even at this very late stage, I believe that with commitment and effort we can avoid such a choice.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

For us, you\u0027re still a significant trading partner... We would consider it to be a real priority for us.Ms Ardern said it was a matter for the UK to decide on the nature of its withdrawal from the UK, but she added: From our perspective, and from New Zealand businesses\u0027 perspective, no deal would be very difficult.In an interesting bit of timing, European leaders are meeting in Brussels for the EU\u0027s Foreign Affairs Council.German foreign minister Heiko Maas told reporters: We are all quite keen to see what we will hear from London today.It is about time. We know what London doesn\u0027t want, now we must at last find out what they want and what there is a majority in parliament for, so we can sit down with our colleagues from London and talk about how we avoid a hard Brexit, a Brexit without an agreement.It appears that everyone wants that, so it must be possible.Asked if he had confidence in Theresa May, Mr Maas replied Of course. But asked whether it was now too late, he said: I don\u0027t really know.He added: It is important that the outcome is not a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, because as we saw this weekend, nerves are on edge there.Europe is a peace project and Europe cannot do anything which leads to conflicts breaking out again in a part of Europe where they have long since been laid to rest.It\u0027s a very sensitive issue and therefore it\u0027s an issue which in the discussions to come I cannot imagine there will be much change.Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg has said he would be open to the idea of former Ukip leader Nigel Farage joining the Conservative Party in the future.Mr Rees-Mogg, the chairman of the European Research Group (ERG), told LBC radio: If the Conservative Party could reunite with the reasonable elements of Ukip that would be very good news and Nigel would be part of that.He said that such a move would be much easier now than it would have been when he was still a member of Ukip, because of the eurosceptic party\u0027s new links with Tommy Robinson.Mr Farage quit Ukip last year over current leader Gerard Batten\u0027s association with Mr Robinson, the co-founder of the English Defence League.Mr Rees-Mogg added: It may be a little bit early, though personally I hold Nigel in the highest regard and think he was one of the people who was instrumental in delivering Brexit... but perhaps a little bit more purdah is required.Conservative minister\u0026nbspRichard Harrington\u0026nbsphas urged\u0026nbspTheresa May\u0026nbspto rule out a no-deal\u0026nbspBrexit, as the prime minister prepares to outline her alternative plans to parliament.The business minister, who repeated his threat to resign should the government oversee such a scenario, said he was “afraid” firms such as Jaguar and Mini could close in the UK under the “absolute disaster” of a disorderly exit.Mr Harrington echoed demands made by\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn, who has insisted in recent days the prime minister must take no deal off the table before engaging in cross-party talks over Brexit.More here:\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

An exclusive survey for The Independent shows that a fresh vote received more support than any of the\u0026nbspfour other options put to the public, including allowing\u0026nbspthe prime minister to go back to Brussels\u0026nbspor a\u0026nbspno-deal Brexit.The survey by poling organisation BMG Research also suggests that more people oppose\u0026nbspMs May’s deal than back it, although the prime minister can take some comfort in the data showing a softening of opposition.

It found 28 per cent were against and 26 per cent did not know.Remaining in the EU was backed by 45 per cent, while 39 per cent of people said they\u0026nbspopposed reversing Brexit and 16 per cent said they did not know.Forty-five per cent supported further negotiation with the EU, while 34 per cent were against going back to Brussels for fresh talks. More than a fifth (21 per cent) did not know.Some 40 per cent would opt for Norway-style deal – which allows access to the single market – but 36 per cent dismissed the option and 24 per cent were unsure.Leaving the EU without a deal was the least popular option as it was preferred by only 35 per cent, while 45 per cent opposed it and 21 per cent said they did not know.It comes as\u0026nbspthe prime minister has been reaching out to Labour MPs and trade unions in a last-ditch bid to get her deal\u0026nbspthrough parliament.Government insiders are expecting Brussels\u0026nbspto offer\u0026nbspMs May some extra help by Monday, which they hope will ease fears from wavering MPs over\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspIrish backstop.However, she is unlikely to secure a legally binding guarantee that the UK can independently decide to the leave the backstop, which Brexiteers and her\u0026nbspDUP allies want.BBC analysis estimates Ms May could lose the meaningful vote by\u0026nbsp228 votes next week, after which she would have to come back to parliament within three days with a plan B.Northern Ireland secretary ‘using peace process as bargaining tool’What is the position of the big trade unions on Brexit?The truth about May’s shambolic approach to the unionsFinally, May has realised she desperately needs Labour’s backingArticle 50 set to be extended even if May wins crucial Brexit voteOpposition to Ms May’s deal\u0026nbsphas weakened among the public, as the BMG research shows 37 per cent think\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspshould reject the deal, compared with 43 per cent in December.When asked if parliament should vote to accept the terms of the deal, 29 per cent said they should, up from 26 per cent last month. More than 30 per cent said they were unsure in both instances.The poll put Labour and the Conservatives\u0026nbspneck and neck on 36 per cent of the vote,\u0026nbspwith the\u0026nbspLiberal Democrats on 12 points,\u0026nbspUkip\u0026nbspon 6 per cent and the Greens on 5 points, once don’t-knows were excluded.The Independent\u0026nbsprevealed on Friday that Ms May’s\u0026nbspchances of delivering\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspon 29 March are fading fast after senior ministers privately admitted more time is needed, even if her deal wins the backing of parliament.On Saturday, transport secretary Chris Grayling was accused of engaging in “gutter politics” when he warned that blocking Brexit could lead to a surge in far-right extremism.Created with Sketch.

No one should be condemned to an earlier grave or a life of illiteracy simply because they were born poor,” said Mr Spencer.Economists generally agree that the level of global inequality is large and many agree with Oxfam that redistributive wealth taxes are warranted.But many analysts also stress that in recent decades the share of the world population living in poverty – surviving on less than $2 a day – has fallen sharply from 44 per cent in 1980 to 9.6 per cent in 2015 according to World Bank data.This is largely due to economic growth in large poor countries such as China and India as they have opened themselves up to global commerce.Branko Milanovic, the pre-eminent researcher on global income inequality, has estimated that international income inequality (as opposed to wealth inequality) fell between 1988 and 2008 for the first time since the Industrial Revolution.The Credit Suisse analysis upon which Oxfam bases its estimate of the fortunes of the bottom 50 per cent of the world population also shows a slightly different story about the trend in the wealth share of those at the top.It found that the share of wealth of the top 1 per cent declined slightly in 2018, from 47.5 per cent to 47.2 per cent.“While it is too early to say that wealth inequality is now on a downward trend, the prevailing evidence suggests it may well have levelled out, albeit at a very high level,” Credit Suisse’s team wrote.Estimating the wealth of those at the very top of the wealth pyramid – not the top 1 per cent but the highest 0.1 per cent, 0.01 per cent and beyond – is difficult because the super-rich do not tend to participate in the surveys that national statisticians use to estimate the broad distribution of wealth.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Protesters take part in a demonstration near the Greek Parliament against the agreement with Skopje to rename neighbouring country Macedonia as the Republic of North Macedonia, in Athens.

Since March last year the MSCI Index of world shares has fallen by around 5 per cent, which will likely have dented the net worth of many dollar billionaires.An\u0026nbspinidual would need\u0026nbspnet assets of $4,210 (£3,300) to be among the wealthiest half of the world population in mid-2018, according to Credit Suisse, meaning the majority of people in the UK would be in this category.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He also co-owns a house in Surrey.Mishcon de Reya first hired him in  as a part-time consultant for its business crime unit.He quit client work for the firm in April , but was reappointed as a consultant to its in-house academy in June this year.The MP stood down from that role after being appointed to the shadow cabinet last month.Starmer is the third key figure from the lacklustre £.m Operation Elveden witchhunt of Sun reporters to be employed by Mishcon de Reya.His former principal legal adviser at the Crown Prosecution Service Alison Levitt and former politan police assistant commissioner Sue Akers – who headed the bungled investigation – have also done work for the firm.This week Starmer refused to apologise after reporter Anthony France had his conviction overturned - meaning not one of  Sun journalists arrested were convicted.A spokeswoman for the law firm said: “Keir Starmer was a consultant to the Mishcon Academy, our in-house centre for learning and development.“The role did not involve client advice on any issue. Keir resigned as a consultant to the academy when he was appointed to the Shadow Cabinet.”A spokesman for Starmer’s office said: “MPs are required to register and declare fees received since the May  election even where those fees were earned before the election.“The register makes it very clear that in the case of Keir Starmer, the vast majority of his declared earnings represent payment for work undertaken by him as a lawyer before he became MP.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Shakeel Begg was found in the High Court to be an Islamic extremist.There can be no excuse for any political party working with Begg.It is not only unacceptable to give him a public , but it is also dangerous for extremists to be legitimised in this way.Begg sued the BBC after Sunday Politics presenter Andrew Neil referred to him as extreme and intolerant.But Mr Justice Haddon-Cave ruled against him, describing Begg as “an extremist Islamic speaker who espouses extremist Islamic positions”.The preacher had told followers that “solidarity amongst Muslims means making jihad against the Jews and fighting the Jews in an Islamic Jihad until the Territory [Palestine] goes back to its proper people”.The judge said those comments were “encouraging offensive jihad against Jews to recover Palestine andit to the Muslims”.Begg spoke on a  alongside Jeremy Corbyn in the wake of Lee Rigbys murder.A Labour spokesman said: Communities and faith groups coming together is an essential part of the fight against the scourge of racism."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000291943658.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"star next to the moon bright venus","story":"Here’s all you need to know about the new light in the morning sky.The light isn’t actually a star, it’s Venus.Venus is the second closest planet to the sun and has moved position over the last few days.It was at its brightest on Sunday, December .But it is still clearly visible in the early hours.Venus is closer to the Sun than Earth, so it orbits inside Earth’s path.The planet orbits the sun every . days.When it is on the far side of the Sun, Venus can’t be seen, but as it comes round, getting closer to Earth, it becomes brighter and brighter, reflecting light from the Sun.Less of the planet can be seen the closer it gets to Earth, but due to it being nearer it will seem larger in the sky.As it gets closer to us it is visible in the evening, then when it passes its closest point and moves away again it is visible in the morning.Venus’ brightest point is known as its “greatest illuminated extent” – when it is getting closest to us, without being directly between us and the Sun.This happened on December  as Venus’ waning phase coincided with its largest disc size – at this point the planet is usually about  per cent illuminated."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT0004573685281.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"conspiracy theorists parking tickets debt uk laws","story":"Thousands of Brits are believed be living as freemen on the land, a highly secretive group that originated in s America and Canada and has since spread its ideas across the pond.Because of their secrecy their real numbers are unknown, but freemen are thought to be active in English-speaking countries including the UK, Ireland, Canada, the United States, Australia and New Zealand.Despite their numbers they remain under the radar, only rearing their heads by causing havoc in courts where they can disrupt the entire process by refusing to take part.They are united in their belief that a big state conspiracy exists between the government and court system to take away their common law rights.Lawyers have dismissed freemens bizarre claims as a conspiracy theory and they are not known to have won any cases in court - but followers say they have used the wild theories to get out of parking tickets and demands for money from big businesses.As a policeman who has worked in London for the past  years, Sam is an unexpected candidate for freemanism.The -year-old dad, whose name has been changed to protect his identity, first came across the movement in  when searching online for a way to manage his spiralling debt.Id heard about freemen before but didnt know much about them, I just wanted justice,” he told the Sun Online.“I was up against big bullying corporations. The information I found was a tool to help me fight against them.”Sam claims to have written off £, by arguing that the three banks he allegedly borrowed money from had behaved illegally by stopping an agreed reduced payment plan and continuing to charge him interest.“What they were doing was unlawful,” he claimed. “Under contract law it was null and void. They were breaking the contract.”Since then, Sam has read up more widely on freemen beliefs and now lives by what he sees as its and his own guiding principles – often in conflict with his role with the politan Police, in his eyes an “immoral” limited company.I police through common law, he said. Theres a fine line between the dictates of your job and what is right. I do what I think is right, I use my own tuition and logic.“I wouldn’t hand out parking tickets, for example. And when I saw a woman stealing nappies from Lidl, I turned the other way.Sam estimates there are several thousand other freemen in Britain alone, but says he acts alone and has contact with only a few other freemen.“If I had my way we’d live in an anarchic system, one that is self-governing, he said.The whole current system is corrupt and set-up. It may sound nutty, but its nothing less than enslavement.”Freemen arguments like these are sometimes wheeled out by those who unwilling to follow the law.The Sun Online reported in October how motorist Dean Renshaw was stopped for driving an untaxed car - but refused to admit any offence.When cops pulled him over and told him his tax was well out of date, the self-styled freeman replied: I do not respond to statutory acts because they are laws of the sea.These sentiments resonate with Veronica Chapman, an author of several freemen texts who created and runs fmotl, a website for the community with more than , monthly subscribers from all around the world. The extraordinary site contains entire sections on “how to get out of fixed penalty notices” as well as sample letters to write to banks about extracting oneself from debts.But Veronica maintains that freemen are slaves, not con-artists.Freemen are accused of trying to get out of paying for things, but nothing could be further from the truth,” she said. “All freemen are trying to do is to prevent themselves from being robbed.Freemen may be able to bamboozle the odd debt collector or parking warden, but they are yet to win a single case in a court of law.Dozens have tried – including Mark Coles, a self-declared freeman on the land who refused to answer a judge’s questions about his identity and claimed his sentencing hearing was a “perjury” at Taunton Crown Court.Appearing before the judge, he repeatedly said: I am not Mark Coles, I am a man.Somerset Live reports how he told the court he was appearing under duress and added that Mr Coles is a fiction, and a trust entity.”People who class themselves as FMOTL say they are born with one name and given another by the government through the name written on their birth certicate. This is sometimes known as the “strawman” theory.This means that “freemen” claim to have a sort of “get out of jail” card by saying that any court is holding only their fictional self - the name written on their birth certicate - to account rather than them.But former government lawyer Carl Gardner describes the freemen concepts as “pseudo law” that “apes certain legal modes but is used to attack law operating in any kind of serious way”.He believes the movement originated in the US or Canada with a group who call themselves the sovereign citizens, an idea which spread to the now distinct freemen - who also hold that the person is sovereign.But he dismissed the ideas as “sinister nonsense.They use law like magic spells. That means theyre no longer subject to the law.It is a fringe thing, and a conspiracy. I think the far right is very invested in it, I think we all need to be a bit careful of it.He added: Some people dont mean well but take advantage of others, some of them may have mental health issues and be vulnerable. Its a concern that people are taking these ideas and using them.However bizarre they may seem, freemen beliefs have changed the direction of police officer Sam’s le. Over the next months he plans to quit the police force, de-register from paying “illegal” tax and give back his own sort of tax through services to the community.“I’m leaving here to have a more honest job,” he said. “Learning about freemen beliefs has opened so much for me that I didn’t realise was there. It’s totally changed my perspective.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000462281132-e1547763641125.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa theres jeremy corbyn ira hamas hezbollah jihadis stalinists holocaust deniers","story":"He was happy to talk to Hamas and Hezbollah without preconditions. He is happy to hang around with Stalinists and anti-Semites, Holocaust deniers and apologists for terrorism. But he won’t talk to the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.The Labour leader’s refusal to discuss Brexit with his Tory — and come to that, Lib Dem, SNP, DUP and Plaid Cymru — counterparts reveals the utter smallness of the man.For two years, Jezza has been noisily demanding that Theresa May “reach out” to other parties. Yet the moment she does, he comes over all snooty and stand-offish.He won’t join any discussions about our EU policy unless and until the PM pledges that we won’t leave without a deal.That condition is absurd. Mrs May, as Corbyn well knows, is also keen to avoid No Deal. But the only way to avoid that is to agree on, you know, a deal.That’s precisely why the PM is talking to the other party leaders.The only effect of publicly ruling out No Deal — as several MPs in all parties have been pompously doing — is to encourage Brussels to dig in and thus, paradoxically, to make No Deal more likely.What explains Jezza’s sudden coolness  Is it simple tribalism of the sort that has now taken over the top ranks of Labour Immediately before the vote, for example, Richard Burgon, the Corbynite Shadow Justice Secretary, repeatedly described Conservatives on TV as “the real enemy”.After the confidence motion, another Labour MP, Danielle Rowley, posted a picture of the Conservative benches with the caption, “People are dying because of these people”.Is Corbs unwilling to talk to Tories because he sees them as evil murderers I don’t think so. Part of the old booby’s schtick is that he will talk to anyone. It’s how he justies his meetings with Irish Republicans and jihadi extremists.It’s how he justies taking money to appear on a TV station backed by the ayatollahs in Tehran.He has even said that he would be prepared to negotiate with the head-hackers of IS in order to facilitate peace.I don’t think so.

It would force him to take a public position on Brexit. And that is the last thing he wants to do.Corbyn is an Old Left Eurosceptic. He took what was, effectively, the Moscow line during the Cold War, namely that the EEC was the economic arm of Nato.He disliked what he saw as its capitalism, and knows he will be able to implement a far more radical form of socialism once Britain is no longer constrained by EU rules on competition and state aid.He also knows that the overwhelming majority of Labour MPs want to stay in the EU.During the referendum campaign, he reluctantly went along with his party, though he made little secret of his distaste.Although we’ll never know for sure, I have a strong suspicion, looking at his face as he left the polling station, that he secretly voted Leave.Be that as it may, he has since kept the Labour coalition together by attacking the Government while saying nothing about what he would do.That ambiguity has allowed him to appease his party without alienating the millions in Labour’s northern heartlands who voted Leave.From a self-interest point of view, it made sense. But the impact on Britain’s negotiating position was dire.Labour’s tactic has been to demand impossible conditions from the Government. As Barry Gardiner, the Shadow Trade Minister, was overheard saying in Brussels: “It’s bollocks — always has been bollocks.”The trouble is, that by adopting its testicular conditions, Labour has ended up arguing for something that would represent the worst of all worlds.The main stated dference between the two parties is over the customs union. Labour says it wants Brussels to control Britain’s trade policy in perpetuity after we leave.As recently as last year, Corbyn was against the customs union on the unarguable grounds that “It is protectionist against third- world countries”.That was the reason successive Labour Eurosceptics, as far back as Clement Attlee, opposed joining the EEC.But last February, spotting an opportunity to vote against the Government without having to commit to anything, Labour somersaulted and started demanding customs union membership.Be clear: Being outside the EU but inside its customs union would be disastrous. It would keep the costs of membership without the benefits of leaving.As former Canadian PM Stephen Harper, a massive Anglophile and a Remain supporter in , put it recently: “It is really critical that this country rediscovers itself as a trading nation. If you do not do that, then frankly the Brexit experience will be bad.” When I put that point to another member of the shadow cabinet in a BBC green room, he looked at me asI was mad. We’re this close to the first truly socialist government in Britain,” he told me. “You really think we care about the customs union either way ”Yet it is precisely that cynicism that voters are turning against. People are furious at the game-playing in Westminster. They accept that MPs have dfering views, but they can tell when a party is advancing bogus arguments for purely selfish reasons.In the last analysis, Jeremy Corbyn has shown himself to be unwilling to work in what he himself sees as the national interest. That is what makes him unfit for office.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They must fight — or the public will never forgive them.IS anyone seriously looking for a “consensus” on Brexit What concessions have any opposition leaders offered Theresa May  They all just demand a second referendum and or No Deal “taken off the table”.Yes, the Government is sticking to its guns too.

Thatno deal can be found, then that is at least the Brexit a majority voted for in .One Europhile writer found it “staggering, terrying”.

What a powerful statement.This school’s success is rooted in a couple of factors. It has a dedicated “study centre” open from am until pm.The centre was opened after the school realised that some of their students who live in busy or chaotic households don’t have access to a quiet study space.Role models are emphasised within the school, which has created a “university access team” featuring five full-time members of staff who are all Oxbridge graduates.Quite apart from the academic challenges — the privilege and elitism surrounding the world of Oxbridge is so intimidating that even the brightest kids coming from ordinary households could easily conclude that they wouldn’t belong.So the university access team also help them to see Oxbridge as an achievable goalThey take students to museums and find other ways to get them excited about study.Their sole aim is to support potential candidates, from  upwards, to get into good universities. I often say you can’t help where you start but you can decide where you end up.And this is a brilliant example.This kind of success comes down largely to self-belief.These children have been encouraged to visualise a very bright future for themselves, and to believe that they are worthy of it. And with that powering you, the sky really is the limit.Which is why the story about a young woman called Liv Conlon, from Bothwell near Glasgow, also caught my eye.Liv set up her first business at , importing goods from China and selling them online.She used the money she made from that to start another company, called The Property Stagers, which furnishes empty homes and, after years of bullying, decided to leave school at  to run it full time.Liv is now . The company furnishes more than  properties a year, and she’s hired a team of ten people – including her mother and brother.She’s also bought and renovated her own one-bedroom flat — all without the help from the Bank of Mum and Dad.She believes being bullied every day at school for four years made her set on being a success.“It made me more determined. Everyone who’s ever doubted my ability or capability or challenged that just put a fire in my stomach to go on and be better.”An outstanding attitude and what a role model Liv is.Nothing is more powerful than feeling irrepressible and the desire to cock a snook at the people who don’t want you to achieve.Both these stories prove the same point: If you believe in yourself – and you are prepared to work hard – there is no limit to what you can do.Yes, you need a bit of luck. But in my experience the harder you work, the luckier you get.DJ Sara Cox said this week she has to “work at friendship” as she gets older, words that really resonated for me.When you are young friendships are the backbone of your le and feel effortless.But things change.Andyou aren’t careful you get boring.I’m shocked at how easy it can be to reach a point where you don’t want to go out or do anything in your spare time.But you know what  It’s so important to force yourself off the sofa every so often and have a laugh with your girlfriends. I just need to get Dry January out of the way first.No wonder some envious people have been making mean comments.Meghan has glided through the past few months with real dignity, while also looking a milllion dollars.She is positively glowing. . .  something I never quite managed during pregnancy, despite all the promises.MY heart went out this week to Andy Murray, and the despair he so clearly feels that his body is letting him down and ending his career.It’s a reminder that the toughest part of the job for sports stars is the end. And the higher you’ve flown, the bigger the fall.I had a glimpse of how it feels ten years ago when I sold my business and had a bit of a . . . lull, before the next thing happened.During that time, I’d phone people up and when the receptionist asked me where I was calling from, my answer was, “Um, my living room.”For the first time in my le I wasn’t being defined by my business or my job title.The same will surely be true for Andy when he can no longer say that he is an international tennis player.The dficulty for professional sportspeople on retiring is that, suddenly, everything you have been geared up towards and focusing on is not there any more. There is nothing so harsh as the realisation that you are no longer relevant.I’ve seen this happen to a lot of footballers.One day you are a revered player for a Premier League club where everything is done for you. The next you are on your own, trying to make your way in a not-always-friendly world.In my view, people who cope are those who look forward not back. They look at what is happening in the next chapter, rather than who they once were.Take John McEnroe who is a hugely successful TV pundit and author. He has capitalised on his success – and shared it. And I have a feeling that, when the pain subsides, Andy Murray will do the same.HAS anyone  noticed how many news stories at the moment seem to be about people carrying and using a machete Why on earth would anyone need to carry a machete in England  We don’t live in a jungle, although it might feel like it at times.The only way to stop this epidemic is to pass a law prohibiting the ownership of this type of weapon.Anyone selling them on the internet for dispatch to this country needs to be issued with a UK arrest warrant and prosecuted.NOT quite sure what is motivating everyone to take part in the so-called “Ten-Year Challenge” – where you upload a photo of yourself from ten years ago to social media, together with a recent one, we’ve mocked one up for Adele.The only possible reason to do this, as far as I can see, is to say: “Haven’t I aged well ”I like a challenge . . . but this one’s not for me.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The margin was higher than expected because some Labour MPs abstained, highlighting deep unease in the party about its leader’s fitness for high office.In contrast, even after a sobering setback, Theresa May signalled her determination to seek further concessions from Brussels.Mr Corbyn rebuffed the Prime Minister’s offer of talks unless she ruled out leaving with No Deal. If only he took such an uncompromising stance towards terrorists and despots. In reality, Jeremy Corbyn has no idea what Labour’s policy on Brexit would be.The path ahead is set in law. The UK will leave the EU in  days’ time — preferably with a deal,not on World Trade Organisation terms.  If Labour wants to reverse that legislation, it will require government backing — and the PM has made clear she won’t support it.The EU has asked to hear what alternatives the UK would accept. So this is a moment of truth, a test for the EU. Are they serious about a deal The Government must seek two essential changes. First, a mechanism so we can exit from the backstop — an interim regime of rules.Otherwise we risk being stuck in an indefinite limbo of laws, with no UK say over them.Second, we want a future relationship based on a free trade agreement so we are free to strike deals with other countries, from Latin America to Asia, to create jobs and cut prices in UK shops.If the EU won’t budge, we should keep our pledge to leave on WTO terms. That way, we can mitigate the risks of some short-term disruption.Dissident MPs are firing blanks. The Norway option means more concessions, including giving up UK control over immigration.A second referendum would create more uncertainty, the last thing business wants, and trigger a backlash from the majority who would feel cheated by the rejection of the  result. Pushing back the exit date would just prolong the anguish of this tortuous haggle with Brussels.None look capable of ­mustering support from a majority of MPs. I am struck by how many Remain voters — let alone Leavers — now just want to see Brexit done.It’s time for politicians to re-focus on boosting jobs, easing the cost of living and ensuring high-quality schools and NHS services. But the British people won’t move on from Brexit until their ­politicians keep their promises on Brexit.We’ve argued long enough. It’s time for some national self-belief.  People heard the risks and, yes, we need to manage them. But voters also expect their politicians to offer a more optimistic vision of post-Brexit Britain and grasp the opportunities.We will control our laws and our immigration policy. We will continue to trade in Europe, but broaden our global horizons — which is good for creating jobs, boosting wages, and offering UK consumers cheaper goods and wider choice.We should put rocket boosters up the economy by cutting business taxes and raise the threshold of National Insurance employee contributions to save workers more than £ each year.While we’re at it, a more robust pro-competition policy at home would give small businesses the opportunity to break into markets, end consumer rip-offs and offer customers better deals.Enough wrangling.

Heres the latest on Britains departure from the EU.Brexit comes from merging the words Britain and exit.The term has been widely used ever since the idea of a referendum on leaving the EU was put forward.More than million people voted in the June  referendum with a turnout of . per cent. Leave won by  per cent to  per cent.People now talk about “soft” and “hard” Brexit in reference to how close the UK will be to the EU post separation.The road to triggering Article  - which saw Britain officially start the process of leaving the EU - was paved with complications for the PM, including a Supreme Court case ruling MPs needed to vote on Brexit negotiations.But it was finally triggered on March , , meaning the official departure date and move into the transition phase is due to take place on March , .The European Union is an economic and political partnership. There are currently  members states including the United Kingdom.It began as a trade group of six nations in the s.The UK first applied to join what was then the European Economic Community in  and finally became a member in .Now called the European Union, it has grown to include former Soviet bloc states and has at its heart a “single market” allowing goods and people to move freely.It has its own parliament, central bank and the euro currency used by  countries, with some members including Britain opting to keep their own money.Eurocrats have been pushing for ever closer political and financial union, which could include a European Army separate from the Nato alliance.Those in favour of leaving said Britain was being held back by EU red tape with too many rules on business.They also campaigned on the issue of sovereignty and said they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders.Beyond the question of ceasing to be a member of the EU, what Brexit actually means in practice has been the subject of intense debate ever since.Theresa May officially triggered Article  on March ,  after which there was a two-year time limit set for negotiations to hammer out the details.The UK is therefore bound to leave the EU by March , , although there is a -month transition period.Negotiations began on June , with the two chief negotiators, Michel Barnier of the EU and former Brexit Secretary David Davis, immediately setting off to find common ground.Some of the “uncertainties” being discussed include citizens living in each others territory, border arrangements between Ireland and the UK and the amount Britain stands to pay to honour its existing EU commitments.This is a bridging agreement between the current situation – where we are members of the EU – and our long-term relationship outside the bloc.Also known as an implementation phase, it allows for the UK to keep some of the same arrangements with Brussels on trade and other matters until a new comprehensive trade agreement is sealed.In March , Britain secured a transition deal that will also allow ministers to seek trade agreements around the globe.The UK will also be free to set its own foreign policy as soon as Brexit happens, as well as negotiate and sign new trade deals anywhere in the world – to implement them in .However EU chiefs made it clear the period, which allows the UK to stay in the Single Market and Customs Union, will only come into forcethe Irish border is sorted.Former Brexit Secretary David Davis and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier unveiled terms for the  month interim period.The UK will not be fully out of the EU until December ,  – four and a half years after the historic referendum decision.But EU leaders have suggested they could extend the transition period further.Theresa May finally struck a Brexit deal with Brussels on November ,, after days of round-the-clock talks in Brussels.But this has proved just the beginning of a long drawn-out, painful process.Facing near certain defeat by Parliament, which is required to back the deal, Mrs May cancelled the meaningful vote on December .The opposition centred predominantly on the backstop agreement which ensures there is never a border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.The backstop will see Britain remain in the customs union for as long as necessary until an alternative way of keeping the border open is found.On December  it was revealed that  Conservatives have put in votes of no confidence, calling for the PM to go.May survived the vote by  votes with  ministers voting to keep her in power, and is safe from another such challenge from her own party for the next  months.But the meaningful vote was finally put before Parliament on January , , when it was crushed by  to  votes.May immediately faced yet another vote of no confidence - this time called by the leader of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn.Yet again, May managed to hold on - just - with a majority of just  after the DUP propped her up.There are multiple options for what could happen next - including options of staying in the single market with open borders, extending Article , a no deal and a second referendum.Due to an amendment, May has until Monday, January  to present plan B to parliament and MPs will vote on the deal on January ."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000291223491.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brexiteers legal challeneg theresa may article 50","story":"They will seek a High Court ruling on any decision to extend or revoke Article  – and demand the right for Britain to retain our seats in the European Parliament.So its pretty unlikely it will pass, leaving Labour red-faced yet again.HOW LIKELY   GOING SOFTA cross-party group of MPs are frantically pushing an alternative Soft Brexit plan which could replace Mrs Mays deal.It would be welcomed by big business -

Cabinet sources said it had been agreed that continuing Irish intransigence meant ministers must now turn a laser focus on winning over the DUP.Mrs May also promised to end plans for any cross-party union with Labour on Brexit.She pledged to concentrate on renegotiating the backstop to win over her backbenchers.Mrs May had hoped a treaty with Ireland might let her cobble together a deal that could be supported by the DUP and Tory Eurosceptics.

The EU has said this cant be done, but after the PMs humiliation last week, could a small tweak like this save the deal TRADE DEAL PROMISEThe PMs said that a trade deal will have to be completed by June  - but theres no guarantee of this. If the EU agreed to legally promise it in the Brexit agreement, MPs could get behind it.LEGALLY BINDING PROTOCALThe UK, Ireland and the EU could all legally promise they wont put up a hard border in Northern Irelandwe leave with No Deal with a fresh agreement.CHANGE GOOD FRIDAY AGREEMENT One shocking plan could see the UK and Ireland agree a set of additional comments to the  peace treaty, saying both sides would guarantee an open border.But opening such a controversial and politically sensitive deal, which finally brought peace to Northern Ireland after the troubles, will be seen as reckless and furiously opposed by MPs, and so is incredibly unlikely.Some ministers think the best way of pushing Brexit through is to make changes on the Northern Ireland backstop.Yesterday key Brexiteer Jacob Rees Mogg suggested hed rather back the deal than risk not leaving altogether.He said this morning on LBC: The backstop has most but not all of the problems... the ECJ, continuing oversight by that court, ability to set our own tarfs...If the backstop could be removed altogether, so could most of the problems be removed.And Boris said on Friday the main obstacle to backing the deal was the hated Irish policy too.He said this morning in his column: Take out the Irish backstop, and the deal, on balance, is better than staying in the EU, and it should be seized in the hope that we can make a better fist of the next phase of the negotiations.That is the way ahead, and I believe thatthe Prime Minister goes back to Brussels with real take-it-or-leave-it determination she will not only get what the country needs, but she will also unite her party and the national feeling of relief will be astounding.MPs do have other issues with deal - including paying a whopping £billion to Brussels without the promise of a trade deal - but its thought that many of them could fall in line rather than risk no Brexit at all.The PM lost last weeks vote by more than  votes, so she has to get a considerable amount of Tories and the DUP on side to push it through.But as the clock ticks down towards Brexit day on March , time is running out to get something that Parliament will pass.GOING SOFTA cross-party group of MPs are frantically pushing an alternative Soft Brexit plan which could replace Mrs Mays deal.It would be welcomed by big business - but Brexit voters would be unhappy because it would mean Britain accepting open borders, and following European rules without a say.HOW LIKELY   HARD AS NAILSMost of the Tory Brexiteers who oppose the PMs deal want her toto Brussels and strike a tougher line.But Eurocrats currently insist its impossible to re-open negotiations.HOW LIKELY   REFERENDUM RE-RUNDozens of MPs are hell-bent on forcing Mrs May to hold a second referendum so Britain can stay in the EU.Yet without the support of the Government its unlikely the second vote could become a reality.HOW LIKELY   DEAL OR NO DEAL If Mrs May cannot pass a deal, the legal default is that we will leave the EU without a deal on March .Despite the legal position, the majority of MPs insist they will take any measure necessary to rule out No Deal.HOW LIKELY   MAY TRIUMPHS -

as well as his own vote to trigger Article  - is such an impossible case to argue that he’s decided to tear up the British constitution instead.It would be a very bitter, twisted and dangerous development MPs could overturn the will of  MPs who voted to trigger Article , not to mention the .million who voted for Brexit. Nadine Dorries added: There are Europhile, kamikaze MPs in Parliament, assisted by a senior clerk and the Speaker, who would happily end their careers in flames in order to defy the will of the people and stop Brexit.A separate attempt to rule out a No Deal Brexit is being launched by a cross-party group of senior MPs.Labours Yvette Cooper and Tory Nick Boles have drawn up a bill which would see Article  delayed until the end of the yearthere isnt a Brexit deal by the end of next month.Its backed by other veteran figures such as Hilary Benn, Nicky Morgan and Oliver Letwin - and Jeremy Corbyn could throw his weight behind it too.Then on Tuesday January , the PM must hold a debate where MPs will have their say on her plan.Although the debate will be on a so-called neutral motion, stating only that the Commons has considered her statement, MPs will have the power to table amendments dictating what should happen next.GRIEVE AMENDMENT - WRECKING BREXITDominic Grieve has proposed an amendment which would effectively transfer power from the Government to the Commons.Under the terms of his proposal, Article  could be suspended indefinitely - keeping us in the EU - on the say-so of  MPs, which is less than a majority.The MPs would have to come from at least five dferent parties, with a minimum of five Conservatives involved.The amendment would tear up centuries of precedent by limiting the Governments ability to govern and so is unlikely to succeed.COOPER BILL - NINE-MONTH DELAYYvette Cooper is tabling a bill to stop Britain leaving the EU without a deal on March .She proposes thatthere isnt a deal by February , MPs could delay Article  for nine months - giving ministers until the end of the  to secure a withdrawal agreement.The bill is a standalone law, but an amendment to the PMs statement could see it catapulted to the top of the Commons agenda.Jeremy Corbyn is considering supporting the move, which would give it a good chance of passing.DROMEY SPELMAN AMENDMENT - BLOCKING NO DEALTory Caroline Spelman and Labours Jack Dromey have a separate amendment to prevent a No Deal outcome.The pair, who both represent Britains industrial heartland in the Midlands, would simply see the Government declare that Britain wont quit the EU until a deal is in place.CABLE AMENDMENT - SECOND REFERENDUMLib Dem boss Vince Cable has come up with a way of forcing a second referendum on Brexit via a Commons amendment.The motion would see Mrs Mays deal approved, but only on the condition that the Government holds a referendum letting the public choose between her plan and staying in the EU.Ms Cooper today claimed Mrs May is keen for the bill to succeed because she secretly wants No Deal off the table.She told the BBC: I think she knows that she should rule out No Deal in the national interest because it would be so damaging.Shes refusing to do so and I think shes hoping that Parliament will do this for her - that is not leadership.If No Deal is ruled out, it may encourage Brexiteer MPs to back Mrs Mays deal - or risk Britain staying in the EU permanently.The Government is currently spending more than £, an hour on preparing for a possible No Deal, according to Labour.So far ministers have paid out £.billion making sure the country is ready to leave without a deal - even though Mrs May is adamant she will get a deal.Jeremy Corbyn said: We’re ready to talk to the Government and others in Parliament about a sensible alternative plan, but not while Theresa May is wasting £, an hour of taxpayers’ money on dangerous and unnecessary No Deal brinkmanship.Today the PM will be grilled on her plans to change her deal so it gets past the Commons despite last weeks humiliating defeat.Then next Tuesday MPs will have a chance to vote on the proposals -

its not a road to a free trade agreement, its not a road to anything.Its an absolute disaster for the country and its supported by a minority of a minority of people.She should in my view say, We are responsible people, were going to do our duty to business, and were going to rule out a No Deal because we want a great deal.He also hit out at Liam Foxs claim to have secured dozens of trade deals ready to go in time for Brexit.Mr Harrington ridiculed the sham of pretend trade agreements that havent happened yet."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/dk-graphic-page10may-e1548032913967.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"annegret kramp karrenbauer irish backstop","story":"Unlikely because it does not yet exist and requires a sharp change of attitude on all sides.But in times of crisis, ­anything is possible.Hardline Tory Brexiteers are now prepared to vote for ­Theresa May’s shattered EU Withdrawal Bill — as long as she ditches the wretched Northern Ireland backstop.Meanwhile, Germany is under siege from its political and industrial leaders, who are finally speaking out against a breach in trade and security ties with a vital European ally.Together this makes it ­possible to navigate a way through the thicket of bitterness and rancour which has soured ­politics, ided families and split the British nation.It requires a change of tack from Theresa May — never an easy ask.The PM’s deal is toxic because it hands Northern ­Ireland to Brussels as a ­province of the EU.Cutting out this tumour would win Mrs May the backing of at least  MPs, including Tory Brexiteers and the hardline DUP.Remainers would have ­little choice but to join in, giving Mrs May her majority and scuppering Jeremy ­Corbyn’s demands for a snap election.This might be seen as an impossible dream, not least because the hated backstop was allegedly invented in Downing Street, not Brussels.German negotiators pounced on an easy win.Now Berlin, the ultimate EU power broker, is facing fierce protests from industrialists over the risk to car, aerospace and engineering giantsBritain leaves with No Deal.“A hard Brexit would be disastrous,” says Dieter Kempf, head of Germany’s BDI — the equivalent of our Confederation of British Industry.“It would cause great dficulty for tens of thousands of companies and hundreds of thousands of workers on both sides.”Friday’s touching note from German politicians to The Times newspaper pleads with Britain to stay — or at least leave on friendly terms.But this is no love letter. It is hard-nosed realism.Signicantly, it bears the ­signature of Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, Angela Merkel’s chosen successor as Germany’s next Chancellor.Her appeal can be seen as a rebuke to Mrs Merkel, who rejected David Cameron’s plea for help to curb immigration, tipping ­Britain towards Brexit.Brits might have chosen dferentlyshe had responded to voters’ dismay not just in Britain but across the EU.She later signed her own political death warrant by flinging open Europe’s borders to a million Syrian migrants.But voters’ resentment towards arrogant EU leaders — recorded by their own Eurostat polling system — long predates immigration.Embattled French President Emmanuel Macron recently admitted he had dared not offer his voters a “Frexit”  ­referendum — because they would leave in a flash.Weeks later, his fears were confirmed as “yellow-vest” anarchists set Paris ablaze.French observers believe the gilets jaunes riots have their origins in another referendum crisis.In , France voted overwhelmingly against the European Constitution — only to see it renamed the Lisbon Treaty and slyly introduced against their express wishes.The European Constitution, like the disastrous euro, was a crucial but unpopular step towards a federal European superstate.Ireland and ­Denmark have also voted down EU moves to ever-closer union.They were told to vote again until they said Yes.Brussels’ arrogant contempt for ordinary voters — dismissed by one French president as “scum” — is what politicians blithely describe as the “democratic deficit”.It sowed the seeds for Brexit. Immigration simply brought it to a head.Germany’s letter to The Times reads like a plea from a deserted lover.“Without your great nation, this continent would not be what it is today — a community defined by freedom and ­prosperity,” writes Germany’s next Chancellor.“Should Britain wish to leave the European Union for good, it will always have friends in Germany and Europe.”This is precisely what British voters hoped for as they ­teetered on the brink of Remain but opted to Leave.They wanted a civilised orce between economic and diplomatic allies.This is still possiblethe border issue can be resolved.If we can persuade the IRA to decommission deadly weapons, surely we can decommission a backstop that nobody wants Theresa May’s rejected deal is not a total failure.

Luckily, as you may have read, some plucky entrepreneurs have come up with a solution. The Brexit Survival Kit contains ration-style meals with a seven-year shelf le, and boast enough nutritional value to keep you healthy through even the bleakest armageddon. The kit costs a cool pound, and troublingly includes fire-lighting gel in case the national grid goes down, and water puriers in case we have to drink out of the Thames. But these are ‘emergency’ rations - designed for the very worst case scenario. But whatthey’re not very nice    Surely the only thing worse than having to live in a post-apocalyptic wasteland is to then discover the food is terrible. So I decided, for the good of the country, that I would take one for the team and test them out. I ordered a three-day sample pack of the food included in the Brexit Survival Kit - and I’ll be eating nothing  until it’s all gone. You can keep up with my progress on Twitter. The good news is that washing up will be a thing of the past in post-Brexit apocalypse Britain. All the meals can be cooked and eaten in the bag. Just rip the top off, fill to the line with boiling water - like a Pot Noodle - and enjoy. That’s the idea, anyway. I’m only a couple of meals in, but I’ve got to be honest, they’re a bit grim.  Breakfast is ‘scrambled eggs with cheese’. Think of the eggs you’d find on a cheap hotel buffet. But they’ve been sat under a heat lamp until nearly lunchtime. Next up, lunch was ‘salmon and broccoli pasta.’ And there is nothing that can prepare you for the stench of freeze-dried fish. Imagine what a fishmonger’s bins might smell like the day before they’re collected. Luckily it tastes better than it smells. Which is to say, it doesn’t really taste of anything.   Oh, and did I mention these Brexit rations are made by the European Freeze Dry company  And the tagline is: Comfort food for turbulent times  Seriously. Thats printed on the packaging. The Government insist there’s no need to stockpile emergency rations. They say even in the worst possible no deal scenario - there’ll still be something to eat. And you’d better hope they’re right. Becausethey’re wrong, you too will be enjoying this freeze-dried lumpy mush in a couple of months.

Speaking from .pm on Blue Monday, supposedly most depressing day of the year, the Prime Minister will tell MPs her next steps after her Brexit deal suffered the biggest defeat in Commons history. But in a phone call with the Cabinet from Chequers last night, shes said to have claimed her plan will simply be another version of Plan A. In other words, getting concessions on the Irish backstop. Mrs May has already been trying to rework the backstop - which could trap the UK under EU customs rules in order to keep the Irish border open - for more than a month. And it shows shes shted her approach back to winning over Tory and DUP rebels - despite announcing cross-party talks just days ago.   She reportedly told her Cabinet something must be done to fix the backstop but was light on specics with no actual solutions proposed. And one plan was shot down today before she even stood up.  Mairead McGuinness, Fine Gael MEP and vice president of the European Parliament, said reports of a new treaty between the UK and Ireland to replace the Irish backstop were not an option.She told the BBC: Ireland is part of the European Union. The idea that one country of the  would have this particular arrangement with the United Kingdom, separate from what the EU does, really is not an option. I was quite surprised when I read the speculation yesterday.  Labour MP Chris Bryant fumed: Plan B is Plan A. Even after losing by  votes in the biggest defeat in parliamentary history, Mrs May insists on appeasing the right of her party rather than uniting the country.   Mrs May won some support from former Brexit Department aide Eddie Hughes, who said: I thinkshe comes up with a way of making sure that we can either leave unilaterally or making some sort of sunset clause on the backstop then that will go a long way to allaying my fears. And I would think the DUP would be keen to be involved as well then. And Tory ministers have renewed warnings they will resignshe pursues No Deal Brexit as a main strategy. One, Richard Harrington, said No Deal could shut Mini and Jaguar in an absolute disaster for the country. But Labour are demanding enters talks over a customs union with the EU - something she has now signalled she will rule out. Jeremy Corbyn also boycotted talks with Mrs May because she refused to rule out a no deal Brexit.   TUC General Secretary Frances OGrady suggested the PM had shown bad faith, saying: She needs to sht gear. She needs to show some good faith - that shes not just opening her door but opening her mind and her ears. Mrs May is said to be so desperate that No aides are considering a plan to rewrite parts of the Good Friday Agreement. And starting today, MPs will start to unveil a string of amendments to push forward their own Plan B. Many have talked about extending the March  date of Brexit and a vote on the next steps will be held on Tuesday  January.  Boris Johnson saidthe Brexit date was delayed, the reaction would be a vicious and unparalleled contempt for the whole political class. The Tory wrote of MPs in the Daily : By seeming so blatantly to go against the wishes of the electorate, they will contribute to a very damaging feeling of a gap – and a growing gap – between the public and the political elite.” But union chief Ms OGrady also called for the  March Brexit date to be delayed saying: Weve always said the people should have the final say on the deal either through a general election or a popular vote. She added: I can see this government collapsing under its own contradictions.

JLR has chiefly blamed a slump in sales in China and falling demand for diesel cars in Europe. Yet Business Secretary Greg Clark has also claimed Brexit would do extra damage to the firm. And today Mr Harrington told the BBC: Im not afraid of no drugs etc. But Im afraid of Jaguar closing, Mini closing, the le sciences industry closing and all the other things.  Because wed have no agreement that represents the way these businesses are integrated today. Asked why those firms could close he cited friction in the form of new rules on thousands of lorry movements. We cant suddenly say well its WTO [World Trade Organisation rules], we dont have an agreement with regulations, he said. This is fancul nonsense and it must be stopped.  Slamming Brexiteers in his own party, Mr Harrington said No Deal Brexit is supported by a minority of a minority of people. The PM doesnt support it. I support her deal, or a iation of it which Im sure were going to get back.  And publicly urging the Prime Minister to rule out No Deal, he said: She should in my view say we are responsible people, were going to do our duty to business and were going to rule out a no deal, because we want a great deal. Trade Secretary Liam Fox willmeet Aussie counterpart Simon Birmingham today for talks in the hope of a deal with a nation across the world. But in a blue-on-blue ministerial spat, Mr Harrington slammed the sham of pretend trade agreements that havent happened yet. It came as Theresa May prepared to unveil her Brexit Plan B to MPs from .pm today - amid claims she will simply copy her Plan A of trying to replace the Northern Ireland backstop. Last night another minister, Public Health Minister Steve Brine, told the BBCs Westminster Hour he would find it “very, very hard” to stay in governmentTheresa May pursued a “no deal” Brexit in full voice. “I’d find it very, very hard to do that and I think there are lots of us in the same place,” he said.

He said the government had already wasted pound.billion- equivalent to paying the annual salaries of , newly qualied nurses , secondary school teachers or , police constables. The Labour leader, who has boycotted Brexit talks with the PM, said: “May’s no-deal threat is empty and hugely expensive, wasting billions of pounds we should be spending on vital public services. It’s a pointless and damaging attempt to appease a faction in her own party when she now needs to reach out to overcome this crisis.” Mr Corbyn has called for no deal to be ruled out before he engages with the Prime Minister. Today Theresa May willto the Commons to set out her Plan B amid mounting claims she will be forced to delay Brexit. The beleaguered Prime Minister held a conference call with warring Cabinet colleagues on Sunday night in a bid to thrash out a way forward. Some ministers want her to rule out a no-deal exit, opening the door for talks with Labour over a pact which can pass the Commons.  But others insist she must keep the option of quitting without an agreement. It was also claimed her chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, told two Cabinet Ministers thatPlan B flops, the PM might have to offer to stand down in May in a bid to generate more support for her pact. The PM’s deal suffered a crushing -vote defeat last week, giving her until tonight to tell MPs what she plans to do next. A Cabinet Minister accused Remain-supporting MPs of trying to “hijack” Brexit, while Labour frontbencher Sir Keir Starmer believed extending Article  - the mechanism by which a country leaves the EU - was “inevitable”.   There was mounting speculation around a snap election as Tory chairman Brandon Lewis e-mailed supporters asking for cash for the partys campaigns war chest. “Every penny you give will help us put the policies you support into action,” he wrote. Braced for a fresh Commons mauling, the PM will face renewed calls to extend Article  - effectively delaying withdrawal beyond the March  scheduled departure date - when she addresses Parliament this afternoon. Mrs May will outline her next steps, paving the way for MPs to seek to box her in with their own demands. Some backbenchers want a second referendum, others a guarantee of a no-deal exit. There will also be attempts to impose a February  deadline to win Commons’ backing for a withdrawal agreement, or postpone Brexit for the rest of the year. MPs have a week to table amendments before a debate and series of votes next Tuesday. One plan reportedly drawn up by No involves an agreement between the UK and Ireland over the backstop, designed to prevent a hard border along the -mile frontier separating the Republic and Northern Ireland, in the event of a no-deal departure. The plan would sideline the EU until Brussels was asked to rubberstamp it. But Ireland’s Deputy PM Simon Coveney tweeted his “continued support for the EU UK agreed WAin full, including the Backstop as negotiated”. Chairman of the Conservative Party’s  Committee of backbench MPs, Sir Graham Brady, believed Mrs May could pass her Brexit dealthe backstop “can be sorted out”. He told BBC Radio  Live’s Pienaar’s Politics: “So much of the vote against was from people who simply cannot support a potentially permanent backstop,that can be sorted out then I think we might get that withdrawal agreement through.” International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said a solution could be “getting an agreement with Ireland on an alternative mechanism to ensure that we don’t get friction across the Northern Ireland-Ireland border”.  Warning of a “political tsunami”the Government failed to deliver on the  vote, the Cabinet Minister feared the political consequences of reneging on the referendum result would be “astronomical”. He also accused some MPs of trying to “steal” the result from voters. “You’ve got a Leave population and a Remain Parliament Parliament has not got the right to hijack the Brexit process because Parliament said to the people of this country, ‘We make a contract with you, you will make the decision and we will honour it’,” he told BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show. “What we are now getting is some of those who always absolutely opposed the result of the referendum trying to hijack Brexit and in fact steal the result from the people.” He refused to rule out resigningthe PM agreed to place the UK in a customs union with the EU or extend Article . “I don’t think people should go round saying they’re going to resign, it makes it much more about them than the principle or about the voters and that’s what we should be concentrating on,” said Dr Fox. There was a small boost for the PM when leading Leaver Jacob Rees-Mogg said “even Mrs May’s deal would be better than not leaving at all”. Senior Labour MP Hilary Benn, who chairs the Commons Brexit Committee, said the PM’s “mind appears to be completely closed” to compromising. He said a second referendum maybe neededParliament was deadlocked.   But Labour former Europe Minister Caroline Flint, who backed Remain but now supports Brexit, said: “We had a referendum, people had their say. “They wanted to get a deal and actually, we should be saying, get no-deal off the table but get Remain off the table as well.” Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir warned the clock was ticking to March . He said: “It’s extremely dficult to see how the Prime Minister can achieve what needs to be achieved in  days and therefore I think it is inevitable Article  will have to be extended whatever decision is taken. “I don’t think we can get what needs to be done in the next  days and the blame with that lies with the Prime Minister.” But ex-Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab urged the PM to rule out extending Article . He told Sky News: “If there is an attempt to reverse the referendum - stop Brexit altogether - I think that will cut across not only the democratic mandate, the biggest in history that we’ve had, but I think alsoyou look at current public opinion and how it’s shted by two to one, people want us to respect the referendum.” Meanwhile, Commons Speaker John Bercow could scrap plans to quit this summer after Cabinet Ministers threatened to deny him a peerage over of his alleged Remain “bias”, it was claimed.

The new host of the flagship discussion show is said to have mocked, off camera, a black woman enduring terrible racist misogyny, then, with an ignorant intervention, triggered audience ridicule as we watched at home. It puts the public service broadcaster in crisis. The BBC’s authority and legitimacy, in a fractured Britain, are under the gravest strain since it disgracefully acted as the official mouthpiece for a Tory Government during the  General Strike. So to refuse an on-air apology is the hubristic obstinacy of a corporation digging itself into a deeper hole.   Abbott must be scrutinised and held accountable like any other politician, but the BBC inadvertently legitimised the awful hounding of the most abused MP in Westminster, rape and death threats depressingly regular because of her heritage and gender. The mealy-mouthed admission that Bruce blundered by agreeing with Brextremist Isabel Oakeshott’s incorrect assertion that Labour was “way behind in the polls” isn’t good enough. A supposedly impartial host undermined Abbott’s accurate “we are kind of level-pegging” retort with her glibly erroneous dig that Corbyn’s lot were “definitely” behind. Why Labour are not streets ahead in the polls is a frequent criticism of mine, though the party has accurately pointed out that it has recently led in as many as it has been behind in. Bruce must also be made to explain why, according to Labour’s count, she interrupted Abbott  times and Tory minister Rory Stewart just nine and the SNP’s Kirsty Blackman only eight  The row over what Bruce said about Abbott before filming, including claims she suggested the MP owed a seat in the Shadow Cabinet to a past relationship with Corbyn, could be resolved immediately by releasing unbroadcast footage. When internet “fake news” is the enemy of the truth, the BBC would be stronger owning its mistakes instead of ducking responsibility. I can live with the broadcaster’s establishment bias and tire of wilder partisan attacks from Left and Right. Andrew Neil is the media’s best interviewer by miles, and I recently intervened outside Parliament to defend BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg from a threatening mob. It is as a critical friend of the BBC that I urge it to apologise formally and fulsomely to Abbott.

It might be possible to buy a house in the country for as little as pound, - the price of a brand new family car.However, buyers can expect to shell out for renovation work and have to compromise on space, Wales Online reports.

Demonique and Thabo Wilson, from Salford, Manchester, say their five children have gradually been left with no friends to play with.They also claim their bins have not been collected for six years, forcing them to take their rubbish to the tip themselves. And because, they say, nobody would buy their home, they are now stuck in limbo, the Manchester Evening News reports. The last of the Wilsons  neighbouring families moved out of Holcombe Close in Pendleton nine years ago amid a pound million regeneration project.  All of the familys neighbouring properties on the small ghost estate have been either torn down or cleared out, and just one row of six terraced houses remain. Five of those have been boarded up, and the Wilsons claim they can no longer even access basic services from their local authority. But council bosses say the reason the familys bins do not get collected is because they dont leave them out. Mr Wilson told the MEN that he has lost count of the number of times his family has been targeted by vandals and burglars . Rats and bats allegedly entering their home from nearby abandoned properties also pose a constant headache for the family of seven. Mr Wilson, , a mental health nurse and trainee church minister, claimed: We suffer. Weve had our windows smashed, the car vandalised. Ive lost count of the amount of times weve called police . There is no-one for the kids to play with. Normal kids they have friends in their neighbourhood. Our eldest children, their friends have all moved. Our youngest children think this is normal because its all theyve known. But its not normal. It has to be brought to the publics attention so more families dont suffer like we have. The Holcombe Close falls under the remit of the Pendleton PFIproject, a -year regeneration project which will come to approximately pound million. The Wilsons are in the middle of a long-running legal battle with Salford City Council, which they claim has breached their human rights by not offering them a new-build house as a replacement. Six years ago, a judge ruled in their favour, although the case was later put on hold following an appeal by the council. The family is currently unable to sell their home to a private buyer, and refuse to sell to the council until they are guaranteed another council property in the area. Mrs Wilson, , said: We do not feel safe here, our kids do not feel safe. They do not have neighbours. There is no-one for them to play with. We feel like we are on our own. We cannot sell to a private buyer, because we are attached to five derelict houses that the council want to demolish. Nobody would buy this home, so we are limbo. We are stuck.  We are paying our council tax, but we are not even getting basic services like getting our bins collected. We have to take our rubbish to the tip. What are we paying for  Councillor Tracy Kelly, the lead member for housing and neighbourhoods at Salford City Council, said: “We need to buy this property as part of a poundmillion regeneration scheme which started in . The whole area needs to be cleared and replaced with a mix of brand new up-to-date homes which will cater for local needs which includes homes for families, people with disabilities and those who need affordable housing. “Every effort has been made to agree a value for the property and find suitable alternative accommodation for the resident. This has included offers of new and refurbished rented accommodation in the area which have been rejected. We will continue to work with the family to find a satisfactory resolution. Holcombe Close receives the same service as the rest of the city but no bins are left outside the property.

The couple met in a pub in Eastwood and later married in June . Housewe Jacqui, , revealed how John took on her five-year-old daughter Anna, which was a huge thing. Four boys and three girls followed, including their youngest, who is now .  Jacquisaid: It was never a plan to have a big family but when we had a loft conversion it just went from there. He wasalways a gentleman who wouldn’t let you walk on the roadside. We could talk for hours and never ran out of things to say. Le wasn’t perfect but at the moment the good outweighs any of the bad. The best memory Ive got is him taking me to see Bryan Adams. Its not the sort of thing we ever did but it was on my bucket list and he surprised me with tickets. It was our biggest date night ever. Johnsmum Gwyn, said: John always went for a drink with his dad every Saturday night after he moved out. When his dad passed away five years ago I went out with him every Saturday.

He was rescued by pensioner Roy Warne who said Prince Philip told his we he had been dazzled by the sun before the crash. The new images were taken ton Sunday and show the low winter sun shining through the trees onto the junction where the Duke of Edinburgh pulled onto the A in Norfolk.

The Duke of Edinburgh was not injured in the crash, which is now being investigated by police. Two women in the Kia were taken to hospital and treated for minor injuries and then discharged.

She was chauffeured to church on the Sandringham estate today for the weekly Sunday service, but the Duke did not attend. He is recuperating at Wood Farm in a secluded corner of the Royal estate, surrounded by fields and trees.

All you are really thinking about day-to-day is the next game and getting three points.“Maybe afterwards there will be people talking about it and you are pleased you’ve got a win for him because it is the first time he’s been here.“Before a game, though, it’s not something we’re thinking about.”And,Nesbitt and his team-mates would have liked to have played better in front of the man who pays their wages, he believes the owner could take encouragement from the way United battled for three big points.In danger of being detached at the turn of the year, back-to-back defeats for Ross County and Ayr have left United just one win off the pace in the battle for automatic promotion.And,the former Celtic kid would have liked to have put on a better show for everyone who was at Tannadice, he knows getting the job done mattered most.“Three points and the results where went our way, that makes it a good day.“It was, obviously, a bit of a battle but we got there in the end and that’s what matters.Performance-wise it wasn’t the best and we would expect to play a lot better than that and put on a show but sometimes circumstances in a game mean it doesn’t go that way and then you need to grind it out and win it.”If Nesbitt was nothing like satisfied with his own display, he had the consolation of knowing for the second week running he played a part in a vital goal.His debut against Partick saw him win the penalty to earn United a point and on Saturday he provided the cross for Nicky Clark’s dramatic late winner.“It’s good to contribute when you’re new and I’ve done that in my first two games.“My game play against Dunfermline wasn’t good enough but to make contributions is important andI’m still making those contributions when I’m playing better I will be happy.”In setting up the all-important goal, Nesbitt showed character. He had not been happy with his performance but he wasn’t going to hide.“I had a pass that went nowhere and, before the goal, a cross that went right to their keeper.“When that happens you can put your head down and go into a shell, especially in a game like that one but you just need to keep going, believe in yourself.“I kept going and when I saw Cammy I cut it back to him. It came back out to me and I saw a couple of boys running. Nicky made a brilliant run and when I saw him I just put it in that area and let him meet it. He’s done that and finished brilliantly.

It wasn’t good when we lost.“That feeling is one you don’t want again and results like that one just show you can’t take anything for granted.“Teams in Scotland in all the leagues have good players and,you don’t have the proper approach, you will have problems.”And Stanton expects Montrose to battle tooth and nail to cause a shock tomorrow but believes United will be ready to cope with that.“These are dficult games because you know one team is giving everything they can to beat you because they have that nothing-to-lose mentality about them.“I’ve been there myself in those cup-ties when I was with Dumbarton, where you play teams who are bigger than your club and you don’t normally play against.“It excites you and it’s a chance for you to show how good you are. It’s why,you’re the bigger team, you can never take these games for granted.”He believes the key to avoiding a shock is treating the opposition with the respect they deserve and working towards the tie asit was a big game.“We have prepared for this one like we do every other game and that makes sure you have the right attitude.“The manager has had his videos of Montrose and been telling us about their strengths and weaknesses.“That way you make sure you are going into the game with the right mentality.”And,promotion from the Championship this term is by far the No  goal, Stanton admits he would love to go as far as possible in the cup.“A cup run is always important for the supporters and we know that.“For the players as well, it’s nice to do well and, as a football club, it is always important that we go as far as we can in the cup.“It’s another game we want to win and,you can string some wins together in the league and add a cup run to that as well, it’s always a help.”Stanton is also well aware that a side story tomorrow will be Tangerines legend Sean Dillon coming up against them for the first time since he ended a -year stay at Tannadice in .He expects the man who won the cup with United in  to get a rousing welcome from Arabs but, once that is out of the way and the game kicks off, it will be business as usual.“Sean left before I arrived at United but I know what a good player he was for the club.“He was here a long time and I’m sure he will get a good reception from our fans who travel up there.“For us, it’s about making sure he’s not the one getting clapped off the pitch after the game has finished.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/01/5c4079a3cf34a9.68815705.jpg ","title":"dundee winger andy dales looking to make instant impact","story":"Dundee winger Andy Dales is hoping to hit the ground running after checking in at Dens Park on loan from Scunthorpe United.The -year-old former Derby County youth academy product has joined up with the Dark Blues until the end of the season and goes straight into the squad for Saturday’s Scottish Cup fourth-round visit of Queen of the South.It was a deal that was agreed quickly, so much so, the England C international had to race north on Monday morning to complete the move.He has been in training with Jim McIntyre’s men since and is hoping to make his debut at Dens this weekend.“It’s been really good, I had a little chat with the gaffer on Tuesday morning and have had some intense training sessions so I’m really looking forward to it,” said Dales.“I only found out on Monday morning.

I’ve enjoyed it, the lads, the training, everything about it has been good,” said the man who is teaming up again with boss Jim McIntyre after their time together at Ross County.“The fitness levels are really good and the lads are at it. You can see they are up for the fight and there is some really good quality here, there’s no doubt about that, so it’s looking promising.”And the Liverpudlian believes three weeks off has given Dundee the chance to recharge their batteries.“I think the break has been a good thing, mentally in particular. I’ve been in this position and sometimes when you are in that rut when you are finding it dficult to pick up points it’s nice to have that break.“Mentally and physically you get away from it and then you come back in like it’s almost a new season, so I think it has been welcome.“And the mood here has been good but I don’t think I’ve been surprised by that because the lads know there is enough here and we are adding a few more bodies, so we know we have what’s needed.“We are up for a fight and you can see that looking round.”Curran believes that willingness, starting with tomorrow’s cup-tie, to do whatever it takes to get wins will be vital in the coming weeks.“There are times when it’s not going to be pretty because of where we’re at. There is going to be that sense of anxiousness going into games but we have that hunger and drive to overcome that.“There might be games that are ugly but these are ones we need to make sure we go on and win.“Whether we scrap it out - or -, we have to win and, once we do, we can then go and play a bit like I know we are capable of.”If, on paper, Dundee have been handed the perfect opportunity to report back with a win by being paired with a side from the second tier, Curran knows they’ll have to perform to make the next round.His time at Tannadice taught him there are decent outfits in that ision and, after facing them twice, he puts Queens in that category.“This is not going to be an easy game, just because they are in the Championship, no one can think that.“They have boys who are good players – Stephen Dobbie is on fire right now with his goals.“So, the mentality is the one thing we have to make sure is right and that’s not something I think we have an issue with. We have to make sure we come out on top, that’s our aim.”Curran also took the opportunity to stress he left United on good terms and thanked Tangerines boss Robbie Neilson for allowing him to move early in the January window.“I had a good relationship with Robbie and I only have good things to say about him.“The style he wanted was to play with one striker and Pavol Safranko has been the best player at United by a margin, I feel.“I understood that and he understood what an opportunity this move was for me.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/5c051af07378a-e1543840266799-940x555.jpg ","title":"tom duthie scottish football should never allow merger of dundees clubs","story":"The latest outbreak of merger fever in Dundee was no more than another in a long list of  alarms among the city’s football public.It’s not unlike the hypochondriac who catches a cold and immediately thinks he’s gone down with pneumonia.The revelation Dundee owner Tim Keyes wants to increase his shareholding to over % and remove the right of the club’s supporters’ society to veto any merger with neighbours United, had temperatures running high.With another American, Mark Ogren, now in control at Tannadice, fans of both clubs had been examining the “symptoms” and reached the diagnosis that a coming together was desired.That shows the accusation the media never let the facts get in the way of a good story can also, sometimes, be levelled at supporters.All along a forensic examination of the timeline of those symptoms strongly suggested this had everything to do with Keyes wanting to be able to build his new stadium at Camperdown without having to get the go-ahead from the fans’ group.Moving away from Dens is another on the list of protected items they can block and,Keyes is going to spend millions on “Nou Campie”, it’s not stretching the imagination to see why he might not want to need permission from a group that won’t be asked to inject a penny.More signicant is the fact Dundee first raised the matter months ago – before Ogren was on the scene at United. Even though this was a case of putting two and two together and getting five, it shows, despite merger being mooted and quickly dismissed on numerous occasions down the decades, it remains a worrying subject for the fans.And while those further afield may see a lot of sense in a one-club city, for those punters who actually turn up at Dens and Tannadice, it is the nightmare scenario. They’ll take hard times like financial crisis and relegation and stick with their team but what they’d never do is watch a merged team.That alone is why such a move is too dangerous. The clubs should always take the “nos” of the fans who go to games over the “I woulds” of potential new customers of a ‘Dundee City’.There is every chance a build-it-and-they-will-come merger would leave us with a club only slightly bigger than the two that exist.That wouldn’t just be bad for the city but Scottish football and it makes it surprising that, when the topic is raised, no one at the top of the game has come out against it.While sporting performance is rightly the normal criteria for the make-up of our top ision,ever it was to be done on size of club, Dundee and United would be in there – and comfortably so.If Premiership membership was decided on that second basis the top  would be something like Celtic, Rangers, Aberdeen, Hearts, Hibs, Dundee United, Dundee, Motherwell, Kilmarnock, St Johnstone, Falkirk and St Mirren.The likes of Morton, Dunfermline and Inverness may argue they should be in there but it would be on the basis they have more potential than the names at the end of that list.When it comes to core support, the first seven clubs listed are untouchable. If Glasgow giants Rangers or Celtic, on their own, are bigger than the rest put together, those from the country’s three other major cities are also well ahead of the others below them.To reiterate, in all but exceptional circumstances, results should determine who’s in the top league, so it’s up to the likes of United to get back there by winning matches.But when the Tangerines and the Dark Blues are in the top flight, Scottish football is the better for it.That will always be the case."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-launches-veggie-happy-meals-as-greggs-sells-vegan-sausage-rolls","story":"MCDONALDrsquoS restaurants across Glasgow have launched their first-ever vegetarian Happy Meal for children from today."},{"url":null,"title":"richard-madden-flashback-to-when-rising-actor-spoke-to-the-evening-times","story":"RENFREWSHIRE actor Richard Madden has picked up a Golden Globe for his role in gripping BBC drama Bodyguard."},{"url":null,"title":"sir-andy-murray-from-dunblane-to-double-olympic-champion","story":"FROM gangly, wild-haired teenager to one of Britainrsquos great sporting heroes, Sir Andy Murray may have been forced to hang up his rackets but his impact will be felt for generations."},{"url":null,"title":"dennys-bosses-slam-unforgiving-customers-after-being-bombarded-with-terrible-reviews","story":"DENNYrsquoS bosses have hit back at ldquounforgiving customers who have left negative feedback after visiting the dinerrsquos newly-opened branch near Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"whisky-galore-as-glasgows-tall-ship-gets-go-ahead-to-sell-drams","story":"VISITORS at Glasgowrsquos Tall Ship will be able to treat themselves to an unusual souvenir as they walk along the decks of the historic asset."},{"url":null,"title":"university-celebrates-life-of-engineer-james-watt","story":"The pioneering work of James Watt will be celebrated by the University of Glasgow with a year of events marking  years since the engineerrsquos death."},{"url":null,"title":"planning-application-for-new-drive-thru-starbucks-in-denniestoun","story":"A planning application to transform land nexta Dennistoungarage into a drive-thruStarbucks is awaiting council approval."},{"url":null,"title":"more-plunging-temperatures-and-winter-weather-on-the-way","story":"Disruptive snow and plunging temperatures could be set tohitGlasgow next week."},{"url":null,"title":"owen-hassan-memory-page-set-up-for-tragic-dad-of-three","story":"Friends of tragic dad-of-three Owen Hassan who diedafter being attackedlast year have set up a memory page for him."},{"url":null,"title":"celtic-2-airdrie-0-celtic-3-airdrie-0-scott-sinclair-and-timo-weah-send-celtic-through-scottish-cup-tie","story":"A double from Scott Sinclair and a debut strike from Timo Weah - who even got a flash of the disco lights for his troubles - eased Celtic into the fth round of the William Hill Scottish Cup.

Invited to join Cameron up at the Cruachan dam for the second of his two recent programmes, I was delighted to tramp the mighty mountain with Scotland’s Number one authority on outdoor pursuits.As an author and broadcaster, Cameron always has an eye on a good story, and so as well as asking me about the lack of health and safety regulations at the time the hydro project was being built, he also wanted to knowthere really was a murder during the construction. There was, as I told him, a body – but the body wasn’t identied, no arrests were made, no court case took place.It would be a shamethat construction period went down in history as an invasion of , workmen – #Tunnel Tigers# as they were dubbed – into one of Argyll#s most beautul settings and a possible murder.My book was intended to give the story of the local people whose lives were punctuated by this ambitious construction project. Quite rightly, those Tunnel Tigers had been lauded in a number of publications. The work that was done hollowing out Argyll’s highest mountain to provide electricity for the nation was amazing.The plan for Cruachan – as for the other major hydro projects of the post World War II era – was conceived by Tom Johnston, to whom I dedicated my book. Johnston was a politician who remained true to his ideals of bringing rural Scotland into the modern world. There was no power in the Highlands, and without power there could be no industry and no prosperity. The engineering genius was Sir Edward MacColl, whose biographer Norrie Fraser called him #a maker of modern Scotland#.Cruachan was the first reversible pumped-storage system in the world. During its years of construction from  to , eminent international engineers visited the project to see how the water was pumped between two reservoirs through reversible turbine generators. At off-peak hours, the water was – is # pumped back up to the reservoir you see high up in the corrie above Loch Awe, held back by a dam that is now so much a part of our landscape. The loch itself is the lower reservoir.I had imagined that the scale of such a project – using Scotland’s top engineering companies who shipped in workers from other parts of the UK and Europe – would have been a cause for resentment and protest by local people.That, of course, failed to take account of the vision of the folk of Dalmally, Lochawe, and Taynuilt. Although it took men with engineering experience to blast the  miles of tunnels, hollow out the mountain itself, and construct the dam, there was also a need for a support army. There were clerks and porters, joiners and caterers, folk willing to let out a room, a caravan, a house, serve in a pub where just occasionally it was necessary to keep a baseball bat behind the bar to maintain bonhomie. The project kick started careers, fortunes and marriages, and gave the area good roads and a tourist industry.If you haven’t visited the hollow mountain or walked Cruachan’s slopes, make  the year you do.[In bold please] Cruachan: The Hollow Mountain is available from the Argyll Book Centre in Lochgilphead and all good book shops, along with Marian Pallister#s other books of local interest.PICS:The Pass of Brander before work started. no_aCruachanLe before the project # the Loch Awe Hotel with steamers. no_aCruachanThe Queen opening the project in October . no_aCruachanWorking on the  miles of tunnels. no_aCruachanWorking on the road to the dam, overlooking Loch Awe. no_aCruachan"},{"url":null,"title":"sports club lotteries 9","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowDrawn on Monday January , Kilmory Camanachd Club#s lottery numbers were ,  and .

That resilience is running out, and this is particularly true for hill sheep and suckler cow farmers.#And you would think that with the weather we#ve had through  , the results of the lambing and store lamb sales this season we would have a cast iron argument to maintain LFASS support # and to increase it with a top-up for harsh weather.

We deliver on landscapes, bioersity, air and water quality, cultural heritage, animal health and welfare.#Think how bioersity would be maintained without farmers and crofters managing the grazing land.#In many parts of Argyll you#re lucky to see sheep and cattle grazing. It#s no longer viable, yet without grazing by farm animals the bioersity changes.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13865741.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/2_JS172700549.jpg","title":"brexit conservative remainer mp admits","story":"NewsBrexit: Conservative Remainer MP admits he would consider voting Leave in second referendumBill Grant says \"arrogance\" from EU negotiators may push him towards voting Leaveany second referendum arose.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN NewsBill Grant MP \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA Scots Tory MP says he would consider performing a Brexit u-turnBritain goes back to the polls.

Tory group leader Martin Dowey made the plea for the area to be more car-friendly following the announcement of the closure of Hourstons last week. Councillor Dowey urged the council to ease parking charges in the High Street in a bid to encourage more footfall to the area. Speaking at Seafield, Fort and Wallacetown Community Council last Wednesday, he said: “I am frustrated and saddened at Hourstons closing. “Given the retail climate, it wasn’t unexpected.” The councillor said internet and retail park shopping had contributed to the demise of town centres across the country. “Town centre shops need to be smaller and more niche,” he added. “The town centre is far too big for the size of Ayr.   “We need to utilise what we have got to encourage footfall.” SNP ward councillor Siobhian Brown is disappointed that the iconic store is to close and said a long-term plan is needed to attract more people back to the town centre. “It is a sign of times as people buy online,” she added. Norman McLean, the community council’s chairman, said: “It didn’t get the footfall. It was only a couple of months ago I was in the store and I felt like I was the only person there. “Has the council got any contingency plans  “What about waiving the cost of the first hour parking at parking meters ” The meeting heard that Hourstons were paying pound, per year in business rates before they started paying staff and other costs. Now the iconic building could be turned into flats or used by the council for offices.   Councillor Dowey added: “We need more parking and we have to bring cars back into the High Street. “The one-way system brought in the s was probably a good idea then but it is not such a good idea now. “People don’t drive down the High Street as much any more and they don’t see how bad the bottom end is. “I am guilty as anyone because I go to Heathfield for shopping because you can get parking there.” One community councillor said more must be done to attract sport and culture to the town centre to get people back there. “Retail cannot be sustained,” he insisted. “We need cultural tourism to do draw people into the town centre.” Another pointed out that shops in Prestwick and Troon are thriving: “The dference between Prestwick and Ayr is that they have all small units and in Ayr it is all big High Street units for the past  or  years. Big units cost too much.” "},{"url":null,"title":"travel-to-hawick-music-club-by-tuba","story":"FUN and frolics as well as fantastic music are on the cards when Travelling by Tuna land in the Borders.The irrepressible duo of Chris Cranham and Stewart Death tell the story of the tuba from its early origins using wind and brass instruments from all over the worldAudiences at next weekends performance for Hawick Music Club can expect a , year-old Swiss Alpine Horn, a Roman Cornu and a Zulu Warriors Kurdu Horn just for starters.From the East there will be a pair of Tibetan Dungs, which are played by the Buddhist Monks, and a Chinese Dragon -Headed Trumpet.And you could be introduced to the Cimbassa - a cross between a Tuba and Trombone.Vanda Mercer from Hawick Music Club said: \"Having been established for  years Travelling by Tuba is now on its final tour so this performance is not to be missed.\"Travelling by Tubas repertoire begins with The Hungarian Dance No  by Brahms.A selection of Africans spirituals follows with three beautul melodies, My Lord What a Morning, By and By and Deep River.Handels first oboe concert is next, along with the third movement of Mozarts fourth concerto for horn which is full of fun and le.

I had a lot of balls left because Georgie loved them and my other dog doesnt so I put them in the box at the Gattonside end of chain bridge.\"Since then someone has attached it to the gate and people have been borrowing the balls and putting them back and even adding new ones.\"I just want the box to remind owners to enjoy every moment with their dog.\"Georgie passed away in May last year after contracting Alabama rot, also known as Cutaneous and Renal Glomerular Vasculopathy .Only appearing to affect dogs, the disease damages the lining of blood vessels in the skin and kidney, resulting in ulceration of the skin and kidney damage.The condition can affect any breed or age of dog and a proportion can go on to develop severe, acute kidney failure, which is often fatal.Lynsay and her dogs Georgie and Taffy used to walk along the river most days and it was after one of these walks that she noticed Georgie had lesions on her legs.\"It was after a walk in Gattonside one Saturday that I saw that she had sores on her legs so I took her to the vet on Monday and she was given some cream.\"But she went downhill fast and by Wednesday her poo was black, which I later learnt was a sign that her kidneys were failing.\"I took her to the vets again where she was given a cone to stop her licking the sores but by Friday the vets suspected it was Alabama rot and put her on a drip and kept her in overnight hoping that she would improve.\"But on Saturday we were told that her kidneys had stopped working and she wasnt going to get better.\"I took Taffy with me to spend some time with her and then she got put to sleep.\"Alabama rot was first recorded in the UK in  and the number of cases has risen each year. Georgies was the first confirmed case in the Borders.Lynsay said: \"The only way that you can be sure it is Alabama rot is to have a post mortem so Georgie was then taken to the Dick Vet in Edinburgh where it was confirmed that she had had Alabama rot. My other dog was tested for it but thankfully the results were clear.\"The Kennel Club is warning dog owners to be extra vigilant at this time of year as the peak season for the disease is between November and May.Caroline Kisko, Kennel Club Secretary said: ldquoAlthough the disease is very rare, affecting an extremely low percentage of dogs in the UK, the condition is very serious and potentially le-threatening. It is therefore vital that owners understand and recognise the warning signs, especially as time plays a signicant part in successfully treating the disease.ldquoWe are asking owners to look out for any signs of Alabama rot during the winter months and to remember to take action right away. Any dogs with unexplained or concerning skin lesions which typically look like sores, ulcers, or red, swollen, bruised areas, commonly with an infected appearance should be taken to their vet as soon as possible. These skin changes are usually found on their paws or lower legs, but may also appear on their head, face or lower body. Dogs who have contracted the disease may also become tired, disinterested in food, or present other signs of illness like vomiting or diarrhoea.ldquoAlthough these signs may not necessarily mean your dog has Alabama rot, acting quickly and speaking to a vet to determine what is wrong is the best course of action to protect your petrsquos health.While large amounts of research have been carried out over the last six years, the cause of the disease remains unknown. As yet, no evidence has been found to suggest that CRGV is caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, toxins, or radiation.

This apple is magic and is found at the top of a tall ancient tree, which grows deep in a dark forest.ldquoTo get to the tree first you must find your way through the forest. Then you will come to a circular clearing, where there are no trees except the ancient tall apple tree.ldquoThis tree grows in the middle of the clearing and its single fruit, the apple of your dreams, can be seen on its topmost branch.The storyteller looked round his audience.ldquoWill you try to reach it and pick it to make your dream come true  he asked.The children all answered yes.ldquoThen first you must decide what your dreams are.ldquoBe rich, was a common response. The storyteller smiled and nodded: ldquoYes we all have dreams of being rich, but rich in what  Rich in love and happiness, or rich in money and things ldquoItrsquos the same, said one child. ldquoI donrsquot think it is, said another, looking at the storyteller. ldquoIs it ldquoThat is a good question, replied the storyteller, ldquofor sure having too little money is not a good thing. And the world is an unfair place where those who have too much money and too many things keep it to themselves, so those who have too little money never get their fair share, even though there is sufficient for everyone to have enough.ldquoSo I want to be one of those that has too much! declared one member of the class, to laughter.ldquoAndso would you share what you have with others who do not have enough  asked the storyteller.The child paused for a moment for thought: ldquoMaybe some of it.Other children voiced dferent opinions. ldquoIrsquod keep it all, ldquoIrsquod share it, ldquoIrsquod give some to my family and friends.It created some discussion amongst the children.The teacher was going to ask the children to be quiet and listen to the storyteller, but he indicated he was happy with what was happening.ldquoBut then yoursquod end up being poor again, said one. ldquoNo, Irsquod not give it all away.ldquoBut the whole point of being rich is that you can do what you want.ldquoWell, it also means you can help other people.The storyteller listened to the debate for a minute or two, then he beat his drum to regain the childrenrsquos attention.ldquoAnd so, for most here, money will be your dream. I understand that. Nobody wants to be poor. But lots of money is not really your dream.A chorus of: ldquoYes it is!ldquoNo, replied the storyteller, ldquomoney is not your dream, it is what you spend it on, what it might make possible for you that you do not have now, that would be your dream. That is what you must think of before you set out on your quest.ldquoBecauseyou pick the apple of your dreams, but have no dreams for your le, then you will still be poor, evenyou have all the money in the world.ldquoThatrsquos just stupid, said one boy. The teacher was quick to remind him not to be rude, but the storyteller asked him: ldquoWhat is stupid ldquoWhat yoursquove just said, you canrsquot be pooryou are rich, that doesnrsquot make sense. Thatrsquos what I meant is stupid.The storyteller smiled. ldquoPerhaps you are right, but do you think sometimes people can also be poor in things that money canrsquot buy There was silence for a moment. Then a girl said: ldquoYou mean people can be poor in dreams for their le The storyteller smiled and nodded.ldquoPrecisely, said the storyteller. ldquoThe whole issue of getting rich has stopped us thinking about what our dreams actually are.ldquoI want to be a dancer, said one child. ldquoI want to drive fast cars, said another.ldquoI still want to be rich so I donrsquot have to do anything and just play computer games.ldquoI want to make the computer games, said his friend. ldquoYeah, me too, agreed his pal.ldquoI want to be the President! another said.ldquoI just want to be happy!The storyteller beat his drum again.ldquoAnd so before you set off on your quest you must think about your dreams. And let me tell you that dreams can be shared too.ldquoHowrsquod you do that  he was asked.The storyteller thought for a moment: ldquoWell, for some their dream may be to save an animal that is in danger of being extinct.ldquoOr save the planet, called out another.ldquoThatrsquos why I want to be President.ldquoSo I want you to think about your dreams, and once you have you got your dreams you are ready for your quest into the forest, said the storyteller.The children assembled their thoughts and soon everyone had a collection of dreams to take with them to the apple tree.ldquoThere is one more thing I forgot to tell you, said the storyteller. ldquoItrsquos an important piece of information. You see, when you finally get to the clearing you must be very careful, for wrapped around the base of the ancient apple tree there is a ferocious dragon.ldquoIt sleeps, but very lightly. It will wake when you approach the tree. It will hear you no matter how quiet. It will hear your heartbeat. And there is no place to hide in the clearing. The moment you approach the tree, the dragon will pounce on you.ldquoCan the dragon fly  asked one.ldquoYes.ldquoAnd breathe fire ldquoYes.There were murmurings.ldquoAnd so, the storyteller continued, ldquoyou must decide how you will overcome and defeat the dragon. It is there to stop you reaching the apple of your dreams.Some of the children came up with immediate ideas:ldquoIrsquod run as fast as I could in zig zags.ldquoIrsquod distract the dragon.ldquoIrsquod shoot the dragon with a gun.ldquoIrsquod make a giant kite and fly to the apple.ldquoIrsquod take some friends and feed them to the dragon while I get the apple, then dream my friends back again.There were many solutions and the storyteller listened to them with interest. Each child came up with a dferent strategy.The storyteller nodded, explaining the powers of the dragon that it couldnrsquot be killed by bullets or blades or fire, that it was faster than lightning and once it had heard you and seen you it would go for you.ldquoKnowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams They all said yes, refining their ideas.And so once the children had come up with their final strategy, the storyteller asked them to think about what they might need to take with them to defeat the dragon. They will have to carry these things through the forest, or perhaps collect them on the way.Then the storyteller set the children the task of drawing the things they would need and then the dragon and apple tree. In drawing the apple they would have to decide what the apple of their dreams would look like.When this was all done, the children settled down to hear who had the right answer.ldquoI have looked at all the ideas, said the storyteller. ldquoWhat I must say is that le is unfair and so is this quest. For some, the journey through the forest will be longer than others. The dragon will be more dficult to defeat for some than others, as its mood changes. But you have all come up with the same answer, and so you are all right.There were howls of protest.ldquoNo, we didnrsquot we all have dferent answers!The storyteller beat his drum again to calm the children.ldquoWell yes, you all have dferent ideas on how to defeat the dragon and reach the apple, that is true. But you all have the same answer to the most important question.ldquoWhatrsquos that  the children asked.ldquoWell, said the storyteller, ldquoI had told you how fierce and dreadful the dragon could be. And then I asked youknowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams.ldquoAnd you all said yes, yoursquod try to reach your dreams, even though you had a big fight on your hands.ldquoThat, I believe, is the right answer. You may have dferent ideas on how to get that apple, but yoursquore all right because each of you will have to fight the dragon in a dferent way. The most important thing is your determination to get to that apple.ldquoWhatafter all that we fail  asked one child.ldquoYou might, said the storyteller, ldquobut on your journey to your dreams you may find a new path that leads to another ancient tree without a dragon.ldquoTherersquos another magic apple tree without a dragon !ldquoPerhaps, perhaps not. But the only way to find out is set off on the journey with determination in your heart. You might realise on the journey that your dreams are easier to reach than you had thought, or it could be the other way round.ldquoBut the most important thing is to have your dreams and find ways to reach them.The storyteller finished his session. He left the children with their dreams and their strategy to reach them.Happy New Year and good luck in defeating your dragon, and reaching your apple."},{"url":null,"title":"salon-owner-astonished-as-sign-to-be-torn-down","story":"Anna Mather moved her business from grade C listed premises in Gford into a grade B listed building on Haddington High Street last year.The switch has allowed her successful hair stylist team, who were named Scotlandrsquos Hair and Beauty Salon of the Year, to take on larger premises as they moved into the converted George Hotel building in the centre of town.But Ms Mather was stunned when East Lothian Council planners wrote to her to say that her shop sign, which is the same as the one she had at Gford, would be forcibly removed in a few weeksrsquo time.Ms Mather said: ldquoI contacted planners about the sign when we moved in and was told that, because it is plastic, it is the wrong material for the building, even though the shops across the road use the same type of signs.ldquoWe had gone to great s to ensure it was mounted properly to avoid having to screw it into the wall of the building and it is the same as we had at our previous salon.ldquoI appreciate it is a grade B listed building and am happy to meet requirements but when I asked for advice about what materials I could use they said they could not tell me.ldquoI have to apply for planning permission but, without knowing the material I can use, it will just be rejected and cost us money.ldquoNow they have written to say they are coming to forcibly remove the sign on January  and will charge us for the work.ldquoWe are a new business in the town and cannot afford to have these types of expensive bills.

And so I think I shall.A story from your head is a term I use to describe a story either made up on the spot or a remembered story that was made up at an earlier time. So essentially itrsquos a story that isnrsquot written down anywhere or got from a book.Of course, reading to, and with, children is really important. But making stories together with a child is a really bonding experience and a fantastic way to encourage the child to explore and develop her or his creative imagination.This dadrsquos child is quite young but the process Irsquom about to describe can be used for any age group, and indeed yourself.Firstly, I want you to think of a mountain. You are standing at its base on one side and you want to get to the other side. In order to do so you will need to climb to the summit first. This mountain in your imagination is going to initially help you make a story, because itrsquos called a story mountain.So now you are standing at the base of the story mountain. You need a few things before you begin your journey to the summit, and the first thing is a character or characters.This is the first question to ask your child: who is in the story  Let them decide, and it can be anyone or anything: a dragon, a princess, a footballer, Spiderman, a Minion, a witch, a boy or girl, or even your child themselves.Next question is to find which place the story begins, that is what the setting is for the beginning of the tale. So you can ask where the character is.It can be an imaginary setting or a real one, perhaps even local, itrsquos up to the child for example, answers might include ldquothe dragon is hiding in a school or ldquothe princess lives in a cave.Once you have a character or characters and some kind of setting you have the beginning of the story. ldquoOnce upon a time, a dragon was hiding in a schoolhellip ldquoThere was once a princess who lived in a cavehellipYou can now help the child to add a few detailsyou wish by asking simple questions about the characters and or the settings. For example: ldquoWhy is the dragon hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the cave look like Questions like these can help direct the story towards what is going to happen, and that is the next part of your journey up the slope to the summit of your story mountain.So the child may say: ldquoThe dragon is hiding in the school because itrsquos scared of a bigger dragon. Or: ldquoThe cave is cold.Now we have the characters and setting, itrsquos time to make the climb to the summit of the story mountain. This climb represents the issue within the story: a problem, a task or quest, a desire or dream to be sought, a need for change or something to be found and so on. In other words, itrsquos the beginning of the adventure.Itrsquos at this point that beginning the process of visualisation is useful. Visualisation is a technique used by storytellers to help them remember a tale and tell it in their own words. It involves actually imagining yourself in the story, asyou are there.So before you set off on the story, imagine the dragon in the school, enter into the image in your head. Is it your old school, what does the dragon look like, where in the school is it hiding, what are its emotions Likewise with the princess, can you see her in the cave  Enter it in your imagination and look around. Is it large or small, cosy or scary  Where does she sleep and can you see the princess shivering in the cold  What is she feeling and thinking This is what story is all about, entering the world of imagination. Itrsquos not the words you need to remember but the images in your mind. Itrsquos like they become a memory which you can later describe.Your child will have his or her own visualisations, but you can help develop that by asking questions and allowing the child to describe what he or she sees.Painting vivid moving pictures in your mindrsquos eye is the key to not only remembering but developing the story.So now we may have a terried small dragon hiding in the dinner hall of your childrsquos school, and a shivering princess sitting by a small campfire in a huge cave, feeling hungry.The next step is to find out what is going to happen. This begins us on the journey to the summit of the story mountain. To give the child ownership of the story, ask him or her questions like: ldquoSo does the big dragon find the one hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the princess do to make the cave warmer and get something to eat Now we have the issue that takes us up the hill to the summit. The summit represents the transformative moment in the story, the thing or person or happening that alters the course of events. In any story, this is an important ingredient.So perhaps we will end up with: ldquoThe big dragon flies into the playground and all the children run. But the teacher comes out and is really strict and makes it go away so the children are safe, and so is the wee dragon. Or: ldquoThe princess goes fishing. And she sees a pirate ship while shersquos fishing and decides she wants to be a pirate instead.So the headteacher and the pirate ship are the transformative factors in these examples. They change the course of the story, and in doing so the journey back down the other side of the mountain can now take place, for this represents the conclusion or ending of the tale.Is it a happy, sad, funny ending  So questions like ldquowhat happens to the wee dragon  and ldquodoes the princess enjoy being a pirate and living on the pirate ship  may lead to answers that the wee dragon loves the school and becomes a part of the P class and learns to read, and that the princess becomes the pirate captain.So now the base of the other side of the mountain has been reached, with the storyrsquos ending. Now you can take away the structure of the mountain and lay down the bones of the story you have made along the journey.Here are the bones: wee dragon hides in a school from a bigger dragon, teacher chases bigger dragon away, wee dragon decides he likes the school and stays and joins P princess is in cave cold and hungry, she goes fishing by the sea and sees a pirate ship, she joins the pirate crew and becomes the captain.The visualisation technique can now be used to put flesh on the bones, giving it more detail. You can revisit the tale and develop it later, or leave it as it is.In telling the story, donrsquot think of words, think of the images created in your head, then the words will come naturally as you describe what you see.This way you will remember the story. You may tell it slightly dferently each time, but thatrsquos fine. Your child may remind you of how it was told before, as he or she will have their own visualisation of the tale.Or your child may ask you for a dferent story, in which case you are back at the base of another story mountain ready to climb it!Happy storytelling!"},{"url":null,"title":"plans-for-250-more-homes-in-dunbar-to-be-revealed","story":"Members of the public have the chance to view the

Ronnie Spector. Poprsquos original bad girl . ldquoWe werenrsquot afraid to look hot, she once said of the Ronettes in their s heyday. ldquoThat was our gimmick.Ronnie Spector, now , in her bed drinking coffee and talking to a journalist in Glasgow about the past and the present and finding nothing but good things to say about both.ldquoI was in Glasgow and Scotland a few times in the sixties. I remember the accent was harder than the London accent. I remember the pipers and how they would wear skirts and all that. I remember that well.Read More: Celtic Connections: The Top Ten Must See ShowsIn our time together, she tells me the stories that she tells every journalist about Lennon ndash that time in New York in the s when he saw her in the street and shouted ldquoHey Ronnie Ronette Dick Clarkrsquos Caravan of Stars about that time in the studio when she started singing Be My Baby for the first time and all the musicians just stopped.ldquoIt was like we were in the Twilight Zone. The musicians in the place were going crazy. You remember that feeling how they looked at you and said, lsquoWow, thatrsquos a dferent voice.Theyrsquore good stories, ones we want to hear. But shersquod rather not talk about her ex-husband , thank you. It was  years ago, and shersquos said enough about that. Therersquos a bookyou really want to know, she reminds me.What Irsquom interested in is the before and after of the story. The place where she comes from and the place she is in now, the place she had to fight to get to.The before is easy. Spanish Harlem, Upper Manhattan, at the turn of the s. She makes it sound like paradise.ldquoWhen I was growing up, Teddy, we had everybody in our neighbourhood, so I didnrsquot think about race or colour or anything like that.Spector comes from a mixed-race family. Her dad was Irish, her mum was ldquoblack and Cherokee. Her skin was lighter as a result, but race or colour didnrsquot figure much, she says.ldquoI thought everybody had a neighbourhood like mine, with Jewish delis and Chinese restaurants and black barbecue places. I grew up in a wonderful time. There were no gangs or dope. It was just a wonderful regular childhood. It wasnrsquot crazy.In my mind, I tell her, back then there were doo wop groups singing on every corner in Spanish Harlem. ldquoWe didnrsquot see much of the doo wops on the street, she admits. ldquoWe werenrsquot allowed to go out that much. But I love that because we had a huge family and we were protected. Thatrsquos why a lot of groups got messed up because they didnrsquot have anybody to trust. My mother travelled everywhere with us England, Scotland, America, everywhere, so it was like coming home from school. We never got into drugs and alcohol and all that stuff because your mother was there.I imagine it must have been an eye-opener when she did then go on tour and find that America wasnrsquot really like Spanish Harlem. But Spector says not. ldquoYou didnrsquot think of race, she says.That said, she does recall being on tour as part of Dick Clarkrsquos Caravan of Stars, a package put together by the American radio and TV presenter, and stopping who knows where, but definitely not Spanish Harlem, for food.One black doo wop group wouldnrsquot get off the bus, she remembers. ldquoThey said, lsquoRonnie, would you bring us back a hamburger rsquo I thought it was strange, but at  you didnrsquot pay that any attention. I didnrsquot know what I know now that they were actually afraid to get off the bus.Spector always sang. She remembers at five getting up on the coffee table at home and singing silly songs to a family audience. ldquoMy family would applaud and that stuck in my mind forever.When she was eight Spector used to go her grandmotherrsquos after school with her cousins and shersquod stand in the lobby and sing. ldquoIt was the echo in that hallway that made me feel like, I can really sing. Irsquom like eight or nine years old and Irsquom singing Frankie Lymon songs and all my cousins are backing me up with all the doo wop stuff and thatrsquos my first memory of saying lsquoI can sing.rsquoIn  Frankie Lymon ndash a Harlem boy, a boy destined for self-destruction, a boy who would OD on heroin at the age of  ndash released an album entitled At the London Palladium. She loved it, loved Frankiersquos voice. A few years later The Ronettes would be at the Palladium themselves.When Spector was  years old The Ronettes played the Apollo amateur night. ldquoMy mother would say to me, lsquoIf they like you yoursquove got it made,they donrsquot, finish your schoolwork.rsquoldquoThey loved me, so I knew that I would be a somebody in the business. I didnrsquot know how or when or who.The when was , the who Phil Spector, the how was singing Be My Baby.Other hits would follow. Baby I Love You, Walking in the Rain, most notably. The sixties had started, pop music in all its immediacy and innocence was in full bloom and The Ronettes were part of that. ldquoWe looked dferent from everybody . We had our own hair when most groups wore wigs.Success meant access. Spector met the Beatles, toured with the Stones. These days she lives just  minutes away from Keith Richards. She met him a month ago when she was going into her dentist and he was coming out.ldquoHis daughter was with him. Hersquos a changed man from that seventies era and whatever they were going through. Hersquos a great dad.Read More: Jenna Reid on launching album Working Hands at Celtic ConnectionsRonnie, I say, who was your favourite Beatle  ldquoJohn. As simple as that. He was so nice, and his mind was really intact. He knew what he wanted to do, knew what he wanted to write. We were friends. He took me to Carnaby Street and showed me where to get the T-shirts and the boots. Irsquod come back to America looking all English.ldquoHe was really my favourite one. We dated a couple of times. He took me to a couple of clubs and I remember him leaning over to me and saying, lsquoRonnie, sing a little bit of Be My Baby in my ear.rsquo And I sang, lsquoThe night we met I needed you so helliprsquo I looked over and he had passed out.Good memories. There are bad memories too. The fairy-tale le she was leading took a grim turn when she married Phil Spector. She met the producer, the ldquofirst tycoon of teenwhen she was . He made her a star and then he took it all away from her.The day after their wedding, she wrote in her  memoir Be My Baby: How I Survived Mascara, Miniskirts and Madness, she woke up to see men erecting barbed wire and gates around the Spector mansion in Beverley Hills.In the years that followed she found herself trapped at home by a controlling, abusive, paranoid man. He robbed her of performing, robbed her of her voice .The story has the odd black comic edge. When she did get permission to leave the house she had to drive in a car with a blow-up Phil Spector doll in the back. But her account of those years when published is mostly pure horror show. In the end she had to sneak out of the house and flee with the help of her mother.If anything, her memoir might have downplayed things. In  in an ultimately unsuccessful bid for unpaid royalties, Spector would claim in court that her husband pulled a gun on her during their marriage. In  Spector was found guilty of the murder of Lana Clarkson in Spectorrsquos home.Perhaps, given everything, we shouldnrsquot be surprised that she doesnrsquot want to talk about any of this now.ldquoEverybody knows that story. It wasnrsquot a relationship. I wrote a book about it. Itrsquos been well over  years since I left. I prefer the music we made together to speak rather than dwell on the negative, she says when I tentatively broach the subject.ldquoAs a matter of fact, that made me more positive today. All the hell I went through made me the woman I am today. I dusted myself off and went on with it. When I was there I wasnrsquot singing and that was my passion and without my singing it wasnrsquot even a world I was living in. It was hell.ldquoThatrsquos why I love the #MeToo movement now. I wish they had it in the sixties. Because it was a manrsquos world back then. Men were producers. Men were writers. We were like employees rather than artists.ldquoSo now my le is great. I have no regrets about het past because it made me the woman I am today. Period, Teddy.Indeed. So, letrsquos celebrate that. Because this is the story of a woman who is a survivor, a woman who put the past behind her, who married againand who still gets up on stage at the age of  and sings those old songs and takes as much pleasure from doing so as she did  years ago.

Challenging pupil behaviour, frequent changes to curriculum and assessment have contributed to stress and workload. Smaller budgets mean doing more with less.The perception that teachers are overworked and underpaid has impacted on recruitment. Nearly all councils have multiple vacancies. Head teacher posts that once would have attracted double digit applications have become hard to fill.Unsurprisingly, teachers have become restless and vocal as they see their salaries fall in real terms. Large demonstrations and near-unanimous rejection of a % increase by Educational Institute of Scotlandmembers were clear signs of the way the wind was blowing. The decision by the EIS Council to ballot members on strike action comes as no surprise.Teachers have a case for a rise but, then again, so have many other public sector workers. Threatening strike action can be a useful bargaining strategy, but teachers and their leaders need to ponder further on its effectiveness and consequences.To paraphrase LP Hartley, the past was a dferent country and indeed, we did do things dferently there. The present social, political and economic climate is very dferent to that of the s and s. Take, for example the number of days lost to strikes. From the early s until the mid-s around  million working days were lost each year. In  the number was ,.That is largely due to the decline in union membership and influence. Additionally, unions have recognised that strike action is rarely effective. Teaching unions have generally bucked the trend and teachers continue to form a largely unionised profession. The relative strength and solidarity of the teaching unions may well be fuelling their apparent readiness to act. Nevertheless, like Marty McFly, teachers are in real danger of being transported back to the future.Very few of those to be balloted would have been involved in the prolonged industrial action of the s and s. That lack of personal experience may well contribute to strong support for strike action. Those of us, however, who lived and worked through those years remember what it was like and the lasting damage it did to the profession and, more importantly, to the youngsters who were in our care.Back then, teachers generally managed to keep parents on side. The strikes and school closures were only part of widespread action by many groups including miners, dockers, transport workers and large swathes of the public sector. It is questionable , in the current climate of austerity and post-Brexit uncertainty, parents will be as supportive. Many of them have suffered reductions in their own spending power and standard of living. They are unlikely to view teachers as a special case especiallyincurring additional expense for child care.Teachers might also wish to consider the moral imperative. Presumably we all entered the profession because of our passionate belief in the le changing potential of education. If so, can reducing young peoplersquos le chances be justied  Surely, very few teachers would argue that these youngsters are mere collateral damage. It was particularly dispiriting to hear one union leader threaten sustained strike action in Government ministersrsquo constituencies. To target particular children because of where they live would be despicable and unacceptable.During the disputes of the s I continued to run a school football team. I recall being berated by a delegation of colleagues, one of whom asked, ldquoWhose side are you on  Up until that time I had never considered that there were sides in education. I naiumlvely believed we were all on the youngstersrsquo side.Hopefully, unions and the Government will recognise that they are both on the youngstersrsquo side. Teachers deserve a rise but it mustnrsquot be our young people who foot the bill. A decent increase spread over two years may be a way out. Sure, it will cost, but not as much as sacricing another generation of young people and their prospects."},{"url":null,"title":"paul-hutcheon-delaying-brexit-is-vital-if-no-deal-departure-is-to-avoided","story":"IT would not take a clairvoyant to predict that the UK is facing the most serious rupture since the second world war in fewer than  days.Here is how it might play out. By mid-March, Theresa May has successfully headed off a softer Brexit proposed by a coalition of MPs and defeated plans for second referendum by exploiting Labour isions.With the country hurtling towards a no-deal departure, the Prime Minister secures concessions from European partners and puts a revised deal in front of the Commons which wins over some Tory doubters.Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the SNP oppose the new draft, but May is confident support from the Democratic Unionist Party and Tory colleagues will suffice. On the day, a hard core of Brexiteers who still have misgivings derail the plan and defeat the Prime Minister. As a result of Westminster paralysis, the UK crashes out of the European Union without a deal on March th.The consequences for the UK economy and society are immediate. Excessive form-filling at ports in the south of England has led to queues of more than  miles in the UK and France. Farmers are panicking about the lack of seasonal harvest workers and warning about the impact of World Trade Organisation rules on exporting their products.Hotels, pubs and restaurants are also complaining about the effect of no deal on their ability to recruit staff and shoppers staring at empty shelves in supermarkets. Car manufacturers announce plans to relocate from the UK and the financial services sector loses vital passporting rights.But it is the strain on the NHS that is causing the most anger. The cost of medicines is to rise sharply and the Health Secretary has conceded that delays will affect the importation of le-saving drugs. All waiting times targets are suspended for five years and thousands of UK nationals in the EU are unsurethey can receive any care.A no-deal Brexit, and the chaos many predict will ensue, is a live prospect because of the terms laid out in the Lisbon Treaty on how to leave the European Union. Once a country invokes Article  ndash the beginning of the withdrawal process ndash the same state has two years to negotiate a deal. The UK departs at the end of March.As we reveal today, key parts of Scottish society have major reservations about the Brexit impasse and the prospect of no deal. Bodies such as the Scottish Trades Union Congress, the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations and the Scottish Chambers of Commerce support an extension of Article .Civic Scotland is backed up by political muscle. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, as well as Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie and Scottish Greens co-convener Patrick Harvie, are demanding that Brexit is delayed. Collectively these parties represent a clear majority of MSPs at Holyrood. The Prime Minister is under pressure to heed these calls.The argument for an extension is multi-faceted. The  referendum was won by Leave, but even the most passionate Brexiteer would have to concede there is nothing written in the stars about March . Supporters of the intervention believe it is more important to get a good deal than fixate on a specic date in the calendar.There are also political reasons for a delay. The Leave campaignrsquos specic promises have been pored over, scrutinised and mocked, but eurosceptics consistently said the UK would get some form of deal from the EU. Crashing out was never part of the offer ndash regardless of what we have heard in recent days and weeks. An extension would not contradict the verdict delivered in the referendum.But it is the potential economic damage that is fuelling calls for a push back. According to the Confederation of British Industry, no deal would cause GDP to shrink by up to % and put thousands of jobs at risk. Government analysis claimed the GDP hit could be .% over  years. A contraction of this sort would inevitably lead to huge reductions in public spending.Seeking an extension is within the gt of the House of Commons. Senior Labour figures seem broadly sympathetic and the Prime Minister has pointedly refused to rule out a delay.However, as with much of the Brexit melodrama, the key factor is the internal politics of the Tory party. The Prime Minister may recognise the move is inevitable, but she is worried about the cries of betrayal from right-wing colleagues who will see an extension as a plot to stay in the EU. The clock is ticking."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-to-select-candidates-for-european-elections-in-case-brexit-is-delayed","story":"Nicola Sturgeonrsquos party will vet hopefuls in the next few weeks, while the Scottish Greens and Liberal Democrats are also exploring the idea in light of the current Brexit chaos.A senior SNP source said the move would send a ldquopowerful signal that scrapping Brexit is becoming a serious option.The UK is set to leave the EU on March th, with or without a deal on the terms of departure.The next elections to the European Parliament are scheduled for May, but the UK voters will not elect any MEPs as the country is scheduled to have left the EU.However, given that the UK Governmentrsquos draft withdrawal plan was comprehensively rejected by MPs last year, a range of options have moved into view.These include a no deal Brexit, which will occurMPs fail to raty an agreement struck with EU negotiators, and a second referendum.It is also possible for the UK to delay Brexit by requesting an extension to the Article  process which will lead to the UK leaving in March.And, as a result of a court case brought about by Scottish politicians, the UK can cancel Brexit by revoking Article .One of the lsquodelayrsquo models is extending the leave date by a few months, by which point the new round MEPs will have taken their seats.It would also be possible, but politically harder, to extend Article  for a substantially longer period.At a recent meeting of the SNPrsquos national executive committee , senior councillor Chris McEleny, who has contested his partyrsquos depute leadership election, is said to have raised the issue of the next European elections.It is understood he said the SNP, which favours a second referendum on leaving the EU, should select MEP candidates because it is possible Brexit may not go ahead.A source said: ldquoChris said thatArticle  is revoked or extended then Scotland will still require representation in the European Parliament, and so it would be diligent to have candidates in place.Keith Brown, the SNPrsquos Depute Leader, confirmed the move to this newspaper:ldquoThe SNP is open to candidate applications for the  European Parliament election. We are working on the basis that the party will be vetting and selecting people to stand in the coming weeks.ldquoAs we are calling for the extension of Article  negotiation period between the UK and European Union - to avoid the clf edge of a no deal at the the end of March - it is vital we prepare for such a sht.ldquoI look forward to seeing who comes forward from the wealth of talent that exists in our mass membership ranks.\"A spokesperson for the Scottish Greens said: \"With the deal dead and a Commons majority against No Deal, staying in has gone from a pipe dream to one of the most viable options. Preparing for a potential election is both the most responsible thing to do and a clear statement of intent. We intend to beat Brexit and and were increasingly confident that we can.\"A Scottish Liberal Democrat spokesperson said: ldquoWe are making the preparations necessary to enable us to ballot all our members to select our Euro candidatesthere is to be a European election.In a recent article, the Institute for Government think tank laid out four options for the UK continuing to have some form of representation in Brussels during an extension period.One of the stated options is to elect new MEPs until the end of the Article  period. ldquoThe UK would hold European Parliament elections this year, although not necessarily at the same time as the rest of the EU. This option would only make sensethere was an extended extension."},{"url":null,"title":"civic-scotland-brexit-must-be-delayed-and-chaotic-no-deal-avoided","story":"Leaders in the business, trades union, charity and higher education sectors are behind calls to pause what promises to be the biggest economic change in the UK in over  years.Their call, which is echoed by the SNP, Scottish Liberal Democrats and the Greens, comes as the Prime Minister plans to unveil her Brexit \"plan B\" to MPs tomorrow.Under the terms of the  Lisbon Treaty, the UK is scheduled to leave the EU on March , two years after Theresa May invoked the so-called Article  which sets a time limit on negotiations.However, with Parliament rejecting the withdrawal plan presented by Theresa May, the prospect of the UK coming out of the -member bloc without a deal grows by the day.Various reports have warned that no deal would have negative economic consequences for the UK, with shortages of medicines and huge tailbacks at ports being predicted.Although March  is the official leaving date, an extension to the process can be granted by EU member statesthe UK makes a request.A range of high-profile bodies in Scotland has intervened by calling for Brexit to be delayed. Anna Fowlie, chief executive of the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations , which has around , members, said:ldquoAfter two years, we find ourselves on the brink of exiting the EU without a withdrawal agreement that both the UK Parliament and the EU can sign up to.ldquoThere is therefore no choice but to seek agreement with the EU to extend Article  to allow time for a second EU referendum to take place.Liz Cameron, director and chief executive of the Scottish Chamber of Commerce, said: ldquoThe rationale for a delay to the Article  timeline is growing each and every day in our business communities.ldquoAn extension to Article  would, first and foremost, avoid a no deal outcome on March , but it would also acknowledge that neither business nor government are prepared for such a scenario.Colin Borland, director of Devolved Nations at the Federation of Small Businesses , which has around , members, said: ldquoThis longer window could give Scottish business a much-needed opportunity to prepare while taking the fever out of the public debate.And David Watt, executive director of the Institute of Directors in Scotland, said business leaders are ldquovery concerned about a no-deal Brexit: ldquoWith all of this in mind, the inevitable conclusion is to extend Article . It may be the only option to ensure a deal and a reasonable transition period.Grahame Smith, general secretary of the Scottish Trades Union Congress, which represents around , trade unionists, also backs an extension, as does GMB Scotland Secretary Gary Smith.Professor Sir Anton Muscatelli, principal of Glasgow University, is also strongly in favour of hitting the pause button as a way of delivering another referendum.\"With the Prime Ministerrsquos deal dead and Parliament in gridlock, there is only one way out ndash that is to request an extension to Article , and call a Peoplersquos Vote, he said.He added that an extension would ldquoappear the only opportunity to avoid the chaos of a No Deal outcome.In todayrsquos Herald on Sunday, the senior civic figures are joined by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie and Scottish Green co-convener Patrick Harvie.It also comes after three former Prime Ministers ndash John Major, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown ndash called on Article  to be either extended or revoked.Major, who was a Tory PM between  and , has said revoking Article  is the ldquoonly sensible course, as a no-deal Brexit would be ldquomorally reprehensible.Blair said he would be discussing the terms of an extension with the EUhe was still in Government, while Brown called for Brexit to be delayed by a year.Mayrsquos minority administration is opposed to an extension, but the Prime Minister has not ruled it out.However, the move would anger her pro-Brexit backbenchers and likely lead to further Cabinet resignations.Boris Johnson, the Brexiteer who quit as Mayrsquos Foreign Secretary in protest at one version of her deal, warned against an extension:\"It would be so utterly pathetic that I do think it would not only cause widespread international dismay but also reinforce peoples view that there is some sort of plot at Westminster to stop this thing .\":"},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  MPs must work together to unblock Brexit  or they   ll open the way for authoritarians","story":"So, we at least have breathing space, a pause, a moment for reflection. My own wish would be for MPs to seize the moment and vote to revoke Article  altogether. MPs have the power to stop the clock for good, thanks to the good works of legally-minded MPs like the SNPrsquos Joanna Cherry.Staying in the EU is the only sure way to stop the endless arguments about Canada plus, Norway plus, customs union, Irish backstop, regulatory alignment, maximum facilitation and all the rest of the gubbins thatrsquos been occupying our addled brains for the last two-and-a-half years. However, this isnrsquot going to happen.And Irsquod have to agree that it would be undemocratic for MPs to simply reverse the result of the  referendum by revoking A. It may be that Parliament has the power and the constitutional right to do so: referendums are only advisory. But it would leave so much unpleasantness that British politics would be soured for decades. There would have to be a referendum.This is where my unease turns to genuine anxiety. I have a horrible feeling that Labourrsquos Diane Abbott was right on Question Time this week when she said: ldquoBe careful what you wish for. She agrees with Nigel Farage that a repeat referendum is likely to endorse no-deal Brexit, perhaps by an even greater margin than in .Evenit left us with a mirror-image result, with say % Remain against % Leave, that would itself be a disaster because it would have no legitimacy. Yes, some opinion polls say Remain would win a comfortable majority, but they said that last time.The Brexiteers are already field-testing their slogans on social media. The frontrunner is ldquoTell Them Again, which may not be as resonant as ldquoTake Back Control but is still pretty hot. It surfs on the very widespread disgust and alienation that many ordinary people feel about the political elite. It appeals to democratic injustice: how dare the globalists ignore the result of , which David Cameron promised would be for keeps What would Remainrsquos slogan be  Itrsquos likely to be a repeat of the Project Fear line which failed dismally in . ldquoDonrsquot put your childrenrsquos prosperity at risk, perhaps, or ldquoThink Twice Think Jobs. But what many pro-Europeans fail to grasp ndash and this applied to the Unionists in the Scottish independence referendum ndash is that it ISNrsquoT the economy, stupid. Brexit voters donrsquot just make their decisions on the basis of economic rationality, as seen from the CBI and corporate Britain.People are always motivated more by emotion than numbers ndash on what they believe to be morally right. The sense that working-class people have lost control is a very potent mobiliser.As in war ndash and it is remarkable how much Brexit mythology harks back to World War Two ndash people are quite willing to sacrice some comfort for what they believe in.I may think they are mistaken. As with the people who supported Donald Trump because he promised to Make America Great Again, and bring back the jobs, I think Brexit voters have been sold a  prospectus by politicians who do not have the best interests of working people at their hearts.But that isnrsquot really the point. I can well understand the sense of injustice felt by people who have been left behind by global capitalism. They want to kick the system, and the referendum gave them a chance to do it. They need a very strong reason not to kick the metropolitans again. Only Labour can provide that reason, and Jeremy Corbyn has been singularly reluctant to do so.His refusal even to meet Theresa May was irresponsible in this climate. It may have allowed him to avoid coming off the fence, but it looked petty and weak. Corbyn should have gone in guns blazing, demanded that she drop the red lines, and then mobilised Labour for either rejoining the single market or for a referendum.Single market membership has always been the logic of Labourrsquos position, even though Corbyn usually refers to a ldquopermanent customs union. Only by joining the European Economic Area could Labour deliver friction-free trade, and protect environmental standards and workers rights. People say that Norway has blocked the UKrsquos entry to the European Economic Area, but this is not true. The Norwegian PM, Erna Solberg, has repeatedly made clear that Norway would have severe reservations ndashwho wouldnrsquot  ndash but would not block UK membership.This is because the EEA is essentially a Brussels creation.

My own wish would be for MPs to seize the moment and vote to revoke Article  altogether. MPs have the power to stop the clock for good, thanks to the good works of legally-minded MPs like the SNPrsquos Joanna Cherry.Staying in the EU is the only sure way to stop the endless arguments about Canada plus, Norway plus, customs union, Irish backstop, regulatory alignment, maximum facilitation and all the rest of the gubbins thatrsquos been occupying our addled brains for the last two-and-a-half years. However, this isnrsquot going to happen.And Irsquod have to agree that it would be undemocratic for MPs to simply reverse the result of the  referendum by revoking A. It may be that Parliament has the power and the constitutional right to do so: referendums are only advisory. But it would leave so much unpleasantness that British politics would be soured for decades. There would have to be a referendum.This is where my unease turns to genuine anxiety. I have a horrible feeling that Labourrsquos Diane Abbott was right on Question Time this week when she said: ldquoBe careful what you wish for. She agrees with Nigel Farage that a repeat referendum is likely to endorse no-deal Brexit, perhaps by an even greater margin than in .Evenit left us with a mirror-image result, with say % Remain against % Leave, that would itself be a disaster because it would have no legitimacy. Yes, some opinion polls say Remain would win a comfortable majority, but they said that last time.The Brexiteers are already field-testing their slogans on social media. The frontrunner is ldquoTell Them Again, which may not be as resonant as ldquoTake Back Control but is still pretty hot. It surfs on the very widespread disgust and alienation that many ordinary people feel about the political elite. It appeals to democratic injustice: how dare the globalists ignore the result of , which David Cameron promised would be for keeps What would Remainrsquos slogan be  Itrsquos likely to be a repeat of the Project Fear line which failed dismally in . ldquoDonrsquot put your childrenrsquos prosperity at risk, perhaps, or ldquoThink Twice Think Jobs. But what many pro-Europeans fail to grasp ndash and this applied to the Unionists in the Scottish independence referendum ndash is that it ISNrsquoT the economy, stupid. Brexit voters donrsquot just make their decisions on the basis of economic rationality, as seen from the CBI and corporate Britain.People are always motivated more by emotion than numbers ndash on what they believe to be morally right. The sense that working-class people have lost control is a very potent mobiliser.As in war ndash and it is remarkable how much Brexit mythology harks back to World War Two ndash people are quite willing to sacrice some comfort for what they believe in.I may think they are mistaken. As with the people who supported Donald Trump because he promised to Make America Great Again, and bring back the jobs, I think Brexit voters have been sold a  prospectus by politicians who do not have the best interests of working people at their hearts.But that isnrsquot really the point. I can well understand the sense of injustice felt by people who have been left behind by global capitalism. They want to kick the system, and the referendum gave them a chance to do it. They need a very strong reason not to kick the metropolitans again. Only Labour can provide that reason, and Jeremy Corbyn has been singularly reluctant to do so.His refusal even to meet Theresa May was irresponsible in this climate. It may have allowed him to avoid coming off the fence, but it looked petty and weak. Corbyn should have gone in guns blazing, demanded that she drop the red lines, and then mobilised Labour for either rejoining the single market or for a referendum.Single market membership has always been the logic of Labourrsquos position, even though Corbyn usually refers to a ldquopermanent customs union. Only by joining the European Economic Area could Labour deliver friction-free trade, and protect environmental standards and workers rights. People say that Norway has blocked the UKrsquos entry to the European Economic Area, but this is not true. The Norwegian PM, Erna Solberg, has repeatedly made clear that Norway would have severe reservations ndashwho wouldnrsquot  ndash but would not block UK membership.This is because the EEA is essentially a Brussels creation. It was set up as a halfway house to membership of the EU back in  when a number of countries were uneasy about joining the political institutions of Europe. The EEA is just the European Single Market under another name.Brussels endorses British membership of the EEA, and this economic arrangement has a number of advantages over Mayrsquos deal.

Mrs Mayrsquos remarkable achievement of winning a party leadership vote then a vote of confidence while simultaneously heading the first UK Government in history to be found in contempt of Parliament and suffering the biggest-ever defeat is enough to make anyonersquos head spin.So plotting the next few weeks and months will be dficult, but there are a few gravitational forces that cannot be denied. Firstly, the clock is ticking. Unless something  actively happens, the UK and Scotland with it will leave the EU at pmon March . All this ldquotherersquos no majority in the Commons for No Deal is entirely meaningless, much like the iceberg did not actually bear the Titanic any ill will ndash exit will happen unless they actively do something to stop it.Secondly, Mayrsquos ldquodeal is only to exit. The future is dealt with only in an aspirational Political Declaration which is not worthless, but not binding either. So all the bumping of gums by MPs about Norway plus, Canada minus or upside-down Lichtenstein is all so much puff ndash these negotiations will only start after the exit. If we exit with a deal then a transition period kicks in where EU law will continue to apply as we try to negotiate the future relationship. Basically wersquoll have as little idea of the future, except wersquoll be outside the EU.SoBrexit happens, a ldquosoft Brexit where the UK remains in the single market and the customs union is undoubtedly the least damaging aspiration. This is why the Scottish Government and others have proposed it as a potential ldquoless bad option in the spirit of trying to find solutions, but they have also been clear EU membership is the best option.My concern is that there may well be a majority in the House of Commons for a Norway-style aspiration, but that it will be as unsustainable as all the other pipe dreams and in reality offers no stability at all. It would not withstand its first crisis, which would come all the harder because by then we would have lost the chance to avert it, having left the EU.So letrsquos take a look at it. EFTArsquos own website explains that ldquothe EEA EFTA states have little influence on the decision-making phase on the EU side. Instead, they focus on ldquodecision shaping. This involves informal consultations, attendance at some committees, and submission of views in generally short ldquocomments papers.This is not nothing, but it is light years from the power we have now in council and the European Parliament, and votes for ministers and the UKrsquos  MEPs.The term ldquoVassal State is overblown and grievously offensive to many EU states who actually were until recently, but the reality is that the amount of influence we would have is really very limited. From day one the deal would be ripe for destabilisation by unsatisfied Brexit ultras and their allies.The current members of the EEA and EFTA have spent many decades building up how it works they know the compromises and the shortcomings. The UK political class and administrative machinery are wholly unprepared for the reality that being a rule-taker would bring.You can imagine the mischief the Brexit ultras would make. In a world where outrage can be whipped up over rules on lightbulbs, kettles and toasters, theyrsquod be braying for vetoes to be used at the slightest hint of a controversial EU law. Of course, they would move on to attacking membership of the EEA on this basis.Some already see the EEA as a way to gradually move to a hard Brexit by stealth, so eventhe arrangement survived first contact it is unlikely it would be remotely stable in the medium to long-term.Itrsquos a measure of just how damaging Brexit is that the very best alternative is still much worse than EU membership. It still brings considerable economic shocks, has a considerable price tag in terms of ongoing contributions to EU programmes, gives little real extra in terms of control, and reduces our influence in Europe and the world dramatically.Of the options we face, all of which have signicant problems, the best deal remains and always has been EU membership.Until March, the door remains open to maintaining that and we should not allow ourselves to settle for unstable halfway houses for the lack of a bit of intellectual honesty and political courage.The reality is that soft Brexit will inevitably become hard Brexit because the Brexit ultras have no desire to compromise. In the face of this the House of Commons only has one real choice: Remain.Yes, it would be messy and yes, it will take courage, but even the best alternative is far worse.Alyn Smith is a Scottish politician, and Scottish National Party MEP for Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"article-50-explained","story":"Itrsquos a formal legal process that had never before been used until the UK invoked it on March , .The article - only  words long - forms part of the Lisbon Treaty, drawn up in December of  as part of a bid to make the EU ldquomore democratic, more transparent and more efficient. Signed by the heads of state and EU governments, the treaty includes the article, which is a basic five-point plan for any country wishing to depart the European Union.It states: ldquoAny member state may decide to withdraw from the union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements.And its only real quantiable detail is a provision that provides negotiators with two years from the date of article  notication to conclude new arrangements.Failure to do so means the state falls out of the EU with no new provisions in place.And so, when the UK told the EU it was leaving, it meant it would no longer \"participate in the discussions of the European Council or Council or in decisions concerning it.But two and a half years on from the vote to leave and it seems the UK is no further forward.So could the article be revoked Under its wording, the government can obtain an extension from the European Council, provided that the other  countries accept unanimously.And after the Brexit deal was rejected, the Committee on Exiting the European Union yesterday saidParliament could not agree on a way forward by the March  departure day, lawmakers should be able to vote on whether to extend the article  negotiation period.Last night, it was reported that European officials were indeed examining plans to delay Brexit until  after France and Germany indicated their willingness to extend negotiations due to the turmoil in Great Britain.Chancellor Philip Hammond had raised the possibility of an extension on Tuesday, saying in a call with business leaders that a ldquono-deal Brexit could be avoided.According to the CBI, he outlined how the  March date might be postponed.On Monday, Theresa May declined to categorically rule out an extension, stressing she wishes to deliver a ldquosmooth and orderly departure.But as the last two and a half years have shown, nothing is ldquosmooth and orderly about Brexit."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9309974.jpg?type=article-full","title":"10-voices-tell-herald-on-sunday-why-we-should-delay-brexit","story":"ldquoArticle  must now be extended.

Sieve the flour into a large bowl. Add the extra virgin olive oil and salt, and mix by hand. Add the water, a little at a time until you get a smooth dough that doesnrsquot stick to your hands or the bowl. Cover and leave in the fridge to rest.. Next, prepare the filling. Steam or heat the haggis in the microwave to soften the meat. Gradually add the beaten egg, a little at a time, to bind the mixture.. Prepare the sauce by reducing the cream and whisky by half in a pan over a medium heat. Once cooled, add the mustard. Mix well and set aside.. Remove the pasta dough from the fridge and roll it out on a lightly floured work surface. Divide the dough into two pieces.. Set the rollers of the pasta machine to their widest setting. Dust the first piece of dough lightly with flour and run it once through the machine. Fold in half and run it through the machine again. Do this on the first setting at least  or  times as this will give the pasta a firmer texture.. Change the rollers to the next setting and run the dough through it. Keep changing to the next setting and working the pasta through the rollers until it is thin but not transparent.. Next, fill the ravioli. Lay the sheet of dough on a lightly floured surface. Place one tablespoon of the haggis filling every . to cm apart. Lightly brush or spray the exposed edges with water. Fold the sheet in half, over the filling, and seal around each mound, pressing out the air pockets with you fingertips. Cut between the filling and press the edges to seal them completely.. Next, fry the ravioli. Heat the vegetable oil in pan and add the ravioli, a few at a time and fry until they turn golden brown, which will take around two minutes on each side.. Serve the ravioli with the mustard sauce and a wee dram of whisky.

Real jobs here are scarce.Under Mugabersquos rule, the rate of unemployment rose to more than %, forcing many people to eke out a living by hawking on the streets, giving rise to Mbarersquos Mupedzanhamo Market, which, loosely translated from the Shona language, means ldquoend poverty.ldquoMbare is a tough place to live, surely you can see that for yourself just standing here, said Joseph Masenda, while his sister nearby filled a bucket with water from an open communal pipe at the foot of a block of dilapidated redbrick flats where many of the windows were broken or boarded up.ldquoWe need change, big change, andEmmerson Mnangagwa cannot bring it, then some new leader has to, insisted Masenda, as we stood talking in the township last year just before the elections many Zimbabweans hoped and believed were the beginning of a new political dawn.At long last, they thought the authoritarianism, corruption, human rights abuses and widespread poverty that had plagued their lives for years might finally be over.The man many pinned their hopes on was Mugabersquos fellow Zanu-PF party member Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa, or ldquoED as he is more commonly known here.However, it was perhaps Mnangagwarsquos other nickname, ldquoThe Crocodile, given to him for surviving a turbulent political career with a mixture of cunning and ruthlessness, that provided the real clue as to where the now president was intent on taking the country.For over these past days, ldquoThe Crocodile has snapped back old style, as he cracks down on street protests sparked by a % hike in fuel prices that has made petrol in this economically shattered country now the worldrsquos most expensive.According to president Mnangagwa, the increase in prices was meant to ease the impact of the fuel shortage on Zimbabwersquos ailing economy.But Zimbabweans, already squeezed by the high cost of living, were having none of it. While most heeded a nationwide stay-at-home protest, others took to the streets, where they were met with force by Zimbabwersquos security forces in Harare and in the southwestern city of Bulawayo last week.Since then, graphic reports have emerged of security forces targeting activists and labour leaders, while the government also imposed a ldquototal internet shutdown in what critics called an attempt to hide evidence of the true nature of the crackdown.On Friday, badly injured people streamed into a hospital in Harare, after assaults by soldiers and paramilitaries.While the government says three people died during the unrest, lawyers and activists say the toll was much higher and mass arrests were used to quell the street demonstrations.On January , Zimbabwersquos Doctors for Human Rights released a statement saying ldquohundreds shot, tens estimated dead in rampant rights violations across Zimbabwe.Their assessment included reports of  patients treated for gunshot and blunt trauma wounds. Human rights group Amnesty International also reported that at least eight people have been killed. The government and media, meanwhile, also accused the opposition Movement for Democratic Change , trade unions and civil society groups backed by foreign funders of orchestrating the protests as part of a campaign to undermine the government and elevate the MDCrsquos leader, Nelson Chamisa, into office. Both the US and Germany were named. Such accusations though are par for the course when the Zimbabwean government faces protests. Based on past experience, it seems unlikely it will supply compelling evidence to support such claims.ldquoOur country is going through one of the most trying periods in its history, the Zimbabwe Catholic Bishopsrsquo Conference said in a sweeping statement lamenting the governmentrsquos ldquointolerant handling of dissent and its failure to halt the economic collapse.Among the  or so people arrested and charged by magistrates was pastor Evan Mawarire, a rights activist who started the popular ldquoThis Flag movement, and rose to prominence as a critic of Mugabersquos rule and led a national protest in .ldquoI cannot tell you how heartbreaking it is. We thought we had a new country and a new way of doing things. None of what I am being accused of is what I have done at all, Mawarire told reporters after being arrested for ldquoinciting violence on social media.ldquoI did nothing of that nature. If we have true justice, letrsquos see it at play, said Mawarire, who will now stand trial on more serious charges of subverting the government.While it remains too early to assess the true scale and severity of Zimbabwersquos crisis or whether itrsquos a warning of big shts in the countryrsquos volatile political environment, activists and civil society organisers who witnessed the violence say the crackdown appears more widespread and severe than those in the past decade.They described widespread beatings by security forces, a police raid on a hospital where those assaulted were receiving treatment, and the military taking over a police station where protesters were detained. All spoke on condition of anonymity, citing concerns for their safety.ldquoThe crackdown is profound hellip and brutal, and we cannot work out what the endgame is, one Zimbabwean health worker was quoted by Foreign Policy magazine as saying.Itrsquos all a far cry from the positive pronouncement made by Mnangagwa last year when I visited the country and he declared: ldquoZimbabwe is now open for business.Walking the streets of Harare back then I couldnrsquot help noticing the number of newspapers on stands praising Mnangagwa.One prominent paper, The Sunday Mail, applauded the presidentrsquos then recent visit to China.ldquoED s with a bagful, it proclaimed in a reference to a deal Mnangagwa was then brokering to secure billion of pounds worth of investment for projects in Zimbabwe.At the time it seemed that Mnangagwa could do no wrong, and concerns over his ability to deliver didnrsquot seem to trouble many Zimbabweans other than those who saw him as a chip off the Zanu-PF block and just another part of the political old guard.Even the European Unionwas prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt.One morning during my visit I attended Mbarersquos Stodart Community Hall, where the EUrsquos Commissioner for International Development, Neven Mimica, who had just met Mnangagwa, signed an agreement with Zimbabwean officials that would see new EU-funded programmes worth pound million launched to improve peoplersquos access to health services and enhance their livelihoods.Mimicarsquos was the first high-level EU visit to Zimbabwe in almost a decade and spoke volumes about the EUrsquos hopes for the country, given that its financial support came with conditions requiring improvement in Zimbabwersquos democratic process and transition under Mnangagwa. ldquoThe EU has always been a reliable partner of the Zimbabwean people and it stands ready to accompany Zimbabwe in its process of change, said Mimica.ldquoWe do not want to be a passive partner in this process, he added, stressing that the EU and others were watching Zimbabwersquos forthcoming elections carefully and that reforms must be made and checks carried out that that process is underway for EU financial support to be maintained.Where now, one wonders in light of events over the past few days, does that leave the EU and wider international community when it comes to supporting Zimbabwe  For the time being, no-one doubts that Zimbabwe still desperately needs that support in both urban and rural communities.Venture out from Hararersquos bustle into the rural hinterland and the true fragility of this beautul countryrsquos economic stability and faltering steps towards democracy quickly becomes apparent.Itrsquos worrying then to hear the EU over the past days issuing a statement noting the ldquodisproportionate use of force by security personnel and the UN appealing for restraint by the Zimbabwean authorities.There are clearly real fears now that Mnangagwa is not the democratic reformer many in Zimbabwe had yearned for when Mugabe was ousted in  after his  years in power.Some have even gone as far as to suggest that what is currently being witnessed is the ldquothe open militarisation of the state.ldquoPeople wanted to see Mugabe go, but they didnrsquot realise that they were actually creating a bigger monster, says Alex Magaisa, a Zimbabwean lawyer and professor at the University of Kent.ldquoThe military is now very much in control and very powerful.In some ways, perhaps, the latest unrest should come as no real surprise. Anger at the government has been steadily brewing since those hopeful days after Mugabersquos overthrow. Even on my last visit to the country its economic woes were plain to see.Everywhere people complained of prices in shops soaring, retailers were closing down and queues for petrol were ening as the country struggled to juggle payments for competing import priorities.Control over the countryrsquos fuel supply, which triggered the current unrest, remains in the hands of Mnangagwarsquos ruling ZANU-PF party, and the huge financial benefits that come with it are reportedly causing factional rivalry.There is widespread public speculation that the shortages are caused by inter-elite squabbles or even deliberately engineered. This sense that Mnangagwarsquos hand controls all was reinforced over the past few days as Zimbabweans found themselves without internet access after the government ordered the countryrsquos biggest mobile operator to shut down service again.After several hours networks were restored but social-media s remained blocked, meaning that people have not been able to access any social-media sites such as WhatsApp, Twitter and Facebook throughout the week.Itrsquos all a long way from barely  months ago when the coup that forced Mugabe from office created a mood of optimism that also played out online.Like many ordinary Zimbabweans, Joy Mviro, a young mother I met last year outside the Edith Opperman Maternity Centre in the heart of Mbare, was adamant that things were changing for the better. Just , Joy still had most of her le ahead of her, as did her six-month-old daughter Keisha, whom she has brought to the clinic as part of a series of regular check-ups since the baby was born #around the time that Mugabe was overthrown.ldquoWe can now talk openly, she told me confidently that day when we met. ldquoBefore Mr Mugabe was kicked out, I would have thought twice about talking to a journalist or answering their questions, but not now, Joy insisted.How sad it is now, then, that such optimism has largely evaporated in light of recent events unfolding on Hararersquos streets. Ten years or so ago, in a small village north of Bulawayo, during one of my first visits to Zimbabwe, I met a -year-old great-grandmother called Golidem.Sitting on the floor of her hut, surrounded by a few meagre possessions and lovingly cradling her one-month-old great-grandson Nkosina in her arms, she talked eloquently of another time in Zimbabawe, a bygone age when dialogue, not ision, made the country a great beacon of hope across Africa.Golidem will have passed on by now but Zimbabwersquos drive to make a better society goes on. Zimbabweans are known for their patience, but just as it ran out with Mugabe so now it is also running out with Mnangagwa."},{"url":null,"title":"alex-salmond-piles-pressure-on-nicola-sturgeon-over-indyref2","story":"Mr Salmond said the Westminster crisis over Brexit meant there was ldquonot likely to be a better time to force the issue.He told the Sunday National: ldquoNicola should be concentrating all her energies on the independence agenda when we will never have better circumstances.ldquoAs far as I am concerned Westminsterrsquos Brexit dficulty should be Scotlandrsquos opportunity.ldquoRight now, the Westminster political establishment is at its weakest point in my letime while the national movement is in good heart.ldquoThere is not likely to be a better time to force the issue.The Scottish Tories said the war between the Yes movements two biggest beasts was getting worse by the day, and urged Ms Sturgeon \"to put Alex Salmond back in his box\".Mr Salmondrsquos comments come amid open ision in the Yes movement over the timing of Indyref.Ms Sturgeon has said she will give an update on timing in ldquoa matter of weeks, but appears to be playing a long game, focusing for now on a Peoplersquos Vote over Brexit.However an increasingly strident Mr Salmond - buoyed by his legal win against the Scottish Government over its botched misconduct probe into him - is pushing for immediate action.The split between the past and present first ministers has led to a bitter briefing war.Ms Sturgeonrsquos office has accused the ldquoother side of \"smears\" and waging a ldquovendetta\".Mr Salmond blamed the ldquounionist press for ldquoprovoking a response, but admitted he had told his own spinners and proxies to stop getting involved.He said: ldquoIt takes two to tango and Irsquom just not playing this game.

Here goes.The first one is this: the Salmond investigation is unlikely to change many minds on independence, which is where Walter Macfarlane comes in. Walter, I should explain, has been dead for  years but I only came across him for the first time a few days ago while I was reading the journals of the great Scottish diarist James Boswell. Boswell writes about meeting Macfarlane in the entry for Sunday  November  and describes him as a man who was ldquokeenly interested in the reigning contests between Scots  English.:Poll suggests SNPs credibility damaged by Alex Salmond allegationsldquoHe talked much against the Union, writes Boswell of his new friend. ldquoHe said we were perfect underlings, that our riches were carried out of the country, that no town but Glasgow had any advantage of trade by it, and that many others were hurt by it.Why am I bringing this up now  Mainly because it demonstrates something thatrsquos often forgotten, which is that unhappiness with the Union and support for independence is not a modern phenomenon, and itrsquos not all about the SNP either. As you can see from Boswellrsquos diary, Macfarlane was complaining about the Union just  years or so after the Act of Parliament that brought it about and  years before the SNP was even thought of. Which is the important point: independence has always been a strand of Scottish opinion and, seen in that long historical context, the travails of Nicola Sturgeonare unlikely to greatly change that one way or the other.The second fact is this: the Salmond investigation has emphasised that there are serious isions in the SNP. Some nationalists appear to be offended by this idea and deny there is any ision at all but the briefings of Salmond supporters against Sturgeon and vice versa speak for themselves. In fact, even as he made an apparent appeal to end the acrimony at the weekend, Alex Salmond couldnrsquot resist turning his handshake into a punch. He said he had ordered his team not to become involved in any more exchanges before criticising Sturgeon for not concentrating on independence. There may be some in the SNP who insist this doesnrsquot represent ision but then Baghdad Bob insisted there were no American troops in Iraq to the sound of American troops in Iraq.The third fact leads straight on from the ision in the SNP but is about nationalism more generally and itrsquos this: levels of support for both sides of the independence debate have not shted.In some ways, this third fact is the most surprising of all because, on the face of it, the circumstances are in place for a breakthrough on either side. For the opposition parties at Holyrood, therersquos the Salmond investigation and its implications for Sturgeon and yet support for the SNP has not changed, and for the nationalists, therersquos the crisis of Brexit and yet the polls continue to show  per cent of Scots want to remain in the UK. The nationalists may talk about a ldquosurge and the unionists may revel in the SNPrsquos crisis, but the polls havenrsquot changed. Thatrsquos a fact.Which leads us to the fourth, final, and perhaps most controversial fact: a second referendum on Scottish independence before  is less likely than it was two years ago. Partly, this is because of those polls againbut itrsquos also because of the logistics and timing. The reality now is that we may not know ndash even by  ndash what Brexit is going to look like and Sturgeon herself has said there will be no announcement until the fog has cleared. Then therersquos the clincher: there is no prospect of a Section  order giving permission for a referendum from the Conservative Government. Thatrsquos a fact many of those in the independence movement simply pretend does not exist.:Calls for public inquiry into \"unlawful\" handling of sexual misconduct complaints against Alex SalmondThe effect of all of these facts, as Irsquove confidently called them, is another matter entirely and depends on how much the politicians resist them. In the wake of the Salmond investigation, itrsquos certainly hard to imagine the SNP fighting the  election campaign with any of the confidence it had in  and , and even in , but then again therersquos every chance Nicola Sturgeon will stick to the grid and announce a referendum before  in the hope that its rejection by the UK Government will increase support for her position.Should that happen, I have honestly no ideathe strategy would work ndash the facts donrsquot stretch that far ndash but maybe now would be a good time toto the diaries of James Boswell for some insight from the past.Writing on  December , just a few days after his meeting with Walter Macfarlane, Boswell got to thinking about the upheavals caused by unrest and war. He did not much care for the quarrels of Mankind when ided into particular states and nations, he wrote, but he could see that they depended not on facts but on the frailties of humans. ldquoI can see that Great People, those who manage the fates of Kingdoms, he said, ldquoare just such beings as myself."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9312948.jpg?type=article-full","title":"theresa-may-set-to-reveal-plan-to-ditch-irish-backstop-in-bid-to-win-over-brexit-deal-critics","story":"Last week, the Prime Minister said she would focus on cross-party talksto get a withdrawal agreement accepted by Parliament.But it is understood she is now seeking to win approval from her own benches and show the EU that MPs could back a deal without a backstop in the hope of encouraging Brussels to soften its position.The backstop is the \"insurance policy\" in the withdrawal deal, intended to ensure there is no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic after the UK leaves the EU.Mrs Mays initial withdrawal deal was rejected by a majority of  MPs in a historic defeat earlier this month.If Parliament doesnt approve a withdrawal agreement, the UK is due to leave the EU on  March without a deal or transition period.The prime minister will address the Commons on Monday afternoon, setting out how she intends to proceed with the Brexit withdrawal agreement.She will also table a \"neutral\" motion, simply saying that the Commons has considered her statement, which will be debated and voted upon on January .This motion is expected to attract amendments from groups of backbenchers seeking more of a say in the process.Read more: Brexit - What might happen nextTwo groups of MPs are expected to table bills which could take a no-deal Brexit off the table, and potentially suspend Article  - which allows the UK to leave the EU.One of the groups -which includes Labours Yvette Cooper, Conservative Nicky Morgan, and Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb - wants the UK to extend negotiations with the EU beyond  March,MPs do not approve a withdrawal agreement by  February.There was anger among pro-Leave MPs at moves to enable backbenchers to take control of the Commons business from the Government - in breach of normal conventions - through a series of amendments to the neutral motion.One group including senior Labour MP Yvette Cooper and Tory former minister Nick Boles is seeking to give time for a bill to suspend the Article  withdrawal processthere is no new deal with Brussels by the end of February.Another more radical amendment drawn up by former attorney general Dominic Grieve would allow a motion by a minority of  MPs - from at least five parties and including  Tories - to be debated as the first item of Commons business the next day.Read more:Ian Blackford urges PM to lsquofundamentallyrsquo change position on BrexitMr Grieve said it would enable the Commons to stage a series of \"indicative votes\" on the ious alternatives, such as a \"soft\" Norway-style deal or a second referendum to establish which could command a majority.He denied claims he was seeking to prevent Britain leaving the EU after International Trade Secretary Liam Fox accused pro-Remain MPs of trying to \"hijack\" the  referendum vote.Mrs May is expected to use her statement to explain how she intends to proceed in the run up to the vote on January , rather than setting out a detailed \"plan B\".But Ian Blackford blasted the reported plans, tweeting on Monday: \"The threat to reopen the Good Friday agreement is beneath contempt from a Prime Minister who I did not think could plumb such depths.

Paper card and metals, cartons and plastics recycling bins would also be incorporated into the -weekly collection cycle, together with a weekly food waste collection. Although a dferent option was more popular in the consultation, professional advice is that the alternative is most likely to encourage residents to recycle more and send less waste to landfill.By increasing recycling the proposed change is expected to reduce service costs by at least £, per year, money which will be reinvested into other essential council services.It is also proposed to double the number of seasonal garden waste collection points, with new facilities in locations including Balmedie, Kemnay, Kintore, Mintlaw, Newmachar and Oldmeldrum.Aberdeenshirersquos current recycling rate is only .%, but the services currently available to residents should allow over % of waste to be recycled.

During that time, hundreds of thousands of people have volunteered their time providing the RSPB with over eight million hours of monitoring garden birds.This year’s event takes place on ,  and  January .The public is asked to spend just one hour watching and recording the birds in their garden or local green space, then send their results to the RSPB.Close to half-a-million people join in the Birdwatch every year and, in Aberdeenshire, the most commonly recorded bird last year was the house sparrow, followed by the starling, chaffinch, blackbird, blue tit, and goldfinch.Over the last  years,  million birds have been counted giving the RSPB an astonishing amount of insight into how our wildle is faring.Mike Clarke, RSPB Chief Executive, said: “Everyone has a role to play in saving nature and protecting our wildle. Big Garden Birdwatch participants have made a signicant contribution to monitoring garden bird numbers over the past four decades. Those taking part work together as part of a community with thousands of other Big Garden Birdwatchers to help the RSPB’s work to protect birds, other wildle and the places they live.“Reaching  years is a huge achievement and shows just how passionate people across the UK are about their wildle.The survey started as a winter activity for our youth members. It’s now the largest garden wildle survey in the world and appeals to both children and adults because it’s an enjoyable, easy, inclusive activity that anyone can do and a great opportunity to connect with nature.” As well as counting birds, the RSPB is once again asking participants to log some of the other wildle they have seen throughout the year. This year, people are being asked to look out for badger, fox, grey squirrel, red squirrel, muntjac deer, roe deer, frog and toad.To take part in the Big Garden Birdwatch , watch the birds in your garden or local park for one hour at some point over the three days.

He will be  next month but still visits schools and other groups to give slideshow presentations about his war experiences. Here we reproduce an interview with Don which was published in the Groat in June  to mark the th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Don flew to Normandy twice on D-Day, first dropping paratroops and then a glider with more troops and equipment.*WHEN the grey dawn broke over Normandy on June , , Don Mason had already made the first of his two contributions to the momentous events of D-Day. The young airman was part of the six-man crew of a modied Stirling bomber that had dropped  paratroops and their equipment at Ranville under cover of darkness. Heading for home, the Stirling came under fire from anti-aircraft guns on the French coast but ed unscathed to its base at Fairford in Gloucestershire. In the early evening the same crew were back over Normandy, this time towing a glider with more troops destined for the original dropping zone ndash and by this stage, almost  hours after the start of the Allies seaborne invasion, the full enormity of Operation Overlord was clear to see. \"It looked like a scene out of a nightmare,\" Don now recalls.Don had been fascinated with aeroplanes since his childhood in Worcestershire. As a young boy he once walked four miles with his family to see a travelling circus which featured a plane of Great War vintage Don could only gaze in wonderment as the flying machine entertained the crowds, and he resolved that one day he would fly an aircraft of his own. It was an ambition that would be fulfilled with the onset of World War Two.Although just  at the time of D-Day, Don had already clocked up numerous operations as a bomber pilot. He had been severely injured in a fighter attack over Germany in  and was declared medically unfit. After being reinstated on appeal, he was retrained as a radio observer.\"We had been in No.  Group Bomber Command,\" says Don, who moved to Thurso in the s but whose Caithness connection goes back to  when he flew Blenheims out of Wick. \"The whole squadron were suddenly lted out of Bomber Command and put into  Group, airborne support, which was a completely new role because wed never worked with paratroops or the like before.\"He was now in  Squadron, flying a modied version of the Stirling four-engined heavy bomber: the Mk IV troop-carrier and glider tug. \"We had to do a lot of exercises to get used to that aeroplane and to get used to dropping troops and towing gliders, which obviously was a dferent ball game altogether... it required a lot of dferent techniques.\"And it was necessary with any airborne group to drop them accurately in as tight a bunch as possible ndash therefore youd got to operate at a low height and also not get them scattered, so timing was important.\"There developed a formation flying technique which was called starboard echelon, so youve got two lines of aircraft flying parallel to one another. We had to practise these on group exercises, and a number of things happened: tow ropes broke, gliders went down in dferent places.\"On one group exercise we were flying along in this starboard echelon formation and there were literally hundreds of us ndash it wasnt just my squadron, it was a number of dferent squadrons ndash and suddenly an aircraft in the port line veered straight across into an aircraft in the starboard line and they both went down in flames. We lost two aircraft and two crews, just like that, on an exercise. Those are the things that stick in the mind.\"That tragic accident occurred on May , , in one of the last group exercises before D-Day. It was becoming clear that a big operation was imminent, one that would have major repercussions for the course of the war.\"Obviously we knew something was happening,\" Don says, \"because we were practising with troops and gliders and whatever. But we werent aware, of course, until the th of June when we were briefed originally.\"The invasion was scheduled initially for June  but was postponed for  hours because of the weather. \"Before that we had the indications of the airfield being closed off and we werent allowed to leave ndash we were shut in, the mail was censored.\"Paratroops of the th Airborne Division had been arriving at Fairford from the middle of May, and glider pilots were gathering there too as the security arrangements became ever tighter. The troops camped out on the airfield and Don remembers: \"One thing that struck me was that most of them were not very big men but the amount of equipment they carried was phenomenal, with kitbags full of gear strapped to their legs. The other thing that struck me as quite remarkable was they were all carrying water bottles full of white rum!\"Stirling LJ  took off from Fairford at . hours on June  in what was code-named Operation Tonga, with Don as wireless operator air gunner. On board were  fully equipped paratroops and the BBC correspondent Guy Byam.Dons chief recollection of that night flight over the English Channel is the sight of vast numbers of landing craft and other vessels in the assembly area ndash which was known as \"Piccadilly Circus\" ndash as they awaited the signal to head for the beaches.\"We were briefed to drop precisely at a time and place,\" he explains. \"It was important to get the troops on the ground in a bunch, not scattered. We were only over mid-Channel so we did an orbit ndash that was a bit dicey with so many aircraft about, all flying in one direction, and us crossing the stream. It all went to build up the tension.\"Finally, at . hours, the troops were released at Ranville, where they were to set up a homing beacon to aid following aircraft and also to assist in holding bridges over the nearby river Orne after the seaborne invasion had begun. Don remembers the red light in the fuselage turning to green on reaching the dropping zone. \"They all had to go together. Naturally some hesitated on the lip of the door ndash but they had all got to go.\"In the lead-up to the drop, there had been a close encounter between the Stirling and a group of paratroops released by a nearby Dakota. \"He released his troops and they came past us and we flew right through and didnt touch one,\" says Don.\"There was no flak at all over Normandy but then we had to fly in a northerly direction towards the Pas de Calais after dropping our troops, which was a feint because the Germans expected us to attack the Pas de Calais rather than anywhere . So we flew on a northerly track and we experienced flak around Le Havre and Dieppe, and then when we exited France towards Beachy Head we got some light flak on the coast, but there wasnt a great deal of resistance.\"It was a dferent matter altogether when Don and his crew-mates embarked on their second operation of D-Day, code-named Mallard.This time their Stirling had a Horsa glider in tow, containing more troops bound for the Ranville area along with an armoured jeep, four anti-tank guns and ammunition. Take-off time was . hours and the glider was to be released at ..Don remembers the scene vividly: \"The Channel was still littered with shipping but when we approached the Normandy coast it was a chaotic mass of ships and landing craft and smoke and explosions. It looked like a scene out of a nightmare, really. And, of course, as we went over land and approached the landing zone there was a lot more activity and a lot more flak.\"You couldnt tow a glider above  knots so it was fairly slow. You were low because you didnt want the glider to be shot down before it could get down to land. So obviously a big aircraft like the Stirling, with a ft wingspan or thereabouts, and a Horsa glider behind it, was a good target. In fact, all  of our aircraft were hit by anti-aircraft fire.\"Indeed one of those planes was shot down and crash-landed into the beachhead. The airmen were uninjured and got away for a while before being picked up by a German patrol.Subsequently the German position where they were held prisoner was captured and the crew ed to base.Reflecting on the chaos and confusion of D-Day, does Don recall feeling scared by what was happening around him  \"Well, everybodys scared ndash I dont care what anyone says,\" he replies. \"If youre not scared you dont perform, but its discipline and training that takes you through. You do reach a point of no .\"This is rude, I know, but its what I call s**t or bust. You go on and do it. Its a matter of accepting whats going on and just dealing with it, and doing the job youre supposed to do.\"Its not a question of bravery. Im very suspicious when people say, Oh, youre a brave man, or Youve got a lot of courage. You react to circumstances. Its a question of training and discipline and doing your job, without really recognising the probability of being killed.\"And I think to some extent the unorm protects you ndash you feel less vulnerable when youve got a unorm on and youre acting in that capacity. Everything happens very quickly.\"So Im very suspicious about bravery. I think we react more instinctively based on our training and our own iniduality. I dont think I could have coped with being an infantryman, for instance. I dont know how those chaps did it, because it must have been hell on earth for them.\"Don can look back on hundreds of hours of operational flying in a distinguished RAF career that included missions for the Special Operations Executive. And yet, despite the passage of years, he has never forgotten the thrill of his first tantalising taste of aviation.\"I fell in love with aeroplanes when I was a kid when Alan Cobhams Flying Circus came to visit our town with an old World War One aeroplane, and it was fascinating,\" Don says. \"He had a couple of old SEs [fighter aircraft] and you could have a flip round the field for  shillings ndash but of course  shillings was half a mans wage, so we just stood there with our mouths open.\"But the smell of hot engine oil, castor oil and fumes and what-not got into you. I was determined to try to get into it in some way, and of course thats what I did.\"He grew up in Kingswinford, Worcestershire, where his father ran a transport yard. Don trained as a motor mechanic after leaving school at the age of  and went on to qualy as a motor vehicle technician in the summer of . He was called up when war broke out in September of that year, having joined the volunteer reserve two years previously.After pilot training he enjoyed rapid promotion in Bomber Command and was an acting squadron leader when, ing from a mission near Hanover in May , his aircraft was attacked from below by an unseen German fighter plane. The bomb aimer, navigator, flight engineer and wireless operator were all killed but Don survived along with his mid-upper and rear gunner. Somehow he managed tohis crippled Stirling to an emergency landing field on the east coast of England despite suffering severe spinal injuries, damage to his left eye, lacerations around his head and a hole in his knee. He still bears the scars.Don spent eight months in hospital and was discharged as medically unfit. However, he refused to accept that his flying career was over and lodged an objection with the air ministry. Eventually his appeal was successful and he was reinstated, being retrained in the new discipline of radio observer.Operations in the aftermath of D-Day included Market Garden in September  ndash \"I went to Arnhem five times during that debacle,\" says Don ndash and he continued in Stirlings until .He and his first we Lillian were married in  and they had three children: daughter Elaine, now living in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and sons Peter and Robert, who are both ex-Navy. Peter is in Denmark while Robert has a management post at Dounreay.Don ed to the motor trade after the war and became general service manager with a large garage group. He then spent more than  years working in further education, including a spell as head of the engineering department at a college of technology in Salisbury.Lillian died in  after many years of ill-health and in  Don moved to Thurso, coming out of retirement to work for eight years with local firm Ashley Ann. In  he was married for a second time, to Lybster-born Isabel, whose three daughters became part of the family. Isabel died in .Don still keeps in touch with three of his former crew-mates from those D-Day operations: Jim Wayman, the rear gunner, who lives in Dorset Eric Winter, flight engineer, in Coventry and Sid Harrison, the mid-upper gunner, who lives in Crewe. However, there was a particularly close and enduring bond between Don and his pilot, New Zealander Frank Cox.\"Although our families were half a world apart, they sort of grew up together ndash he came over [to this country] and I went to New Zealand,\" says Don. \"In  his daughter rang me from New Zealand and said Frank was dying of bowel cancer ndash he knew he was terminally ill and he hadnt got long to live. They had asked himthere was anything he really wanted, and hed said, Id love to see my old mate again. So I went to New Zealand and I was with him when he died.\"Now you cant explain relationships like that ndash they exist because of the worth of each one of you to the other in action. Its what they call camaraderie. Im still in touch with his family.\"As his thoughtsto the events of  on the Normandy beaches, Don agrees that D-Day was a turning point ndash \"theres no doubt about that\". But he adds: \"I regret to say I dont think weve learned any lessons. I dont think we should be doing what were doing now [in Iraq].\"As I look back I think first of all how lucky I was and I feel very sad about the people who gave their lives in that struggle. Its not really appreciated, the sacrices that were made both on the home front and in action. Its a sad reflection on society, I feel.\"We ought to be very thankful that were free, because thats what it was about. We should remember that this country wouldnt be freeit had been overrun by Nazi Germany.\"It was all for a cause. People may say, Oh, thats patriotic nonsense. But it isnt.\"* This is a slightly edited version of an interview first published in the John OGroat Journal of June , .Monday  Jan  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"More festive frustration for Wick Academy as Formartine snatch victory in stoppage time","story":"Wick Academy  Formartine United Formartine United took advantage of a late red card to Danny Mackay to hit an injury-time winner and consign Academy to a second defeat over the festive period.The Scorries struggled to create any clear chances but defended resolutely and the game appeared to be drting towards a goalless draw before Graeme Rodgerrsquos late strike.Manager Tom McKenna made two enforced changes to his side, with Ross Allan and Andrew Hardwick replaced by Gordon MacNab and Craig Gunn. Sixteen-year old Mark Macadie, brother of Richard, made his first appearance on the bench.Academy started positively and Marc Macgregor twice tested Formartine keeper Kevin Main within the opening  minutes ndash first when he scuffed a shot straight at Main after being set up by a driving run down the right from Davie Allan, and then seeing an edge-of-the-box effort comfortably held.With Wick sitting deep in clear defensive blocks of four and five, the visitors took control after that and passed up several decent opportunities to take the lead.Archie Macphee found himself with a clear look at goal a quarter of an hour in but he somehow poked wide of Sean McCarthyrsquos left-hand post, and Rodger followed that moments later by guiding a shot wide of the same spot.After coming through that tough -minute spell, it was Academy who threatened next when, after a great spin in midfield by Grant MacNab, the ball came through for Macgregor whose shot was blocked by Main.The biggest cheer of the half came when Formartine assistant manager Russell Anderson, unhappy with what he felt was a series of unfair decisions against his team, was given a strict talking to by lineswoman Molly Alexander.Academy made a tactical switch with Craig Gunn and Davie Allan swapping wings and Gordon MacNab moving upfield to partner Macgregor up top. The move failed to pay idends as Wick couldnrsquot trouble the away defence throughout the half, Davie Allan coming closest to goal when he skewed his shot wide after a one-two with Macgregor.Formartine similarly struggled to break down a well-drilled home defence, but they smelled blood when Mackay was given a second yellow card in the last minute after a collision with substitute Scott Ferries.It was another Formartine sub who played a key role in the winner when Liam Burnett skipped past Craig Gunn to the by-line and cut back for the unmarked Rodger, who had the simple task of tapping it home.Wick Academy: McCarthy, M Steven, Farquhar, D Mackay, Manson, Henry, Gunn, Macgregor , D Allan, Gordon MacNab , Grant MacNab .

Improvements to the north brae are very welcome and I hope that it is the start of a bigger vision to improve the entire Berriedale Braes.\"We can expect the standard lead-in period of about three months and for discussions to be held with the contractor on how they propose to physically approach the works and discussions with statutory bodies like the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds among others.\"He said that archaeological investigatory works have been completed.The award of the contract was also welcomed by Trudy Morris, chief executive of Caithness Chamber of Commerce.She said: \"We are delighted to see that after many years of dedicated campaigning by the chamber, Caithness Transport Forum and other local organisations, this project is finally moving ahead. For too long, the Berriedale Braes has acted as a pinch point for travellers on the A north of Inverness, disrupting business and jeopardising investment in the region.\"It has been good to see other work on A improvements and repairs going to local companies in recent years, and we hope the principal contractor will engage closely with our highly skilled local supply chain as these works progress.\"Ms Morris added: \"Now that the contract has been formally awarded, we hope to see clarication on exact start dates and expectedof works very soon.

Following on from its four other adaptations of children’s classics, as well as pantomimes and avant-garde entries to the SCDA festival, the group has decided to stage a musical version of Arthur Ransome’s well-known book Swallows and Amazons.Developed for the famous Bristol Old Vic theatre, it tells the story of four rather straight-laced children on holiday in the s, given permission, in those pre-risk assessment days, to take a dinghy out onto the lake with their father’s warning not to be “duffers,” in other words, just to be sensible. They soon get their sense of adventure heightened when they meet the fierce Amazon pirates, otherwise the Blackett sisters, Nancy and Peggy. After a brief “battle of the boats” on the lake, they decide to wage another war against the Blacketts’ Uncle Jim, soon to be renamed “Captain Flint,” simply because he has spent the summer writing a boring book and isn’t a fun uncle any more. That, and a mysterious burglary, makes for an exciting, funny and absorbing play, with a surprise at every turn.The story is great fun, all the more so since the production uses a number of clever devices to turn everyday household objects into boats, rocks, weapons and everything  needed to tell the story. The cast, made up of actors ranging in age from  to  plus, have enjoyed creating their characters and learning the very catchy songs with this year#s musical director Glenys Hughes.Soyou want to see how a hall can be turned into a lake without flooding it, Deerness Dram Group encourage you to come along on February ,  or  and join in the fun!

The names of the companies involved have however, not been released.Minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, said: “Issuing the Invitation to Tender marks the next stage of the process to award the new contract to operate the Northern Isles Ferry Services.“The contract will run for eight years, allowing us to build a strong working relationship with the successful bidder, and all the routes within the network are being tendered as a single bundle.“The Scottish Government remains fully committed to high quality ferry services to the Northern Isles. A key benefit of this new contract is the in-built flexibility, allowing the ferry services to be amended to reflect future changes in demand across the important sectors of the islands’ economies – tourism, fishing, food and drink, aquaculture and farming. Scottish Ministers will also retain control of all of important issues, such as fares and timetables, through the public service contract.“We are committed to a fair, open and transparent tender which aims to get the best possible deal for the communities that depend on these ferry services.”• Commenting on the issue, Northern Isles MSP’s Liam McArthur and Tavish Scott said: “The Scottish Government have finally issued the tender. The timescale is very tight indeed given the operator needs to be up and running the North Isles leline ferry services in  months’ time. It is essential that companies make constructive bids with improvements to the existing service. It must, in particular, recognise the growing freight volumes that are being exported south to the Scottish mainland.“So the tender bids must be properly assessed to ensure the service moves forward and not backwards.

She agreed to look at ways the Scottish Government may be able to help in identying potential options.Commenting after these exchanges, Mr McArthur said: “It remains a concern that Orkney continues to be without a local abattoir. I am very conscious that the longer this remains the case, the more dficult it will be to find a solution.“I welcome the cabinet secretary’s willingness to re-engage with the Council and other local stakeholders in Orkney in an attempt to make sure that all possible options are fully explored.

SSEN say these changes are aimed at improving the security of supply serving one of Orkney#s most remote islands, enhancing network resilience for the local community.The network operator has also installed new automation equipment on the network which allows SSEN’s teams to remotely operate switches, meaning power can be restored much quicker in the event of a power cut by remotely isolating the affected part of the network.Colin Rendall, SSEN’s Orkney Operations Manager, said: “The work on Sanday forms part of an ongoing commitment to target our investment towards improving network reliability in the areas with the greatest potential impact and improvement for our customers. We’re delighted to have completed this project on time and on budget, providing a more resilient, stronger electricity network for our customers on Sanday.“As a responsible network operator, we worked closely with archaeologists and ecologists to ensure all works were completed in a responsible manner, with careful consideration for the local landscape and environment. We’d like to thank the local community for their support and patience during these works.”This work, delivering on one of SSEN’s business commitments, means the main network line serving  properties from Stove to the north end of Sanday has now been upgraded — resulting in a more resilient network for SSEN’s customers living and working on the island.Mobile generation was deployed throughout the duration of the project to minimise disruption to the island community, ensuring schools, shops, hotels and local businesses stayed on supply whilst SSEN’s engineers undertook this essential work.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The programme starting today will culminate with ldquomemory blankets that each participant will design and create.Evanton Wood education co-ordinator Simon Harry said: ldquoThis is a great addition to our summer dementia programme as we have secured funding to continue this programme of activities in the woods throughout the early part of this year.ldquoThe work will be focused at Evanton Community Woods utilising the woodland cabin as a base and using the surrounding forest environment to help bring to le the memories and ideas of the group.ldquoWe will be working closely with local artist Lizzie McDougal who has been a big hit with our group.He added: ldquoLizzie will lead the sessions with input from Evanton Wood staff and volunteers.ldquoThe process will start with two storytelling sessions in which Lizzie will encourage the sharing of memories and stories from each couple within the group.

However, health chiefs have been accused of dragging their feet over helping to find a sustainable future model to deliver the scheme, which many of the users have said gives them a reason to get up in the morning.The project leader, who is employed by High Le Highland, has been told funding will end this month.

The government believes it is in the best interests of the UK to remain in the EU. This is the way to protect jobs, provide security, and strengthen the UK#s economy for every family in the country # a clear path into the future, in contrast to the uncertainty of leaving. This is your decision. The government will implement what you decide.# So said the leaflet distributed to voters across the country at a cost of some £ million by David Cameron’s government. There was no equivocation. The people were being given the choice to decide the course the country should take in its relationship with the EU. A deal was not mentioned, like the ballot paper that would be presented, the question being put was should we remain or leave the EU Those words could not have made the choice more plain while stating the government believed we should remain, but nevertheless confirming the majority decision of the people would be enacted upon. We would expect nothing less. Our parliamentarians had agreed to hand the decision over to the people. We did not know at the time that the turnout of over million would mark the largest democratic expression of political will in Britain’s history. Ever.Now, more than two and a half years later as we approach our departure on  March, we are witnessing before us in open view of the public a well-organised attempt by parliamentarians to go back on their word. Some of them voted in favour of holding the referendum so the decision would rest with the people. Many voted in favour of invoking Article  of the Lisbon Treaty that meant the UK must leave the EU two years hence be there a “deal” for any future relationships or not. All of them have on many occasions said they would “respect” the outcome of the referendum and the solemn verdict of the people. Yet many of those who were on the losing side in the referendum, who claimed they would abide by the result– and still later claimed their fresh popular mandate by standing on their party manesto to leave in our entirety, deal or no deal – are now using every hour to betray their repeated promises.As the last few days of the  general election approached Anna Soubry, seeking re-election as the Conservative MP for Broxtowe, not only stood by her party and its manesto she went further and distributed an e-mail to electors that said, “I accept and will continue to honour the EU referendum result. We are leaving the EU”.During the same campaign fellow Conservative Dominic Grieve QC told voters, “the decision of the electorate in the referendum must be respected” and went further to say of the parliamentary process that “our system works correctly to give effect to the referendum decision”.We now learn that Grieve, in cahoots with others who are intent of wholly disrespecting the referendum by seeking to annul the decision, is proposing to submit a parliamentary amendment that will introduce anarchy to parliament by wresting authority away from the majority and giving it to a minority. This is not about defeating the will of his own party he remains shamelessly a member of, or that of that the government he claims to support, but of ensuring even the will of parliament can be prevented from charting an agreed course – so that in descending into chaos nothing is possible. His amendment would allow only  of the  MPs – a  per cent minority – to take control of parliamentary procedure so long as five of that number are from dferent parties are ten are Conservatives.Grieve’s approach is starkyou cannot win by achieving a majority within the rules, then change the rules so the minority governs the majority. The purpose is clear, he wishes to obstruct the existing law wherebythe EU has not agreed a “deal” with the UK then the process of government being able to amend the law can be grabbed by a minority – not the majority – of MPs in parliament.Ironically what might stop Grieve’s amendment passing is a fear in the Labour leadership that were it to become established it could in future make le for any minority Labour government virtually impossible. Grieve needs the backing of Labour to pass his amendment, but Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell must realise the controversial programme they would dearly wish to introduce in time could be blocked repeatedly by MPs holding out for bargaining concessions unless they had a commanding majority.There is a great deal of comment being expended about why the country’s democracy is now in the mess that it is. Some blame David Cameron for calling the referendum, but he at least gave fair warning he would do so and then having been elected delivered on that promise.The reason we now have an impasse in Westminster is that MPs such as Dominic Grieve, Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston and Nicky Morgan stood for election stating they would respect the referendum result and have then broken their word. It is really that simple.MPs that voted for Article  to be invoked were voting for the possibility of the UK leaving the EU without a transitional agreement before we departed. It is only because of their actions subsequent to the general election that Labour has been able to frustrate the government.Theresa May has to ask herselfseeking to wrest control of her government’s authority is really in keeping with Dominic Grieve – and those Tories who may support his plan – retaining the Conservative Whip and being able to stand as Conservative candidates in any General election they may cause. I cannot see how it can be justied. If Grieve moves his amendment the Whip should be removed so he can be judged for the consequences of his actions.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4859075.1547840122!/image/image.jpg","title":"vegans and meat eaters why they need each other jane bradley","story":"Vegans, carnivores and everyone inbetween should not fight over who is more moral, writes Jane Bradley.You would be forgiven for thinking that the whole world has turned vegan. Supermarket shelves are lined with meat substitutes: sausages, steaks and burgers. There’s even, from this week, vegan “fish and chips” in batter on offer from Quorn.Actually, just seven per cent of the UK population actually identies as vegan – although that is a  per cent increase on two years earlier – according to figures published last year by Comparethemarket. Yet there is no doubt there is a growing, and welcome, movement towards plant-based diets, whether for health or environmental reasons.A report out earlier this week claimed that people across the world need to cut down dramatically on meat and dairy consumption.Yet, like most things in the age of Twitter, it has somehow become a fight: plant-based food vs meat. Vegans versus omnivores. Are you a true vegan or, like my friend, someone who eats an entirely plant-based diet but still owns leather shoes and bags she bought pre-conversion, so is scared to call herself a vegan for fear of being branded a hypocrite This week’s report, compiled by  scientists forming the EAT-Lancet group, paints a stark picture of what we should be doing to combat climate change. Their suggested daily diet includes just  grams a day of red meat, which equates to around two small steaks a month g of chicken g of fish and g of dairy, the equivalent of just one glass of milk along with about one and a bit eggs a week. On the other hand, g of fruit and g of vegetables a day would be required to fill us up.Whether or not the EAT-Lancet’s plan should be followed – and there has been some backlash as to the independence of the investigation – in practice, it never will be, not by everyone.What people are scared of is extremes. Someone who enjoys a processed-meat fried breakfast every day is not suddenly going to switch to a vegan lestyle, no matter how many plant emoticons someone tweets at him.: Sean Murphy: Growth and popularity of veganism in the UK showing no sign of slowingA colleague, not usually known for following a good diet, on  January, decided he was to have a massive lestyle sht. Suddenly, gone were the processed foods and sugar-laden snacks: in came an entire grocer’s worth of fruit and vegetables packets of unsalted nuts and boxed leftovers from nutrient-rich, home-cooked dinners.For a couple of weeks, he was a paragon of virtue, swapping healthy-eating tips with his deskmate, a formerly hard-living hack turned tumeric-tea-drinking-almond-milk-quaffing puritan.But earlier this week, disaster struck. We’re still not clear what caused this dramatic fall from the wagon, but on Wednesday, we found him guzzling a bottle of Lucozade washed down with a packet of Haribo, while he lunched on an entire pack of out-of-date croutons followed by a sausage roll.He had even, we discovered, covertly reverted to his old habits of scoffing a bacon roll – left over from a morning breakfast meeting buffet, and reheated in the office microwave.Yet,he had not taken things to such extremes in the first place, perhaps he would have lasted longer on his health kick, which would have good for not only him, but for the environment too.Increasingly, the argument for veganism comes from the animal-cruelty angle, rather than anything to do with health or even environmental arguments. For people who feel like this, this is a perfectly valid decision and they are entitled to make it. Yet, there are many who don’t and their views should also be respected. Of course, increasing animal welfare so that those animals we do eat have a better le before they are killed is obviously a positive thing.: Marks and Spencer launches vegan shoes and accessoriesAt a busy city centre restaurant in Edinburgh this week, my friendwas handed a “vegan and vegetarian menu” along with the a la carte and lunchtime offering from which I chose my meal. More restaurants have this option now – and so they should.Similarly, many years ago, when I lived in Cardf, there was an excellent vegetarian restaurant around the corner to my house which offered a single meat option. And why not  They focused on vegetarian food because that was what they did – and very well. But there was one offering which might appeal to some of its other customers who enjoyed meat. It was always busy. I wonder now, in today’s climate,that restaurant would do as well  I fear it may be boycotted by angry “true vegans” who felt that the restaurant was doing them a disservice.This is where things are going wrong. We should not ghetto-ise food choices, nor insist on slapping labels on everyone’s lestyles. If someone is generally vegan, but has a bacon sandwich once a month, who does that actually hurt  There is no need for things to be as cut and dried as whether someone is carniverous or vegetarian.We need to work together to stop climate change and we will not do that by breaking into camps of vegan and non-vegan, fighting against each other to get the moral upper hand. If most of us just cut down on meat, bought only higher welfare-ieties and ate less processed food, it would be a start, both for our own health and the health of the planet.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4857392.1547647215!/image/image.jpg","title":"brexit nicola sturgeon promises independence timetable in weeks","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Nicola Sturgeon has said Theresa May is #deluding herself# by trying to persist with her Brexit red lines, and suggested details of the timetable for a second Scottish independence referendum would be revealed within #weeks#.The First Minister was at Westminster to meet with SNP MPs, and said an extension of Article  and a People’s Vote were the only realistic options to break the Brexit deadlock.However, she added: “I’ll say more about the timing of a referendum in the next matter of weeks.“I want to see the UK stay in the EU, I think that would be best for the whole of the UK... even when Scotland is independent, that serves our interests best as well. That’s why we’re backing the Peoples Vote, the second EU referendum.“Butthat’s not possible, in terms of our wider interests, the chaos and the fiasco of the last couple of years have shown that the worst thing for Scotland is to be thirled to Westminster when it’s making such a mess of things.

Recent years have seen partial powers in key areas such as taxation and welfare devolved. This will continue as powers in areas such as agriculture and fishing come to Holyrood.“It absolutely is a new kind of devolution because originally the devolution-reserved ide was pretty black and white,” Mr Macintosh said.“The principle is that everything is devolved unless it is reserved to Westminster. Everyone know where the powers were and where the ide lay. But we’ve now got shared responsibilities in any number of areas. Taxation being one of the newest, social security being one of the newest, across a number of areas.”There have always been shared controls in limited areas, going back to food standards at the start of devolution, but as more controls were devolved following the independence referendum this approach has developed.“It’s be more complicated and there’s no two ways about it,” Mr Macintosh added. “The dficulty is that some of these decisions and negotiations are government to government – but the parliaments are holding their inidual governments to account.

A police investigation is taking place into the allegations made by two women and dating back to when he was first minister. But Mr Salmond won a legal challenge against the Scottish Government over its handling of the claims.The Scottish Government is carrying out a review of what happened and Ms Sturgeon has referred herself to independent advisers to consider whether she breached the ministerial code during meetings and phone calls with her predecessor. Mr Salmond said Ms Sturgeon’s focus should be on the drive to bring about independence. He said: “Nicola should be concentrating all her energies on the independence agenda where we will never have better circumstances. As far as I am concerned Westminster’s Brexit dficulty should be Scotland’s opportunity.” Ms Sturgeon is to give an update to the Scottish Parliament on her plans in the coming weeks. A formal request for a Section  order which would give Holyrood the authority to stage a referendum was rejected by the UK government last year, with Prime Minister Theresa may insisting “now is not the time” to revisit the Scottish constitutional issue amid the Brexit uncertainty. It is understood that a further request by the Scottish Government would also be rejected by Westminster.Writing in the Sunday National newspaper yesterday, Mr Salmond said: “One of our features in the national movement has been our inability to weigh the strengths and weaknesses of our political opponents. We have tended to concentrate on the shape we’re in.“However, right now the Westminster political establishment is at its weakest point in my letime while the national movement is in good heart. There is not likely to be a better time to force the issue.”However former SNP deputy leader Jim Sillars warned there is “no appetite” for a second independence referendum. He said: “There is no national Yes organisation in place – a prerequisite to success as many Yes activists and voters are not SNP.“No policy work has been done on the post-Brexit situation and thus we are not in a position to deploy then new policies in that post-Brexit new paradigm that will be needed to convince No voters to vote Yes next time.”Polls indicate there has been no rise in support for independence among Scots since the last vote in  and Perth and North Perthshire MP Pete Wishart said a vote should be held when it can be won.He said: “We are already making progress towards that with Brexit as the catalyst. But it will be dficult to secure the conditions to make a referendum happen before the next Holyrood election.”Alex Bell, a former SNP government adviser also called for a more considered approach.He said: “The SNP and Yes have to stop seeing independence as a sneaky prize to be won when everyone  is messing up and instead base their campaign on the reality of what Scotland can achieve through an honest understanding of the world.”Ms Sturgeon had pledged to hold a second referendum in the immediate aftermath of Brexit but “reset” her plans after the SNP suffered heavy losses in the  UK election.At First Minister’s Questions last week, she said: “Given the catastrophe that Scotland faces in our economy, our society, our living standards, the prospects for the next generation and our reputation in the world, it is essential that the option of independence is open to people in Scotland.“When people in Scotland have the ability to choose independence, I believe that the country will opt to be an independent one.”The Scottish Parliament has already voted in favour of a second referendum following the Brexit vote as the SNP combined with the pro-independence Greens.\u2028Scottish Secretary David Mundell has written to Mrs May to urge her to maintain her refusal to grant Holyrood powers for a second independence referendum.If the authority to hold a second referendum through a Section  is rejected, as expected, by the UK government, it has been suggested that the Scottish Government could make this the central issue of the next Holyrood election in , as it seeks to build the case for a independence in the years ahead.\u2028Tory constitution spokesman Adam Tomkins suggested Ms Sturgeon will seek a Section  order in the knowledge it will be rejected by in order to “stir up as much grievance and bad feeling as possible”.Scottish Liberal Democrat Leader Willie Rennie urged the SNP to abandon plans for another referendum. A Scottish Labour source added: “The last thing Scotland needs is more instability and chaos of yet another independence referendum, what our communities need are Labour governments here and in Westminster to end austerity.”An SNP spokesman said: “With the clock ticking down to Brexit date - and with the Tory government incapable of governing and Labour incapable of effectively opposing - the SNP will continue to focus on standing up for Scotland’s interests in the face of a disastrous Tory-driven Brexit and further austerity.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4858817.1547818802!/image/image.jpg","title":"ryanair cannot rule out more turbulence","story":"Budget airline Ryanair has cautioned over earnings after counting the cost of lower-than-expected airfares over winter.The carrier has trimmed its full-year, post-tax profit guidance from between €. billionand €.bn to a new range of €bn and €.bn.

It is due to reach the KPL facility early next week, although earlier this week it was moored off Ullapool during high winds while the tug ‘Ievoli Black’ sheltered in Gruinard Bay. The rig was still there on Friday .Alistair Philp, secretary of the North West Responsible Fisherman’s Association, praised KPL for the standard of communication with the affected fishermen.He said: “They have been pretty good with updating us. We have been getting passage plans and times and we have been disseminating that information out to the local fishermen. I believe much of the Inner Sound gear has been cleared from the anticipated path of the rig.“I spent a whole day moving my own gear. We can only hope that the rig sticks to the route given. It#s been quite a lot of disruption to many of the fishermen andthe rig deviates even a hundred or so metres there is still plenty of opportunity to foul the moved. and now more-densely packed fishing gear but at least in the area where I am working there has been a -plus metre corridor cleared where the advertised track says the rig will be.“No doubt there are some fishermen who are on holiday or who for whatever reason have not had the opportunity to clear all their gear. However, so long as the OGW sticks to its route damage should be minimised.”Despite the optimism, Mr Philp said he wasn’t sure what “process or policy is in place” in the event of damaged or destroyed gear.He added: “I would suggest that, considering this the first time this has happened in over  years, we assess the outcome from the passage of the rig and then cross that bridge when we come to it. So far, the fishermen and KPL are working together to minimise disruption. Hopefully,there are any issues, they can be resolved in good faith afterwards.“Considering this may become a regular occurrence and some fishermen are dedicating considerable time to moving gear clear and then once the rig is in Kishorn will have to dedicate considerable time to reinstating their gear, it would only seem reasonable in future to consider our options for some sort of compensation for the disruption.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/web-subs-3.jpg","title":"closure of tarbert ferry service to vehicles unavoidable say","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineCalMac’s director of service has  described a planned temporary closure of the linkspan at Tarbert ferry terminal as “unavoidable disruption”.The operator has announced the vehicle service will be out of action for five days across February and March.

If anything, it should be amplied.It turned into a trilogy. There was a Great Book of Skye Two in , and now we have the #Great Book of Skye Three#.That was perhaps predictable. In the first volume, Cailean Maclean commented that he had two problems in persuading Norman Macdonald to prepare the book. The first problem was to get him to start the second was to get him to stop.Three books and , pages later, the prof has stopped — or so he says.The three volumes comprise a Dictionary of Skye Biography. The lives of almost , people are profiled and illustrated inside their pages. They have all #been Skye born or bred or are people who have had an intimate connection with the island. They have all been noteworthy in one way or another… #There has never been more than , people living in Skye at any one time, and for much of history — particularly recent, recorded history — its population has been much smaller than that.Nobody, however, will be too surprised that Norman and Cailean uncovered and portrayed over a thousand eminent Sgiathanaich. Without wishing to kickstart Norman once again, the miracle is that they enumerated so few. The island, like almost all Hebridean islands, has been a breeding ground of talent and character.The only other qualication for entry in the Great Books of Skye is that you must be dead. You, dear reader, however, accomplished you might be, will not be able to read your entry unless metaphysics permits you access from your celestial cloud. These are obituaries, not panegyrics.That lends a sombre tone to certain pages of the Great Book of Skye Three. There are people featured here who, we are sharply reminded, were alive when volume one was in preparation.Here, for instance, is the smiling face of Dr Vicky Ann Galbraith, who was born in Portree in  and who died at home in Aird Bernisdale of brain cancer in .Vicky Ann was achievement personied. A leading scientist for Roche Pharmaceuticals, she also played for Scotland#s national women#s rugby union team on  occasions. Following her fatal diagnosis, she raised thousands of pounds for cancer research by leading sponsored walks from Portree to Glasgow, up the West Highland Way and where.Here is Thomas William Mackenzie. You may have known him as Tommy. He was born in  and he died last March. He was, in the GBS abbreviated subheading, a #printmaker, etcher and gallery owner, Chieftain of Skye Highland Games, boat race devotee, tug-of-war revivalist, shinty enthusiast, and half-marathon runner.#That just about covers it, as a dictionary of biography is forbidden to indulge itself and cannot add that for very many people, Tommy Mackenzie was the face and personality of modern Portree.These volumes, these hefty Great Books of Skye, are a leisurely parade along Wentworth Street and then out to the peninsulas, pausing to wave at or pass the time of day with Victorian land reformers, clan chiefs, bards, teachers, surgeons, fishermen, and climbers. It#s a verbal Skye equivalent of the cover of #Sergeant Pepper#s Lonely Hearts Club Band#.Sir Harold Boulton was not a Sgiathanach. He came from Hertfordshire and was educated at Harrow and Oxford.In  he married into the Highland quality via a Dingwall military family. Boulton already had an interest in Gaelic song and music.He enters the Great Book of Skye because, in the late th century, Boulton seems to have heard a Gaelic rowing song and put his own, English, words to the tune.Those lyrics and that tune have become internationally known as #The Skye Boat Song#. Norman Macdonald digresses wonderfully on Boulton#s creation of a supposed Jacobite anthem.We are still left with the dilemma of the bonnie boat#s journey. The original Gaelic version may have celebrated a voyage from Torrin to Loch Coruisk. For most of the th century, it was assumed to refer to Charles Edward Stuart#s post-Culloden flight by sea from the mainland to Skye.As Charles never made such a journey directly by sea, pedants have more recently suggested that Boulton must have been referring to the Pretender#s actual sea voyage It really, really, does not matter. We are in the realms of mythology. Charles may as well have been sailing from Papua New Guinea. Harold Boulton invented the whole damn thing — the misty isle#s most famous song is a Victorian concoction — and in recognition of that, he deserves his entry in the Great Book of Skye Three.And finally, here we are back in Portree. William Cowie was born in Kiltarlity in  and became an agricultural advisor in Skye in the s. The brother of a professional footballer, Cowie devoted himself to shinty and became one of the greatest players of his era.Fittingly, he married in  a grand-daughter of the captain of the Skye shinty team which had won the inaugural MacTavish Cup in .William and Margaret Cowie had two sons, Ross and William. He died too young, at the age of  years, while playing badminton in Portree Drill Hall.William Cowie would, therefore, have been shy of his th birthday had he led his natural course to June  and a day in Fort William which would have caused him, more even than the rest of Skye, unimaginable pride.It is tempting to say of all three Great Books of Skye that they are for dipping in and out rather than reading as a single narrative. The trouble with that suggestion is that once you#ve dipped in, it is very hard to dip out again.As a trilogy, they are a phenomenal publishing achievement. They should take their place, alongside the inevitable Tommy Mackenzie print, in every home in Skye."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1380213.jpg--.jpg?1547207055000\n","title":"57 job losses confirmed by administrator jbe not feasible","story":"The Administrator for JBE Mechanical.Electrical Ltd, the Ballymena based electrical and mechanical firm, has announced that following a review of all options in respect of the business, that it is not feasible for the business to continue to trade.Speaking following a meeting with all staff at the firm’s headquarters at Braid River Business Park in Ballymena, the Administrator Gerard Gildernew said: “Unfortunately, following our review of live contracts and the company order book, I have concluded that it is not feasible to continue trading the business in administration.

This is an issue which needs addressing and one which requires a Strategy, to be put in place.Whilst I like the idea of our local Assembly producing a strategy, it is vital that this statistic is reduced, drastically.”Ian’s we Beverley lost a family member over  years ago, through suicide. Beverley commented: “our family knows only too well the pain and heartache which family and friends endure, following such a tragic loss. For many years, you ask the question why.You also wonder,only they had engaged with someone, and that person had been able to offer some glimmer of hope, which resulted in them not pursuing their course of action. “There have been a number of suicides in our town recently and since the Samaritans are a wonderful organisation, who offer a tremendous telephone helpline service, we thought that it would be worthwhile to try and raise some funds, for this great charity.”The Samaritans’s vision is that fewer people die by suicide. They believe that it is time to look beyond the statistics and into the real lives of these people, so that they and others, can find ways, to reduce any unnecessary deaths. The Samaritans know that when people are in crisis, talking can help that person.Beverley added: “ the money raised at this event, can fund just one phone call to the Samaritans and the Samaritan at the other end of the line is able to provide some hope and results in one person not proceeding with their plan to take their own le,then this event will have been very worthwhile. “I would appeal to anyone who is facing dficulties, no matter what they are, to call the Samaritans on  . The Samaritans volunteers provide a listening ear,  days per year and you can call them any hour of the day, or night,”If you are able to help out in any small way, by baking a few scones tray bakes or by just coming along to have a cuppa and a scone and to give a donation, the organisers will certainly appreciate your kindness.IN PICTURES: Dromore High opens its doors to prospective pupils Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8770151.1547557159!/image/image.jpg","title":"education  ","story":"Dromore High School recently welcomed prospective pupils to the school.

P children from Seymour Hill met with Mrs Jess before her birthday and found out more about her le, before sharing the story with the rest of the school.School Principal Mr Stephen Nimmons explained: “During World War Two Mrs Jess worked at a hem stitching factory near Dromore, where she worked on the machines and made fancy patterns around pillow cases and table cloths. “Every day she would have to cycle four miles to work and in the evenings four miles back home – rain, hail or snow. When the war was at its height, the factory started making unorms for the soldiers. From her house in Kinallen, she could see the lights of Belfast light up the sky when the German bombers came.“Just after the war, in , Mrs Jess married and went on to have three daughters. She has been a widow for  years and now has three children, six grandchildren and six great grandchildren. “Mrs Jess came to live in Seymour Hill on February ,  when there were no schools, shops nor churches built on the estate at the time. Seymour Hill Primary School was built by September  when the first pupils started the school. “She started working in the school when it opened in  and she worked in the school for over  years until her retirement. She worked as a cleaner for most of those years, as well as being a lunchtime supervisor and for a short time, she was also the school caretaker.“The children, staff and PTA of Seymour Hill PS wish to thank Mrs Jess for taking time to talk with them and visit the school on such a special occasion.”Vintage car show celebrates th birthday Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"LISB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"LISB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8769766.1547548496!/image/image.jpg","title":"mla speaks out over electoral office closure","story":"Upper Bann DUP MLA Carla Lockhart and Alderman Junior McCrum have spoken out over concerns at the closure of the electoral office in Banbridge.The Upper Bann MLA has previously expressed her concern at the news that the future of a number of locations were under review. “I am very disappointed that this decision has been taken,” said Mrs Lockart. “I have taken this matter up with the Chief Electoral Officer however, the message I feel has been ignored.

Schoolchildren, cyclists, runners, older people and people with acute medical conditions immediately spring to mind, but in fact I think everyone should carry an ICE Card. People don’t think twice about wearing a seatbelt or cycling helmet, butyou had a serious accident you’d like your next of kin to know as soon as possible and you’d want the best care possible in a medical emergency. Almost everyone carries a wallet or purse with them so this is the ideal place to keep an ICE Card”.Chief Inspector Barney O’Connor commented: “PSNI is fully supportive of this initiative which is straightforward, practical and user-friendly and provides families reassurance that a loved one has personal information accessible in all emergency situations. Ideal for use whether you are a student studying away from home, an older person or someone with a medical condition.”The ICE Card ensures all the essential information is accessible in one place meaning it could help save lives, provide the best help and care, as well as make sure your next of kin can be contacted promptly.Information about medications and allergies helps ambulance personnel make better decisions about treatments they can give you and crucially in the case of heavy blood loss, it is important for emergency staff to know your blood type. In the case of people with conditions such asAlzheimer’s it can help a person who may be confused contact their family and avoid any unnecessary distress.The cards are initially being rolled out at PCSP and PSNI engagement events and through groups.

They are told with the reverence and respect you would expect from someone whose fictional characters populate the very streets and alleyways he himself walked and walks. These are stories sympathetically woven from yarns shared at wakes and barricades and they are told with all the authenticity and captivating power of a backstreet seanchaí.And while the protagonists are sympathetically drawn — there are no psychopathic terrorist godfathers or feeble-minded IRA cannon-fodder here — there is deceit, treachery and even murder.If your conception of Ballymurphy circa  is based upon the ramblings of our mainstream media commentators scrambling for credibility or the pulp fiction ravings of Jack Higgins, then the short stories in ‘Gáire in Éag’ will be like epistles from another planet. If, however, you actually knew people who stored weapons for the IRA, sheltered republican active service units, engaged in armed struggle for the IRA or even betrayed the IRA — and most probably called them your neighbours — then these stories of ordinary people in extraordinary times is a tonic for the retired troops. Of course, to enjoy this exceptional collection, you will have to be able to read Irish, the literary language of ‘John Boy’ Ó Muireagáin, evennot his mother tongue. That, the author says, is the book#s strength — evenit means not all those who would be able to recognise themselves in its pages will get to enjoy it.“I don’t think you would get a publisher for this book in English,” says Seán . “To be published in English on the topic of our conflict, you need to have a certain point-of-view which often has not even the faintest connection to the reality we experienced. In ‘Idir Dhá Thine Bealtaine’, I tell the story of a woman who kept an arms dump for the IRA. I don’t judge her but I dotell her story as a writer who is very proud of the republican and nationalist people from whom I come. After all, the people who hid IRA weapons were, some might say, more heroic than the people who did the shooting. Every night, they went to sleep dreading the early-morning raid. And yet, no-one is telling the story of those overlooked heroes who are at the core of any revolution ” A member of the extended Ó Muireagáin tribe which spearheaded the Irish language revival in the Upper Springfield area, Seán, now , didn’t start writing until he was well into his forties. “I started with poems about ten years ago,” he says. “They helped me make sense of my own le but about four years ago I started to try my hand at short stories. I wanted to tell the story of my own community, a story which hasn’t been told despite the mountains of books which have been written about us. I felt I could do that in Irish easier than in English. The Irish language community is tighter and more understanding than the larger English language public and you can sidestep the inevitable condemnation which would rain down on anyone who wrote stories with this worldview in English.”His fluent story-telling style is comfortable and engaging and firmly rooted in lives which would be considered humdrum and ordinarythere wasn’t a war raging in the background. His fealty to his subjects is reminiscent of the master Basque writer Bernardo Atxaga who tells the story of an entire people without leaving the tiny mountain village of Obaba. But the Ballymurphy man’s genius with words doesn’t stop there for in setting his stories against the background of the battlefield, he takes up the mantle of Kenya’s greatest author Ngugi wa Thiong’o whose books demolish the previously accepted white-man’s-burden version of the Mau Maustruggle against British colonialism. However, anyone expecting The Victor comicbook-style war stories of republican derring-do is likely to be disappointed.“The stories are about war and conflict at a very personal level how conflict affected the lives of ordinary people,” says Seán. “In ‘Sceithire# , I look at the informer not in traditional black and white republican terms but with empathy for the tout#s family and, of course, with an eye to the mirrors-within-mirrors nether world of informers.”The longest story in the collection, Pól, is a dark, macabre helter-skelter in which an enraged lover sets out on a murderous rampage, covering up his deeds in the undergrowth of Troubles’ killings. “I always wonderedsomeone with malign intent could literally have got away with murder and through Pól I get to let my imagination roam free,” says Seán. “However, no-one should reopen any cold cases all my characters are fictional. True, many are inspired by a titbit of true information or by a real event but ultimately, this is fiction not loose talk.”Seán is keen to let his short stories do the talking for him but he does have a fascinating story of his own to tell — perhaps in memoir form now that he is taking early retirement from the Irish language agency Comhairle na Gaelscolaíochta to focus on his writing. A poet, short story writer , a consummate sean-nós singer and even a stand-up comedian, Seán was a renaissance man before the term was invented but his renaissance started with the Irish language.“I am just an ordinary person who had the good luck to discover this Irish language which has nurtured me since I was a teenager,” he says. “Now I want to give back by writing plays, poems and stories which do justice to the ordinary people who make up my community and who have come through the most extraordinary times with their heads held high.”Seán Ó Muireagáin has no plans for an English language translation but what brought Atxaga and Ngugi to a wider audience, the gt of translation, could reveal this gem of a book to a wider audience in the time ahead. Indeed, that would be the perfect way to mark the centenary of our own wee country in !

In Belfast we have load of Victoria places. A hospital, a shopping mall, a university. We also have a bridge named after Queen Elizabeth. Of course those named venues are not really about the women they are named after. We all know it is about their position, the reign of empire and monarchy.The only other place named after a woman that I am aware of is the Mary Peters’ Track. Unlike the aforementioned, it is hard to view that negatively. Mary earned it the hard way.There are also very, very, few places named after working class heroes. As we walk our streets in West Belfast we walk on the roads named after imperial battles or, less insultingly, places like Donegal. The exception is the Michael Ferguson Roundabout named after the beloved councillor who died too young but had dedicated his short le to the people of Colin.In the s, when standing in the Bolshoi Ballet in Moscow, being hosted by Mikail Gorbachev, Mrs Emma Groves was handed a blini with caviar. She turned to the only other woman in attendance from West Belfast, Clara Reilly, and said, “I think I’d prefer a fish supper.” That night at the performance, Clara sat beside her friend Emma, who had no sight but could hear the glorious music, and she described to Emma the intricate costumes and the air-like dancing.Emma Groves and Clara Reilly were not there on a jolly. They were not invited as political favour. They had travelled to Moscow at the height of the Cold War to ask for help for the most forgotten and dismissed of victims of our conflict. They lobbied for Soviet support to end the use of plastic and rubber bullets. In the same breath we can mention a similar visit by these two women to Washington to lobby the other side of Cold War incredibly impressive human rights advocacy that would be recognised more universally had they not been Irish women from West Belfast highlighting British state abuses. Mrs Clara Reilly embodies the spirit of freedom. A spine of steel and a heart of gold. Her story is yet to be written. But she has some of that story still to write.When Emma Groves passed away, she was carried by those who loved her, including Clara, in a willow basket. She epitomised humility. It was no surprise that her final wishes were to contribute to the earth. She gave example to us all.Both women shone a light of humanity in the darkest of days. Despite horric violations of injury and bereavement visited upon them both, they could only think of others who they used their hearts and strength to support and advocate on behalf of. While other human rights advocates on this island looked to South Africa or Nicaragua in safety, these women stood in their own streets and insisted on human rights beginning at home.This weekend Belfast will have a new nameplate. This time for two working class women who would not be silenced or intimidated. Who refused to allow a line of expedient amnesia to be drawn during our peace process. Our streets become richer with their names. The history of human rights in Ireland will now speak of Emma and Clara. Our friends.

I worked there for a further two years under the stewardship of Jim Deery, who I owe a lot to. Jim really gave me a foot up when I needed it. I cut my teeth in the back streets of the New Lodge learning about social justice, community development and participative democracy.“I always knew I wanted to work with young people – it’s my passion. In St Malachy’s I spent as many free periods as I could get playing football as opposed to studying – I wanted to do teaching at that time, but I wasn’t really interested in the A-Levels I was doing.“There was always that draw to work with people, young people in particular. My mummy was always heavily involved in the community and volunteering, so I also have that family background.”After six years at the Star, Chris went on to become a Senior Development Officer at the Bytes Project before taking up a post as the Children and Young People’s Coordinator with Belfast City Council, where he helped set up a city youth forum and Belfast’s first skate park.Remarkably, he took up the Director’s role at NIYF just a few years later when he was just  years old. It presented a massive new challenge, which Chris insists he was well prepared to meet, despite his young age.“It was definitely in my DNA,” he said.“It’s about building the capacity of young people to affect positive change.“We always talk about young people being part of the solution as opposed to being the problem, and again I have to pay credit to Jim Deery, he was the one who schooled me in that chain of thought.“All of those people in the Star really heavily influenced my thinking. All of my jobs since leaving school, whether it was in voluntary or paid capacity, had that underbelly. It’s about people making positive change for themselves.“When the job in the Youth Forum came up it was like a dream job, it was allowing me to do something that I had been practising for years, but only on a regional basis.“The role here is very strategic. You’re linked into government, you’re linked into the EU, we’re presenting to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, so we’re doing all of this amazing work internationally as well as locally.“We are working with young people who are on the margins, such as homeless young people, and seeing those young people building their own capacity to affect change in their own lives and communities is amazing.”He continued: “Some days I feel like I should come in with a firefighter’s hat, because you spend an awful lot of time fighting fires and managing mini crises.“A big part of the job is strategising, lobbying and campaigning. I often talk about speaking truth to power, so it’s about bringing the voice of young people to those in a position of power. Sometimes that’s uncomfortable for those in positions of power, because you’re banging down doors to try to affect change for the marginalised people in society. Every day is a battle. You’re fighting a fight for people who are getting the rough end of the stick.”In an ever-changing world, the problems faced by young people have become increasingly complex, and Chris says that many of them are challenges faced by young people the world over. However, he believes that legacy of our recent conflict makes many of our own young people’s challenges unique.“Whether you’re in Belfast, Paris or Sydney, there are massive problems around mental health, drugs, poverty, exclusion and all of these things you can apply to any area,” he said.“The big thing here is the legacy of the past – it’s the lens that magnies all of these problems. I would relate a lot of the reasons our high suicide rates and mental ill-health to the conflict and the legacy of the past. There is a lot we still don’t know we talk about transgenerational trauma. You just need to look out the window and you can see people living with these issues and a lot of it is linked to the conflict. If we don’t deal with legacy and we don’t deal with the conflict then that’s not going to go away.”Despite the magnitude of the task ahead, Chris and the NIYF are relentless in their pursuit of a better society. After serving that eye-opening apprenticeship he now heads one of the largest providers of non-formal education in the country. There is undoubtedly a lesson to be learned from his experience.“I know it’s a cliché, but what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger,” he said.“Every time you are faced with a challenge it can be a valuable lesson. Again, another cliché, sometimes you learn more in failure than in success. I’m a great believer in ‘Mól an óige agus tiocfaidh sí – praise the youth and they shall prosper’.“In my work le and in my voluntary work teaching kids in sport I try to teach them about work ethic. I try to teach them that hard work beats talent and that talent doesn’t work hard.“The education system as it is set up is designed for maybe  per cent of high achievers, so in my opinion it is failing so many young people. Non-formal education, for us, is about finding that passion. For us it’s about encouraging young people to find the thing that lights the fire in their belly.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"image of the day monday","story":"Renowned human rights activist Clara Reilly looks on as Belfast Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey and West Belfast MP Paul Maskey unveil the sign at the newly-named Groves Reilly Corner – Coirnéal Groves Reilly – on the site of the former Andersonstown Barracks.

That’s all we asked and that’s what got.“Peter Healy, Kristian Healy, Odhran Eastwood, boys like that, James McAuley, Joe Maskey – calm heads. Eoin Nagle was fantastic up front.“It’s going to take a good team to beat us. I’m so proud of the boys – that was some performance.”Naomh Éanna settled into the game quickly and a goal from the impressive Kristian Healy, following good work from Nagle and midfielder Ethan Gibson, put them into a - to - lead on eight minutes.The pace of the Naomh Éanna attack created numerous goal chances in the first half, with Liam Kelly making a last-ditch clearance to deny Odhran Eastwood, but the Ulster side didn’t have long to wait before finding the net again.On  minutes, Joe Maskey and Kristian Healy put centre-forward Ruairi Scott through on goal and, despite Manus Breathnach’s best efforts in the An Spidéal goal, the shot had too much power and trickled into the net.The Galway men were reliant on free-taker Antaine Ó Lao to keep them in touch, with the centre-forward landing four frees in the first half.Yet their defence was being repeatedly unlocked by the sheer pace of Naomh Éanna, who forced several turnovers.With  minutes played, goalkeeper Breathnach was caught in possession around midfield and dropped the ball under pressure from James McAuley and Maskey with the former gathering possession.After talking a few steps forward, Maskey unleashed a shot with the outside of his right boot which carried  yards into the unguarded net.Leading by six at the break, Naomh Éanna never looked in danger of losing the game with Eastwood unerring from frees – finishing with a haul of -, with one from play. An Spidéal’s discipline undermined any slim hopes they had of getting back in the contest, with Eoin Ó Droigheáin and Conal Ó Caoimh picking up black cards either side of Ó Lao’s dismissal as Naomh Éanna held their nerve to claim a seven-point victory.

Under the terms of an amendment tabled by Dominic Grieve and controversially passed by MPs, today is her deadline to present a new plan to MPs.While the details of this Plan B are not clear, the chairman of the Eurosceptic European Research Group Jacob Rees-Mogg wrote in the Mail on Sunday that it was possible for Mrs May to get a deal through the Commonsshe persuaded the EU to show flexibility on the backstop and £bn orce bill.“If I had to choose between a no-deal and Mrs May’s original accord, I would have no hesitation of opting for no-deal Brexit, but even Mrs May’s deal would be better than not leaving at all,” he wrote.Read MoreDowning Street rejects claim PM wants to change Good Friday AgreementLeaving without deal would be a disaster, says farmers’ unionRemainer MPs are trying to steal Brexit, says FoxIt’s good to talk:Mrs May has offered to talk to Opposition parties and groups with dferent desires and views to find consensus in Parliament. But her refusal to abandon no-deal Brexit and other leaders’ refusal to speak properly until she does, suggests one party will need to cede some ground.Also writing in the Mail on Sunday, chief Brexit representative for the European Parliament Guy Verhofstadt said: “If necessary, this document could still be enhanced in the next coming weeks.“British politicians will always find an open door to do that, but they must act soon.“This will only happenpolitical parties in the UK start to work together.“Such a cross-party approach is not natural to the adversarial UK political system, but it’s time to change course and to put the national interest ahead of narrow party political interests.”Confidence vote .:The Opposition can in theory call as many of these votes as they like, although the Lib Dems have said they will not support another as they believe it is a waste of time.Such a vote could trigger a general election but this is very much the nuclear option for Tory rebels and the DUP has already said it will not vote with Labour, so it appears to be unlikely.Back to Brussels for more talks:The EU has said repeatedly that it will not reopen negotiations on the withdrawal agreement, and “assurances” on the Irish border backstop were dismissed by Brexiteers earlier this week. There is little time and no clear indication what more the EU can or wants to offer. France has stepped up its no-deal preparations.Asking for an extension of Article :Mrs May has previously insisted almost to the point of foot-stamping that Britain will leave the EU on March , and a U-turn here would enrage already puce Brexiteers.But writing in The Observer, Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said: “The PM has pushed us dangerously close to the exit door with perilously little left on the clock.“So it’s vital that immediate steps be taken to extend Article .“Not to stop Brexit, but to ensure that there’s time to force a change of Government, or find a solution Parliament can back.”Halting of Article :A court case last year ruled that, while all  other EU states have to agree to extend the Article  process of leaving, the UK can unilaterally reverse it.Neither the Tories nor Labour support a halt, but Philip Hammond reportedly told business leaders in a conference call on Wednesday that a bill being rustled up by backbenchers would have this as its aim.A second referendum:Labour members at conference left the door open to supporting a new vote on leavingthe party could not trigger a general election. Mr Corbyn was applauded by Labour activists when he pointed this out in a speech on Thursday.

the default outcomeno other arrangements with the EU can be agreed by Parliament by then.It also comes as a senior DUP MP floated the idea of a free trade agreement with the EU as a possible way forward out of the current Brexit impasse.Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the partys chief whip, called for \"political maturity\" and an end to \"megaphone diplomacy\" as the clock ticks down to a disorderly Brexit.The Lagan Valley MP said his party was \"ready to engage\" to find a way forward that avoids a hard border.\"I believe it is possible to arrive at a UK-wide solution that protects both the integrity of the UK and the EU and avoids a hard border,\" he told the Sunday Independent.\"Certainly, such an outcome avoids a hard Brexit but it doesnt mean the UK staying in the single market.\"A new free trade agreement with the European Union should provide for customs arrangements that accommodate North-South co-operation without creating a regulatory border in the Irish Sea.\"Sir Jeffreys remarks were yesterday being interpreted as a softening of the DUPs hardline position on Brexit, with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar also saying that \"UK-wide solutions are possible\" to end the Brexit crisis.It is understood that Mr Varadkar and his deputy Simon Coveney are planning to meet the DUP later this week to discuss Brexit in the wake of the devastating issues.Sir Jeffrey put forward his free trade agreement proposals on social media at the weekend, saying: \"Any solution must respect the integrity of both the United Kingdom and EU - but also the progress made in developing relationships on these islands.\"This is above all about future relationships and we need to show the political maturity that the challenge demands of us - all of us.\"However, it was not immediately clear how the Irish Governments commitment to the backstop could be accommodated as part of a free trade agreement between the UK and the EU.Dublins determination to hold on to the border backstop has won it praise at home, but has been criticised by some in the UK as inflexible.Resistance to the backstop from Conservatives and their DUP allies was a major contributor to the defeat of Mrs Mays withdrawal agreement.Fears are now growing that Dublins intransigence over the backstop makes a no-deal Brexit more likely.Trade Minister Liam Fox said yesterday that one way to break the deadlock could be an agreement with the Irish Government on an \"alternative mechanism\" to the backstop.\"Im not asking them to change their position,\" he said.\"We actually agree that no matter what, there should be an agreement that ensures that theres no hard border between the United Kingdom and Ireland.\"The question is, can we achieve what the Irish government wants and what we want by a dferent mechanism \"He said that could ease concerns about the current backstop proposal, which would keep Northern Ireland in an EU customs union unless and until an alternative arrangement is agreed.However, his idea was instantly shot down by Irish government sources, who said anybody talking about side deals needed to go back and study \"the basics\" of how the negotiations work.\"Ireland is part of the EU which negotiates as a block,\" a source said. \"There are no bilateral deals.\"And yesterday Dublin reiterated its commitment to the backstop.Mr Coveney tweeted: \"For the record, the Taoiseach and I have always been on the same page on Brexit, and we remain united and focused on protecting Ireland.\"That includes continued support for the EU UK agreed WAin full, including the backstop as negotiated.\"As Brexit dominates news coverage, no surprise that some analysis today gets it wrong.\"I can reassure you the Irish Governments commitment to the entire Withdrawal Agreement is absolute - including the backstop to ensure, no matter what, an open border between Ireland, Northern Ireland and the Good Friday Agreement are protected.\"What could happen after the Prime Minister presents her proposals for a revised deal to ParliamentTheresa May resigns:While the PM has said she will not lead the Tories into another general election, she has consistently ruled out quitting before Brexit.Plan B is activated:The Prime Minister has yet to reveal what her fallback position is. Under the terms of an amendment tabled by Dominic Grieve and controversially passed by MPs, today is her deadline to present a new plan to MPs.While the details of this Plan B are not clear, the chairman of the Eurosceptic European Research Group Jacob Rees-Mogg wrote in the Mail on Sunday that it was possible for Mrs May to get a deal through the Commonsshe persuaded the EU to show flexibility on the backstop and £bn orce bill.“If I had to choose between a no-deal and Mrs May’s original accord, I would have no hesitation of opting for no-deal Brexit, but even Mrs May’s deal would be better than not leaving at all,” he wrote.It’s good to talk:Mrs May has offered to talk to Opposition parties and groups with dferent desires and views to find consensus in Parliament. But her refusal to abandon no-deal Brexit and other leaders’ refusal to speak properly until she does, suggests one party will need to cede some ground.Also writing in the Mail on Sunday, chief Brexit representative for the European Parliament Guy Verhofstadt said: “If necessary, this document could still be enhanced in the next coming weeks.“British politicians will always find an open door to do that, but they must act soon.“This will only happenpolitical parties in the UK start to work together.“Such a cross-party approach is not natural to the adversarial UK political system, but it’s time to change course and to put the national interest ahead of narrow party political interests.”Confidence vote .:The Opposition can in theory call as many of these votes as they like, although the Lib Dems have said they will not support another as they believe it is a waste of time.Such a vote could trigger a general election but this is very much the nuclear option for Tory rebels and the DUP has already said it will not vote with Labour, so it appears to be unlikely.Back to Brussels for more talks:The EU has said repeatedly that it will not reopen negotiations on the withdrawal agreement, and “assurances” on the Irish border backstop were dismissed by Brexiteers earlier this week. There is little time and no clear indication what more the EU can or wants to offer. France has stepped up its no-deal preparations.Asking for an extension of Article :Mrs May has previously insisted almost to the point of foot-stamping that Britain will leave the EU on March , and a U-turn here would enrage already puce Brexiteers.But writing in The Observer, Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said: “The PM has pushed us dangerously close to the exit door with perilously little left on the clock.“So it’s vital that immediate steps be taken to extend Article .“Not to stop Brexit, but to ensure that there’s time to force a change of Government, or find a solution Parliament can back.”Halting of Article :A court case last year ruled that, while all  other EU states have to agree to extend the Article  process of leaving, the UK can unilaterally reverse it.Neither the Tories nor Labour support a halt, but Philip Hammond reportedly told business leaders in a conference call on Wednesday that a bill being rustled up by backbenchers would have this as its aim.A second referendum:Labour members at conference left the door open to supporting a new vote on leavingthe party could not trigger a general election. Mr Corbyn was applauded by Labour activists when he pointed this out in a speech on Thursday. But he also indicated he would rather leave with a Labour-flavoured withdrawal agreement.Former Attorney General Dominic Grievewrote in the Sunday Times: “I have made no secret of my support for the People’s Vote campaign, but it is important to recognise that this idea may well gain support only at the end of a process when every possible Brexit option has been explored.“I do not doubt that legislating for a new referendum is a dficult decision and the last resort for many MPs. “No-deal Brexit:If Theresa May loses and Parliament cannot come together behind an alternative, the UK will leave the European Union on March  without a deal.This is something to either be afraid of, or not afraid of, depending on your view of Brexit."},{"url":null,"title":"sdlp mla clarifies brits social media post after londonderry bombing","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

She is required to update MPs on her “Plan B” in the Commons on Monday.However, reports suggest she intends to instead press on with attempts to win over her own MPs and the Democratic Unionist Party by assuaging objections to the Irish backstop – aka Plan A.Brexiteer sht \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Jacob Rees-Mogg said he would back Theresa May’s deal over no deal The PM met a group of Brexiteer former ministers on Thursday. Attendee John Whittingdale said it had been a “constructive meeting” and he was convinced an agreement that satisfies a majority of Tories and DUP remained possible.Meanwhile, Jacob Rees-Mogg, chairman of the European Research Group of Brexiteer MPs, has signalled that he may ultimately choose to support Mrs May’s deal.Writing in the Mail on Sunday, the leading Eurosceptic said that, in a choice between the Withdrawal Agreement and no Brexit, he would back her deal.DUP on side \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds and DUP Leader Arlene Foster met the Prime Minister DUP leader Arlene Foster and her deputy, Nigel Dodds, also visited Downing Street for talks last week.Mrs Foster said the issue of the Irish backstop needed to be dealt with “in a very clear way”. Mr Dodds said the details on how progress could be made were being discussed but that it was not “useful to give too much of a running comment on the details”.Labour attacks ‘appeasement’ strategy\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has urged Theresa May to take no deal off the table Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn refused to meet the PM unless she took “no deal” off the table. After she stood firm, he branded it a “empty and hugely expensive” threat that was wasting billions of pounds of public money.“It’s a pointless and damaging attempt to appease a faction in her own party when she now needs to reach out to overcome this crisis,” he said.Backbenchers in motionMrs May will table a “neutral motion” on Monday and backbenchers are expected to table a series of amendments.One seeks to give time for a Bill to suspend the Article  withdrawal processthere is no new deal with Brussels by the end of February. Another would allow a motion by a minority of  MPs – from at least five parties and including  Tories – to be debated as the first item of Commons business the next day.Brexiteer concerns over Commons ‘hijacking’ referendum\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  International Trade Secretary Liam Fox accused pro-Remain MPs of trying to ‘hijack’ the  referendum vote. The backbenchers’ manoeuvres could also explain a softening of opposition to Mrs May’s deal among Brexiteer MPs. On Sunday, leading Brexiteer Liam Fox, the International Trade Secretary, accused pro-Remain MPs of trying to “hijack” the  referendum vote. Downing Street said it is “extremely concerned” by the backbenchers’ moves.Another week to save her deal Despite suffering a historic defeat for her deal last Tuesday, Mrs May appears to be pushing ahead with efforts to win over enough MPs to get it through. That would mean placating the opposition of nearly  Tory MPs and the DUP. The Bill will be debated and voted on – along with any amendments tabled by MPs – on January .

That followed a rare Israeli daylight air raid near Damascus International Airport.The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Monday’s pre-dawn strikes lasted for nearly an hour and were the most intense Israeli attacks since May.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Eleven people were said to have been killed It said  people were killed in the strikes. The Russian military said four Syrian troops were among those killed in air strikes that targeted three dferent locations and damaged unspecied infrastructure at Damascus airport.Israeli military spokesman Lt Col Jonathan Conricus said the Iranian missile attack that prompted the strong Israeli response was “premeditated”. Iranian forces in Syria fired the mid-range surface-to-surface missile towards Israel from the Damascus area – a missile he said had been smuggled into Syria specically for that purpose. Lt Col Conricus declined to further identy the type of missile but said it had not been used in any of the internal fighting of the civil war and had “no business” being in Syria.In Iran, the chief of Iran’s air force, General Aziz Nassirzadeh, said his forces are “impatient and ready for a fight against the Zionist regime to wipe it off the Earth”, according to a news website affiliated with Iran’s state television, YJC.ir.Iranian officials have repeatedly threatened to annihilate Israel.Israel has only recently acknowledged carrying out hundreds of strikes against Iranian and Hezbollah targets in Syria in recent years.It previously typically offered only general warnings against allowing Iran to establish a military foothold in Syria and refrained from commenting directly for fear of triggering a reaction and being drawn into the deadly fighting.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The Israeli military said the missile strike which prompted the response was ‘premeditated’ Israeli political and military leaders have been far more verbose of late, and Monday’s announcement went a step further, reporting the strikes in real time and detailing the targets.Lt Col Conricus would not confirm whether the measures marked an official abandonment of the policy of ambiguity, merely saying that it was a “retaliatory strike against active aggression by Iran”.He said Israel had sent warnings to Syria ahead of the attack to refrain from attacking Israeli warplanes, but that Syria ignored those warnings and fired anti-aircraft missiles. He said Israel responded by destroying Syrian anti-aircraft batteries. The Russian military said that the Syrian air defences shot down more than  Israeli cruise missiles, a claim that was doubted in Israel.The military said the Mount Hermon ski site has been closed.Israel holds Syria responsible for allowing the Iranian forces to use Syrian territory as a base of operations against Israel.

One of those families was Rachael Mooney and Kevin Lynch, whose baby, Hope Isabella, who was born at  weeks weighing  grams - she had stopped growing at  weeks.They had picked the name Isabella but when she was born their families said \"we will just have to live in hope and keep up the hope for everyday she is living so Kevin looked at her and said, we are calling her Hope.\"Baby Hope is said to be \"doing well’\" and has just been transferred back to Altnagelvin Hospital. The Dublin-based charity offering a haven for families of sick children was founded by Ade Stack after she lost her son, Hugh. Sadly, Hugh lived for just eight months and for the majority of that time he was cared for in hospital. Through her own experience she noticed families sleeping in waiting rooms, cars or having to travel long distances every day.Ms Stack took it upon herself to establish Hugh’s House so that parents in the same situation would have a place for respite which also allows them to remain close to their child in its time of greatest need.Parents are allowed to stay at Hugh’s House free of charge, it is situated at Belvedere Pl, Mountjoy, in Dublin which is a short five-minute walk to Temple Street Children’s University Hospital.Whilst there, parents are also able to share their own experiences which helps build an important support network at what it a very distressing time.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“It’s a place where you’re loved, where you’re cared about, showing that the wider community does care that you’re going through this hard time,” Ms Stack explained.“We depend on the generosity of the people of Ireland, those who say, thank God I will never need that house. Hugh passed away in the August, we never got a cent off the HSE, but we knew the need was there so we actually opened the Spring after he died. The first Mother’s Day after Hugh died was spent hoovering the stairs.“We all expect to lose people in our lives but when you lose a child it’s really hard because it feels unnatural. But this feels really natural, it feels like we just made a little herd and the love of all the people who helped us in the house, all of the rooms have been adopted by families who lost a child, and I hope all of that love is present in the house, and people feel loved and cared for and wanted.”At the house volunteers cook meals for families and there is a play area for young children who may be visiting their sick siblings.Local Independent Councillor, Gary Donnelly, became aware of the charity recently in his role as a community representative. He has now encouraged the public to register to take part and support fundraising efforts tomorrow. “I became aware of Hugh’s House recently when I was looking for help for a local family and I am aware that a number of families from Derry have recently availed of the service. “Creggan Community Collective will be holding a fundraiser on behalf of Hugh’s House Dublin. We will be doing a sponsored Spin Cycle beginning at am on Friday th January. The cycle will cover the distance of  miles the distance from Derry to Dublin.

We could all learn so much from him.Cllr Walker said he hoped those who targeted Ryanrsquos cookie box would realise the error of their ways and stop again outside the young manrsquos home to pay for the food they took.ldquoWhat happened in the dead of night outside Ryanrsquos home is a sad reflection on those responsible. If they do not pay for the goods. I hope they can be identied so the authorities can have a word, he continued.Cllr Walker, who, along with his Rowallane counterpart Terry Andrews, organises several charity events each year, hopes that his  itinerary will allow him to raise some for Ryan which he can donate to a charity of his choice.He added: ldquoRyan is a shining example to us all. He works hard to help others and it is deeply upsetting that there are those in the community who would target of all things an honesty box.

The group of Independent councillors have held the balance of power on council and can swing the vote on issues vital to our community.Cllr Enright said there was a long tradition of Independent and environmentally-minded candidates winning one of the five seats in the Downpatrick and Lecale electoral area.He pointed to Independent hospital candidate, Raymond Blaney, who won a seat on the former Down Council almost  years ago, and the Green Partyrsquos Bill Corry winning a seat in .ldquoIn the  elections, Raymond nominated Bill and I acted as his election agent, while in the  and  elections, both Raymond and Bill supported my successful election campaigns, explained Cllr Enright.ldquoBoth ex-councillors will be active on my behalf for this Mayrsquos election and Bill is my election agent.Cllr Enright said at the  election to the new Newry, Mourne and Down Council, ldquoa remarkable coalition of activists from community organisations, the farming community and the environmental sector backed him to win the fourth of five seats, with an all time high of first preference votes for an independent candidate in the Downpatrick DEA.He believes the fact that he is one of the few local politicians who works full-time as a councillor has helped his support base in an area where he continues to work closely with community organisations in villages and in Downpatrick..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Family’s plea to change organ donation system  ","story":"THE family of a Downpatrick man who died before he could get a heart transplant hope that an opt-out organ donation system will be soon introduced to Northern Ireland.Tommy McManusrsquos sister has revealed that even in their grief, the family honoured his commitment to organ donation by giving the  year-oldrsquos corneas so that someone  may see one day.Roisin Taggart said that she believes a system where people choose to opt out of donating their organs in the event of the death will increase the number of organs available.The current situation in Northern Ireland, as opposed to Scotland and Wales, is that people who do not wish to donate their organs have to opt-out by registering their details. England is to introduce an opt-out system in .Mrs Taggart said: ldquoWe need to talk about the people who have lost their battle for an organ. We need to put faces to these tragedies and we all need to make sure our families know about our wishes.Mr McManus was buried last Thursday in his home town after he died from multiple organ failure at the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle Upon Tyne on December .Despite being put on a ldquosuper-urgent transplant list just days before Christmas, he succumbed to his illness as he waited for a suitable heart to become available.A successful mechanical engineer who travelled the world with his career, Mr McManus became seriously ill in .After six months of investigations, doctors diagnosed that Mr McManus had suffered cardiac arrest.A heart transplant was ruled out as he was too ill at the time, but doctors did all they could for him by fitting a mechanical pump in anticipation of a new heart.Despite being born with a congenital heart defect known as Transposition of the Great Arteries, the former De La Salle High School student had already defied the odds to live a normal le up until then.Raised in the Colmcille Road area of Downpatrick, Mr McManus ed home to be close to his father Tom mdash his mother Colette had passed away earlier mdash sisters Lisa and Roisin and their families.While he waited on the standard transplant list for three years, Mrs Taggart said that her brother bore his illness well.ldquoTommy was unable to work or travel and relied heavily on us for basic day to day things like shopping, cleaning, etc, she said.ldquoHis mobility was extremely limited through fear of over-exertion. Still, he did everything he could to aid his recovery.Tommy and his family were so thankful to the medical team at the Freeman Hospital for saving his le in  that they raised over pound, in order ldquoto pay back the care they had received.Mrs Taggart says that her family know that the doctors ldquodid absolutely everything in their power to keep Tommy alive and had promised that he would have had his heart transplant before Christmas.ldquoThere is a typical wait of between - days for a heart and we just donrsquot know why one didnrsquot become available. But it didnrsquot and his lungs and kidneys began to fail as a consequence of his heart failure, said Mrs Taggart.Despite the efforts of the ldquophenomenal medical team, Tommy required dialysis and ventilation to keep him alive.The medical team were unable to get him breathing on his own again and he was taken off the transplant list.ldquoWe had seen Tommy go through some much and come out of the other side that it never crossed our minds that he wouldnrsquot get a heart, said Mrs Taggart.She and her family now know from personal experience just how hard it is to make a decision to donate a loved onersquos organs.ldquoDue to Tommyrsquos condition, he was only eligible to donate his corneas, she explained.ldquoWhen we were approached about this, my fatherrsquos immediate reaction was, lsquoNo, hersquos been cut into enoughrsquo, despite the fact that Tommy campaigned so passionately about organ donation, and we all knew his wishes.ldquoThankfully myself and my sister were able to be Tommyrsquos voice, and he was able to give one final and very precious gt to someone.ldquoWe desperately hope that the subject of organ donation can be normalised, and that a change in legislation and attitude is seen very soon. We are just so sorry that this change will come too late for Tommy.Mrs Taggart paid a loving tribute to her only brother: ldquoTommy was a fiercely independent, successful and outgoing young man. He was extremely intelligent, loved technology and was a fountain of knowledge.ldquoNo matter where he travelled, he made friends instantly.Mr McManus is survived by his father, sisters, brothers-in-law Bryon and Kieran, nephews Daniel, Paul and Matthew, nieces Emma and Erin, great-nephews Jay and Donal and great-nieces Chloe and Freya.bull To join the NHS organ donation register, go to www.organdonation.nhs.uk.register-your-details.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Finnebrogue to create 90 new jobs with new food ranges  ","story":"THE success of innovative Downpatrick firm Finnebrogue Artisan is set to continue with the opening of a new ultra-modern poundm vegan and vegetarian factory.The latest signicant investment by the award winning company mdash which is one of the districtrsquos leading employers mdash will support  new jobs with the new facility capable of turning over poundm a year.The latest investment by the company is in response to increasing demand for vegetarian and vegan alternatives, with the ersication illustrating the firmrsquos willingness to respond to changing trends across the food industry.The artisan food producer, which has revolutionised the bacon and ham market in the past  months by launching the first mass-produced nitrite-free alternatives, has invested poundm as it looks to step up its meat-free offerings.Finnebrogue has been producing vegetarian and vegan products for three years, but the opening of a brand new factory marks a signicant up-scaling of the firmrsquos meat-free production.The companyrsquos managing director, Brian McMonagle, said Finnebrogue prided itself on providing consumers with ldquodelicious, innovative products.ldquoGiven the increasing demand for vegan and vegetarian alternatives, this new factory was the obvious next step in our extraordinary growth, he continued.ldquoWe are determined not to stand still and are always looking to make food the best it can possibly be, without being bound by the way itrsquos always been done.

An engineer explained that a conductor on a transformer, which had probably been smouldering due to a layer of snow or ice, caught fire.Carryduff, the highest point between Belfast and the Mourne mountains, had falls of up to six inches and drts were reported as deep as one and two feet in some areas.Ballynahinch had several inches fall inside an hour and this worsened as snow continued to fall. Dromara got it bad yet again and Comber reported several inches.The Department of the Environmentrsquos snow ploughs were in use at Carryduff, Ballynahinch and Dromara, and gritting machines were needed on many local roads.In Downpatrick and coastal districts there was sleet and heavy rain mdash and roads were made treacherous when this turned to ice yesterday morning. There was a spate of minor accidents as cars slithered through the snow and ice.Roads are being gritted by the DOE, but owing to decreasing fuel and salt they have only been treating priority roads.CROSSGAR mdash Crossgar is taking part in an appeal organised by the BBC programme Blue Peter, which will help provide bicycles for villages in Africa.The campaign, which involves the collection of stamps on Christmas card envelopes, is already well underway and these will be sold to buy bicycles which will help with transporting medical aid in remote African villages.Anyone in the Crossgar area who wants to help with appeal can leave their contributions at the Post Office.DOWNPATRICK mdash Representatives of Downpatrick organisations are asked to turn their backs on the wintry weather and go to the townrsquos library for a public meeting to consider plans for a major Maytime festival.A steering committee, which was born out of ideas kicked around by Down Councilrsquos arts committee more than a year ago, will present good thinking on how a wholehearted three-day festival of family fun will put the town in holiday form as never before.The centrepiece of the holiday weekend will be a pageant with a Patrician theme and possibly a medieval type flavour. Jousting is a distinct possibility and so are a number of other unusual dimensions.Although it will be called St Patrickrsquos Festival, the steering committee believe that a Maytime date would be better favoured by the weather than one on March  and would allow them to provide a much wider range of outdoor and indoor attractions.KILLYLEAGH mdash A Stormont Minister is to be asked to prevent the extension of a caravan park near Killyleagh.The unprecedented step is being taken by Down Council in protest against a recommendation made by planners to allow the development at East Down Yacht Club. The council are unhappy about the reasons given by the planners to allow the development to proceed.NEWCASTLE mdash The International Nile Canoe Expedition mdash which includes  year-old Newcastle man Marcus Baillie mdash is making signicant progress and more than a third of the death-defying trip has been completed.Two signicant firsts have been achieved by the eight-man expedition team which has already reached Khartoum in its bid to complete the longest continuous navigation of the mighty African river.Marcus, a former Down High School pupil, is hoping to complete the harrowing journey within the next three months.No-one has ever canoed over such a long stretch of the Nile and Marcus, who now lives in Liverpool, admitted before he left that the trip would not be easy.Despite many warnings from locals, few crocodiles were seen and the herds of hippopotamus provide much less troublesome than the mosquitos.The team are now battling slowly northwards against a strong head wind towards the famous cataracts and Egyptrsquos Aswan.CASTLEWELLAN mdash A burst water main in the Castlewellan area brought about a dry Christmas for scores of local families.There were also fears the sudden drought could spread to Dromore and Banbridge when the water mains burst between Tullymurray and Mayobridge. Because of the work to rule action by watermen, it meant the problem was not dealt with for several days.As a result families living near Tullymurray were without water since Christmas Day.PORTAFERRY mdash Stage two of a new sewerage scheme for Portaferry is expected to get underway in May and should take four months to complete.The Department of the Environmentrsquos Eastern Division Water Service has announced that the second of three contracts is now being advertised and work will involve the construction of a pumping station. The scheme is designed to improve the existing sewerage system in Portaferry.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Ballynahinch Camera Club will hold its first meeting of the new year tomorrow night and has appealed for anyone interested in photography to come along to the townrsquos library where the special speaker will be Stanley Matchett, of the Daily Mirror.The aim of the club is to help amateur photographers to develop their hobby by way of of talks, slide and film shows and processing demonstrations. There will be monthly and seasonal competitions, as well as trips.CARRYDUFF mdash Carryduff residents are to meet soon with Castlereagh Borough Council members to discuss facilities in the Carryduff area.

That is absolutely true of the Downe. First class facilities are nothing without first class staff and at the Downe we are very lucky to have both, she said.Mrs Hanlon remarked: ldquoHospital staff are clearly eager to embrace the challenge of expanding services and I have no doubt that in the years to come the Downersquos reputation as a first class facility with passionate, professional staff will see services grow and develop further..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Head blasts at ‘disparity’ over student allocations  ","story":"A GRAMMAR school principal has hit out at education chiefs for not equally planning for an expected increase for post-primary students.Peter Dobbin, principal of Assumption Grammar School in Ballynahinch, says that the Department of Educationhas addressed the need for additional students in Belfast, Bangor and Londonderry by awarding some schools additional places, but has failed to address the local need for  .He has accused DENI of treating some areas in Northern Ireland dferently to others and has urged the Department to address the local problem sooner rather than later.ldquoWe know that this is a major issue waiting to happen, said Mr Dobbin.ldquoStatistics clearly show that there is a signicant number of extra girls to be accommodated across our vast catchment area and I will be left with very angry parents and pupils who are extremely unhappy with not being allocated Assumption Grammar as their preferred choice.ldquoThis would be understandableall schools in all areas were being treated the same, but this is not the case.ldquoHow can some areas be addressed proactively and then other areas neglected  This disparity and the disrespect towards the parents and children in our local area, compared to other areas, is appalling.Statistics from the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency show that an increase of an average of  children in this age group in the Down district annually over the next ten years.However, last night a DENI spokesperson said that it had reviewed the anticipated shortfall and that no additional places for next year were needed in Ballynahinch.ldquoAt the end of the admissions procedure in ,  places remained available in Ballynahinch,  of which were in the denominational sector.

At around .pm, the bomb detonated.“Fortunately it didn’t kill anybody and fortunately it didn’t cause widespread damage, but clearly it was a very signicant attempt to kill people in the local community.”He added they got everyone evacuated “just in time”.“The bomb detonated just as we were leaving the area and it is only by good grace that local people were not killed,” he said.Those evacuated from nearby buildings included hundreds of hotel guests,  people from the Masonic Hall and a large number of children from a church youth club.The attack has been condemned by politicians across the Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.Mr Hamilton said the attack was “unbelievably reckless”.“Thankfully the attackers failed to kill or injure any members the local community out socialising and enjoying the best of what the city has to offer,” he said.“The people responsible for this attack have shown no regard for the community or local businesses.“They care little about the damage to the area and the disruption they have caused.”Secretary of State Karen Bradley said those responsible would not be permitted to disrupt progress in Northern Ireland.“The small number of people responsible have absolutely nothing to offer Northern Ireland’s future and will not prevail,” she said.“Our voices across the political spectrum are united.“This is intolerable violence and we want to look forward and build a peaceful future for all in Northern Ireland.“Thank you to the PSNI and emergency services who are working so hard to keep people safe and secure.”Ireland’s Premier Leo Varadkar described it as “an appalling, reckless and cynical act of terror”.The Bishop of Derry and Raphoe Ken Good said the attack was an “act of utter recklessness which showed a callous disregard for the lives and safety of local citizens and visitors alike”.“It defies belief that anyone would place a bomb on a city centre street, early on a Saturday evening, so close to people’s homes, churches, a hotel, sheltered accommodation, nearby pubs and a large car park.“St Columb’s Cathedral and St Augustine’s Church, where a group of young people had been meeting yesterday evening, have both had to cancel their Sunday morning services while the police carry out a follow-up security operation,” he said.“I am extremely thankful that no one was injured, or worse, as a result of last night’s explosion.“The attack was wrong. It is indefensible. It should never be repeated.“The time has long since passed when such violence should have been consigned to history.”The mayor of Derry John Boyle challenged those responsible to explain themselves.“I would actually like to ask the people responsible for this what it actually was that they thought they were going to achieve.“It achieves nothing, it didn’t achieve anything in the past, it didn’t achieve anything right now,” the SDLP mayor said.“This is the past and it has to stay in the past. We don’t want to see any more of it.”Alternative arrangements have been put in place for cases that had been due to be heard at the Courthouse in Bishop Street.Crown Court trials with juries have been adjourned until Tuesday while all other Crown Court business, non-trial and jury business, will be dealt with at Coleraine Courthouse on Monday.Magistrates’ court business will be dealt with at Strabane Court No , and County Court equity business will be dealt with at Strabane Court No  on Monday.try catch  TrendingN.I. man dies after he is electrocuted while fitting new lightN.I. issued with severe weather warning - ice and wintry showers due in next  hoursN.I. snow could arrive sooner than originally thought - Arctic blast could strike this weekendThis photograph from an N.I. railway station has sent Twitter into meltdownN.I. snow to arrive tonight and tomorrow - subzero temperatures to reach as low as -degC          ..

Photo credit: House of Commons PA WireShe will also table a “neutral” motion to be debated and voted on - along with any amendments tabled by MPs - on January . Neutral motions are usually unamendable, but in this instance MPs will be able to express an alternative to the Government’s plan.Government sources said she would be holding further talks with MPs, as well as business leaders and trade unionists, throughout the week in an attempt to find a way forward.But after she briefed the Cabinet in a conference call on Sunday about her first round of cross-party contacts last week, there was little expectation she was ready to offer concessions that could win over opposition MPs.Instead reports suggested she was preparing to press for changes to the Northern Ireland backstop in the hope she can win round Tory Brexiteers and her allies in the DUP who voted against her original deal.The Dailyreported she was even considering trying to amend the Good Friday Agreement - although the paper quoted senior sources as saying the idea was a “non-starter”.Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney was adamant over the weekend the backstop - intended to ensure there is no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic - was an essential part of the Withdrawal Agreement.However there were signs some Brexiteers could reluctantly back Mrs May’s deal amid concerns a cross-party grouping of MPs are plotting to impose a “softer” Brexit - or derail it altogether.Writing in The Mail on Sunday, leading Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg said: “Even Mrs May’s deal would be better than not leaving at all.”There was anger among pro-Leave MPs at moves to enable backbenchers to take control of the Commons business from the Government - in breach of normal conventions - through a series of amendments to the neutral motion.One group including senior Labour MP Yvette Cooper and Tory former minister Nick Boles is seeking to give time for a bill to suspend the Article  withdrawal processthere is no new deal with Brussels by the end of February.Ms Cooper told BBC Radio ’s Today programme that she believed the Prime Minister was hoping Parliament would rule out no deal on her behalf.Four questioned over Londnderry car bombShooting victim fighting for le Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"She said: “I think sheknows that she should rule out no deal in the national interest because it would be so damaging. She’s refusing to do so and I think she’s hoping that Parliament will do this for her - that is not leadership.”It came as Business Minister Richard Harrington warned that crashing out of the EU without a deal would be an “absolute disaster” as he urged Mrs May to rule out a no-deal Brexit.“I’ve seen what may well happen with this cut-off date. Crashing out, in my view ... is an absolute disaster - it’s not a road to a free trade agreement, it’s not a road to anything. It’s an absolute disaster for the country and it’s supported by a minority of a minority of people,” he told Today.“Sheshould, in my view, say ‘We are responsible people, we’re going to do our duty to business, and we’re going to rule out a no deal because we want a great deal’.”Another more radical amendment drawn up by former attorney general Dominic Grieve would allow a motion by a minority of  MPs - from at least five parties and including  Tories - to be debated as the first item of Commons business the next day.Mr Grieve said it would enable the Commons to stage a series of “indicative votes” on the ious alternatives, such as a “soft” Norway-style deal or a second referendum to establish which could command a majority.He denied claims he was seeking to prevent Britain leaving the EU after International Trade Secretary Liam Fox accused pro-Remain MPs of trying to “hijack” the  referendum vote.Meanwhile, Sir Stephen Laws, a senior research fellow at the Policy Exchange and a former government law chief, said MPs seeking to delay or stop Brexit could risk involving the Queen.Mrs May is expected to use her statement to explain how she intends to proceed in the run up to the vote on January , rather than setting out a detailed “plan B”.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn hit out at the Prime Minister for stymieing attempts to find a cross-party consensus through her refusal to rule out a no-deal Brexit.“May’s no-deal threat is empty and hugely expensive, wasting billions of pounds we should be spending on vital public services,” he said.“It’s a pointless and damaging attempt to appease a faction in her own party when she now needs to reach out to overcome this crisis.“If the Prime Minister is serious about finding a solution that can command support in Parliament and bring our country together, she must listen to the majority of MPs, as well as members of her own cabinet, and take no-deal off the table.”The SNP’s Westminster leader Ian Blackford MP said: “Rather than listening to other options the Prime Minister is instead closing them down, intent on cutting off any alternatives and leaving a  choice between her defeated dead deal and a disastrous no-deal.”“It would be the height of irresponsibility and economic self-harmTheresa May does not categorically rule out a no-deal Brexit today. Her attempt to run down the clock must be stopped.”try catch  TrendingN.I. man dies after he is electrocuted while fitting new lightN.I. issued with severe weather warning - ice and wintry showers due in next  hoursN.I. snow could arrive sooner than originally thought - Arctic blast could strike this weekendThis photograph from an N.I. railway station has sent Twitter into meltdownN.I. snow to arrive tonight and tomorrow - subzero temperatures to reach as low as -degC          ..

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I canrsquot see that there is any way the council can fix this, there just isnrsquot the infrastructure.ldquoItrsquos obvious that it is not going to work, it would be a waste of money to even try it.But another Plassey Street resident, Bat Goddard, said: ldquoTo spend pound, on an experiment, which in  months they could reject, is ludicrous.ldquoWe have the widest street in Penarth here but they want to turn it in to a one-way system.ldquoWe need to stop this folly now.Vale council member Geoff Cox, who is the cabinet member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, has since said a report will be put forward that retains the roundabout and instead looks at enhancing other ideas to solve crossing issues and traffic problems.Cllr Coxsaid: ldquoAs the Cabinet meeting date approached, I became more aware of the strength of local feeling associated with the highway option being proposed, hence my decision to defer the report meaning it was not even considered by Cabinet on January .ldquoI have since reviewed the ious options further, which has included my meeting with local ward members to obtain their detailed views on all options. I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That includes continued support for the EU UK agreed WA in full, including the Backstop as negotiated. @RTENewsNow https:t.co ljmSBtvuNzmdash Simon CoveneyJanuary , However there were signs some Brexiteers could reluctantly back Mrs Mayrsquos deal amid concerns a cross-party grouping of MPs are plotting to impose a ldquosofter Brexit ndash or derail it altogether.Writing in The Mail on Sunday, leading Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg said: ldquoEven Mrs Mayrsquos deal would be better than not leaving at all.There was anger among pro-Leave MPs at moves to enable backbenchers to take control of the Commons business from the Government ndash in breach of normal conventions ndash through a series of amendments to the neutral motion.One group including senior Labour MP Yvette Cooper and Tory former ministerNick Boles is seeking to give time for a bill to suspend the Article  withdrawal processthere is no new deal with Brussels by the end of February.Ms Cooper told BBC Radio rsquos Today programme that she believed the Prime Minister was hoping Parliament would rule out no deal on her behalf.She said: ldquoI think sheknows that she should rule out no deal in the national interest because it would be so damaging. Shersquos refusing to do so and I think shersquos hoping that Parliament will do this for her ndash that is not leadership.Business Minister Richard Harrington warned that crashing out of the EU without a deal would be an lsquoabsolute disasterrsquo It came as Business Minister Richard Harrington warned that crashing out of the EU without a deal would be an ldquoabsolute disaster as he urged Mrs May to rule out a no-deal Brexit.ldquoIrsquove seen what may well happen with this cut-off date. Crashing out, in my view hellip is an absolute disaster ndash itrsquos not a road to a free trade agreement, itrsquos not a road to anything. Itrsquos an absolute disaster for the country and itrsquos supported by a minority of a minority of people, he told Today.ldquoSheshould, in my view, say lsquoWe are responsible people, wersquore going to do our duty to business, and wersquore going to rule out a no deal because we want a great dealrsquo.Another more radical amendment drawn up by former attorney general Dominic Grieve would allow a motion by a minority of  MPs ndash from at least five parties and including  Tories ndash to be debated as the first item of Commons business the next day.Mr Grieve said it would enable the Commons to stage a series of ldquoindicative votes on the ious alternatives, such as a ldquosoft Norway-style deal or a second referendum to establish which could command a majority.He denied claims he was seeking to prevent Britain leaving the EU after International Trade Secretary Liam Fox accused pro-Remain MPs of trying to ldquohijack the  referendum vote.Meanwhile, Sir Stephen Laws, a senior research fellow at the Policy Exchange and a former government law chief, said MPs seeking to delay or stop Brexit could risk involving the Queen.Mrs May is expected to use her statement to explain how she intends to proceed in the run up to the vote on January , rather than setting out a detailed ldquoplan B.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn hit out at the Prime Minister for stymieing attempts to find a cross-party consensus through her refusal to rule out a no-deal Brexit.ldquoMayrsquos no-deal threat is empty and hugely expensive, wasting billions of pounds we should be spending on vital public services, he said.ldquoItrsquos a pointless and damaging attempt to appease a faction in her own party when she now needs to reach out to overcome this crisis.ldquoIf the Prime Minister is serious about finding a solution that can command support in Parliament and bring our country together, she must listen to the majority of MPs, as well as members of her own cabinet, and take no-deal off the table.This is a fantasy, it is not going to work just as the announcement of cross party talks was doomed due to the PMs red lines. The PM is still in denial after the scale of the defeat last week, after whichthe PM had any dignity she would have resigned. This is a crisis. https:t.co FPgXDiZxmdash Ian BlackfordJanuary , The SNPrsquos Westminster leader Ian Blackford MP said: ldquoRather than listening to other options the Prime Minister is instead closing them down, intent on cutting off any alternatives and leaving a  choice between her defeated dead deal and a disastrous no-deal.ldquoIt would be the height of irresponsibility and economic self-harmTheresa May does not categorically rule out a no-deal Brexit today.

Ulster Business takes a further look A few years back, the options were fairly limited for NI firms when it came to venture capital funding.Now, between private funds, investors and those backed by Invest NI, the options have widened signicantly for companies – especially those which are high-growth – to seek a cash injection, and get to the next level.Jayne Brady is partner at the Bank of Ireland Kernel Capital Growth Fund NI.“We have been operating in Northern Ireland for five years, and in that period we have seen a growing momentum in the Northern Ireland ecosystem,” she told Ulster Business.“We have  companies in our portfolio, and have invested in eight companies in Northern Ireland as part of that.”And a lot has changed in the last few years, particularly with the sheer number of avenues in which businesses can find access to funding.“There wasn’t an availability of local funds, and it was dficult to get that level from GB, because you needed to reach a certain level.”And where is the investment now going in Northern Ireland  “It’s very strong sectors of expertise, and there is a big FDI element – medical technology, cyber-security. It’s not created in isolation, andan availability of skills.”“More recently, there has been more external investors. We would co-invest, and there is a level of investment from outside players – there are good opportunities.”Jayne says that Kernel Capital tracks investments, and the level and size of deals here has grown. A lot of that has been down to the growth of the Knowledge Economy – which has expanded seven or eight-fold in the last few years.For businesses looking towards funds like Kernel, a typical deal size is from around £m up to £m.One of the largest investments was secured by B-Secur, which has created a biometric technology which uses the human heartbeat to unlock everything from finance and healthcare through to cars and buildings.The company, based at Catalyst Inc, secured £.m from investors including Kernel Capital and ADV.For Jayne, Kernel is looking at companies with turnover of more than £m, which have the ability and scope to be scaled.“We see investment where there is a scaling potential. We look at companies where we are generating £m plus –– which you can scale rapidly, or those with a deep IPfocus. Some companies in services won’t have that level of scale.”Then, there’s the Growth Finance Fund, and Growth Loan Fund II, which provide a total of £m of funding for Northern Ireland’s SMEs.The two new funds are being managed by WhiteRock Capital Partners, a homegrown fund manager set up in  to manage the first Growth Loan Fund, which has committed £m of loans to more than  businesses over the last six years.There’s also the Growth Finance Fund. That will see loans from £, up to £m going to growing businesses. It’s also the first time the British Business Bank has invested in a fund aimed solely at supporting Northern Ireland businesses. The latest figures from the Irish Venture Capital Association, which covers businesses across the island, show venture capital funding has slumped, with a fall-off in major deals and seed funding.Investment was down by almost a third to €min the first nine months of the , confirming a signicant slowdown on .The drop-off in cash accelerated during the year, with the amount raised by tech firms and startups in the last three months just half what it was a year earlier.The figures suggested that the largest segment of funding to see a decline is in deals was above €m .But a Northern Ireland report by Catalyst Inc, published last year, showed companies raised over £m in equity capital in .Elsewhere, flying the flag for venture capital in Northern Ireland for more than  years is Crescent Capital.Run by Colin Walsh, former CBI chairman in Northern Ireland, it’s invested in a raft of the most successful and leading companies here.That includes Andor Technology and Belfast-based biotech firm Fusion Antibodies, which is based at Springbank Industrial Estate in the west of the city.According to Jayne, it’s not just about backing Belfast firms, or FDIs setting up shop in the heart of the city.“We look towards the strong sectoral focuses, and outside Belfast as well. We are very conscious to go to our customers.” That includes holding regular open events across areas such as Newry, Co Tyrone and Londonderry. “We are very open to meeting any companies, and our door is open,” she says.But will Brexit play a part in the future of venture capital funding in Northern Ireland  “We need to be cognisant of any particular indication of any change in regulation,” Jayne says.“From our perspective, because we invest in deep tech, they are somewhat removed from that direct impact.” Elsewhere, there are other revenue streams which firms can look towards, especially when it comes to working capital.That includes Upstream – an alternative finance company run by Judith Totten, which specialises in funding for SMEs.“As Northern Ireland’s largest independently owned and managed provider of working capital, Upstream works collaboratively with organisations’ existing lenders to provide additional capital in a more flexible way to help businesses thrive,” sales director Alan Wardlow says.“Businesses come to us for our responsiveness – our formal credit approvals are achieved in days rather than weeks or months. Upstream has long standing relationships with many local venture capitaland private equity providers as well as the ious Invest NI-backed loan funds and we work closely together to provide solutions for business owners across Northern Ireland“We recently incorporated a trade finance solution into our product range to bridge the gap for organisations who require additional growth funding, quickly, to deliver orders beyond their current capability. This funding is proving incredibly popular alongside our long-standing invoice finance option which gives organisations the ability to release funds against their debtor book thereby freeing up cash flow for businesses to seize growth opportunities as they become available.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/steve_web.jpg","title":"the catalyst to putting northern ireland on the global map","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by Ulster Business Ulster Business speaks to Catalyst Inc chief executive Steve Orr about his hugely ambitious plans for growth, expansion and moulding NI into a world-leader in tech ‘We aren’t going to follow anyone , and we need toto becoming leaders in the world.’It’s immediately clear that Steve Orr has big ambitions for Catalyst Inc. He’s just taken over at the helm of the internationally renowned next generation science park which is home to  innovative knowledge based companies, who are employing more than , engineers, researchers, entrepreneurs and executives, across four locations – and has his sights firmly set on making Northern Ireland a leader in two key innovative areas of tech business.Taking on the role as chief executive of Catalyst from stalwart Professor Norman Apsley OBE, just two months ago, plans are under way to build on the foundations of an organisation which has an estate of , sq ft of agile workspace filled with innovative companies. Catalyst leads the way in innovation and entrepreneurship by supporting the creation and growth of innovation companies in Northern Ireland.“We have a rightful place in leading the world. We aren’t going to follow anybody. Let’s get back to leading the world,” Steve tells Ulster Business.“I am going to take the foundation that Norman left and look at how we leverage that by a signicant factor – in terms of economic activity and dynamism for Northern Ireland.“We need deeper, more strategic partnerships with key institutions. It is through collaboration we can do something to scale and put Northern Ireland on a world map.”Catalyst is the thriving, beating heart of Northern Ireland’s booming technology sector and leading the way in educating and preparing companies and young people for the changing world of work through the impact of the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is seeing the impact of new technologies impacting on le, work and society.Formerly known as the Northern Ireland Science Park, Catalyst is an independent not-for-profit organisation operating across the region. It provides agile workspace across four locations – the main site in Belfast’s Titanic Quarter, the Innovation centres in Londonderry, and Ballymena and most recently opened Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, a co-working space dedicated to the fintech sector in Belfast city centre, which is a partnership with Danske Bank.“The business model we have had for the first  years was the perfect model for that period. We need a new model for the next. We are identying a simple, but ambitious strategy – building on the existing foundation.”Part of the strength of Catalyst is in attracting big international firms, such as Citi, in close proximity to businesses at the very birth of existence. Steve says as a result, “accidental encounters” lead to relationships and outcomes which otherwise, would not have happened.It also plays host to Queen’s University’s leading research body, ECITwhich itself is home to CSIT .Some of the leading thinkers based at the site include ECIT’s Professor Maire O’Neill – one of the youngest ever engineering professors at Queen’s, one-time UK Female Inventor of the Year and a leading researcher. “You have US companies looking at why would they want to move to Northern Ireland – they want to meet Professor O’Neill. She’s amazing,” Steve says.“Then there are cyber companies, like B-Secur. The firm specialises in technology which can read your ECG heartbeat as a unique biometric identy verication.“There are other indigenous companies, like Titan IC in cyber-security, Displaynote and ProAxsis. We have great companies that are now making a dent in the world.”And pushing forward with what his predecessor Norman Apsley built, plans are under way to expand and redevelop Catalyst further still.That includes another new building, Pierpont  – which will provide another , sq ft of space – and a revamp and refurbishment of Catalyst’s Innovation Centre, as part of an addition £m investment.“We want to make this the best place to work – improving the environment, the flow around the campus, the accessibility, and the experience, so that you love being here.“We want to refresh some of the buildings on the site. The Innovation Centre will be modernised by March and we will freshen-up our identity.”His big goal is to lead the way in two areas of technology and business at Catalyst – putting Northern Ireland front and centre.“We want to help to incubate two clusters where Northern Ireland leads the world.“How do we build on what ECIT is doing  We take the start-up capability, and ecosystem we have in Northern Ireland and leverage that further.“We want to make it easier for corporations to set up in Belfast and Northern Ireland in order to access amazing research talent. They want to define what the next big breakthrough is.“We can develop something for global companies that they can’t find where in the world. We want to create clusters, that will act as a magnet to attract hundreds of companies.”One of the unique elements of Catalyst is Connect – a network of experienced entrepreneurs, business professionals, top research talent and potential investors who provide their time and experience pro bono to help foster and develop the next generation of entrepreneurs.“It’s helping entrepreneurs to figure out how to build a company around their product idea and providing the support to validate and access the marketplace, capital, investment and or talent,” Steve says.“With the Connect network, we had  early stage companies or entrepreneurs engaged in our programmes last year. There is a lot of exciting and vibrant activity going on at the moment.”And it was Connect, which Steve founded and developed at Catalyst, which first drew him back home to his native Northern Ireland, following years of running and founding tech firms in the West Coast of the US.“I was an entrepreneur in Calornia for a number of years, in San Francisco and San Diego. I was there for the peak of the dot coms,” he said.That included his own start-up business, Kineticom, as well as other tech companies. It was his time in San Diego which resonated strongly with Steve.“Personally, I became obsessed with the San Diego story and the parallels to Northern Ireland. When they started on their journey in , San Diego had a population of . million people, % of their economy was dependent on the public sector. They have an ocean to one side, a mountain range around them and another country to the bottom of them.”San Diego went from the bottom of every league table to the top – with the collaboration of top universities, research and development and entrepreneurship, building the city into the tech stalwart it is now.The Connect  emanated from San Diego – a concept which help shaped the programme in Northern Ireland.“Meeting Norman Apsley at the Science Park was just the most beautul thing ever,” Steve says.The financial and economic impact and contribution that Catalyst has is hard to ignore. It’s estimated the businesses which operate there contribute around £m in GVA each year.“Everything we do is based on the simple belief that innovation has the power to transform our economy. People around the world are all innovating quickly, adapting new technologies, articial intelligence, for example. In Northern Ireland,people are producing goods and services, but are behind in adopting those new technologies, our economy is going to be in trouble as we will not be competitive.“The question is, how does innovation become the foundation on which everything is based ”And as a result of Catalyst’s research into the NI Knowledge Economy, an annual report published later this month, which acknowledges the huge changes to the workplace in the coming year, Catalyst is hosting their second Future of Work summit in May  – aimed at demystying how roles and traditional jobs are changing, right across the Knowledge Economy sectors.Of course, Brexit is still on the horizon. For Steve, the main concern is around the availability of talent. “The tech sector is hungry for talent, but with the uncertainty in the last couple of years, fewer people have been willing to consider moving to Northern Ireland. That places a lot of pressure on the existing employees in the sector.”“Long-term, we have to be optimistic and look at the opportunities which can come out of Brexit. The businesses within the Knowledge Economy are export driven, representing over % of all NI exports. With % of these exports outside the EU, the Knowledge Economy is the sector least dependent on Europe and should be the key for driving growth at this time of uncertainty.”So, for Steve, his level of optimism and dynamism is clear in his new role, one which he says he is “very fortunate” to have.“It’s a position which comes around so rarely, and whoever gets the opportunity is so blessed and fortunate to have the opportunity to lead. We have a talented team of people who are all passionate about what is possible. It’s so exciting. The opportunities and possibilities are endless.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/323433.jpg","title":"theresa mays brexit deal voted down business reaction","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by John Mulgrew Business groups have overwhelmingly raised concerns over crashing out of the EU without a deal after Prime Minister Theresa May’s withdrawal plan with Brussels was overwhelmingly rejected by MPs. Ann McGregor, chief executive of Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry “The business communities that we represent have always had a erse range of views on what form the UK’s future relationship with the EU should take, however they do agree on the need to avoid a messy and disorderly Brexit. “To achieve this we therefore need an agreement that will secure the transition period and protect jobs. As businesses wait to see what happens next in Parliament, it is crucial that those at Westminster move beyond tactical manoeuvring and look at all the options in order to avoid a ‘no deal’s scenario. “Firms are in the dark on too many aspects of le after March . This has already led to many businesses taking action – pausing on recruitment and investment, stockpiling goods, and relocating factories in other parts of the EU. In fact, a third of NI Chamber members are currently putting growth and investment plans on hold in the absence of clarity from Westminster. There is however nothing to stop government acting decisively on areas within their control, such as migration and customs procedures.”  Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “The result this evening will be a cause for concern across the Northern Ireland business community. Northern Ireland businesses desperately need certainty about the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU and will be severely disadvantaged by a no deal. A no deal Brexit means that Northern Ireland households will face higher prices and less choice on the shelves something they can ill afford. “Se need politicians  to coalesce around a workable solution that protects consumers from the costs and disruptions due to the loss of tarf-free and frictionless trade we currently enjoy with partners in the EU. We are now closer than ever to the possibility of a no-deal that will be a disaster for Northern Ireland.” “  Angela McGowan, CBI Northern Ireland director “Every business will feel no deal is hurtling closer. A new plan is needed immediately. This is now a time for our politicians to make history as leaders. All MPs need to reflect on the need for compromise and to act at speed to protect the UKs economy. “No deal would immediately put Northern Irish jobs and businesses at risk and jeopardise years of positive economic development and integration across the island.  It must be avoided to protect our all-island economy.”  Glyn Roberts, Retail NI chief executive “This is a disappointing but not unexpected result. While the Prime Minister’s draft Withdrawal Bill was in no way perfect, it was definitely preferable to crashing out of the EU with no deal. “The Government now needs to work on a cross-party basis with Labour and other opposition parties to reach a broader agreement for a withdrawal deal and secure the transition period, protect jobs and a positive future relationship with the EU  Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster “Leaving the EU without a deal would damage the sustainability of the Hospitality industry and impact on the potential growth of Tourism in Northern Ireland. We appeal to our elected representatives to work together in a spirit of consensus government to ensure that a no deal scenario does not happen.”  Tina McKenzie, FSB NI policy chair “With the clock ticking down to Brexit Day in just  weeks, we are running out of time to avoid a clf-edge, no-deal outcome. “A disorderly exit from the EU would be deeply damaging for small businesses, causing disruption to supply chains, increasing costs and stling investment. “A no-deal is something which we simply cannot countenance, so it is imperative that political leaders sharpen their focus and do all they can to reach agreement in the short time available.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
