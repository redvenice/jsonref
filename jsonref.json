Netanyahu has tried to portray himself as a statesman who is uniquely qualified to lead the country through challenging timesThe performances of these parties could make or break Netanyahu\u0027s ability to form a coalition. Heavier turnout by Arab voters, many of whom stayed home in April, could also hurt Netanyahu.The Israeli leader is desperate to secure a narrow 61-seat majority in parliament with his hard-line religious and nationalist allies who are expected to approve legislation that would grant the prime minister immunity from prosecution.Israel\u0027s attorney general has recommended pressing criminal charges against Netanyahu in three separate corruption cases, pending a long delayed pre-trial hearing scheduled next month.With his career on the line, Netanyahu has campaigned furiously and taken a late hard turn to the right in hopes of rallying his nationalist base.On Monday, Netanyahu vowed to annex \u0027all the settlements\u0027 in the West Bank in an attempt to win nationalist support ahead of the election.

George, 10, saw his GP the day after returning home and tests confirmed he had salmonella\u0027It is particularly worrying that George has been confirmed to have contracted salmonella, which is an extremely debilitating illness and can cause significant ongoing health problems even death in the most serious of cases.\u0027Through our work, we see many cases of gastric illness in people who have been on holiday, with it not only ruining their time abroad but also continuing to affect their lives back home. We have sadly also acted for families of those who have lost their lives to the illness.\u0027We have already begun our investigations into George\u0027s illness and are determined to find out what caused it to ensure that, where possible, lessons can be learnt to prevent other families from facing the same issues.\u0027As part of our work and to assist with our investigations, we would be keen to hear from anyone else who may also have been affected by illness whilst staying at the Holiday Village, Montenegro.\u0027More than a month on, there has been some improvement in George\u0027s symptoms but he is still suffering with the effects of his illness. Ms Dalton, who has had to take annual leave from work to care for him, said: \u0027We were all really looking forward to our holiday and had been saving all year for it.          The Dalton family had a week-long stay at the Holiday Village in Velika Plaza in Montenegro\u0027So it was devastating when George became ill. It was horrible to see him so unwell and in so much pain. It\u0027s also ruined the remainder of his summer holidays, as he has had to be signed off from football academy for four weeks. \u0027He\u0027s struggling with running, when he is normally very active. As if that wasn\u0027t bad enough, it has also had an effect on him psychologically. \u0027A friend invited him to go to Alton Towers, but he was too scared to go as he didn\u0027t want to be away from home in case he felt unwell.\u0027I had to reassure him by offering to stay in a hotel near to Alton Towers so that I could be on hand if he needed me, but he was still reluctant to go. \u0027George has also become fussy with the food he eats, as he is worried that everything he eats will give him salmonella.\u0027Ms Dalton told her legal team that she had had some concerns over the cleanliness and hygiene at the Holiday Village hotel during their stay.She added: \u0027We noticed that on occasions the same utensils were used for both raw and cooked food at a barbecue. \u0027Sometimes there were no serving lids in the children\u0027s area of the buffet, leaving the food uncovered.\u0027Our hotel room was not very clean and I don\u0027t think our shower was cleaned throughout the whole of our stay. \u0027As a result, George had to sleep on beach towels because his sheets were dirty and weren\u0027t changed even though we requested new bedding.\u0027It\u0027s just not what you expect when you go on holiday, and for George to still be suffering, it is heartbreaking. We need answers as to how this happened, because we don\u0027t want anyone else to go through what George has.\u0027A Tui spokesman said: \u0027We are sorry to hear of George\u0027s experience on holiday in Montenegro.

Click or tap on the images to read the captionsThe first match of the series featured the return to Test cricket of the Australian trio Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft following suspensions for their respective parts in the ball-tampering scandal of 2018, aka “Sandpapergate”. Needless to say, few England fans were willing to let bygones be bygones.Warner, one of the Australian openers, soon fell to a delivery by Stuart Broad – a recurring theme in the series – and copped an earful from the home fans as he departed. But what of Smith? The former Australian captain struck a superb 144, helping the tourists to recover from a disastrous 122-8 to eventually post 284 all out. In reply, England’s Rory Burns scored 133 – his maiden Test century – as England made 374 all out.Edgbaston’s Hollies Stand is recognised worldwide for its fancy dress and carnival atmosphere. Fans came in various guises including a group dressed as the England 1966 World Cup winners (replete with the Jules Rimet trophy) and a Donald Trump baby blimp. Many brought pieces of sandpaper to bate the Aussies.The second Australian innings saw another century for Smith – his 10th Ashes ton – and 110 for Matthew Wade. Australia declared on 487 for 7, leaving England chasing 398 to win. Australian bowlers Pat Cummins and Nathan Lyons were in inspired form when England returned to the crease, taking all 10 wickets for only 146 runs. England’s misery in defeat was worsened by the news that their seam bowler James Anderson, who bowled only four overs in the Test, would miss the rest of the series with a calf injury.The sight of Jofra Archer blitzing Smith in the second Test will live long in the memory it echoed the infamous Bodyline series of 1932-33, which is still talked about today.Archer hit speeds in excess of 96mph and caught Smith twice in quick succession with bouncers in Australia’s first innings. The first cracked Smith on the forearm the second careered into the back of his neck and sent him sprawling to the floor. After a concussion assessment and a brief rest, Smith was allowed to carry on, but he was later forced to retire from the Test.Prior to that, the two sides had only traded metaphorical blows. After a washout on day one, Australia had won the toss and sent England – who wore red caps in support of the Ruth Strauss Foundation – in to bat. England made 258 all out.Warner fell in the fifth over of the visitors’ reply – his third single-digit score of the series – bowled again by his nemesis Broad. Then Archer claimed his first Test wicket, dismissing Cameron Bancroft lbw. With Smith losing his wicket LBW to Chris Woakes only eight runs short of another century, Australia’s tailenders tumbled before tea and the tourists finished with a total of 250.England’s second innings saw Joe Root out for a golden duck to Cummins on day four, before rain brought proceedings to a premature end. A sprightly batting display from Ben Stokes, who bludgeoned 115 from 165 balls, allowed the hosts to declare on 258 for 5 in order to chase a late win. However, Labuschagne and Travis Head proved obstinate for Australia, putting on 85 runs for the fourth wicket.Ultimately, despite placing numerous fielders at close quarters in the dying light, England could not skittle Australia and the match was drawn.Headingley 2019: the greatest Test match ever played? Discuss.For sheer drama and down-to-the-wire brilliance, the final day of the third Test will go down in legend so too will its key protagonists. Ben Stokes and Jack Leach hauled England to an unthinkable victory with a show of great resilience – the latter earning himself a lifetime supply of Specsavers glasses to boot.But how did it ever come to that? For the second Test running, the start of play was delayed by rain. Australia collapsed to 179 all out in their first innings and Archer ended with figures of six for 45. However, England were woeful in reply: all out for only 67, it was their 12th lowest Test score of all time. Josh Hazlewood picked up a five-wicket haul for the visitors and England looked like they had thrown the Ashes away.In their second innings, Australia scored 246 all out to give themselves a lead of 358, meaning England needed their highest ever successful run-chase in Test cricket.England reached day four of the Test on 156 for 3, giving themselves a ray of hope. But Joe Root was then caught behind before Jonny Bairstow, Jos Buttler, Chris Woakes, Jofra Archer and Stuart Broad all departed in the space of 16 crippling overs. England had only one wicket remaining with 73 more runs needed for victory. It looked impossible.Jack Leach joined Ben Stokes in the middle and the two men created a partnership for the ages. Stokes reached his century with a masterful display of batting, while Leach, whose glasses frequently steamed up as the pressure mounted, was the perfect defensive foil. At times, Stokes was so nervous he was unable to watch his partner on strike.In the dying stages, when England needed just two runs, Nathan Lyon fumbled a brilliant chance to run out Leach who was miles from his crease. The next ball looked like a plumb lbw shout but Australia had burned all their reviews. Leach then scrambled a single off Pat Cummins before Stokes hammered through the covers to complete an astonishing victory.As delirious celebrations swept the ground, Leach planted a smacker on Stokes. England had not only saved the Ashes, they’d given themselves a chance to go on and win it.After the delirium of Leeds, England’s performance at Old Trafford fell flat. The Aussies ran rampant in their first innings, racking up 497 for 8 before declaring. Steve Smith was once again the main architect of their innings, scoring 211 before being caught by Joe Denly off Joe Root. England narrowly avoided the follow-on when they posted 301 in reply – Stokes could only muster 26 in his first stint at the crease – but even the arrival of storm clouds couldn’t alter the course of the Test.Smith top scored (again) in the second innings as Australia declared on 186 for six, setting England a run-chase of 383. When Burns fell for a duck and was instantly followed by Root – out first ball to a monstrous delivery by Pat Cummins – late on day four, England were 0 for 2. Jason Roy defended the hat-trick ball and survived until the close of play, but England’s hopes were in tatters.A brief rally on day five gave Australia the jitters – Jos Buttler, Craig Overton and Jack Leach all provided solid resistance to Australia’s otherwise inspired trio of Pat Cummins, Marnus Labuschagne and Josh Hazlewood. The latter eventually took Overton’s wicket lbw to end the contest and ensure Australia retained the Ashes on English soil for the first time since 2001.Only one thing remained to be settled in the fifth Test: could Australia win the Ashes series outright, or could England force a creditable draw? Remarkably, Australia’s captain, Tim Paine, put England in to bat after winning the toss – one of his many questionable decisions in the series – allowing the home side to chalk up 294 in their first innings. Jos Buttler top scored with 70.In return, Warner fell cheaply again as Archer took six for 62. Woakes removed Smith lbw, but not before the Australian had plundered another 80 runs.England’s 329 runs in their second innings teed up the prospect of victory. But for that to happen, they’d surely have to find a way through Smith. Unexpectedly, Smith fell cheaply by his standards but Matthew Wade made 117 off 166 balls. The innings featured an increasingly hostile battle between Wade and Archer as the Australians scrambled in vain. Their target, 399, was never in sight and when Root caught Hazelwood off Leach’s delivery in the 76th over, England sealed victory and salvaged a series draw.The urn may not be coming home, but it’s been a whirlwind few months for English cricket. First a World Cup win in the one-day format, then the heroics of Headingley in a tumultuous Ashes series. A cricketing summer never to be forgotten."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64010ecbea26f4033fa0272c9507290162db7542/0_0_3800_2280/master/3800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fefe8a2737d38cb61b3820f205d7e191","title":"the best visual art of the 21st century","story":"Steve McQueen in bed, Ai Weiwei in trouble, Pussy Riot in church and Ragnar Kjartansson in the bath – they’re all included in our countdown of the best art since 2000by  Adrian Searle,  Jonathan Jones,  Sean O’Hagan and  Hettie JudahAlmost an hour long, Tacita Dean’s film is a summation of her work to date.

The pantyhose feet droop, midair. The lights are a sign of life. Whether hanged or floating, dangling or soaring, Lucas’s figure is full of pathos and humour, both miserable and transcendent.

This prince, well versed in new philosophies, set aside painting and video art and decreed the exhibition a social laboratory. One thousand and one citizens of China would travel by his side as both audience and exhibit. And the prince constructed a great dormitory, matching wheelie suitcases and coloured bracelets, that by these tokens the citizens of Kassel might know the citizens of China, and welcome them. And all lived happily ever after (apart from the Prince of Protest, who was arrested four years later and imprisoned for 81 days by his own government). HJThis cycle of 14 paintings, all based on an Andy Warhol sketch of a monkey, and assembled in a specially constructed and lit room in collaboration with architect David Atjaye, was a breakthrough work for Chris Ofili. Tate’s purchase of the work proved controversial, but it would probably have been split up otherwise. With its drifts of glitter, its gorgeous colour and detail, its humour and elephant dung, it pointed the way to an expansive, immersive narrative approach Ofili has continued to develop. I was astonished. ASStarting with the basic, pressing question of how to evade surveillance in a world read through moving images, Hito Steyerl’s influential video picks apart what it means to disappear. If surveillance feels grossly invasive, how do we feel about the invisibility afforded to the vastly wealthy? What about the invisibility bestowed by a burqa, systemic bigotry, or extraordinary rendition? Shot on an abandoned satellite “resolution target” in the California desert, How Not to Be Seen is conceptually intense, but retains the daffiness of the Monty Python sketch that inspired it. An artist and theorist both, Steyerl beguiles us into contemplating uncomfortable questions with wit and charm. HJRead more here.“This variation, 2012” says a voice in a pitch-black room. Tino Sehgal’s magnificent performance piece takes place in near total darkness. Performers stamp and sing, whisper, holler and dance. They go through little routines, songs and riffs as the viewer stumbles among and between them. Sometimes there is a confrontation and sometimes unnerving quiet. Wildly exhilarating, This Variation concerns presence and presentness, and what it means to be a spectator.

Birds sing, cars go by, people fold washing as she tramps back alleys and country lanes, city streets and unmade paths. Nothing happens in the film. It has already happened, in bucolic villages and city side-streets. The film lasts a long time, dwelling on the past’s persistence in the present. The camera is unwavering as the world turns, oblivious. ASRead more here.A moving, beautiful, mournful and uplifting three-channel portrait of the lives and times of Stuart Hall. Talent meets talent, words meet images and postwar England meets its wisest cultural thinker in this wonderfully deft work. Using more than 800 hours of audio and TV material from Hall’s own archive, Akomfrah takes us from Hall’s Jamaican childhood to a grey postwar London. But the real concern is the malleability of identities, how we are formed and the endless task of reinventing ourselves. ASRead more here.The sun indoors ... what’s not to like? Eliasson’s hallucinatory installation in the Tate Turbine Hall had people lying on the floor, mellowing out to his shimmering recreation of a Turneresque sky inside the museum. He would be very good at staging a Pink Floyd reunion. But in fact he is a very thoughtful artist, fascinated by colour, light and the fragile state of nature. This unforgettable spectacle was the most over-the-top in a string of dazzling installations and interventions that have proved Elisasson one of the century’s most significant artists.

The painting is as small as the TV screens people were glued to that day. The image is interrupted, almost swiped away by paint, recognising the impossibility of comprehending the enormity of the moment. ASTaking as its premise a call for more than three million Jews to return to Poland, land of their forefathers, to save the country from being only for “Polish Poles in Poland”, Yael Bartana’s film trilogy plays on and inverts nationalist sentiment, EU and old-style Communist party rhetoric, Zionist dreams, the holocaust and the Palestinian right to return. With escalating irony, shock and pithy humour, Bartana takes on the world.

It zigzagged down the ramp like a small canyon, or the remains of an earthquake. Shibboleth evoked ision, a flaw. “It represents borders, the experience of immigrants, the experience of segregation, the experience of racial hatred,” Salcedo said. “The space which illegal immigrants occupy is a negative space. And so this piece is a negative space.” How of our moment Shibboleth remains.

It is hard to keep up with all the shenanigans between Shia and Sunni, and the duplicitous isions and squabbles of the Christian invaders, regarded by Arab commentators of the time as uncivilised barbarians.

But few will have seen the entire work, with its approximately 12,000 cinema clips ning its 24-hour entirety. A tour-de-force of borrowed movie footage, The Clock is cinema’s great timepiece, always synchronised to the real time wherever it is shown. Following the diurnal rhythms of everyday life, it is by turns perky, sexy, conspiratorial, manic, exhausted and sullen. Knowing it is there is almost enough.

Teresa Margolles’s Limpieza (Cleaning), part of her larger work at the Mexico Pavilion at the 2009 Venice Biennale, was both an everyday routine and a bleak response to both state and criminal violence. Both washing and sullying the floors, Limpieza was emphatic, unforgettable, tragic and tender. ASThere’s a lot of weak political art out there: sophisticated, modish, after-the-factish art that broadcasts liberal values to a liberal audience. Pussy Riot’s performance of Punk Prayer occupies the opposite pole: feminist, explicitly anti-Putin, protesting the banning of gay pride and the Orthodox church’s support of the president. Staged by the brightly masked punk collective in the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow, it got members Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Maria Alyokhina arrested and imprisoned. The after-image of their performance still lingers as a powerful – and immaculately constructed – symbol of defiance in the face of freedoms lost.

Among great stands of nettles, strange plants of all descriptions flourished: nightshade and Afghan poppies, aphrodisiacs, poisons and psychotropic plants. In a clearing beside a pond sat a bronze statue of a reclining woman whose head was a living nest of bees. Two lithe greyhounds, one of whom had a leg that had been dyed pink, wandered about. “Live things and inanimate things, made and not made,” read Huyghe’s description of this wondrous work. ASHistory isn’t only written by the winners – it is also woven into magnificent battle tapestries for their baronial walls, and painted large and heroic on canvas for their palaces. In portraying a brutal clash between pickets and police in South Yorkshire during the miners’ strikes in 1984-5, Deller instead chose to approach this horrifying confrontation from the field up. Battle of Orgreave, described by the artist as “a thousand-person crime re-enactment”, was staged by 800 historical re-enacters and 200 former miners. For all of them, the event was in living memory. A monument of sorts, the performance was at once participatory ritual, spectacle, living archive and a space to mourn.

Ragnar understood her lyrics as a commentary on what he calls the “common defeat” of their marriage. The music was co-written by Kjartansson and his frequent collaborator Davíð Þór Jónsson.The artist’s friends play different parts of the same song, which repeats over and over, for more than an hour. A pair of twins play concertina and cello in different rooms – all the musicians were audible to one another through headphones. There are two pianists, a guitarist, drums. The Visitors is a live performance, each musician visible on a different screen. Outside, there is a party on the porch, where the house’s current occupants take in the early evening. Captured in real time, one evening at sunset, the music builds and dies and builds again. The song repeats and develops, reaches false crescendos and plateaus. Ragnar, in the bath, is nearly submerged in soap bubbles as he sings, “Once again I’m falling into my feminine ways.” “There are stars exploding around you  And there is nothing  Nothing you can do,” goes another refrain, in this idyllic crumbling retreat. You get sucked in.You feel like a guest yourself in this marvellous, immersive multiscreen film. The more often I see it, the more I come to inhabit its rooms. Why is it so compelling and, with its repetitions, so watchable multiple times? The fragility of friendship and love, communality and miscommunication all have a part here. The title of the work is taken from Abba’s final album, when the band were falling apart. The film’s absurdities and longeurs, the light, and the concentration of all the performers and the repetition of the song is utterly compelling and hypnotic. Youthfulness and idealism feel like a fading dream in the evening’s light. The Visitors is a kind of extended farewell to romanticism, to which Ragnar is both drawn and deeply suspicious of. Writing this, I want to see The Visitors again, immediately.

Bourne’s study of this copy, which has been housed in the Free Library of Philadelphia since 1944, dated the annotator to the mid-17th century, finding them alive to “the sense, accuracy, and interpretative possibility of the dialogue”. She also provided many images of the handwritten notes, which struck Scott-Warren as looking oddly similar to Milton’s hand.“But I always think ‘I recognise that handwriting,’” Scott-Warren said. “I go and check and normally I’m wrong. This time I thought: ‘The case is getting stronger and stronger’.”As evidence stacked up, he said he became “quite trembly … You’re gathering evidence with your heart in your mouth.”The first folio is the first collected edition of Shakespeare’s plays, published seven years after his death. Without it, 18 plays including Macbeth and The Tempest might have been lost to history. Around 750 first folios were printed, with 233 known to survive. They command huge sums at auction, with one selling for £1.87m three years ago.Scott-Warren has made a detailed comparison of the annotator’s handwriting with the Paradise Lost poet’s. He also believes that the work the annotator did to improve the text of the folio – suggesting corrections and supplying additional material such as the prologue to Romeo and Juliet, along with cross-references to other works – is similar to work Milton did in other books that survive from his library, including his copy of Boccaccio’s Life of Dante.The scholar tentatively suggested in a blogpost that he might have identified John Milton’s copy of the Shakespeare First Folio of 1623, admitting that, “in this as in other cases, there’s usually a lot of wishful thinking, plus copious spinning of the evidence to make it seem plausible, and elision of anything that doesn’t seem to fit”.But he soon found that other scholars were agreeing with him. “Not only does this hand look like Milton’s, but it behaves like Milton’s writing elsewhere does, doing exactly the things Milton does when he annotates books, and using exactly the same marks,” said Dr Will Poole at New College Oxford. “Shakespeare is our most famous writer, and the poet John Milton was his most famous younger contemporary. It was, until a few days ago, simply too much to hope that Milton’s own copy of Shakespeare might have survived — and yet the evidence here so far is persuasive. This may be one of the most important literary discoveries of modern times.”As well as numerous textual annotations, the folio also contains a host of line markings, showing the annotator’s engagement with, particularly, Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth, The Tempest, Henry IV, As You Like It and King Lear. Scott-Warren believes these can be traced to Milton’s own work.“The book is absolutely covered with lines in the margin of passages and when you’re reading those thinking the annotator is Milton they become really interesting,” he said. “It’s how they echo with his work, the sense that the volume offers you the opportunity to read Shakespeare through Milton’s eyes. Because the lines in the margin don’t give you any verbal content, you don’t know why he’s singled out a passage for attention, but it forces you to think your way into Milton’s head and it does really chime with a lot of what goes on in his poetry, so you can see him constructing himself through Shakespeare.”One highlighted section in The Tempest is the song: “Come unto these yellow sands,  And then take hands:  Courtsied when you have and kiss’d  The wild waves whist.” The unusual rhyme, of “kiss’d” and “whist”, is echoed in Milton’s On the Morning of Christ’s Nativity: “The winds with wonder whist,  Smoothly the waters kist.”“We would already have known about that allusion, they are the only two writers who used that rhyme, but you can see him marking it in the text and responding to it,” said Scott-Warren. “It gives you a sense of his sensitivity and alertness to Shakespeare. What’s quite remarkable as well is that he’s singled out for attention lots of the passages that have become incredibly famous – he goes through and marks out some of the most celebrated Shakespearean speeches.”It has always been known that Shakespeare was a huge influence on Milton – in his poem On Shakespeare, Milton calls him a “son of Memory” and “great heir of fame”, writing of how “Thou in our wonder and astonishment  Hast built thyself a live-long monument.”“But this allows us to see the encounter happening,” said Scott-Warren. “It shows you the firsthand encounter between two great writers, which you don’t often get to see, especially in this period. A lot of that kind of evidence is lost, so that’s really exciting.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e57aeb04d3f09a7545f08797662293f4ad87e36/0_113_1557_934/master/1557.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3452b7a610f3391089e6fa19d39bd48b","title":"joe abercrombie you can get women into any story if you think about it for 10 seconds","story":"The leading grimdark author, known for his cynical and violent fantasy novels, is back in the world of the First Law – along with a lot more women ...British author Joe Abercrombie may have sold five million copies of his violent, darkly humorous fantasy novels, and had his books praised by reigning overlord of the genre, George RR Martin (“bloody and relentless”). But the first time he sat down to write what he believed would be “the great British fantasy novel”, it didn’t go well.Growing up on David Eddings and Dragonlance, Abercrombie was aiming for full-blown epic fantasy when he made a stab at his own novel in his early 20s. He managed a few chapters, but it was “absolutely pompous”, he admits now, away from his home in Bath to meet with his publishers in London.A decade later, he tried again. He kept the same characters, the same storyline, but “straight away it had this much more world-weary, humorous voice,” he says. “I was taking myself, and the fantasy genre, much less seriously.”The story began to work. Abercrombie spent months refining every paragraph, even “taking it seriously enough” to show it to his parents, who are still his first readers and biggest critics. “I can remember my mother saying – she denies this – ‘This is not nearly as bad as I thought it would be’. I knew then that I was on to something.”That something was 2006’s The Blade Itself, following the adventures of torturer Inquisitor Glokta, barbarian warrior Logen Ninefingers, and the dashing but vain swordsman Jezal dan Luthar. Gritty, violent, cynical and redolent with dark humour, “it was my take on Lord of the Rings, but bringing in all my weird preoccupations about how people work, the nature of violence. It’s a reaction against the shiny and optimistic heroic fantasy I read as a teenager. In trying to do the opposite, it becomes quite pessimistic and grim.”Unusually for epic fantasy, the story takes place at a time when money is becoming the new power and the middle classes are rising mercantile forces are afoot. “The fantasy I read as a kid did often take place in this medieval sandbox where nothing really developed or changed, where conflict comes from a battle between an objective good and evil rather than rising out of social forces and changes as it does in the real world. So I’ve always been interested in worlds that move on and shift,” Abercrombie says.He couldn’t find an agent, sending out his manuscript to no avail. “Criticism of that first book is hard to take. You’re expecting to make an impact somehow, even if it’s negative – ‘I despise this book because it’s so powerful!’ – but what you get is the little photocopied slip saying ‘thanks, but no thanks’. So you have no idea if the book is unfashionable, weird, very bad, almost there … that total lack of any guidance was quite tough to deal with,” he says. “I think the combination of violence and humour wasn’t an immediate easy sell. People maybe read it and thought, ‘is this Game of Thrones or Terry Pratchett?’ Maybe there was a disconnect there.”A friend in publishing passed the manuscript to Gollancz, and he was finally signed for a trilogy. Abercrombie continued his day job as a television editor, but he began cutting back as the royalties came in. “The first couple of cheques were little drips and then they started to get more and more significant, and I went from being shocked at how little writers earn to thinking, ‘oh, you could make a living from this’,” he says.This week, Abercrombie returns to the world of the First Law with A Little Hatred, the first in a new trilogy. Focusing on a new generation of characters – although bringing in some old favourites – it opens with a quote from Samuel Johnson: “The age is running mad after innovation and all the business of the world is to be done in a new way.” The chimneys of industry are rising over this fantasy universe, and its denizens are struggling to come out on top. It’s funny and sardonic, violent and compelling – just what his readers have come to expect. It also features a notably larger cast of female characters than Abercrombie’s usual fare, including Savine dan Glokta, a brilliantly mercenary socialite, and Rikke, who can see the future with her “long eye”.“The First Law was definitely very male,” Abercrombie admits. “A lot of classic fantasy tropes are male – boys with special destinies, wizardly mentors, shiny knights, that kind of thing … Even when I was writing the third, I was thinking, I didn’t cover myself in glory here. I could have done a lot better, both in terms of the central female characters, but even incidentally having more women in the world. But I would never have considered it. If I needed a politician or a blacksmith or an innkeeper, those were all men.”Over time, he says, he realised that “there are many ways to get women into any story if you think about it for 10 seconds”. He hopes that having more women in the cast and the wider world will make it “more interesting”.With two more books still to come in the new trilogy, Abercrombie is busy enough for now. Next, he’s interested in having magic collide with a more modern world. “Along with the cliche of worlds never really progressing, there’s this cliche of magic leaking away from the world in this slightly tragic way, and a tear shed over all that’s been lost,” he says. “I quite like the idea of magic erupting again in a violent and unpleasant way – that’s another direction things might go.”• A Little Hatred by Joe Abercrombie is published by Gollancz on 17 September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/941cabc79f030ffc46009e1dd0cdb0ab49e1f9e0/684_193_2675_1605/master/2675.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ff4eb6eeb6ad0bdd2d6862299ae0878","title":"russian culture minister dismisses comics as for those who cant read well","story":"Vladimir Medinsky’s comments have sparked backlash from fans and boosted sales, according to one Russian publisherThe Russian culture minister’s dismissal of comic books as “for those who can’t read well” has sparked a backlash from fans but also boosted sales of the genre, according to one publisher.The minister, Vladimir Medinsky, told an audience at the Moscow international book fair that comics are “like chewing gum, it’s not food”. “Comic books are aimed at children who are only learning to read,” he added. “I think it’s pathetic for adults to read comic books.”Dmitry Yakovlev, head of one of Russia’s leading indie comic producers, the St Petersburg-based Bumkniga, was unfazed by the minister’s dig. “Medinsky’s comment was pure stupidity, therefore supporting the comic industry,” he told the . “Sales increased.”Yakovlev said that the number of comics published in Russia in recent years has significantly increased, with “a fully-fledged comic book market forming in Russia”.“Phrases like ‘comics are for children’, for those who do not like to read or for idiots are present everywhere. But comics are a form of storytelling, like literature, cinema and theatre,” he said. “Comics are read in Russia in the same way as in other countries. The value of comics is their universal language: the language of drawing is understandable anywhere in the world.”Chrissy Williams, editor of comics including the Eisner award-nominated series The Wicked + the Divine, said she was “appalled that any skepticism still remains on this point”.“The language of comics, by definition, contains more components than the written word alone. It asks its audience to read words, but also images, in sequence, and the spaces between the images,” she said. “Maus – a moving and innovative memoir about the holocaust that s multiple genres, utilising word and image to communicate so powerfully – won the Pulitzer prize in 1992. Of course comics are literature.”Cartoonist Stephen Collins, author of the forthcoming graphic novel Susan Wogan’s Journey to the Stars, agreed. “People often get this backwards, in my view,” he said. “What people are really saying when they ask this question is ‘but are they literary?’, which is essentially just a question about genre prejudice.”For Collins, “making a comic feels very much the same as writing, so comics are certainly literature”.“Writing is just feeding information to the reader in deliberate sequence to get a desired response,” he said. “Novelists do that within a sentence, cartoonists do the same in dialogue and narration, as well as ‘writing’ the order of the panels, too. The only thing we can’t generally do is write similes and evocative description of visuals, because typically they are shown. But in general, comics are very much ‘literature’ in their creation. I think that to question that is just to get confused by one’s own genre biases.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94d14759d16ef8e2038335cccb4478b47e7b744b/0_174_2606_1563/master/2606.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e8c828093b9f31005885c98fa0d425a","title":"wework delays ipo investors flotation","story":"Office-sharing company’s value has been slashed since January but it says flotation will still take place this year WeWork, the US office-sharing company, has postponed its stock market flotation after receiving a lukewarm response from investors.WeWork’s parent, We Company, had planned to launch an investor roadshow this week to drum up interest in its $20bn (£16bn) share sale, slashed from an initial valuation of $47bn. It hoped to price and list its shares next week, but has put the plans on ice amid operating losses and corporate governance issues.We Company said it still aimed to complete the flotation before the end of the year.The company has been under pressure to push ahead with the flotation to secure funding for its operations. We Company secured a $6bn credit line from banks last month but can only access this if WeWork floats before the end of the year and raises at least $3bn.We Company reportedly realised on Monday that even with the support of WeWork’s biggest backer, Softbank, the IPO would have raised just more than $2bn, short of this target.Softbank, the Japanese telecoms and technology group, had urged the company to delay the float, after concerns mounted over big operating losses, pricey lease agreements and executive payouts. A recently released prospectus showed the company has lost about $3bn over the past three years.WeWork’s IPO underwriters at JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs have been testing investor appetite for shares with a valuation between $15bn and $20bn. The valuation could be as low as $10bn, according to reports.John Colley, associate dean of Warwick Business School and an expert on IPOs, said: “Following the recent collapse of Uber and Lyft shares after their initial price offerings, potential investors in WeWork will have some valid questions. How much is it really worth behind the slick marketing? And will it be successful in the long run?”He noted that the company is a long way from becoming profitable, and lost $1.9bn after making sales of $1.8bn last year. It has been losing $2 for every $1 of revenue it generates.“It is also relatively easy for new competitors to enter the market, perhaps in less costly parts of the city and because WeWork offers short-term contracts, it is easy for tenants to move elsewhere if a better deal comes along. There are no strong reasons to be loyal to WeWork,” Colley said.“WeWork is highly subsidised to attract its customers. This means the company will probably have to raise prices in the future to make money, particularly when investors want a return. Any collapse in demand will see them struggle to pay their landlords, particularly during an economic downturn or recession.”There are also concerns about the firm’s management and corporate governance standards. WeWork’s CEO and co-founder, Adam Neumann, has taken $700m out of the company before the IPO. He also owns properties that WeWork rents, a potential conflict of interest.Rogier Quirijns, head of European real estate at property investment firm Cohen \u0026amp Steers, said: “WeWork has been a disruptor and innovator with an undeniable ‘cool factor’, but ultimately its business is not so different from IWG or other landlords specialising in flexible offices. IWG, the former Regus, nearly went bankrupt after the TMT bubble in 2004.

Many of these shareholders live close to the mine and invested as a show of support in a project that had the potential to greatly improve the local economy.”Sirius will explore alternative financing ideas mooted by a number of investors and advisers, and said the company had enough cash in the bank at £180m to see it through the next six months.Fraser said: “The company will now conduct a comprehensive strategic review over the next six months to assess and incorporate optimisations to the project development plan and to develop a different financing structure for the funds required.“This is the most prudent decision to give the company the time necessary to restructure its plans to move the project forward. The process will incorporate feedback from prospective credit providers around the risks associated with construction and will include seeking a major strategic partner for the project.”Credit providers are concerned about the risks associated with deep shaft construction, Sirius said, prompting it to explore how the building of the shafts and other major aspects could be rescheduled to reduce this perceived risk.The plans involve sinking two shafts to a depth of 1,500 metres (4,920ft) – equivalent to about 20 times the height of York Minster – and building a 23-mile (37km) underground tunnel with a conveyor belt to a port in Teesside.Graham Spooner, an investment research analyst at the Share Centre, said: “With cash running out fast, investors will be fearing for the future of the mine and remain cognisant that the recent history of mining in the UK has been littered with failures.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b0b4c66b19d797fda54500bfdc84f127f5e9e3e/0_220_3501_2102/master/3501.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68cc18e92529c99f9cb4d3b5d7d0e61f","title":"palestinians israel election occupation netanyahu","story":"After 50 years of occupation, our freedom is shrinking every day. But even if Netanyahu loses, little will changeWhen Boris Johnson announced his plan to suspend parliament, I was visiting Orkney with my wife, Penny. It was the last week of a month-long stay in Scotland, and it took a day for the news to reach us. We were having tea with some English friends on 29 August when they heard what had happened. They began to fume: he’s done it again. They worried how this would undermine their country’s democracy. It was a curious twist: I am usually the one bearing bad news about the state of my country. For a brief moment, we traded anxieties – although mine were of a more existential nature. Even in Scotland, the bad news from home was constant: the expansion of Israeli settlements, the threat of annexation, and the steady tally of death and injury in Gaza, all eating away at what remained of my Palestine.A few days later, just after Johnson had expelled 21 MPs from his party, we flew home. The driver who picked us up from the airport took the usual circuitous route to get us to Ramallah, crossing three checkpoints on the way. At each one, we held our breath and hoped the soldiers were not in a bad mood. As always I felt the shock of returning home, seeing our parched hills at the end of summer and my noisy, crowded city I had a sudden and pervasive sense of precariousness.On the way our driver informed us without betraying any emotion that Israel was no longer allowing traffic from Jerusalem to pass through the notorious checkpoint at Qalandia into the West Bank, forcing drivers on to circuitous routes through other checkpoints and compounding the misery there. “They are digging and placing cables” on the road to the checkpoint, he said. Then with typical sardonic Palestinian humour he added: “Perhaps they are planning to present us with a gift.”His other news was about Benjamin Netanyahu’s triumphant stroll through the old city of Hebron, where he spoke in front of the Ibrahimi mosque, a holy site for Muslims and Jews, who know it as the Tomb of the Patriarchs. In 2000, Ariel Sharon’s provocative visit to al-Aqsa mosque sparked a second intifada. But this time Palestinian protest was muted. Some signs were held aloft and a murmur of anger was heard.Netanyahu acted triumphant. He assured the 800 Jewish settlers who dominate a city of more than 200,000 Palestinians that they will “remain here for ever”. By paying his first visit since 1998 to the most populated Palestinian city in the West Bank – without setting off a strong protest – the Israeli prime minister was highlighting his almost total control of the territory. It was a transparent stunt to boost his popularity before the upcoming elections. But it did demonstrate how thoroughly Israel has dominated and subdued the Palestinian population under its occupation.Every time I return to Ramallah after a few weeks away, I’m struck by how much my world has shrunk. Movement between Palestinian cities is restricted, and travel to Gaza impossible. Gaza is about 50 miles away from Ramallah I have not visited for 19 years. The Oslo accords ided Palestinian territory into three categories. “Area C” is under Israeli control, “Area B” is under joint security control by Israel and the Palestinians, and “Area A” – the smallest – is administered by the Palestinian authority.Since Donald Trump became US president, the Israeli settlers in the West Bank have hastened their takeover of more and more Palestinian territory in the areas under Israeli administration – including the land around Ramallah. No longer do the settlers justify this by the law of the land as Israel interprets it, nor by Israeli court decisions. It is now simply the Bible. They declare: “This land is ours even if the Palestinian can present proof of ownership, because God gave it to us.”Ramallah is now the de facto capital of the struggling Palestinian Authority. It suffers from overcrowding but enjoys none of the benefits of statehood. A few days before our return, the head of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, declared that it would cancel the ision of the land into three “areas” and put the whole West Bank under PA sovereignty. But this was a hollow declaration, and the PA will be forbidden from implementing it. In July, Israel demolished dozens of Palestinian apartments in an East Jerusalem neighbourhood where the PA is supposed to control planning – and the authority was powerless to stop it.Last week Netanyahu promised that if re-elected he would annex one-third of the West Bank, including the Jordan Valley, the West Bank’s most fertile area. This was another election stunt: in reality, annexing the land will change nothing. It is already under total Israeli control, and the settlers who live there enjoy all the rights and privileges of Israeli citizenship.I’ve returned carrying a large number of books because ordering one takes many months – if it ever arrives. But it isn’t only books that are delayed. The mail that has to go through Israel is barely functioning. Living conditions in my hometown under Israeli occupation are going from bad to worse with the economic exploitation by Israel proceeding unchallenged. Most vegetables and fruits that we used to buy from local greengrocers were local produce. Now they are mainly Israeli and often are grown on Palestinian land that the settlements now cultivate.Among Palestinians, despair is widespread. “The times are rotten,” my nephew Aziz told me upon my return, echoing Hamlet. There is growing awareness here that Israel’s international campaign to demonise criticism of its colonial policies as a form of antisemitism is succeeding. And there is no hope to be found in Israel: none of the parties contesting the elections on Tuesday are talking about the occupation or proposing how to end it. Instead they are competing to see who can promise the most to the settlers.This is the gloomy political atmosphere to which I have returned. I shall miss the walks in Edinburgh’s parks and the green hills around it. I had hoped that we could spare one of the hills around Ramallah and turn it into a park. But given the scarcity of the land left here to grow, this proved impossible. This congested city is left with no open areas to breathe, and with few of its traditional buildings and trees that gave the place its character.After a month away, I found my garden had lost much of its greenery except for the plumbago – which I found in full bloom. I will revive what can be saved, and in the future concentrate on planting only drought-resistant shrubs. And I must try to remember what I have learned during more than 50 years of occupation, about how to live here on my own terms without losing myself to hatred or anger. For whoever gets elected in Israel this week, it will make no difference to our future in this land.• Raja Shehadeh is a Palestinian writer and lawyer.

For me, it’s about smoking weed in a school playground’As young men, we didn’t talk about our emotions much, so maybe they poured into the music. I was always reticent to ask Tim what the songs were about, although if he wrote about heartbreak I knew the people, the ex-girlfriends and so on. There are loads of internet theories about what Somewhere Only We Know means but I always thought that it is about a place where we grew up – and a longing for something pure and simple. My mum and dad ran a school, and we used to sit in the grounds as teenagers, smoking weed and hanging out: I always thought about that place when I sang the song. To me it’s about us as friends and a band, growing up. We were fish out of water in the London scene, these nice, middle-class boys in our 20s. Meanwhile, some of our old peers were looking down their noses at us because, while they were all becoming successful, we were still pursuing this ridiculous teenage dream. I’m always transported to that place when I sing the song.When Dominic left it could have been the end of the band, but it turned out to be a lightbulb moment. I was never that good on bass and found playing piano much easier. Without anyone to do a big guitar solo the songs became less flabby and I got really into the Smiths, whose early songs were really short.We’d been gigging for years, playing to literally two people on occasion, and were licking our wounds. We couldn’t afford to live and rehearse in London any more with the lowly jobs we had, so we moved back to Battle, rehearsing at my mum and dad’s house. I wrote Somewhere Only We Know on the little piano in their front room. I had the driving rhythm of David Bowie’s Heroes in mind as a starting point, so used the pounding piano like a rhythm guitar and the rest just flowed instinctively.I remember thinking Somewhere Only We Know was pretty good, then playing it to Richard who said: “This is amazing.” A record label had expressed some interest so we took a demo of it on CD it to their office in London and said: “We think this is the song.” They said they were too busy to listen to it and we never heard from them again. It probably went straight in the bin. Instead, we signed to Island Records. Somewhere Only We Know opened all the doors for us and we’re still playing it 15 years later. I suppose many people have somewhere special that feels like a refuge. People still love that song and a lot of them have pored over the lyrics, trying to work out what it means. As a songwriter, it’s a dream come true. • Keane’s new album, Cause and Effect, is out on 20 September.

No sooner has the autumn term begun than schools are recruiting the next cohort of students. If it sometimes seems that they all say the same things about their engaging curriculum, personalised pastoral care and professional ethos, how can you tell them apart?For some parents, it’s all about outcomes. Which school tops the league table for results? Which has been judged by Ofsted as outstanding? For others, it’s more about a culture that will suit their child. Is there a mobile phone ban? Does the school have the dreaded isolation booths?But there is also another consideration. In the same way that consumers are becoming more ethically driven when it comes to the working conditions of those making their clothes or harvesting their food, some are now wondering about how their child’s teachers are treated. So how can you tell whether a school is “toxic”?Just to reassure you, there are not many toxic schools out there. However, it is undeniable that a few have an ethos where staff are worked to the bone, made to complete unnecessary tasks, and are not treated with respect.Miserable and exhausted teachers are unlikely to be as effective as they could be. Teaching is tough but not every school seeks to improve conditions for staff. I wouldn’t want my children taught in such an environment, even if whipping their teachers leads to better GCSEs.I’ve known victims of toxic schools. If I could handpick a teacher for my children it would be my friend Sylvia every time. Sylvia ended up in a toxic school. Meetings were called for 7am as well as 7pm emails demanding immediate actions arrived at all hours, at weekends and during holidays. Her head of department came into her year 11 lesson and announced to the students that if they failed, it would be Sylvia she blamed. The principal never once spoke to her. When she spent hours putting up a beautiful display of student poetry, she was told she’d used the wrong colours and it had to be taken down immediately. Sylvia ended up having a breakdown and quit.It also happens to headteachers. When Rob’s mum died, within six hours of her death his chair of governors had emailed three times wanting to know when he’d be back and whether he could finish the report he was writing by the next day.By the time of his mum’s funeral a week later, the chair had phoned 17 times and sent 50 emails, not one offering condolences. It was the last straw after years in a toxic academy trust. Rob walked away from a school where he was dearly needed.Does this matter to you? And if it does, what are the signs?Look carefully when you visit. Are the senior leadership team visible? Are they talking to children and parents? Are they talking to teacher colleagues, or keeping to themselves in a huddle? How do the teachers interact with one another around the building – do they seem respectful, happy and positive? Don’t necessarily dismiss schools where teachers look tired – teachers are nearly always tired and the back-to-school bugs will have hit.I’ve heard that triple marking helps children. Do you do that here?Triple marking – or excessively remarking work – does not lead to better outcomes but is an indicator of excessive workload expectations.How often will I see marking in my child’s books? Although we are conditioned into thinking lots of marking will improve outcomes, it is not the case. Regular feedback, much of which is oral, makes a difference. Many schools trying to reduce workload and improve teacher wellbeing have ditched written marking altogether.How often will I find out how my child is doing? It is reasonable to expect updates a couple of times a year and one or two parents’ evenings any more is an indicator of excessive workload.Are there many new staff this year? Sometimes schools may need staff turnover to keep things fresh, and it is sometimes necessary to move on underperforming staff. However, a regular high turnover may indicate unhappy staff.What do you do on Inset days? This may provide an insight as to how valuable the staff find the professional development on offer. Are Inset days used to lecture them and berate them about results? Or do they get time simply to get themselves organised? With what kind of enthusiasm do they speak about their experiences?I work long hours so I might have to email you at about 8pm – when would you be able to respond? Don’t expect responses immediately – within 24 working hours is fine. Lots of schools are encouraging staff to remove work email from their devices and set time limits during evenings and weekends.What do you think about the head’s vision? Staff who feel involved in a shared mission tend to be happier. Teachers completely at odds with the direction of the school are unlikely to feel settled, involved and happy.How long have you worked here? Are you likely to stay for long? Whether a teacher has just joined or been employed for years, the way in which each inidual responds will give you an impression about whether they feel as if they belong and are looked after. The caveat is that even after 30 years of experience, I’m not sure I could walk through the door of a different school and be able to identify whether it was toxic or not. Adopting the air of a concerned but unknowledgable innocent can disarm those you speak to. Bear in mind, though, that even if their responses raise a red flag, the school may still be a happy place to work. You may never know."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f86e1d570f91a9494a487aedc7dff865a8bc8ce/0_236_4066_2440/master/4066.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5ffafaf321421da5d6292ae081c68d5","title":"un climate summit 2019 why it matters","story":"With Trump expected to skip the UN climate summit, the question will be: what’s possible if the most powerful nation is pulling away from action?This story originally appeared in the Nation. It is republished here as part of the ’s partnership with Covering Climate Now, a global collaboration of more than 250 news outlets to strengthen coverage of the climate story.As world leaders converge on New York City for the United Nations climate action Summit on 23 September, they enter what may be the most consequential week in climate politics since Donald Trump’s surprise election as president of the United States in 2016. Trump, of course, announced soon after taking office that he was withdrawing the US from the Paris agreement, the landmark treaty signed at the last big UN climate summit in 2015. António Guterres, the UN secretary general, convened this week’s summit precisely because the US and most other countries remain far from honoring their Paris pledges to reduce heat-trapping emissions enough to prevent catastrophic climate disruption.The events of the coming days – including a global climate strike on 20 September by the activists whose protests in the past year have pushed the term “climate emergency” into news reports around the world – may help answer a question that has loomed over humanity since Trump’s election: can the rest of the world save itself from climate breakdown if the richest, most powerful nation on earth is pulling in the opposite direction?Adopted in December 2015, the Paris agreement stands as the strongest achievement of climate diplomacy since governments first debated the issue at the UN Earth Summit in 1992. In a shock to climate insiders, the agreement not only committed signatory governments to limit temperature rise to the relatively less dangerous level of 2C. It also obliged governments to keep temperature rise “well below” 2C and, in a major victory for the most vulnerable countries, to strive for 1.5C. That half-degree may not sound like much, but it spells the difference between life and death for low-lying coastal nations such as Bangladesh and island states such as the Males – two of many places that, science says, would literally disappear beneath the waves with more than 1.5C of warming.Trump is not expected to attend this week’s summit the US delegation will instead be led by Andrew Wheeler, a former coal company lobbyist who is now the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. In keeping with Trump’s denial of climate science and his administration’s dismantling of environmental regulations and accelerating of fossil fuel development, Wheeler testified to the US Senate last January that he would not call climate change “the greatest crisis” facing humanity.Which highlights a question that may shape whether this summit turns out to be a success, a failure, or something in between. What role will the US play? Will it be a spoiler, actively seeking to disrupt progress? Will it be a braggart who, as Wheeler boasted (inaccurately) in that testimony, represents “the gold standard for environmental progress”? Or will it be more like the addled uncle at the family reunion whose babblings provoke eye-rolls and are ignored?“Don’t bring a speech, bring a plan!” For months now, that’s what Guterres has been telling heads of state and government. Instead of the endless blah-blah-blah heard at most UN meetings, Guterres wants this summit to be more like “show-and-tell”, a meeting where governments share concrete and replicable examples of how they are cutting emissions and boosting resilience to the climate impacts already unfolding. As such, the summit aims to address a glaring deficiency of the Paris agreement. In part, because the agreement made emissions cuts voluntary, global emissions have continued to increase since 2015. On current trends, the earth is heading towards 3-5C of temperature rise – enough, scientists warn, to destroy civilization as we know it.Asked how the world can meet the “well below 2C” target when the current US government is doing all it can to increase global warming, Alba, a career diplomat from Mexico, steered clear of criticizing the Trump administration. “We need higher political will not only in one country but in a number of them,” he said, before adding: “We’re very much impressed by what states, cities and businesses are doing in the US to move into renewables … We are quite confident that the US will contribute to solutions, even if the decision to withdraw by the current administration is maintained.”China, the other climate superpower along with the US, will therefore have to do better as well. China won plaudits in the lead-up to the Paris summit in 2015 by closing many of its coal-fired power plants. But coal burning in China has recently crept back up, and Beijing has also financed construction of coal plants in other countries, particularly in support of its massive “Belt and Road” initiative to construct ports, railways and other infrastructure across Asia to the Middle East, Africa and Europe. Alba commends China for promising to go beyond the emissions reductions it pledged in Paris, but he adds, “We are asking them to do much more and in particular to green the Belt and Road initiative. It’s quite important because of the scale of that initiative that they do not support coal plants but instead renewable energy.”When Guterres gavels the summit’s plenary session to order next Monday, the 12-year deadline outlined by the IPCC scientists will have shrunk closer to 11. Meanwhile, the burning of the Amazon, Hurricane Dorian’s devastation of the Bahamas, this summer’s heatwaves across much of the northern hemisphere, and countless less-heralded disasters illustrate that climate disruption is no longer a worrisome future specter but a punishing current reality.Alba nevertheless draws hope from the heightened public concern and activism against the climate threat. “Compared to 10 years ago, the level of public involvement is very different,” Alba said, “and that’s to a large extent because the news media is talking about it more and young activists are demanding action.”In the United States, activists with the Sunrise Movement and other groups have protested against Democratic and Republican politicians alike and demanded that the government implement a Green New Deal. Championed by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive congresswoman from New York, and modeled on the New Deal jobs and investment programs President Franklin Roosevelt implemented to pull the US out of the Great Depression in the 1930s, the Green New Deal calls for the government to kickstart the transformations of energy and other sectors the IPCC says are needed. Such a massive investment program will also, the activists say, create millions of jobs and reduce economic inequality. Central to the plan is “climate justice”, the notion that poor and non-white iniduals and communities have suffered worst from climate change and therefore should get precedence for the jobs and opportunities flowing from a Green New Deal.Activist pressure has helped make the Green New Deal the de facto position of the Democratic party in the US, while also spreading the idea overseas. Each of the leading Democratic candidates in the race to replace Trump has endorsed one version or another of a Green New Deal. Bernie Sanders proposes a particularly robust program that will, he promises, “end unemployment” by creating 20m new jobs and also help developing nations dump fossil fuels in favor of renewables.Guterres has gone out of his way to boost the visibility of the climate youth, most notably Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teenager who is the best-known face of the climate movement. Thunberg’s “School Strike For Climate”, begun a year ago in her home town of Stockholm, spread like wildfire around the world, inspiring hundreds of thousands of students to skip classes and take to the streets to demand that governments, in Thunberg’s words, “act like the house is on fire – because it is”. Guterres has invited Thunberg to keynote a special one-day youth climate summit on 21 September and also to address world leaders at the plenary session on 23 September.Alba recognizes that the public is sometimes skeptical of UN conferences, and he acknowledges that the UN “does not have the means to enforce” the commitments made by governments in the Paris agreement. Instead, he puts his faith, again, in the ability of public pressure to compel governments to do the right thing. “As in many other parts of international law,” he says, “the enforcement rests in the follow-up and the ‘name and shame’ role of civil society – to expose that a country is not complying with what they’ve committed to. The media plays an important role there, and so do activists.”Meanwhile, Alba’s own teenage son has given him advice on how to make the case for action: don’t talk so much about the future that youth will inherit but rather about the climate disasters happening now. “He had a point,” says Alba. “This is an emergency we need to deal with today, not tomorrow. Talking about 2030 and 2050 is important because science gives us those dates for achieving certain objectives, but there’s the danger that it tells people that we have time to make these changes. And that is a mistake.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0fcbcedf1f283e34874f02ceeb1f7b72f13eddc1/0_50_3504_2103/master/3504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=186a5aae9e9dbd179b2ef5fedc84670e","title":"i thought it was basically amazing readers pick of the best movies since 2000","story":"From No Country for Old Men to Paddington 2,  readers on the best films of the 21st century so far•Read what the ’s film critics opted for•Film-makers choose their No 1•Peter Bradshaw on why our No 1 is our No 1‘It reminds me how hard it is to leave the relative certainties of childhood’: Amanda, 57, SpainIt is an extraordinary, visceral depiction of the growth to awareness of a young girl, on the cusp of adolescence caught up in a savage world where not even retreat into fantasy can provide a moral framework. There are, of course, many coming of age films but none, I think, as poetic and haunting as this. It was the first film my eldest son took me to see and at 18 he was just emerging out of the chaos of adolescence meanwhile his two younger brothers were still in the labyrinth... with some years to go. As a mother and a teacher no other film has come close to reminding me how hard it is to leave, or be forced to leave, the relative certainties of childhood and form your own moral code in an adult world beset by compromises.‘I expected to see it in the top 10’: skoolboyerrorI expected to see The Lives of Others and Pan’s Labyrinth in the top 10.

The greatest and most poignant last line of any film ever. cwisemanNo Country for Old Men was better than There Will Be Blood in 2007 and still is. It’s more exciting, but underneath that, it’s about how our society’s changing structure has gradually but steadily rewarded the behaviour of psychopaths, and punished the behaviour of the socially motivated. That’s not an over deep reading of the film. That’s what Tommy Lee Jones actually discusses in voiceover. This encroaching darkness he can’t understand, compared to his father’s experiences in the same job. It’s fantastic in every way, right up to its abrupt end with a random car accident. It’s clearly the best film of this century so far, it’s Kubrickianly good. Better than most of the Kubricks actually, it’s close to perfect.Paddington 2 is perfect. A solid simple story, with every little throwaway joke actually a set up for something bigger later on. All the cast are on point and it has a superb ending that finishes at exactly the right point. It commits to its emotional moments without the need to undercut with a sarcastic jibe or punchline. Basically it’s amazing and if you aren’t moved by that final shot you’re basically dead inside. I wish my kids watched it more often and that is something no parent says about any familykids film ever.‘I thought it was amazing’: Laoi Primorac Ó MurchúIt was the weekend of the Spurs West Ham FA Cup match (if League or League Cup please shout).

Okay, whatever, off we went, me and my blonde bombshell. I thought it was amazing, still do. She said it was the most stupid movie ever. I missed the Hammers in action for that sort of reaction? I knew then it was not to be.Son of Saul for me. I took twice the length of the film to watch it, paused it often to breathe. It’s a film I wouldn’t watch in a cinema, I had to watch it privately.

The appearance of the little boy and the only smile in the film, half smile, slight smile, made it OK for the man to die. It’s not my right to be thankful that people died so maybe I took the cowardly way out by being something akin to relieved that I didn’t have to see, think and feel anymore.‘It covers every emotion I want in a film’: bcdcdudeWhen thinking of my best films of this decade (I have yet to work out the best between 2000 and 2009), it was a three-way tie between The Tree of Life, Our Little Sister (by Shoplifters director Hirokazu Kore-eda) and Your Name. I’ve decided to go for Your Name, for the simple reason that it covers almost every emotion I want in a film joy, wonder, sadness, curiosity, longing, loving and the sheer thrill of being alive to watch something so amazing. I’ve watched it three times and each time, it makes me cry. Very few films have ever done that, but to make me cry with simultaneous joy and sadness is a very rare feat.‘Funny and tragic’: ID4460697Great list, but my top winge is the omission of Timbuktu. Against a stunning landscape and the old city, the Taliban enforce their version of Islam on tolerant ancient local Muslim culture. Some really cinematic acts of defiance the boys show such as forbidden to play football they play with an imaginary ball. A woman stately as a queen, her bright African prints trailing the dirt owns the street in her defiance of sharia fashion. Funny and tragic.‘I can watch this over and over again’: Cheryl, 60, LeedsI love this film because it is so multi layered. On the surface is the intriguing situation of the main players in the hospital where they are being treated, Roy, the paralysed stuntman who is clearly seeing his life unravel after a life changing accident on a film set and young Alexandria, the little girl who has broken her arm and initially seems to be the silent narrator as the film unfolds as observed by her. The relationship that develops between them provides a growing emotional tension as he begins to narrate a fairy tale for her in exchange for her collusion in helping him procure the drugs he needs to end his life. The film sets, colour and imagery in this film make it something I can watch over and over again alongside the superb acting of the key characters.‘A tremendous performance from the late Bruno Ganz’: Heather, 38, LondonIt’s a controversial choice, but I love 20th century history, so this biopic of Hitler’s last days in the bunker is a film that has stayed with me over the years. It’s a great film, with a tremendous, underrated performance from the late Bruno Ganz. It is both fascinating, horrifying and tragic. And, of course, it’s the only film to have an afterlife as a YouTube meme, a specific 21st Century phenomenon, with that brilliant scene of Hitler realising the war is lost, being overdubbed with all sorts of daft stuff."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c38807eb44cf8eb9499c805fc706ee9ded1abe1d/0_0_5481_3289/master/5481.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d6531695eab9eb3f1e5b0d599f8457d","title":"muscadet lambrusco great 1970s wine revival","story":"Lambrusco, muscadet, Bull’s Blood: after years of neglect, some wines have returned as retro-vintage starsWhatever happened to the bestselling wines of the 1970s and 80s? Some, happily, are no longer with us or have been banished to the dustiest reaches of the corner shop, brands such as Hirondelle, Lutomer Laski Riesling, or Le Piat d’Or, that neither we nor the French adore any more.Others, remodelled, repackaged, occasionally even drinkable, are still slogging it out in the pitiless commercial battlefield of a supermarket near you: Mateus Rosé, Black Tower, Blue Nun.More interesting are the regional appellations that after years of neglect, critical disdain and flatlining sales, have returned as something else entirely. Regions that have gone from cult to own-label mainstream favourite to beyond the pale and back again. The paradigm of the retro-vintage comeback king is beaujolais. The vignerons of the gamay-producing area north of Lyon once sold millions of bottles of nouveau, that bubblegum-and-banana-scented young red bottled within a couple of months of vintage. But after the 1990s, sales collapsed, their reputation for quality in tatters. It’s taken plenty of angsty reflection and, in many cases, financial struggle, but thanks to its cluster of adventurous small producers and its ability to provide the sort of light, fresh red wines that work so well by the glass, beaujolais – even nouveau, from the right producer – has become a must-list for a certain kind of modern wine bar and small-plate restaurant.Muscadet, typecast as a cheap and cheerful partner for seafood, was washed away by the fruit-rich new wines of the New World, its complacent producers having cashed in with enormous quantities of sub-standard, brand-damaging acid water. Again, it’s taken a while, but a hardcore of small producers around the Loire estuary have been chiselling out a reputation for dry whites on a par with chablis.Other regions to have thrown off the 1970s kitsch include: Vinho Verde from northern Portugal, whose whites can be thrillingly peachy and pure where once they tended to the insipid but tart the Veneto, home of trattoria staples white soave and red valpolicella, now responsible for some of Italy’s most elegant wines and the Rheinhessen, once all but synonymous with liebfraumilch, now reestablished as the site of great dry rieslings.But for the full nostalgia-tinted house, nothing beats lambrusco. Not as the sweetly gassy, £2.99 initiation rite for generations of teenagers and pre-loading clubbers, but in its original, gorgeously gastronomic form from Emilia-Romagna: a vivid, finger-staining, antipasti-partnering sparkling red.From a modern master of muscadet, this is a typically luminous dry white, tight and nervy with a dash of salt and zesty citrus and a savoury palate. Perfect for shellfish, and at a price that puts comparable white burgundy to shame.If you grew up on the wince-making acid, prickly spritz and lemony sweetness of old-style supermarket own-label vinho verde, you’d scarcely believe this pristine, racy, floral, citrus and exotic-fruit-scented white came from the same region.There is still plenty of pallid soda-pop-like lambrusco (and, indeed, its perry-based imitator, lambrini) around. But this is the real thing: an intensely dark cherry-fruited sparkling red with salami-matching grip, and a moreish tangy dry finish.The 1980s was the beginning of the end of sherry’s imperial period as a bestselling wine. Now even the fustiest of styles, cream, such as the suavely sweet fruitcakey Solera 1847, is back on the smartest restaurant lists.Before Aussie shiraz and Argentinian malbec, the “bull’s blood” red wines of Eger in Hungary provided British drinkers of the 1970s and 80s with their big red needs. This modern version is a cut above: a deep, spicy, plummy partner for autumnal stews.Alexandre Burguad’s delightful young wine is a far cry from the banana-bubblegum beaujolais nouveau of folk memory: it’s exuberantly fresh, crunchy, currant-fruity and aromatic with a moreishly sappy, charcuterie-friendly freshness.

In his 2009 autobiography he explained that he learned the value of patience from his parents, both of whom worked on farms. “What you sowed, you reaped a year later,” he wrote. “There was no instant gratification.”A successful harvest is required eventually, though, to keep your family fed. Ancelotti inherited a Napoli team in the summer of 2018 that was coming off a record-setting Serie A campaign, in which it collected 91 points but still finished as runner-up to Juventus. In his first season he guided them to a further second-place finish as well as the quarter-finals of the Europa League and Coppa Italia.This season he expects more tangible success. “Second place is not enough any more,” he said in July. “We have to win something.”A domestic title remains Napoli’s prime objective. They have won Serie A only twice in their history, both times inspired by Diego Maradona. Yet the experience of two seasons ago has this group believing that Juventus can be usurped, especially in a season when the reigning champions are adapting to life under a new manager – Maurizio Sarri – with whom Napoli are intimately familiar.A Champions League run should also be a realistic goal for a team that beat Liverpool and drew twice with Paris Saint-Germain in the group stage last season, finishing behind the eventual champions only by virtue of goals scored. On paper Napoli look stronger than they were at this time last year. Ancelotti rated their summer transfer activity as a perfect 1010.Hirving Lozano was the headline addition: a quick-footed and versatile forward capable of filling in anywhere along the attacking line. Capped 37 times by Mexico, he scored the goal that sealed their World Cup win over Germany in 2018 and followed up with 22 more for PSV last season – including Champions League strikes against Tottenham and Internazionale.The capture of Kostas Manolas from Roma, too, was a coup, one of Serie A’s better centre-backs arriving to form a partnership with Kalidou Koulibaly, Serie A’s best centre-back. Fernando Llorente was a useful addition on a free transfer, while the teenage midfielder Eljif Elmas came billed as a blend of Luka Modric and Gennaro Gattuso.It is too early to assess the impact of any of these players. Lozano has made an encouraging start, marking his debut with a goal off the bench against Juventus. Llorente served Dries Mertens with an assist during Sunday’s win over Sampdoria.At the back integration has gone a little less smoothly. Koulibaly and Manolas started Napoli’s first two league games together, and the team conceded seven goals. Nikola Maksimovic replaced the new arrival for Sunday’s clean sheet against Sampdoria. Ancelotti insisted afterwards that he plans to use all three as part of a regular rotation policy.Only the manager can know what selection he has in mind for Tuesday’s visit of Liverpool. It was against the same opponents last year that he pulled one of his more surprising tactical gambits, deploying Maksimovic – a centre-back – on the right of a back four. It seemed bold to deprive his team of a pacier option to counter Sadio Mané, but paid idends in a deserved 1-0 win.In truth, as became apparent over the course of the season, Ancelotti’s conception of a back four at Napoli is fluid. His team typically lines up in a classic 4-4-2 but in possession the idea is for at least one of the full-backs to push forward, often both.At the same time the wingers may move up to occupy space between midfield and attack. At their most aggressive Napoli seek to split this section of the pitch into quarters, with one striker dropping deep and either a central midfielder stepping up or a full-back advancing even further than he normally would so that a winger can move inside. In practice it can look something like a 2-3-4-1.The idea is to defend on the front foot, retaining possession as much as possible and pressing high with compact lines when it is lost. The risk lies in the transitions. Koulibaly has been uncharacteristically poor so far this season but in theory he and Manolas are well suited to Ancelotti’s approach: both have the pace to prevent teams from breaking with a quick ball over the top.Even at their best, however, these are not superheroes. If the team overcommits when attacking, as it did for Danilo’s opening goal against Juventus, the spaces can become impossible to cover. That will be even more true against the speed of Mané and Mohamed Salah.As Ancelotti demonstrated during last season’s encounters, however, he is unafraid to tailor his gameplan to an opponent. The notional 4-4-2 is likely to endure but both the interpretation and the players used against Liverpool may be something we have not seen before.That goes for the attack as well as the defence. Mertens has started the season in fine form, with three goals in three games, and is now only three shy of matching Maradona’s haul of 115 strikes in seven seasons at the club (Marek Hamsik is the club’s all-time record-holder with 121.) But even Mertens is not guaranteed a place against Liverpool. There is the option to go for a more physical approach with Llorente and Milik.“Liverpool are the favourites, they are champions of Europe,” said Ancelotti. “They have gained greater confidence and have grown even further since we last met. But Napoli have made steps forward as well.”He has tended patiently to his crop over the past 12 months. The moment is approaching, Ancelotti hopes, to reap a bountiful harvest."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0825b1ba914e132a7caf5901bee4ec5aae239d86/188_0_5640_3384/master/5640.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c534ea50f28dfa889e10a034799b0e94","title":"gaming metoo moment harassment women in games","story":"Workplace harassment was high on the agenda at the Women in Games European Conference, following a spate of allegationsSome say it is long overdue, some doubted victims would be ready to speak out, but now #MeToo has very much arrived in the video games industry. Last month, game developer Nathalie Lawhead posted to their website, accusing video game soundtrack composer Jeremy Soule of raping them while the two worked together at an unnamed Vancouver-based development studio. Soule has denied the accusation. Within days, another developer, Zoë Quinn, alleged on Twitter to have suffered abuse and harassment from Alec Holowka, co-creator of award-winning game, Night in the Woods. Holowka was found dead days after the allegations were made.These instances were followed by further accounts of sexual harassment from other developers within the games industry, some detailing extended periods of emotional manipulation and abuse by senior colleagues. The Time’s Up campaign group that fights sexual harassment called the actions described within the posts as “disturbing” and suggested these revelations ought to be a moment of reckoning for the industry.Last week, during the Women in Games European Conference, hosted at the University of the Arts London, Marie-Claire Isaaman, CEO of Women in Games, made the point of addressing the recent allegations in her keynote speech. “In the last few weeks, sadly, we have experienced a games #MeToo moment,” she told the 350 attendees. “After GamerGate in 2014 and a lack of resolution from that intensive moment, I sensed another wave would come.”Senior women in the games industry took the opportunity afforded by the two-day conference to discuss workplace abuse and the wider issue of toxicity in gaming culture and to share positive examples of how to move forward.What emerged was recognition of the problem and a determination not to allow gaming’s #MeToo moment to be just that: a moment. “I believe everyone who has come forward so far and I am generally inclined to believe anyone who has the courage to come forward and speak their truth about being harassed or abused by those exploiting a power balance over them,” said Jess Hyland of Wonderstruck Games. “I do think this industry has a problem with abuse, both sexual abuse and abusive working conditions, and I think it all stems from unhealthy and unaccountable power structures that give abusers so many chances to duck out of responsibility. Victims deserve better.”The constant message throughout the Women in Games panels was that education is key, not just in the workplace, but much earlier, in a school setting. “We work with schools and educational institutions all the way from playground to them coming into the industry,” said Emma Smith, head of talent at UK developer, Creative Assembly, which has set up its Legacy Project to tackle representation. “We talk to girls people and from BAME backgrounds, basically anyone who feels like they are not represented in games to encourage them to have that self-confidence in who they are and what they can bring to the table and make that unshakable no matter what.”This insistence of support from an early age fostered by big studios is slowly starting to reap real world benefits as seen in the erse demographic of last year’s LCC BA Games Design cohort where a third of recent graduates were women, many going on to studio positions. Larra Anderson, dean of screen at the London College of Communication and host of the conference, also spoke of her commitment to ersifying the creative industries. Pauline Martyn, a 2019 graduate, is now a junior narrative designer at Ubisoft Reflections.One theme throughout the conference was that the culture of game studios, which are still largely dominated by men, must change. “Studio leaders model the behaviour that becomes the norm,” said Marianne Monaghan, lead cross site producer for Hanger 13. “If all the leaders are men, if they joke about women in demeaning ways or treat women in a disrespectful way, no amount of HR training will undo that damage. I’m very fortunate to work in a studio with leaders committed to ersity and respect.“I hope, I believe, we’re moving in that direction as an industry but there are still big differences among different studios. I advise women to ‘interview the interviewers’ and observe studio culture when you visit offices. I don’t work in studios that have an aroma of fear or an excess of alpha males. Not everyone is in a position to be picky, but choose assignments as carefully as you can.”Retention of gaming studio positions by female employees is key, so educators are not just funnelling women into the metaphorical meat grinder of the games industry. Having support and empathy from the highest levels within a studio is essential for survival. “At Bossa Studios, the best thing that happened to us is that I am a co-founder and I am a woman and I’m an immigrant and I’m also a computer scientist,” said Roberta Lucca, who is also branding chief at the London developer. “I tick so many boxes that helps us at the very top level, pushing the right ersity and inclusion topics and I am very passionate about that. I act on things that I see on the day to day … if something doesn’t feel right I would just say something and this goes back to how we develop games. We made a statement with Worlds Adrift in 2017, as our first character was a woman.”Once in the studio, the way that games are created is vital in fostering more erse gaming communities. “The industry encompasses far more genres and platforms than when I joined 20 years ago,” said Anna Marsh, a producer at Dambuster Studios. “We have mobile, free to play, indie, PC, there are so many more sorts of games which is leading to a much higher ersity of players. This has definitely led to me seeing much more ersity of people within the industry.”During the conference there was still a palpable reticence by less experienced developers to comment on the record explicitly about gaming’s #MeToo accusations. Anisa Sanusi, a UIUX designer recently voted one of the top 100 women in games by industry publication Games Industry Biz, suggested that being able to anonymously report on incidences of abuse or harassment in a studio can be a key tool for supporting women. “Anonymity is important,” she said. “Often you want to mention the issue but you don’t want to out yourself because personal safety is a big issue. There is a need to have channels in place for women to voice concerns or complaints where they know they are safe. There’s a lot of software out there for employers allowing them to get anonymous feedback from employees. Allies are as important as fighters in this huge battle of equality.”Government policy makers are now actively engaging with the games industry. The ongoing Consultation on Sexual Harassment in the Workplace evidences a positive executive approach which looks to strengthen law in this area. The DCMS report published last week on addictive and immersive technologies was explicit in its criticism and indictment of some companies in its final recommendation. “What we have heard about the games industry’s attempts to tackle the gender imbalance in the workforce echoes its approach to understanding and tackling the potential harms of its games on players: while some take their responsibilities seriously, others could be doing much more.”Early in the conference, a talk by two of the creators behind Bafta-winning mobile game My Child Lebensborn, struck a chord with many of the delegates. “I would dearly wish for the gamedev industry as a whole to create a common set of guidelines to be used by all – setting out how we can all build an industry based on creativity and respect, giving equal opportunities,” said producer, Elin Festøy. “That would help women to feel more secure in the industry. It would clearly state that this is not a women’s problem, but a problem for all. This isn’t a topic just for single game studios, although they also really need to take #MeToo to heart, but about creating a respectful culture for the whole industry.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4025d6646decdda1fc6c18ca64a836da7d464af0/0_902_4016_2410/master/4016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1c5b33c04f641d55ab6d29d859d7de9","title":"healing crystals wellness mining madagascar","story":"Demand for ‘healing’ crystals is soaring – but many are mined in deadly conditions in one of the world’s poorest countries. And there is little evidence that this billion-dollar industry is cleaning up its act. In February, crystals colonised Tucson. They spread out over carparks and gravel lots, motel courtyards and freeway footpaths, past strip malls and burger bars. Beneath tents and canopies, on block after block, rested every kind of stone imaginable: the opaque, soapy pastels of angeline dark, mossy-toned epidote tourmaline streaked with red and green. There were enormous, dining-table-sized pieces selling for tens of thousands of dollars, lumps of rose quartz for $100, crystal eggs for $1.50. Crystals were stacked upon crystals, filling plastic trays, carved into every possible shape: knives, penises, bathtubs, angels, birds of paradise.It was the month of the Tucson gem shows, a series of markets and exhibitions that collectively make up the largest crystal expo in the world. More than 4,000 crystal, mineral and gemstone vendors had come to sell their wares. They were expecting more than 50,000 customers to pass through, from new age enthusiasts with thick dreadlocks and tie-dye T-shirts, to gallery owners, suited businessmen and major wholesalers. Deals done here would determine the fate of tens of thousands of tonnes of crystals, dispatching them across the US and Europe into museums and galleries, crystal healing and yoga centres, wellness retailers and Etsy stores.Five years ago, crystals were not a big deal. Now, powered by the lucrative combination of social media-friendly aesthetics, cosmic spirituality and the apparently unstoppable wellness juggernaut, they have gone from a niche oddity associated with patchouli and crushed velvet to a global consumer phenomenon. On Instagram, hashtags for #crystals and #healingcrystals tick into the tens of millions. In 2017, the New York Times heralded “the great crystal boom” and in 2018 Hello! described them as the year’s biggest health and wellness trend. Sold as lamps, sex toys, facial massagers or “vaginal eggs” hawked by Gwyneth Paltrow’s lifestyle empire Goop, there is now a crystal for every possible occasion. As Kim Kardashian was recovering from her robbery at gunpoint in 2016, she embraced healing crystals. The model Miranda Kerr has said that she filters all her skincare products through rose quartz “to give the vibration of self-love”.In the US, demand for overseas crystals and gemstones has doubled over the past three years, and quartz imports have doubled since 2014. (Those numbers capture raw stone, but not the crystals imported under many other categories: jewellery, home goods, decorations.) Daniel Trinchillo, owner of Fine Minerals International, a high-end crystal dealership, told me that his business makes between $30m and $40m in sales each year. Trinchillo caters to a growing cohort of celebrities, collectors and investment buyers who want rare and valuable crystals. The most expensive single piece he has sold went for $6m, but he knows of some that have sold for $10m. Trinchillo estimates that high-end dealers now account for about $500m in annual sales. Include the lower end, he said, and you are talking about a highly profitable, multi-billion dollar industry.Despite that explosive growth, the way the crystal industry operates has largely avoided close scrutiny. There is little in the way of fair-trade certification for crystals, and none of the industry-wide transparency schemes developed for commodities such as gold and diamonds. Tracing a crystal from the time it is dragged, dusty and cracked, from the earth, to the polished moment of final sale requires a journey backward down the supply chain: from shop, to exporter, to middleman, to mine, and finally to the men and women who work below the ground, on whose labour a billion-dollar industry has been built.If you want to know where the rose quartz on your shelves comes from, Anjoma Ramartina is a good place to begin. A collection of villages that sits atop some of Madagascar’s largest rose quartz deposits, it is a day’s drive from the capital city of Antananarivo. The further you travel from the capital, the greater the security risks. Large swathes of territory are described as “red zones”, considered unpoliceable by state forces. Rural villages often face raids from armed gangs known as dahalo, who steal cattle, sometimes killing, robbing or raping villagers. In January, the week we arrived in Anjoma Ramartina, three men armed with machetes were killed in a clash with village police. Do not travel or go out at night, people warned. Drive in convoy. Stay off the roads after 5pm.In a cool, dark room in the town council hall, Many Jean Rahandrinimaro, the deputy mayor of Anjoma Ramartina, sunk into a black vinyl couch. “Crystal, amethyst, rose quartz,” he said. “Everything except sapphires and rubies, we mine here.” He placed a few stones on the wooden table in front of him: polished clear quartz and purple amethyst. He estimated that from a population of about 10,000 people, up to a quarter of locals now depended on the mines for some income. Between two and four men died each year in the crystal pits surrounding this village, he said – only two last year, but often it was three or four. “Sometimes it’s very dangerous but they still mine, because they want money,” he said. “There’s the possibility of landslide, that happens a lot here. The soil falls on them and they die.”Landslides are not the only danger for miners. Smashed rocks create fine dust and quartz particles can penetrate deep into the lungs. There, they fester, inflaming surrounding cells, increasing the risk of lung cancer and silicosis. Child labour is also widespread: the US Department of Labor and the International Labour Organization estimate that about 85,000 children work in Madagascar’s mines.A few days after our first meeting, I returned to the town hall. In a ruled exercise book, Many Jean traced a finger over the town’s registry of deaths, tapping entries on the page: here and here, the two men who died in the mines last year, recorded in neat cursive handwriting. And here, Benoit Razafimahatratra, who had died two years earlier when he was looking for quartz at a quarry to the east. Many Jean knew where Benoit’s family lived, and offered to show the way on his motorbike.Bomber jacket flapping behind him, Many Jean took us to the next village. Sitting in a small shop that sold fritters and dried fish was Jean Gregoire Randrianarisoa. He looked tired. Yes, his older brother had died, he said. “What killed him was digging for stones, about 15 metres deep. He went into a tunnel and it collapsed from above and he was buried – someone called for help: ‘Help! Zafimahatratra is buried down there!’ That’s when I went with his children to dig him up,” he said.Benoit was about 55 when he died, said his widow, Josephine Rasondrina, a tiny woman, less than 5 feet tall, with hair neatly ided into braids. She brought out a photograph of him. His features had faded. Josephine gestured at her two granddaughters, about six or seven years old, sitting on the steps. “Since my husband died, they stopped going to school. Since my husband died I got really tired.” She raised her fingers to her temple. “I am really tired. Emotionally and physically – because I have to work the field to feed my children.”Common crystals, such as quartz, can form almost anywhere around the world, when water and steam carry mineral particles into fractures in the earth. Drawn together by the mutual attraction of their electrical charges, their molecules stack in orderly sequences, forming defined planes and repeating facets that can create the pleasing shapes – geodes, prisms – that they’re sought for. In the mineral-rich earth of central Madagascar, villagers often find quartz and citrine deposits by chance, when they are revealed by landslide or washed down to nearby riverbeds. The mines dug to meet growing demand are often improvised, operated off the books and without permits.One of these makeshift mines lies about an 18-mile hike from Anjoma Ramartina’s nearest road. Rakotondrasolo, the man who villagers called the mine owner, found the site about 20 years ago, and continues to work there, along with his family, to this day. One morning, he agreed to show me the mine. Rakotondrasolo is tall and very thin. His worn flannel shirt was buttoned over a T-shirt with the face of Andry Rajoelina, Madagascar’s newly elected president. (The T-shirts were everywhere, after being thrown from trucks and doled out at political rallies across the country during the 2018 election campaign.) The red dust of the landscape had worked its way into the weave of his clothing until every garment was infused with terracotta orange.As we made our way along the red dirt track to the mine, the sun was directly above, shimmeringly hot. Here and there was a sparkle among the scrubby grass: hunks of pink crystal, scattered at the path’s edge. Walking behind Rakotondrasolo, his wife pointed: “The stones are beautiful,” she said quietly, “but the work is very hard.” Then the grass of the track ended sharply and the deep red cavern of the mine fell away in front of us. “Keep away from the edge,” said Rakotondrasolo, gesturing to where the ground was cracked and unstable. The pit dropped 15 metres deep, narrowing as it deepened. On the sheer face of rock were cross-hatched marks of spades and pickaxes. At the far side of the cavern, a huge pile of rose-coloured stones caught the sunlight. At the bottom, a passage disappeared, curving out of the light.“Be careful,” he said, as we trod over the edge of the crater, “the rocks are sharp.” Rose quartz cracked underfoot: jagged, gleaming, a little translucent, shining like the flesh of a fresh-filleted tuna. Later, he lifted a worn trouser leg to show the scars he had acquired from a lifetime of mining: on the right leg, where falling stones crushed his shin, and on the left where a sharp edge split the skin, requiring six stitches.At other times, this crater would have been busy with the sound of men at work – his sons and nephews, who would come to dig and then split the cost of stone they sold – but today it was silent except for Rakotondrasolo’s careful footsteps. They had stopped work: rains had been heavy, and they worried that the water made the cavern less stable. “I was afraid, and was afraid for my children because of this soil. It can collapse on them. I asked them to stop working here,” Rakotondrasolo said.He threw in a handful of gravel and it tumbled to the bottom. Of his 10 children, seven worked with him in the mine. The boys started at the age of about 14. When they find a thick seam of quartz they smash it out of the rock, then chain the pieces together. Some blocks are small, but others are 100kg or even 200kg. The miners drag the boulders out of the hole, sometimes five people hauling together, up on to the grass embankment and toward the hill where lorries come to load them.I asked where the crystals went from there. “To the ports,” Rakotondrasolo shrugged. He did not know. Somewhere overseas. A long time ago a client brought him a rose orb, cut and polished into a sphere, to show him what eventually became of some of the stones he had mined. But the buyers mostly say little about what the crystals are used for or where they end up. They pay him and leave – about 800 ariary, or 23¢ a kilo, he said – 17¢ for lower quality. It is not much when the money is split between the men at work: 800 ariary buys a cup of rice at the village market.As Rakotondrasolo stepped away from the crater, a low hiss sounded behind him. We turned back to see a thin layer of red gravel, loosened from the wall, slide down into the hole.While some mines are large, open pits, others are claustrophobically small: networks of tunnels piercing the earth. About 120 miles east of Anjoma Ramartina lies Ibity, a small village surrounded by tourmaline mines, where you have to dig deep to find stones.“The deeper you go, the more difficult it is to breathe,” said Italy Miliama, a shopkeeper at the centre of the village, scooping coffee into enamel cups.“Once you see a stone, you follow it to find the other stones,” said one of his friends. “We dig, dig, dig. We call it the stone way, the way of stones.”The mines at Ibity spread out like an ochre moonscape. On the morning I visited, about 20 people were above ground sifting through the soil. Among them, a local miner named Jean Baptiste Rakotondravelo and his son stood barefoot, turning a large, improvised pulley. Their backs strained against the weight. A moment later, up came a large yellow jerrycan, full of red earth from below. Jean Baptiste’s son carried it to his mother and young siblings and dumped it on a pile of dirt that they sifted with their fingers. The day was hot, the sun nearing its peak. “It’s extremely hard work,” Jean Baptiste said. “It can’t be done by a few people. It has to be done by many.”At his feet was a hole about a metre in diameter, with sheer sides like a well. Shining my torch down the hole, I couldn’t see to the bottom. Every so often a faint shout echoed up from the darkness, and Jean Baptiste and his son put their backs again to pulling up the bucket. His other sons were working down there, Jean Baptiste told me, digging for tourmaline. He shrugged: “Go down if you like.”Near the top of the hole, it was possible to make out mosquitoes catching the light. As they turned the pulley and I descended, gripping the rope with both hands, the light retreated. The passage down was tight, the damp earth walls grazing my back, elbows and knees. Reaching the bottom, the air felt thin and it was a little harder to draw a full breath. On one side, there was a small horizontal tunnel with room only to crawl.I crouched and shouted into the darkness. “Salama!” two young voices called back, and deep in the tunnel, pair of dim headlamps turned to face me. Two boys blinked into the torchlight. The smallest wore a yellow cloth baseball cap, and his eyes were wide, mouth slightly open with surprise. Their names were Roland and Tavita: Jean Baptiste’s sons, who he says are about 14 and 17. They started working down here two years ago, spending hours digging underground, crouching in the dark, backs curved, calves aching.Deep underground, we looked mutely at each other for a moment. Ducking into the crawl-space, I was conscious of the weight of dirt resting above us: about 19 tonnes of soil and rock, suspended only by its own natural cohesion. Roland and Tavita squatted, jamming a spade or crowbar into the soil to dislodge it and pack it into the jerrycan. When it was full they would crawl back toward the light, shoving the heavy dirt bucket ahead of them, to be dragged up top.“When it’s too long they can have difficulty breathing, so they come out,” Jean Baptiste said, back at the top of the well. Above ground, the boys’ mother, Odette, sat working alongside two generations of children, the youngest a fat-cheeked six-month-old girl. Odette sifted through the dirt, searching for a rock shaped differently from the rest: the small, wine-red and green crystal, tourmaline. “Sometimes we go months without finding any,” she said. They had found just one today, about the size of a knuckle.Odette held it out to me, streaked with red dust, in the middle of her palm. At that moment, it was worth just a few cents. But in the months to come, it would slide along the global supply chain, its value multiplying with each stage of the journey.For the crystals mined in Anjoma Ramartina, the path out of the country is through a company called Madagascar Specimens, which exports about 65 tonnes of carved crystals a year. At its premises, a converted house in the outer suburbs of Antananarivo, boxes of crystals were stacked against the wall. A row of shining SUVs were parked outside the house. Samples stood on the disused fireplace: carved angels, pyramids, geodes, wands. The rose quartz had been trucked in rough from Anjoma Ramartina by a local middleman, the village’s former mayor, who bought large quantities from Rakotondrasolo’s mine.The owner of Madagascar Specimens, Liva Marc Rahdriaharisoa, a tall man in dark jeans, wire-rimmed glasses and a navy T-shirt, gestured to the stack of boxes to his left, packed for shipping. “This, for example, is going to Canada. This to Netherlands. This to the United States,” he said.He lifted the lid on a box of quartz massage wands. “These are very popular.” Then another box of rose quartz hearts: “Some of our best sellers,” he said. “Crystals are the most popular stones now – many customers are looking for it, because – I’m not sure of the English – the medicine with crystals is very popular now. Like therapy, the belief crystals have healing power, you know? It’s very – how do you say? – trendy.”The gem and mineral expo in Tucson was a key point in Liva Marc’s year. “That is where you’re looking for customers,” he said. “You see all customers from around the world: Chinese, Japanese, New Zealand, Australian. It is the biggest market in the world. We go there to exhibit, to sell, but most important is to find customers there.”Between the buyers in the US and the mines in Madagascar was a gulf of experience, which, sitting in the courtyard of Liva Marc’s small factory, he found hard to express. “It’s like two galaxies,” he said, grinning and shaking his head. “It’s a big difference. If I say to people at the mine what Tuscon is like, they will never understand. And if I say to the Tucson people to come here, they will never understand. It’s very different worlds.”Madagascar Specimens exports some crystals rough, but its workshop in Antananarivo also works the stones, cutting them into shapes, grinding and polishing the faces. From Liva Marc’s perspective, refining the stone in Madagascar means creating steady jobs and keeping more of the value of the crystals in the country. With stone that was exported rough and then carved in China or the US, almost none of the profit stayed in Madagascar.The plunder of Madagascar’s resources for profit is nothing new. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the country was a source of slaves, bought by Europeans and sent to work in brutal conditions, often on sugar plantations on the islands of Mauritius, Réunion and Rodrigues. When the French colonised Madagascar in 1895, they outlawed slavery, but ushered in a new era of forced labour and extraction, with tens of thousands of tonnes of rosewood and millions of francs’ worth of gold shipped offshore each year. More than a century later, the country’s riches still rarely benefit the Malagasy people, says Zo Andriamaro, a sociologist and human rights analyst. Gold, cobalt, sapphires, crystals: she sees them all as part of the same old story, resources siphoned out of the country for the benefit of foreign companies. “There has to be some more systematic way of controlling and regulating the market for all types of minerals coming from here,” she says. “It is totally unjust.”Mining also threatens Madagascar’s rainforest. When new mining sites are discovered, sometimes thousands of men migrate to mine, encroaching on protected environmental areas and threatening the survival of endangered species. Embracing mining on a larger scale is “intrinsically, fundamentally unsustainable and destructive”, Andriamaro says. “You can never pretend that you will restore the environment to its initial state.”The month after we spoke in Madagascar, Liva Marc and a shipping container full of his stones landed in Arizona, bound for the Tucson shows. I met him in a hotel lobby, one of three retail spots he had in the city. Business was good, he said. Buyers from all over the world had come.The stalls around him showcased towering display pieces: rose quartz boulders, massive amethyst geodes. They had been cleaned, polished and set on display, but he still looked at them and thought of their origins. “All these big pieces – imagine how they must dig it. How difficult it must be,” he said. “Imagine how it starts.”While the crystal business is booming, and largely among consumers who tend to be concerned with environmental impact, fair trade and good intentions, there is little sign of the kind of regulation that might improve conditions for those who mine them.Julia Schoen, co-founder of the crystal drink bottle company Glacce (tagline “Luxury Spiritual”) told me that ethical sourcing is “the No 1 priority” for her company. Schoen was speaking on the phone from her office in New Orleans, where she told me she was surrounded by crystals that had been unboxed and laid out, waiting to be blessed by staff, who would burn sage smudge sticks and pray to cleanse them before use.Glacce sells water bottles and metal straws embedded with rose quartz, amethyst and other crystals, which are supposed to transform ordinary water into a “crystal elixir”, where the water takes on the healing properties of the crystal. The bottles were touted by Vanity Fair as “2018’s Status Symbol” and are sold by bohemian-themed fashion retailer Free People, as well as Goop. Schoen said sales of the bottles, which retail for $60-$100, had increased exponentially since they started the business, and demand often outstripped supply.But even with a booming market, she said, the company didn’t yet have a budget to track their crystals to their source at the mines. Instead, Glacce depended on Chinese middlemen to select crystals, including those from Madagascar. Schoen told me that Glacce’s suppliers “know that we do not want to be having our money go towards a mine that’s using child labour. They know all these things.” At present, she said, they considered transparency a high priority and hoped to develop relationships with inidual mines by 2020, but could offer no concrete reassurances about the current conditions of their miners.“In an industry that has not been so regulated and maybe hasn’t had so many eyeballs on it, there are obviously practices that most people who are purchasing crystals would not want to know about,” Schoen acknowledged. “You know, at the end of the day it’s like, our intentions are – ” she paused. “I think we’re clear what our intentions are.”The challenge of sourcing crystals ethically is one faced by the industry as a whole: Glacce, Goop or any given Etsy vendor are no more culpable than the next crystal dealer. Every retailer I spoke to raised the question of price. Would crystal consumers really be willing to pay more to guarantee safer, child labour-free mines, or a fair wage for miners? Schoen compared it to the organic food movement: if enough people wanted assurance of their products’ provenance, the supply systems would develop.Bajoras visited Madagascar often, but rarely made it out to the mines, opting instead to deal with middlemen in the cities. But he knew the villages of Anjoma Ramartina and Ibity: “Yeah. All our rose quartz comes from that area. All the tourmaline comes from there,” he said.And if some of the conditions are truly awful? “Awful is relative, remember,” he shot back. The volume of his voice rose slightly, but he was still smiling. “Your job looks horrible to me. I feel for you. I’m glad that you’re willing to do it, because we need people like you to do it, but I ain’t fuckin’ doing it, no way. I would rather die in a mine, any day, no doubt. Holy shit. No. Not happening. Spell check? You’re out of your fucking mind.”Meanwhile, the $4.2tn wellness industry rolls on, bolstered by profits from cheap crystals and a generation looking for alternative modes of healing. Bajoras was confident his stones had healing power. After all, he said, if uranium could kill you, why shouldn’t lithium quartz be able to help cure your depression? And when you broke it down to an elemental level, he said, people are mostly minerals and water anyway. “You’re hydrated mineral powder,” he told me. “You are! You’re like Kool-Aid.”Beneath a tented canopy beside the Tucson freeway, his colleague Alexa Stamison was selling an array of Madagascan rose quartz, carnelian and amethyst. Stamison had a warm, open manner and an encyclopedic knowledge of their stones.A woman dressed all in white – crocheted shirt, maxi skirt and headscarf draped over her top-knot – approached the stall. “How much is this carnelian?” she asked. The stone was $30. A stone of empowerment, Stamison told me, great for women going out on their own or moving into a new home.“I think I need it, it was just calling to me and I couldn’t walk away,” the woman said. “I don’t need a bag, I’ll just carry it.” She walked away, cradling the stone.If anything, Stamison wonders if the circumstances of miners in Madagascar, “makes the pieces a lot more special. Because I know some person in a little baby hut was actually polishing it by hand, and they’re setting their intentions into it, too,” she said. “People’s intentions and people’s energy are put into the stones as they’re producing it.”“So the circumstances they’re mined in, they are embedded into the stone somehow?” I asked.“I think so. A little bit, it has to be. It has to be.”Additional research by Holifeno Hantanrinoro and Teddy Rahenintsoa• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4cbcaff683c3c5218597f6b165ad02c6b48592ef/0_349_6480_3888/master/6480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3e49f0371789f36b4e55df14f5517c6","title":"the rise of the proposal planner its not enough to get down on one knee any more","story":"When 36-year-old Justus Parmar decided to propose to his girlfriend, Elisia, he knew it had to be two things – “unforgettable and big”. Less than a week later, he flew Elisia from their home in Toronto, Canada, to the UK, where he proposed in a capsule of the London Eye. Their fellow passengers were an incognito musician, who performed their favourite song, Ed Sheeran’s Perfect, and extras who lined up to reveal T-shirts that read: “Will you marry me?” She said yes.The number of marriages in the UK may have been in decline since the 70s, with barely 240,000 couples tying the knot in 2016, but weddings are still big business, worth more than £10bn a year. With everything from e-commerce platforms such as Zola – which allows couples to plan their special day online and is valued at $650m (£520m) – to startups such as Bloomerent, which helps couples getting married in the same city reuse each others’ flowers, it is a rapidly expanding, tech-driven sector. And the latest innovation doesn’t even concern the wedding itself, but the proposal.For his lavish proposal – which cost £6,000 – Parmar hired London-based firm The Proposers. Founded in 2012, the company has so far organised more than 1,500 proposals all over the globe. “We were the first to set up proposal planning in the UK and it’s still a pretty new thing,” says the company’s founder, Daisy Amodio. “When we started we were doing one a week and now we’re doing six to 10.”Inspired by her experience of planning her brother’s engagement, Amodio noticed a gap in the market. “It’s been getting more and more popular recently, in tandem with the rise in social media,” she says. “People want epic photos or videos to show their friends or maybe their kids in the future. They don’t just want to get down on one knee at sunset on holiday. They want something bigger, they want a story to tell.”Her company’s most expensive proposal cost £800,000. “For that we hired all of Disneyland Paris we had fireworks and a boat go through Paris, too. The couple then hired a private jet to Canada and he popped the question in front of Niagara Falls,” Amodio says. That proposal took three months of planning, but Amodio says most are done in a matter of weeks. “We just had a call to do a proposal on Tower Bridge the next day,” she says. “It’s intense but we get it done.”For Parmar, the service was worth every penny. “I had bought this beautiful six-carat diamond ring and it started burning a hole in my pocket as I didn’t know how to go about the proposal,” he says. “I realised the end result would be a thousand times better if I worked with professionals. They kept it a total surprise – my fiancee had no idea it was coming.”“I was completely shocked,” Elisia says. “Looking back at the moment on camera, there’s this hilarious and surprised look on my face. I am a bit of a hopeless romantic. I had always dreamed of meeting the right guy who would create a unique proposal, and so it was creative and smart of Justus to plan the proposal professionally. Sometimes when you have a grand idea it takes more than one person to make it happen.”Others would rather keep their need for help a secret. Stephen (not his real name) decided he wanted to marry his girlfriend after only six months of dating, but he was unsure whether she would say yes. “I completely fell for her and I knew that if I didn’t ask her to marry me, I might lose her,” he says. “So I had to do something big to prove my love.” He recruited a planner in the US, where he lives, and they arranged for a proposal at the end of a hike, complete with a picnic and a banner asking the question. “She said yes and was so surprised and in awe of what I’d managed to do, I never told her that I’d had help. I wanted to enjoy the moment,” he says. He has no plans to tell her in the future.“Not all guys are creative,” says the South African proposal planner Pippa Lund. “We’re here to translate their romance into a reality. Then all they have to think about is getting down on one knee and what to say.”Planners witness a lot of proposals. So, have any of them ever seen a “no”? “The day someone says no is the day I quit,” Lund laughs. Others have had close calls. Rob Anderson, a magician who specialises in magic-trick proposals in Las Vegas, remembers: “There was a couple who were arguing and it got so bad that the guy called off the proposal discreetly with me just before I was about to perform. I’ve also had a couple break up the day before the proposal, and I’ve had at least one couple break up within a few hours of the proposal. But so far I’ve yet to have a straight no.”Even in places where proposals tend to be more modest, planning is taking off. Pailin Thipayarat, the founder of the Singaporean firm Lynx Proposals, started her business in 2014. “In the first year, there was no one,” she says. “People here would normally propose quietly over dinner or have their parents talk to one another and arrange the wedding that way.” But, with the rise of social media, western ideas began to seep through Singaporean culture. “This new generation is willing to spend on something that will give them an experience for the rest of their life,” Thipayarat says. “They want to catalogue their memories above all else.”Some traditions are slow to vanish, however: all the planners say their clientele is almost exclusively male. “The man asking the woman is ingrained in many traditions, and it’s something a lot of people like,” says Anderson. “Most women want the man to ask them and initiate the marriage.” Amodio agrees: “Only six women have approached us – only one to a man on a leap year, while the rest have been same-sex. I don’t know why more aren’t coming forward, but I’m holding out for a change.”The planners’ own proposals were noticeably more subdued than those of their clients. “We just went for a walk,” Lund recalls. “He set up a little surprise with champagne and my favourite food. It was perfect.” Amodio’s was a similarly private affair in the flat she shared with her boyfriend. “Some people just want something small and elegant, which we can provide, or they might want to do it all themselves,” she says. “And then we’ve had one guy who had to have everything be about cats, so we hired a cat cafe and they were all dressed as cats and even sang a song. We’ve had a fake drug arrest and a fake interview, too. Some people are crazy – but each to their own.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50d1ee19e68c0d5b5aab6c4d76dd8e69cfd3a71d/56_73_2931_1758/master/2931.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=390a37d0a0341979c67573a4cdef908a","title":"the worlds her oyster card can you pack taylor swifts capital tour into a day","story":"The singer claims it would take three years to complete the itinerary in her new song London Boy.

They’re not voicing their disdain for her inability to sell an EU deal to parliament but the fact that as home secretary, she barred Tyler from performing in the UK due to his lyrical content which, it was claimed, promoted terrorism and homophobia.While his button-pushing use of the word “faggot” no doubt grated, the ban was ludicrously draconian and didn’t countenance that even his most offensive songs were cartoonish and played with persona. Tyler clearly believes there was a racial element at play: “It’s been four years since they let my dark skin in this country”, he tells the crowd.By 2015, Tyler had already modulated from snotty to goofy, and he has softened even further in the interim. New album Igor, his most commercially successful yet, is full of unrequited love and neo-soul lamentations, and thousands of people sing its lovely, submissive hooks back to him: “Don’t leave, it’s my fault”, “This time I think it’s for real”, “I’m your puppet”. It seems sillier than ever that his lyrics could have incited terrorism.Gone, too, is the nerdy streetwear he made so influential: Tyler is now dressed in blond wig (strangely reminiscent of May, actually) and a yellow suit that goes from primrose to daffodil as it gets soaked in sweat. He performs against a steadily more impressive series of floaty tasselled backdrops, even playing a white piano, looking, per the Dr Dre line, like he robbed Liberace. Other touchstones are generations of black dandies: his jitterbug poses recall Little Richard, Rick James, André 3000. But ferocious pyro explodes from the floor for Who Dat Boy, as he and the crowd gloriously devolve to his old moshpit mode.Though there is an affecting vulnerability to his conversational singing voice, Tyler is still strongest with this more malevolent rap material. There is more complexity to a track like 2013’s IFHY, as he tussles with love and violent jealousy the goth energy to Igor track What’s Good chafes nicely against the silken drapes. But throughout, Tyler has a blithe star quality that can’t be taught, or indeed repressed.

A Scottish appeal court ruled that Boris Johnson’s decision to prorogue parliament was unlawful – but did not order MPs to return.The government was forced to release its secret Operation Yellowhammer “planning assumptions” for a no-deal Brexit, which warned of rising food and fuel prices, disruption to medicine supplies and public disorder on Britain’s streets.Johnson continued to insist “huge progress” was being made – although No 10 played down hopes of a breakthrough involving an all-Ireland regulatory regime for food and agriculture which it thinks could help replace the backstop, and Michel Barnier said there were “no grounds” for formally re-opening talks.Increasingly alarmed at the possibility that the PM might try to break the law by forcing a no deal, however, a cross-party group of MPs looked at bringing back a version of Theresa May’s deal, plus a vote on a second referendum, in late October.And the outgoing Speaker of the Commons, John Bercow, warned that he was prepared to rip up the parliamentary rulebook to stop any illegal attempt by the prime minister to take the UK out of the EU without a deal on 31 October.Johnson did, at least, meet the outgoing president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker. It did not go well. Before heading to Luxembourg, the PM compared himself to the Incredible Hulk, throwing off the shackles of the EU.Despite EU officials repeatedly insisting they had seen no concrete British proposals whatsoever on alternatives to the backstop, the foreign secretary, Domic Raab, said the bloc had heard enough and was indulging in “political posturing”.Johnson told Juncker the UK would not ask for a further Brexit extension and would not accept one if the EU offered it – nor would it request any extension to the EU transition period beyond December 2020 if he got a Brexit deal.Unfortunately, the PM was then humiliated by his Luxembourg counterpart, Xavier Bettel, who went ahead with a planned joint press conference that Johnson dodged because of protesters – and savaged Johnson’s Brexit approach.All eyes, meanwhile, are on 11 supreme court judges who this week will hear the politically charged claim that the PM acted unlawfully in advising the Queen to suspend parliament for five weeks in order to stifle debate over the Brexit crisis.Some people worry that if the government wins, Johnson may even decide to suspend parliament for a second time when it returns on 14 October.Who knows? But four main scenarios seem to present themselves:Unlikely as it may seem, Johnson could still get a deal, probably based around a border in the Irish sea. He would find getting it through parliament very hard, but perhaps not impossible, helped maybe by Labour MPs in leave-voting constituencies.He could decide to break his promise, request an extension and then immediately demand an election, counting on a fiercely anti-EU, people-versus-parliament campaign to see him through.He could, theoretically at least, go for no deal on 31 October, testing or even ignoring the law. Early elections would follow, with the PM trusting that with Brexit delivered, the Brexit party would be no more – and that no deal would not be too catastrophic.Or he could resign or be pushed out. Rather than the isive Jeremy Corbyn, a more neutral figure (Ken Clarke?) might then head up a temporary government whose sole purpose would be to ask the EU for an extension, with elections to follow.In the , Matthew d’Ancona says Boris Johnson’s invocation of the Incredible Hulk was apt – his behaviour is monstrous:During the leadership contest, Johnson said that the chances of no deal were a “million to one against”. Last month he said it was “touch and go”. Now, in advance of his meeting Jean-Claude Juncker, he claims that “we will get there”. Which Johnson to believe?Frankly, all this briefing about “breakthroughs” and diplomatic “movement” strikes me as mere preparatory work for the attribution of blame as 31 October approaches. Imagine Johnson and his acolytes raging as the deadline gets near, and how they will complain that the prime minister’s superhuman efforts have been undermined – by Brussels, by remainiacs, by disloyal Tories, by judges, by Larry the cat.It will all be someone else’s fault. That, at least, is what they will say. But don’t believe a word of it. Inside the Hulk, there is and has always been a small and fearful man, wondering, with good reason, what will become of him when he loses all his strength.A thread from a professor of EU law that is a wonder of clarity and concision:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c884dfca1736e4c62772df6448752a10194c3ba4/770_2340_1072_643/master/1072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6ad0c90e19d876dfb4c5ef492b0d939","title":"raf injury rugby league army","story":"• Scott Stevenson hurt in inter-services game against the army• ‘This is tragic and heartbreaking news,’ says RFL chiefAn RAF senior aircraftman has died after being injured playing in an inter-services rugby league match against the army.Scott Stevenson was hurt playing in the game at Aldershot last Friday night and news of his death was announced by his family in a Facebook post on Monday evening.

I would have backed right out but then the barmaid said she wanted to practice her English. She’d been taking lessons, she explained, because she’s so excited about the Tokyo Olympics and is sure she will enjoy it more if she can talk to all the tourists who’ll be coming here next year. By the time I’d finished my drink we’d established that no, this wasn’t my first time in Japan, that I have family in Sapporo, and, after I’d made a clumsy mime of typing on the bar, that I was here on business, working as a sports journalist. The one thing we got stuck on was exactly which sport I was here to cover.“Rugby”, I said. “Rugby?”, she replied. “Yes, rug-by.” There didn’t seem to be any other syllables left to try and stress, so in the end I pulled out my phone and googled a photo for her. “Ah, rugby,” she said. Yes, rugby, I replied, trying to copy the way she said it, the World Cup. “Oh yes,” she said, unimpressed. “When does that start?” You’ll hear a lot of spurious official statistics about the millions of Japanese people who have just discovered rugby in the next few weeks, less about the millions more who, like her, remain entirely oblivious to it.You notice them in Tokyo, though. They had 15,000 locals turn up to welcome the Welsh in Kitakyushu, but it feels like the World Cup has got a lot of competition here. The baseball is on, and the autumn sumo too. So it really seems a wildly brave and audacious move for World Rugby to bring their main event, one of the biggest tournaments on earth, to country where their game’s a minority sport.According to a recent white paper there are around 100,000 registered rugby players in Japan, which is around a third as many as badminton has, a quarter as many as volleyball, a tenth as many as football. The average match in the domestic rugby league pulls in a crowd of around 5,000.Big sport doesn’t usually work this way. There’s been nothing quite like it since Fifa took the football World Cup to the USA in 1994. World Rugby is hoping the gamble will open up a new market. They need it to. There aren’t many hosts left among the top rugby nations who can guarantee them the kind of reliable financial return that’s allowed them to spend £64m in four years developing the game in Japan and the other tier-two nations. England is one, France is another, and it is no surprise that one of those hosted the World Cup before this, and the other will host the World Cup after it.Early the next morning the Japanese players who are going to be doing the missionary work were busy rehearsing their lineout drills at the Prince Chichibu Memorial Stadium in central Tokyo. The Japanese may love a plucky underdog, back in 2003 a racehorse called Haru Urara (‘the shining star of losers everywhere’ ) became a national celebrity after it lost 100 races in a row, but rugby’s popularity rides on how well the national team are doing. The average league attendances almost doubled after Japan beat South Africa in 2015. And right now, it feels like there’s an awful lot depending on whether or not they can do it again against Ireland or Scotland in the pool stages.The Prince Chichibu ground is the “spiritual home of Japanese rugby”– they have been playing here for 70 years, but won’t be during this tournament. There are plans to knock it down soon after the competition is over so it can be used as a car park for the impressive new Olympic Stadium which is being built just up the road.That was supposed to be ready in time to host the first and last matches of this tournament, but then the government scrapped the original plans and started over, so construction slowed down and now it is due to open a month after the World Cup finishes.Never mind the baseball, then, these games are very much in the shadow of those Games. The Olympics seem to get nine minutes of airtime for every one afforded the rugby, it’s the Olympic logo that is on the side of all the taxi cabs, the Olympic mascots mugging on all the billboards. So rugby has got to make every use of this little six-week window. The game has got to show the best side of itself, be fast, hard-fought, free-flowing. And that is how they are selling it on the fliers and adverts they have put up around the city. My favourite of them is the poster for the spectators’ village which has been set up out in Fuchu to the west of the city, with the slogan “Let’s watch the great power of live battle of men on the big screen!” Even an Ebisu barmaid might be tempted by an invitation like that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc7623d9ffb5bea3ab228f8081df419e5c6bb766/0_0_500_300/master/500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b86c1275d7da7af479c82b0bb011d37","title":"rugby world cup 2019 georgia team guide","story":"A blend of experience and youth makes up an injury-hit Georgian squad that has brought ‘Gorgodzilla’ out of retirementA blend of experience and youth makes up an injury-hit Georgian squad that has brought ‘Gorgodzilla’ out of retirementThe target for Los Lelos is to at least replicate their result from the last World Cup, but winning two group stage matches in Japan will be much harder for Georgia than it was in 2015. In England four years ago, Georgia earned two hard-fought wins against Tonga and a resilient Namibia side. Those two victories meant that for the first time Los Lelos qualified for the subsequent World Cup by virtue of a top 12 finish, which meant their coach, Milton Haig, had a chance to test younger players in the Rugby Europe Championship. The last four years were spent improving competition in several key positions, such as fly-half and second row. Georgian rugby is largely dependent on two groups – players who play in France or Britain and their under-20s team, who managed to maintain their place among the best 12 in the world for the past four years, defeating Italy, Scotland, Argentina and Ireland in the process. As a result, it is no surprise that the senior team consists of experienced players such as Davit Kacharava who has 115 caps to his name and 18-year-old hooker Vano Karkadze. The worrying signs continued when Los Lelos hosted Scotland in August – the first Tier 1 team to ever visit Tbilisi. Usually, the Georgian defence holds its own even against high-level teams – in November 2017 they narrowly lost to Wales – 13-6 – at the Principality Stadium. Many Georgian fans got their hopes up, that maybe, just maybe, their team could play at Six Nations level. That optimism largely dissolved when Scotland managed to score five tries in the Dinamo Arena while conceding just one. Georgia’s big men can match even top opposition when it comes to scrummaging, but when it’s time to clear out rucks and support teammates, they’re often a bit too slow, which showed on several occasions against Southern Kings and Scotland. Discipline is another thing Los Lelos need to sort out. Georgia conceded 14 penalties against Scotland which cost them dear. Most of the Georgian backs play in the semi-professional domestic competition (Didi 10) and do not always have quality opposition to hone their skills against. Haig included 17 forwards and 14 backs in his squad and Georgian fans were happy when they saw that Mamuka Gorgodze was selected. The Toulon second-row retired from his international duties in 2017 and was adamant he would never play for Georgia again. He told reporters it was time for younger guys to step up, but with Giorgi Tsutskiridze ruled out through injury, “Gorgodzilla” had no other choice. Georgia play their first game on 23 September against Wales. The second game will be against Uruguay, whom Los Lelos lost to at the World Cup in 2003 and Haig is planning to win this one. After just four days of rest the Georgians then face Fiji. If they’re to replicate 2015, Los Lelos need to come away with a victory. The teams have faced each other three times and the Fijians emerged victorious twice. Georgia have previously faced Australia so, in a way, whatever happens in the last game of the group stage, it will make history. • Luka Chochua is a sports Journalist and TV host working for the public broadcaster of Georgia"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66681e097997e92c27e14cf4b657b642d805d23d/0_298_5463_3276/master/5463.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08badd51bab1629f8470e2d3926662c2","title":"iphone 11 and iphone 11 pro review roundup buy the cheapest one","story":"Early reviews of Apple’s latest suggest colour, battery and lower price make the iPhone 11 a winner The early reviews of Apple’s iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max are in from publications with early access to the three models.While the iPhone 11 Pro is the most impressive technically, with a new triple camera system catching up to the competition, it is the iPhone 11, the cheapest of the bunch, that is winning the majority of people over. Questions remain as to whether it’s worth upgrading at all, however, if your iPhone is less than five years old. will have its own reviews of the new iPhones in the next week or so once they have gone on sale, but in the meantime here’s what those given early access by Apple had to say.Costing from £729, the iPhone 11 has a 6.1in LCD screen, two cameras on the back but the same processor and storage sizes as the more expensive iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max.In our tests, the iPhone 11 easily lasted a full day at a time and then some. It’s possible you could manage to kill this battery in less than a day, but you’d have to really try. The battery life is great, just like the iPhone XR’s battery life was great.What’s less great is the fact that Apple is still putting its ancient 5W charger in the box, even though the iPhone 11 Pro has an 18W USB-C fast charger. If Apple isn’t going to update the entire line to a fast charger, it should just do the environment a favour and stop putting the 5W charger in the box entirely there are literally billions of them in the world, and odds are, you have more than one in a drawer already.In reality, the iPhone 11 has a display that will more than satisfy most users. It’s not as sharp in resolution as the likes of the iPhone 11 Pro, or the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 for example, and it doesn’t offer mobile HDR compatibility like these other devices either, but the iPhone 11 still offers a decent screen with ample brightness and arguably more realistic colours than the Pro models and other OLED smartphones.The omission of HDR on the iPhone 11 means that while it tries to deliver a HDR-like experience for compatible content, it’s not the real deal. Smart HDR pictures don’t pop as much when viewing on screen as they do on the iPhone 11 Pro, and you can’t see as much detail on a dark TV show or movie that’s available in HDR, as you can on the 11 Pro – but it’s also one of the few compromises the iPhone 11 makes to the Pro models.The wider-angled front-facing camera is welcome, and digitally zooms in or out to accommodate a wider view that fits in more people and background. The 12-megapixel front-facing camera looks better, and I was happy with the results, but you have to be artful with the wider camera. Sometimes I ended up looking like a little face in a mountain of shirt.My kids instantly started messing around with slow-motion selfie feature. Yes, that’s the Slofie. It’s not a Live Photo, though. It’s just a video mode. That makes it hard to do much with, because the file sizes get large. I do, however, have a lot of extended 240-fps slow-motion scenes of my kids sticking out their tongues.This year’s iPhone 11 has two rear lenses, a wide-angle lens and an ultrawide lens with a 120-degree field of view. Last year’s iPhone XR had a single lens, and any depth effects added to photos were done computationally. This means the iPhone 11 now captures enough information to take better photos from the start – and especially portrait photos.Case in point: last year’s iPhone XR could capture a portrait photo of a person but not a pet or object. The iPhone 11 now takes portrait photos of my cat, which he is pleased about. Just kidding: he is indifferent, per usual.The iPhone 11 is a very good camera, and in a lot of situations it even performed better than last year’s top-of-the-line iPhone XS. But the iPhone 11 Pro takes noticeably better photos, whether standard photos, portrait images, or night mode pics.Like the XR and 5c series before it, a large part of the iPhone 11’s appeal lies in its range of six shades: red, black, white, yellow, green and purple. This is the first ever purple iPhone, and Apple has chosen the Instagram-baiting shade of lilac popularised by the likes of Ariana Grande and South Korean pop sensations BTS – Generation Z’s equivalent of millennial pink.It’s pretty – a stylish splash of lavender Apple knows will have aesthetically-minded iPhone owners clamouring to upgrade (as evidenced by its new range of transparent cases). These are phones to be shown off, not hidden behind rubber or leather sheaths, and even if you do cover it up with a case, Apple is banking on the satisfaction of owning a phone in a colour you’re attached to.Overall the iPhone 11 is a triumph for Apple – if, for nothing else, the fact it’s managed to lower the price year-on-year. We feel enough people are going to be won over by the hard-working camera … and the safety that buying a modern smartphone gives you.You should be able to achieve years of use from this phone, and sure, you could also consider the iPhone 11 Pro or iPhone 11 Pro Max if you want more power and higher spec, but we found the iPhone 11 to be fun to use and often outperformed what we would expect given the price – and that’s a feat some wouldn’t have expected from Apple.Based on my tests of the iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max, the answer is no. Don’t get me wrong: the newest models are nice. Apple has made them speedier, improved the cameras and lengthened their battery life. The new lineup also starts at a lower price of $700, down from $750 a year ago, which is a relief in an era of skyrocketing smartphone costs.But none of this is enough to warrant an immediate upgrade if you have had your smartphone for only two years. The latest iPhones just aren’t a big leap forward from last year’s iPhones or even the iPhone X from 2017.So here’s what I ultimately suggest: you should definitely upgrade if your current device is at least five years old. The iPhone 11 models are all a significant step up from those introduced in 2014. But for everyone else with smartphones from 2015 or later, there is no rush to buy. Instead, there is more mileage and value to be had out of the excellent smartphone you already own.The £1,049 iPhone 11 Pro and £1,149 11 Pro Max top the iPhone 11 with higher resolution 5.8in and 6.5in OLED screens respectively. They also have a new triple camera system on the back – their main differentiator over the significantly cheaper model.The iPhone 11 Pro Max I’ve been using every day for a week has consistently run for 12 to 14 hours on a single charge, with over 10 hours of screen-on time reported in the battery settings per 24-hour period.That’s compared to eight to 10 hours of battery life at most for my iPhone XS Max, which is a marked improvement. It’s not enough to make me stop charging at my desk throughout the day, and I’ll definitely still carry a battery pack on trips.Apple has chosen to stick to the same resolution as last year’s handsets but has spruced them up with a new OLED panel with a 2,000,000:1 contrast ratio called Super Retina XDR. In practice, this means the displays are both bolder and brighter and display colours more accurately.I found this was best exemplified when examining skin tones in the same pictures side-by-side with the iPhone XS Max. Caucasian skin on the XS Max appears pinker and more flushed, whereas the same picture looks truer-to-life. Likewise, the 11 Pro Max picks out facial highlights and hair undertones not as apparent in the same picture over on the XS Max. It’s a small difference, but an impressive one.This year’s most expensive iPhone is the $1,449 (£1,499) iPhone Pro Max with 512GB of storage. Even with 256GB of storage – the minimum you’ll likely want for a high-end phone like this – it will set you back $1,249 (£1,299). There are two main reasons to go for this year’s most extreme iPhone: either you want that larger OLED display (2,688×1,242 versus 2,436×1,125 for the Pro) or you want that extra hour of battery life.I wouldn’t want to spend this much. But if you really are using your phone as a professional camera and you want to see every pixel, you want the best viewfinder and editing display you can get. And, well, this would be that phone. It’s also more fun for movies and games, but at these prices, I’d just buy a separate iPad for that.Overall, the iPhone 11 Pro Max is a real step forward, and the most advanced iPhone yet. However, when thinking about what’s truly new here, we weren’t able to single out much beyond the improved camera (especially night mode) and the slightly upgraded cinematic experience.If you want to save some money, we’d suggest checking out the iPhone 11 – while we constantly found little nuggets of impressive performance throughout our testing of the 11 Pro Max, we couldn’t shake the feeling that this is really only a phone for the Apple fan who wants the best of everything, with no compromises.While Apple says frequently that its integrated hardware and software enable it to do magical things with cameras – and in some cases, that’s true – that doesn’t mean every shot taken on the iPhone 11 Pro phones was the best photo.In some cases, the photos I took on the iPhone 11 Pro Max were clearly sharper, brighter, and even more (you hate to say it) professional-looking than the iPhone 11 photos of the same scenes or subjects. The iPhone 11 Pro Max captured the best portrait mode photo of my colleague Lydia, showing accurate colours, picking up on details like wisps of hair and freckles, and handling highlights and sunlight well. A beach sunset photo captured on the same phone expertly captured the contrast between dark rocks, a glassy ocean and the sunburnt sky. A photo of yaki onigiri captured in harsh overhead light showed excellent detail, right down to the charred rice.But when pitted against other leading smartphones, the iPhone 11 Pro Max wasn’t always the standout. The Google Pixel 3, a less expensive and soon-to-be-outdated phone, took better, crisper photos of a floral arrangement in a very dark bar. An iPhone 11 Pro Max photo of my friend Kayla, captured in a dark sushi restaurant, showed a lot of detail in easy-to-miss spots like her hands, or the slight wrinkles of her shirt. But Kayla, a video producer, and I both agreed that the colour and temperature of the photo was off, whereas the Pixel 3’s photo was more true-to-life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/665332fffd96e72fdc58a7a6e3b1d95992182d5f/0_55_2085_1251/master/2085.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=341a8d8ee4731ac6d5f922d5b69fab59","title":"live like a lord and lady downton abbey is listed on airbnb","story":"Earl and Countess of Carnarvon open doors of Highclere Castle in Hampshire to select guests Fans of the hit TV series Downton Abbey are to be given the opportunity to “live like the lord or lady of a stately home” and stay in the castle where the show was filmed.To mark the release of the Downton Abbey film, the Earl and Countess of Carnarvon have posted their residence of Highclere Castle in Hampshire on the Airbnb booking website.The advert invites two guests to stay in one of the house’s 300 rooms on 26 November and be “treated like royalty”.For the price of £120 ($150), the couple will join the earl and countess for evening cocktails in the saloon followed by a traditional dinner in the state dining room, waited on by the castle’s own butler.After dinner, coffee will be served in the library before the guests retire to one of the principal bedrooms with an en-suite bathroom and views over 400 hectares (1,000 acres) of rolling parkland.“Throughout the stay, Lord and Lady Carnarvon will immerse the guests in the rich history and heritage of Highclere Castle with a private tour of the castle, the Highclere estate,” the advert says.While the room is listed as coming with a hairdryer and shampoo, it will not have wifi or a TV.Reservations open at noon on 1 October and applicants are expected to have a record of good reviews from their previous Airbnb bookings.Applicants need to show they are “passionate about Downton Abbey” in the message they include when requesting the reservation and the most creative submission will be chosen.“It’s an absolute privilege and pleasure to call Highclere Castle my home and I am delighted to be able to share it on Airbnb for a truly unique stay,” wrote Lady Carnarvon in the advert.“Highclere Castle has been in the Carnarvon family since 1679 and has an incredibly rich history.

They also said others were pushed towards the far right by the amount of hate speech and fake news they read every day.They describe being ground down by the volume of the work, numbed by the graphic violence, nudity and bullying they have to view for eight hours a day, working nights and weekends, for “practically minimum pay”.A little-discussed aspect of Facebook’s moderation was particularly distressing to the contractors: vetting private conversations between adults and minors that have been flagged by algorithms as likely sexual exploitation.Gina, a contractor, said: “I think it’s a breach of human rights. You cannot ask someone to work fast, to work well and to see graphic content. The things that we saw are just not right.”The workers, whose names have been changed, were speaking on condition of anonymity because they had signed non-disclosure agreements with Facebook. Daniel, a former moderator, said: “We are a sort of vanguard in this field … It’s a completely new job, and everything about it is basically an experiment.”John, his former colleague, said: “I’m here today because I would like to avoid other people falling into this hole. As a contemporary society, we are running into this new thing – the internet – and we have to find some rules to deal with it.“It’s important to create a team, for example in a social network, aiming to protect users from abusers, hate speech, racial prejudice, better pornographic software, etc. But I think it’s important to open a debate about this job. We need to share our stories, because people don’t know anything about us, about our job, about what we do to earn a living.”Some of the moderators’ stories were similar to the problems experienced in other countries. Daniel said: “Once, I found a colleague of ours checking online, looking to purchase a Taser, because he started to feel scared about others. He confessed he was really concerned about walking through the streets at night, for example, or being surrounded by foreign people.“Maybe because all this hate speech we have to face every day affects our political view somehow. So a normal person, a liberal person, maybe also a progressive person, can get more conservative, more concerned about issues like migrants for example. Indeed, many of the hate speech contents we receive on a daily basis are fake news … which aim to share very particular political views.”In February, the technology site the Verge produced one of the first behind-the-scenes reports from a US Facebook contractor. Similar to their Berlin colleagues, the Americans reported that “the conspiracy videos and memes that they see each day gradually led them to embrace fringe views”, and that a former moderator “now sleeps with a gun at his side” after he was traumatised by a video of a stabbing.Others were dealing with trauma by self-medicating. Just as the Arizona moderators were reportedly turning to drugs and alcohol, so were those in Germany. “I saw a lot of big consumer drugs in the company,” Daniel said. “We don’t have any way to destress. The company, technically, is against drugs.”When trying to go down a more legitimate route of self-help, the American moderators complained about the psychological help that was provided. “The on-site counsellors were largely passive,” the Verge reporter Casey Newton wrote, “relying on workers to recognise the signs of anxiety and depression and seek help.”Berlin moderators were also critical of the counselling services provided and suggested they leaned too heavily on the state’s universal healthcare.The Verge report appeared to trigger reforms. Moderators in Berlin said after the article was published there had been immediate interest from Facebook’s head office in their workload. Previously, they had been required to moderate 1,000 pieces of content a day – more than one every 30 seconds over an eight-hour shift.In February, an official from Facebook’s Dublin office visited, John said. “This person after this meeting decided to take off the limit of 1,000. We didn’t have any limit for a while, but now they have re-established another limit. The limit now is between 400 and 500 tickets.” The new cap – or number of tickets – was half that of the previous one but still required workers achieve about a ticket a minute. However, that volume of work was what their American colleagues had faced before the reforms.Berlin moderators have discussed whether to seek help from the unions, but say the nature of the work makes it difficult. Gina said: “I wouldn’t say no one is interested, but no one has the possibility to do something for real.”John added: “They are so tired.”While the moderators agreed such work was necessary they said the problems were fixable. “I think it’s important to open a debate about this job,” he said, adding that the solution was simple – “hire more people”.In a statement, Facebook said: “Content moderators do vital work to keep our community safe, and we take our responsibility to ensure their wellbeing incredibly seriously. We work closely with our partners to ensure they provide the support people need, including training, psychological support and technology to limit their exposure to graphic content.“Content moderation is a new and challenging industry, so we are always learning and looking to improve how it is managed. We take any reports that our high standards are not being met seriously and are working with our partner to look into these concerns.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2af98ec957ceb1bfedc3cc93f7a83d564a068f4/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=157409f857f85a08300ec63385d0e56b","title":"japan rugby world cup host city guide tokyo osaka yokohama","story":"With the Rugby World Cup about to kick off, Olivia Lee asks locals from the nine cities hosting home nations matches for top places to eat and drink, and the must-see sightsBy Manami Miura, award-winning sake sommelier at the Ginza Kimijimaya liquor store, instagramsakephygramMy city in a nutshellTokyo is a city of gigantic proportions: 47 neighbourhoods slotting together like parts of an elaborate puzzle, home to more than 4,000 shrines and temples, 6,000 parks, and 300,000 restaurants (10 times as many as New York). Quiet shrines stand near neon-lit electronics shops, and serene parks edge up against alleyways lined with late-night ramen bars. But it wasn’t always this way: in the 1600s, when Tokyo was still called Edo, it was nothing but a tiny fishing village, until the shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu decided to build a castle here. In 1868, it was made the capital, and it is now among the largest cities in the world.If you do one thingAsk 100 people what to do in Tokyo and you’ll probably get 100 different answers. I tell people to walk around Ginza. This central neighbourhood is one of Japan’s wealthiest postcodes, where glossy department stores and high-end brands are housed in many of Tokyo’s prettiest buildings, blending the best of Japanese fashion, design and cuisine – it’s also the heart of Tokyo’s sushi culture. Some of the greatest sushi restaurants on Earth are here, including the immortalised shop of Jiro Ono, star of the Jiro Dreams of Sushi documentary.While in Ginza, also visit Sony Park – a quirky urban space that often hosts live music – as well as the tiny shrine of Toyoiwa Inari, hidden down a very narrow alley. Also stop for a drink at Nissan Crossing, a cafe where you can have your face etched on top of your latte in macchi-art for ¥400 (£3).My favourite place to eatA small restaurant in Tokyo’s Ebisu neighbourhood called GEM by Moto. Diners squeeze in on stools around the hardwood counter as they watch owner and sake sommelier Marie Chiba at work. This year, Marie was awarded the Sake Samurai award – one of the most prestigious achievements in the sake industry – for her unique pairings at GEM, selecting sake for each customer based on their food choices from the regularly changing blackboard menu. Her most famous pairing, which you can ask for, is that of milky-white doburoku (unfiltered homebrew sake) with a blue cheese and ham cutlet. On the restaurant’s white walls, you’ll find scrawled messages from Marie’s many sake brewers, who travel from across the country to become customers themselves.• Small plates from £3.80, 1 Chome-30-9 Ebisu, Shibuya City, on FacebookWhere to stayA trip to Tokyo wouldn’t be complete without dipping a toe into the city’s slightly stranger side. A stay at a Henn-na Hotel (meaning strangeweird hotel) will certainly allow you to do that. This chain, of which there are several branches across Tokyo, is almost solely run by robots: some in the shape of people, some in the shape of dinosaurs. You are generally checked in by a robot at reception, with a porter robot to carry your things to your room (plus robotic fish in the fish tank). The latest Henn-na Hotel, which opened on 1 September in Asakusa, even has holographic robot staff who flicker in front of you on the walls. You probably wouldn’t want to spend more than a night or two there, but the rooms are affordable and are in great locations, from Ginza to Maihama (by Tokyo Disneyland). If the robot novelty doesn’t appeal, I also recommend Remm in Hibiya (doubles from £85), a modern hotel that provides a quiet, comfortable night’s sleep in the heart of the city, with rooms featuring rain showers and massage chairs.• h-n-h.jpen,doubles from £55What the guidebooks overlookTokyo is often said to be the foodie capital of the world, with more Michelin stars than any other city on Earth. But less appreciation is given to the city’s creative brewers, of which there are hundreds. My favourites include Brewin’ Bar in Ginza, where you can try home-brewed craft beers (£6) an amazing urban winery called Fujimaru in Kiyosumi-Shirakawa, with both a restaurant and a wine tasting room and Wakaze, a brewery that does pop-ups around the city, serving deliciously sour oak barrel-aged sake.Head north to nearby Ibaraki prefecture, where nature is in abundance. This is where you’ll find the beautiful Tsukimachi waterfall, one of Japan’s 88 ancient power spots. Here people practise a Buddhist ritual called Takigyo, known as “waterfall meditation”, a cleansing of the mind and soul achieved by standing under the powerful – and very cold – water for anything from several minutes to several hours (something only committed monks achieve). You can rent a traditional shiro shozoku karate-style outfit and try it for yourself (I did it in August), warming up after at Momiji-en, a soba (buckwheat noodle) restaurant that overlooks the maple tree valley. About 12 miles away, you’ll find Japan’s highest bungee jump, which sees visitors throw themselves off a 100-metre-high suspension bridge above colourful Ryujin Gorge. To get to Ibaraki, take the 90-minute Limited Express train from Tokyo to Mito, then the 90-minute local Suigun Line train to Shimonomiya station. Tsukimachi waterfall is a 1½-mile walk from there. Alternatively, hire a car in Mito for easy access to Ibaraki’s more rural reaches.Inspiration There are plenty of great Instagram accounts to follow for tips on Tokyo, including photographer @tokyo_one, who shares beautiful imagery, and @bunnytokyo who shares interesting stories. If you can get your hands on a copy, I also recommend the book series Tokyo Artrip. The books, written in Japanese on one side and English on the other, highlight great places to experience everything in Tokyo from sake and green tea to architecture and antiques.By Emma Sato, photographer living in Yokohama, @gomphotographyMy city in a nutshell Yokohama is Japan’s second-largest city: it has one of the largest expat communities in the country – and the largest Chinatown. It may be less than an hour by train from the capital Tokyo (it is actually part of the Greater Tokyo area), but feels far more laid-back – the streets are uncrowded, easy to walk through and dotted with street art and cool cafes. The growing number of microbreweries in the city add to this youthful spirit, and there are beer festivals throughout the year, including an annual Oktoberfest.If you do one thingSpend the evening in Minato Mirai 21, Yokohama’s harbour area. At night, the sea reflects the city lights like a kaleidoscope. To see the skyline in full, jump on the ferris wheel (£5.30), a 15-minute loop that scoops you up among the skyscrapers. It’s also worth viewing the ferris wheel from afar – it lights up in five-minute displays on each quarter-hour. The best spots to watch from are either Osanbashi Pier, which juts 50 metres into the water, or Manyo Club (£19), an onsen (hot-spring) facility that has skyline views from the baths. Manyo also has footbaths outside, so you can roll up your jeans and sit back to watch the show.My favourite place to eat I love a yakitori restaurant called Sumibi Yakitori Azume, where chicken is grilled on skewers over charcoal (yaki: cooked over heat tori: chicken). There are several tables, but sit at the 10-seater bar if you want a front-row view of the chef turning each skewer on the flames. Almost every part of the chicken is available, from the crispy skin to the liver. Wash it down with a local sake or sweet plum wine – the bar is lined with bottles.Where to stayProstyle Ryokan is a Japanese-Western fusion hotel that celebrates the fact that Yokohama was the first city in Japan to open its port to the outside world, back in 1859. The hotel’s design reflects this blending of cultures, from the sunken earth floors of traditional Japanese homes to the Western-style bedrooms, with corridors lit by refurbished gas lamps brought to Japan from the west in 1872. In the lobby, you can listen to curated playlists made by the hotel staff, using headphones plugged into record players. They also offer free smartphones for guests to use out and about during their stay. • prostyleryokan, doubles from £76 room-onlyWhat the guidebooks overlook Yokohama’s Koganecho neighbourhood was the city’s red-light district until the government set about gutting the local brothels in 2006, turning them into creative studios and workspaces. Today, the neighbourhood, which lines the northern banks of the Ooka River, is a great place to stroll around, stopping in at the art shops and galleries, or admiring the bright murals painted on the walls.Catch the Shinkansen (bullet train) to Hakone, a striking onsen town less than an hour away with a great open-air museum, home to an enormous collection of artwork from the likes of Picasso and Henry Moore, as well as more than 1,000 statues in the sprawling grounds. Hakone’s real lure, though, is its Mount Fuji views. To take in all the sights (including designated “Fuji-viewing” spots), follow the “Hakone loop” – a day-long route that winds gently through the mountains and lakes via train, tram, cable car, enormous pirate-styled ship and bus. Don’t leave without trying the famous black eggs of Owakudani, cooked in sulphur water. Locals believe eating one will add seven years to your life. The Hakone Free Pass (£39) allows for unlimited travel in the Hakone area for two consecutive days.Inspiration Follow: @in_suke_gram, who posts artistic photographs of the city.

The cold Sea of Okhotsk, to the north, has some of the world’s richest fishing waters, and Sapporo is known for its seafood – especially crab, served at all-you-can-eat crab buffets across the city. It was also the birthplace of the eponymous beer in 1876, one of the four big beer companies in Japan (alongside Asahi, Kirin and Suntory). The red-brick Sapporo Beer Museum (free) is a popular spot. The best thing about Sapporo though is the weather: heavy snowfall in winter, when the city hosts Japan’s largest snow festival (4-11 February 2020), then a balmy climate in summer, far from the sweltering heat further south. But Hokkaido is perhaps at its best in autumn, when the trees turn bright red and yellow. And unlike further south, where the maples often stay green until late November, the transformation generally begins in late October.If you do one thingWalk down Ganso Ramen Yokocho, a narrow, lantern-lit alleyway home to 17 traditional hole-in-the-wall ramen shops. It’s Sapporo’s “original” ramen street, where miso ramen – Hokkaido’s famed noodle dish, often topped with “butter corn” – is said to have originated, spurred on by the need for a heartier broth in cold winters. The street looks almost the same as it did in the 1950s – except now there are ticket machines where you choose your order and pay. Most of the shops are tiny, seating around six people, so it’s not uncommon to queue.• 3 Chome Minami 5 Jonishi, Chuo WardMy favourite place to eatHokkaido is one of the few places in Japan where you’ll find lamb on the menu (or see sheep in a field): the animals were introduced to Hokkaido in 1857. Now, one of the island’s staple dishes is Genghis Khan (pronounced jingisukan) – grilled lamb or mutton in a sticky marinade. In Sapporo, there are plenty of Genghis Khan restaurants, but the tiny Sapporo Genghis Khan Main Branch is my favourite. It’s a real locals’ bar, with 18 seats crammed inside, and grills set up to cook in front of you. A 130g plate of lamb costs £7.50 English menus available on request.• 6 Chome Minami 5 Jonishi, Chuo WardWhat the guide books overlook Sapporo Art Park, about 15km south of the city centre, has nearly 100 acres of landscaped gardens, outdoor museums and craft studios offering workshops such as woodworking or weaving. The Sculpture Garden, with its 74 striking works of art from 64 artists, is a real highlight its unusual statues stand in contrast to the park’s colourful foliage.• artpark.or.jp, Open 9.45am-5pm, free entry (workshops are chargeable).Where to stay Nakamuraya Ryokan is a charming inn about 10 minutes’ walk from JR Sapporo train station. It’s not five-star luxury, but it’s rare to find accommodation as traditional as this close to the city centre. The ryokan was founded in 1903 and has been in the same family ever since. The guest rooms have tatami mats, with roll-out futons in place of western-style beds, and there’s an on-site 24-hour public bathhouse. It also offers a “hairy crab experience”, where visitors can learn how to eat this Hokkaido speciality the local way (600g crab plus instruction, £41).• nakamurayaryokan, rooms sleeping up to four from £60 Shikotsu-Toya national park is only an hour’s drive from Sapporo city, but a true Japanese wilderness. There’s nearly 1,000 square kilometres to explore, dotted with steaming volcanos, caldera lakes and forest-covered mountains. Make a beeline for Lake Shikotsu, one of the deepest in Japan, ringed by three volcanoes: Eniwa, Fuppushi and Tarumae. In autumn, the trees around the lake turn a brilliant burnt orange, intensified by the lake’s mirror-smooth surface. After a day of hiking, stop to soak at Marukoma Onsen (£7.50 public bath, £19 private) on the north shore. The open-air hot-spring baths come down almost to the lake’s edge.Inspiration Read: The Rurubu Omotenashi Travel Guide to Hokkaido – a chaotically colourful but compelling book detailing what to see, eat, buy and do in Hokkaido’s various regions.

Before it moved there, the city was called Koromo but in 1959 – as an acknowledgement of the economic prosperity the motor chain had brought to this otherwise agricultural community – it was renamed Toyota. Many visitors skip Toyota in favour of nearby Nagoya, but that is doing the city a disservice. It has art galleries, gardens, historic temples and an interesting local craft culture, not to mention scenic mountains and valleys on the doorstep.If you do one thing Korankei valley is a pretty ravine carved by the gushing Tomoe River, and a riverside footpath leads from one end of the valley to the other, past the 254-metre peak of Mount Inari. The route winds over the scarlet Taigetsukyo Bridge (a great spot for photos) and past Kojakuji Temple, part-way up the slope under a canopy of maples. There are over 4,000 maple trees in the valley, each turning like traffic lights from green to orange to red as the year progresses. It’s an explosion of colour so dramatic that thousands of visitors from across Japan come each year to witness it.My favourite place to eatUnachu is a traditional restaurant that serves the most delicious hitsumabushi – a regional speciality of grilled eel on white rice. We love eel in Japan (the Japanese consume three-quarters of the total global eel catch) and Toyota’s prefecture, Aichi, is one of the main eel-producing regions in the country. The eel is grilled on skewers over charcoal and dipped in a soy-based glaze, making it crispy on the outside and delicately soft inside. It’s served with a variety of bowls and condiments (£26). The idea is to ide the eel into three portions: the first is to be eaten alone with rice the second with the accompaniments (nori, spring onions and wasabi) and the third with a green tea-based dashi sauce, poured out of a teapot. The restaurant itself is very pretty, with timber frames, tatami mats and sliding shoji doors.• unachu, around £26 a headWhere to stayToyota’s accommodation is dominated by “business hotels”, aimed at travellers who visit for work. For a place with a little more character, try Sanage Onsen Hotel Kinsenkaku in the countryside about seven miles north of the city. In Japan, traditional rooms are typically measured by the number of tatami mats they can fit (as opposed to square metres): here, all rooms consist of eight mats, suitable for up to four guests sleeping on roll-out futons. The hotel is particularly proud of its onsen: the natural water contains radon, which is said to promote healing. You can bathe in it, but also drink it to absorb the minerals – it’s the first resort water in Aichi prefecture designated safe to drink by the local government. • doubles from £212 with breakfast and dinnerWhat the guidebooks overlook A small mountain on the outskirts of the city called Mount Sanage. It’s only 30 minutes by bus, but it’s like a different world, with shaded forests, tiny mountain shrines and far-reaching views over Aichi prefecture. I love to come here to run or hike, far from the noise of the city.Moving on Take a 90-minute train and ferry trip to the tiny art island of Sakushima – one of three islands in the Aichi archipelago, with a population of just 300. In 2000, Sakushima began a regeneration project to attract visitors, displaying over 20 modern art installations in the wilderness. There’s no public transport on the 1½-mile-long island, but it’s easy to walk or cycle the looping roads and footpaths, following an art map from the information centre. Circling the entire island on foot will take around two hours. In places, it’s as if you’ve walked into a Japanese video game, exploring fantastical art structures in the pretty island scenery.Inspiration Follow: @88mercury, based in neighbouring city Nagoya, takes beautiful images of Aichi prefecture, with lots of pictures shot in Toyota.By Ami Takemoto, contortionist and performing artist in circus and dance shows across Japan, @ami_takemotoMy city in a nutshell In a country not known for its cultural ersity, Kobe stands out. After Yokohama, it was one of the first ports to open up to the outside world (in 1868) and it has worn its multiculturalism as a badge of honour ever since. Perhaps the most obvious manifestation of this is the number of Western-style patisserie shops – I recommend L’Avenue – and the sprawling Nankinmachi, or Chinatown. But Kobe also has strong Japanese traditions: most notably the production of nihonshu, or sake as it’s known in the west (sake in fact just means alcohol in Japanese). Kobe’s Nada district is the top nihonshu-producing region in the country, with many breweries open for tours and samples.If you do one thing The view from the top of Mount Maya, just north of the city, is incredible – especially at night, earning it the nickname “the $10m view”. The most rewarding way to reach the peak is to hike, setting off mid-afternoon. The easy-to-follow route begins just behind Shin-Kobe station and takes around three hours. On the way up, you’ll pass the Nunobiki waterfalls – their misty white water a cooling refresher on the steep slope. Finally, you’ll reach the Kikuseidai observation platform, where the view unfolds. Catch the 20-minute Maya Viewline cable car back down – or up, if you don’t fancy the hike (£3.30 one-way).My favourite place to eatKobe beef is a variety of wagyu – the highly prized beef known for its succulent, buttery texture. If you’re looking to splash out, there are lots of restaurants offering tasting courses – the two-Michelin-starred Aragawa, for example, will set you back £270 a head. Wanto Burger is one place to try the city’s namesake meat for a fraction of the cost. It’s an American-style diner and serves a Super Wanto burger, with sliced Kobe beef steaks, in a huge bun for £28.• wantoburgerWhere to stayNegiya Ryofukaku is a ryokan in Arima, one of Japan’s better-known onsen towns, around 30 minutes from Kobe. Though it doesn’t have the city-centre convenience, it makes up for it with traditional Japanese charm. Rooms are quintessential Japan, with neat tatami mats, low chabudai tables and sliding paper shoji doors. You can don a traditional yukata (Japanese robe) and shuffle between the steaming open-air baths – one of which has “golden” water thanks to its rich iron content – and the dining room, where an impeccably presented multi-course kaiseki-style dinner is served. In autumn, the entire resort is enveloped in orange maple trees. • Doubles from £150, half-board available, negiyaryokanWhat the guidebooks overlook Kikusui-Sarou – a traditional Japanese dessert shop beside Kobe’s iconic Minatogawa Shrine. When the shrine was built in 1872, Kikusui-Sarou’s shopkeeper donated a tile for the roof as a gesture of goodwill. Today, the shop’s signature treat is their “gilded rice cracker”, baked in the shape of that roof tile. It’s a nice place to sip green tea and sample a range of Japanese sweets.3-15 -3, Tamondori, Chuo-ku Kobe, HyogoTake a 40-minute train ride west to the city of Himeji, with its 400-year-old castle – Japan’s only Unesco-protected castle. This wooden structure on a hill above the city, tiered like an elegant white wedding cake, is one of Japan’s 12 original castles – and, unlike most others, never had to be rebuilt after a natural disaster or war. From the top there are sweeping views across the labyrinth of defences below and out over Himeji. The castle gardens reach their peak during the spring cherry blossom season, when queues form outside the grounds, but they’re an enchanting place to stroll the rest of the year as you peer up at the majestic “White Heron”, as the castle is also known. • japan-guide, tickets from £7.50Inspiration Follow: @kobe_style, showcasing the city’s best food and drink spots.

But it’s a great place to spend a few days, visiting tourist-free temples, wandering the coastline and staring up at Mount Fuji whenever the clouds clear. In the surrounding countryside, the hills are covered with green tea bushes, strawberry fields and wasabi farms – the land is fertile because of the mountain spring water and cool coastal climate.If you do one thing Kunozan Toshogu shrine, on the edge of the city, is an ornate complex overlooking Suruga Bay from the side of Mount Kuno. The scarlet buildings of the shrine, dedicated to the powerful Edo leader Tokugawa Ieyasu, stand under a thick tree covering, with colourful paintings, copper lanterns and gold carvings. The ascent to the shrine zigzags over 1,000 stone steps, but for those who don’t want to sweat, there’s the Nihondaira Ropeway (£8 return), a cable car that dangles you above the forested slopes. On clear days, the views sweep across the tea fields and ocean to Mount Fuji.My favourite place to eatHug Hop, a craft beer bar five minutes’ walk from Shizuoka station, serves predominantly Shizuoka-brewed beer, from makers such as Baird Beer. There is also a regularly changing menu of pub dishes, like Japanese curry and pork belly (from £3). Beer names are written on a large blackboard in English, and there are often live music events. • On Facebook, @hughopWhat the guidebooks overlook Ethicus Coffee Roaster – a really cool coffee shop in the centre of Shizuoka.

The shop is chic and minimalist, with an enormous open-plan kitchen where you can watch the coffee experiments take place.• 2-21-12 Takajo Aoi-ku @ethicus.jpWhere to stay Hotel Garden Square, a few minutes’ walk from Shizuoka central station, is smart and modern, with spacious rooms looking out on to the city. But it is the neighbouring garden and kaiseki restaurant, Fugetsuro, owned by the same family, that make it stand out. The garden, with its waterfall-fed pond and bamboo groves, was created at the end of the Edo period (in the 18th century). The restaurant serves seasonal dishes so pretty they look like they’ve been painted on the plate (eight items from £45). Hotel guests have access to the garden, which is otherwise off-limits.• doubles from £62 room-onlyFujikawaguchiko is a lakeside town in the northern foothills of Mount Fuji, and there are few places in Japan that offer such a close-up view of the famous peak. There are bikes to hire for a ride around Lake Kawaguchi, and plenty of boat trips. Still days see the phenomenon of sakasa Fuji, or “upside-down Fuji”, where the lake creates a perfect mirror image. The Mount Kachi Kachi cable car runs 400 metres up to an opposing peak for panoramic views (£6 return).

It’s not a pretty city – more a blur of concrete tower blocks and wide-laned roads – but its proximity to some of Kyushu’s wildest landscapes makes it a great base to explore the island’s wider reaches and go hiking, canyoning and wild swimming. And thanks to the same geothermal activity that carved these landscapes, Oita has another very tempting reason to visit: hot springs. It’s Japan’s top onsen spot, with more hot-spring facilities than anywhere else in the country.If you do one thing Go to an onsen: my favourite is Hyotan, just north of the city in Beppu. There are eight different onsen under one roof, from steaming open-air baths to sunamushi, where you’re buried up to your neck in hot sand. But onsen culture doesn’t just mean bathing: this area also has onsen jigoku or “hot spring hells” – places where hot sulphurous water (definitely not for swimming in) spills through cracks in the earth to create the most vibrant (and smelly) coloured lakes, from cobalt to deep red. They’re also hot enough to cook with. At Jigoku Mushi Kobo Kannawa, you can order (or take your own) vegetables and meat to steam in the water, which reaches temperatures of 98C (20 minutes’ use from £2.50).My favourite place to eat Usuki Fugu Yamadaya restaurant in Oita’s Miyakomachi area has a sister branch in nearby Usuki (the original store) and two in Tokyo, one of which has three Michelin stars (and, unsurprisingly, prices to match). The Usuki one is known for fugu, the pufferfish banned from consumption through the Edo period due to the number of fatalities from its ovaries and liver, which contain a poison 13 times stronger than arsenic. Even now, the Japanese emperor is forbidden by law from eating it. It’s only served at restaurants with a special licence (taking around three years to earn), which verifies the chef’s ability to prepare it safely. Its fugu course (from £72) includes the fish in its many forms.• 4-11-14, Nishiazabu, OitaWhat the guidebooks overlookA little restaurant called Okamotoya on a hill above Beppu. Outside, you can walk around the exposed sulphuric jigoku – bubbling and steaming like a giant witch’s cauldron – or stop to soak in their huge onsen, with views across Beppu Bay. My favourite reason to visit is the custard puddings, cooked using jigoku mushi (“hell steaming”) in the potent natural steam.• 4 Kumi, Myoban, BeppuA 60-minute train ride away is Yufuin, a small town at the foot of the twin-peaked Mount Yufu that’s consistently ranked as one of the top onsen towns in Japan. Yufuin’s architecture is traditional, from old stone farmhouses to elegant ryokans, but the boutique shops and trendy cafes give the town a bohemian flair. It’s a great place to explore on foot, dipping into the many craft shops and studios, where you can see people practise everything from pottery to washi (Japanese paper-making). Spend an hour crafting chopsticks at Hashiya Ichizen (£20), then have lunch at Izumi Soba, a traditional soba noodle shop by Lake Kinrinko on the edge of town.Inspiration Follow: @foodies_oita – a great Instagram page if you’re interested in finding restaurants that aren’t in the guidebooks. Each post includes the name of the cafe or restaurant in English, as well as a detailed description about the place and food (written in Japanese but translatable via the Instagram app).My city in a nutshell Fukuoka is the largest city on the southerly island of Kyushu – a five-hour Shinkansen (bullet train) ride south of Tokyo. Despite the city’s size (it’s home to 1.6 million people), it’s very compact: if you are flying there from Tokyo, you can get from the airport to the centre in less than 15 minutes, and most of Fukuoka’s key sights – such as Shofukuji, the oldest Zen shrine in Japan – are within easy walking distance.Make sure that you come with an empty stomach: Fukuoka is known for its food, from rich bowls of pork-broth hakata ramen to bright pink karashi mentaiko (pollock or cod roe in the shape of a sausage). Fukuoka Now is a website in four languages and a monthly magazine in both Japanese in English, which was founded by Canadian Nick Szasz and is packed with local news and upcoming events.If you do one thingRide the lift to the top of Fukuoka Tower (£5), which stands an imposing 234 metres high beside the sea. On a clear day, you get a snapshot of the real Fukuoka: Hakata Bay and the sea beyond dotted with small islands, the sandy shore, the mirror-like high-rise buildings and the hazy mountains marking the edge of the prefecture. Dusk is a great time to visit, so you catch the last of the sunset over Hakata Bay, before the city lights flick on to reveal one of Japan’s most amazing nightscapes. My favourite place to eat Despite Tokyo’s thousands of ramen shops, Fukuoka has a good claim to be the ramen capital of Japan. My favourite ramen bar is Hakata Isso, known for its rich tonkotsu ramen, served with soft chashu (pork belly slices) and a sticky soy egg. You’ll usually have to queue to get in, especially as it only seats around 10 people. As with most Japanese ramen shops, you select and pay for your food using the ticket machine on arrival (the words are written in Japanese characters, but ask which one is the standard tonkotsu ramen, £5), then hand your ticket to the server. Ramen is technically fast food, so don’t linger long after you’ve finished eating.• 3 Chome-1-6 HakataekihigashiWhere to stay Stand By Me is a “standing bar where you can also stay”. In Japan, standing bars or tachinomiya – tiny bars where the only option is to stand – took off in the 1980s as an inexpensive and quick place to grab a drink, and have become popular as fun places to hang out. Stand By Me has a standing bar downstairs and a hostel upstairs, with shared and private rooms that are simple, but clean and comfortable. A £7.50 ticket for the standing bar lets you pick any four things off the menu, including beer, sake and lots of delicious local food: it’s a good “sightseeing sampler” if you’re new to Japanese cuisine and aren’t sure where to eat. The bar is also a great space to meet other like-minded travellers. • dorm beds from £34, private rooms from £102What the guidebooks overlook Palm Beach The Gardens: even a lot of Fukuoka locals don’t know about this place. It’s a small dining and shopping complex on a golden beach, about 30km from the city centre. There are surfer-style cafes and bars serving Hawaiian favourites such as loco moco and garlic shrimp, as well as Italian gelatarias and cool surf shops. It’s one of my favourite places in Japan to watch the sunset, especially after a day of surfing.• 285 Nishi-ku Nishiura, Fukuoka-shi, FukuokaAfter a couple of days in Fukuoka, catch the bus or train to Dazaifu, nine miles south-east of the city. This seventh-century settlement was Kyushu’s administration centre for more than 500 years, from the year 663. The main tourist sight is Tenmangu Shrine, which was built in 903 on the grave of the scholar and politician Sugawara Michizane. The ornate red-and-gold shrine is large by Japanese standards – 250 metres wide – and set beside an enormous pond in the shape of the kanji character for “heart”.You approach along a cobbled street that is lined with vendors selling everything from wooden trinkets said to bring good luck to the umegae mochi unique to Dazaifu, rice balls filled with azuki bean paste and grilled with plum blossoms – a nod to the 6,000 or so plum trees that surround the shrine.Inspiration Follow: @fukuokadeeps on Instagram, an account showcasing the rare sites of the city, from forgotten statues to little-known temples.By Noriyuki Yamashita, shochu enthusiast and owner of Glocal Bar Vibes, @glocal_bar_vibesMy city in a nutshell Kumamoto city is built around the 17th-century Kumamoto Castle – considered one of the “top three castles” of Japan. In 1877, it successfully withstood a 20,000-strong samurai attack for nearly two months. In 2016, it faced another attack: a magnitude 7.3 earthquake. Although parts of the building were damaged, it stills stands on its grassy mount as a symbol of Kumamoto’s resilience. To the west lie the islands of Amakusa, and to the east, the volcanic mountains of Aso, making Kumamoto a great base for exploring Kyushu island’s wild side. But don’t rush to leave the city too quickly: after dark, the side streets around Shimotori and Kamitori (Kumamoto’s two main strips) come to life, packed with hundreds of tiny izakayas (bars) that deserve at least a few nights of your attention.If you do one thingSuizenji Jojuen is a 17th-century garden considered one of the most beautiful in Japan, full of arched stone bridges, plum trees and herons standing stoically at the water’s edge. It was designed in the kaiyu-shiki-teien style, leading visitors clockwise around a pond. The various elements of the garden are meant to reflect the 53 stops or post stations of the Tokaido – a road that connected Tokyo (then named Edo) with Kyoto. You’ll head across a replica of Tokyo’s Nihonbashi Bridge, pass a miniature Mount Fuji and finish at the Kokin Denju No Ma teahouse, transported to Suizenji in 1912 from Kyoto’s Imperial Palace. Stop for tea on the tatami mats (£4, including a sweet treat), watching the koi carp and turtles swim in the pond.My favourite place to eat Hero Umi izakaya specialises in seafood, getting its catch fresh each day from the Amakusa islands – the archipelago is just an hour away and is known for its high-quality hauls. At lunchtime, the fisherman’s bowl (ryoshi no makanai donburi, £7.50) is an assortment of sashimi caught that morning, served with rice and soup. In the evening, large sashimi platters come paired with a 120-minute nomihodai (all-you-can-drink) menu (from £30, call ahead to book). Don’t leave without ordering a side of basashi (raw horse meat) – a popular Kumamoto delicacy. • hero-umi Where to stayMaruko Hotel, a 120-year-old establishment just off the Kamitori, has the charm of an old-style ryokan but with the convenience of a sleek city centre hotel. You’ll find tatami rooms with roll-out futons, as well as western-style bedrooms. There are male and female hot-springs baths, a private bath you can reserve for your group, and a tiny outside tub so you can soak in the open air. Dinner is served in traditional ryokan style, with lots of colourful small plates of pickles, fish, tofu and endless bowls of rice.• doubles from £170 room only, set meals from £15What the guidebooks overlook My own shochu bar, Glocal Bar Vibes (a “local” bar for “global” people). As the bar owner I’m biased, but you can seriously feel Kumamoto. We sell over 120 different kinds of shochu – a distilled spirit made from barley, potato or rice. It’s the most popular alcoholic drink in southern Japan (not sakenihonshu, as most people think). On Tuesdays we do an all-English night – no Japanese speaking allowed. It’s a great chance to drink with the locals.• Arita BLD 3F, Chūō-kuHead to the southern city of Hitoyoshi – a 90-minute drive through 24 tunnels, or a 150-minute steam train along the Kuma River (£20 one-way). Even for Japanese tourists, this is about as inaka (rural) as it gets. The city is sometimes called Little Kyoto because of its red-lacquered shrine gates, Edo-style teahouses and hot-spring baths. But there’s also another reason to visit: shochu, the distinctively Japanese liquor made since the 16th century. There are 28 distilleries in the Hitoyoshi-Kuma valley, and the “Kuma shochu” name has World Trade Organisation protection. Distillery tours always end with a generous shochu tasting, so you may want to stay the night: I recommend Nabeya Honkan, beside the rushing Kuma River.Inspiration Follow: @kumalikecom on instagram (or visit their website: kumalike) for tips on the best restaurants, bars and attractions, as decided by the locals.Read: asianwanderlustenkumamoto-japan – a great blog giving you and in-depth account of the top things to do and places to stay in Kumamoto This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Our writer straps in for the high-altitude thrill of his lifeI am standing on an enormous limestone plateau almost 3km up, peering over the edge of a cliff that seems to plunge all the way to the centre of the Earth. Behind me in the distance are stratified towers of rock, their tips gleaming through wisps of cloud in the morning sun. And in front of me is this breathtaking drop, the gateway to what our guide Alessio calls “the danger zone”.Alessio stands on the edge, beckons us nearer, then says: “We’re going to have fun in here.” And over we go, white-faced and silent, feeling like we’re leaping out of a plane. But instead our boots crunch down onto a concealed ledge that rapidly leads to a heart-pounding procession of cables, rungs and ladders banged into the sheer sides of the rock, all of which have turned this soaring, rippling cliff into one giant vertical adventure park. The white faces soon turn red and sweaty, the silence gives way to gasps and loud exclamations.This descent, the most exhilarating of my life, was a whole new way of experiencing the Dolomites, that magnificent mountain range in northern Italy. We had walked right through this spellbinding landscape the year before, from north to south. But now, instead of heading for the passes, we were tackling the lofty peaks – an endeavour only made possible by what may well be Italy’s greatest gift to the planet: its extraordinarily numerous and utterly electrifying via ferrata routes.Via ferrata translates as “the way of iron”, which is what these climbing aids were made of when they were first fixed to rock faces during the first world war, when Italian and Austrian troops fought ferocious battles on these mountains. Today they’re made of steel – and superbly maintained. On this spectacular stretch, known as the Francesco Berti, the via ferrata opened up what would otherwise have been a preposterously treacherous descent down, through, under and across smooth slabs, notched ridges, spiky outcrops and tottering ledges that can quickly thin to nothing. The drop was about 1km. The thrill was immeasurable.Via ferrata works like this: you wear a harness with two leashes, each bearing a sturdy quick-release clip at the end. These you attach to the cable, always keeping at least one latched on. There are no ropes to lug around no nuts, hexes or other fiddly anchors to fasten to the rock no elaborate knots to master. That is not to say there are no risks and never any accidents. If you have any doubts at all about your ability, it’s wise to book a guide who will assess your competence and fitness. The cable won’t stop you falling but it will stop you from falling too far and it has a shock absorber built in. Climbers should be fully aware of the risks in advance, as well as the weather forecast, and have proper kit.At the start, I was seeking out holds, thinking this would provide a more authentic experience, letting me feel at one with the mountain. But after about 10 minutes, I was completely at one with the cable, gripping it with both fists and even my knees – particularly when, after one ill-judged stretch, I slowly spun through 180 degrees and found myself facing outwards, feet dangling in thin air, gazing at nothing but blue skies and distant summits. The cable, I realised, is there to be grabbed.When people gasp at your photographs, at those giddying images of you nonchalantly hanging off a pinnacle nosing up into the stratosphere, you have to fight the urge to blurt out: “It’s actually not that hard!” We’re not even climbers. We’re hillwalkers. And we’re pretty rubbish. The four of us have got lost on every big peak in the Scottish Highlands, and plenty of small ones too.But there we were on the Giro del Sorapiss – a grade three route, according to Cicerone’s guidebook, on a scale that rises to six – each feeling like Spider-Man as we scaled up, down and along its via ferrata sections. You just get a huge amount of high-altitude bang for your buck: the chance to feel like a real mountaineer while soaking up those stunning views. From isolated peaks to sprawling saw-toothed ranges, everywhere you look there’s yet another cross-hatched, vertical colossus – all formed of fossilised coral reef thrust up from the seabed 50 million years ago when Italy battered into Europe. Corbusier called the Dolomites the greatest architecture on Earth and we were right in the heart of it.The rock formed by this tumult is perfect for climbing, which is one of the reasons why the Dolomites have the world’s highest concentration of via ferrata routes, roughly 170. But there is a downside: the routes are understandably popular, especially in summer when crowds and queues can detract from their wild character. That’s why it was great to make our debut on Sorapiss, a longer, more out-of-the-way route. The epic circuit (or giro) takes two days and includes a lengthy pair of practically sheer via ferratas: the Alfonso Vandelli lifts you up high on the first day the Francesco Berti spins you back down on the second. “We won’t see many people today,” said Alessio as we set off. “This route is wild.”The Giro del Sorapiss is also a terrific introduction to the world of refuges, those magical hostels that pepper the trails and are a vital part of any Dolomites trip, allowing you to venture far into the mountains, hiking from hut to splendidly located hut. Some are well-equipped, others more cramped and basic, but all are unfailingly welcoming, right down to the window-boxes spilling over with alpine blooms.You may get the odd remote refuge that lacks showers and hot water, but they’ll still manage to bring you mounds of freshly grated parmesan with every hot and hearty meal, and a pair of fancy slippers or Crocs to change into the moment you arrive and wearily pull off your boots.We arrived in Venice, drove two hours north into the Dolomites, parked in a layby, then hiked up for an hour or so to stay first at Rifugio Vandelli, one of the more spartan refuges but very friendly. It is here that the Giro del Sorapiss begins, by a turquoise lake ringed by dwarf pine. There was a mood of trepidation in the tavern that night: maps and tips were nervously exchanged, but people kept largely to themselves, quietly playing cards and nipping out to catch the glorious sunset before turning in early.The next night at Rifugio San Marco – a gorgeous cuckoo clock of a refuge swaddled by mountains – it was party time. “How did you get on?” yelled Ed, a 65-year-old New Yorker who was walking the circuit with his son. “Did you get caught in the hail?” As we sank our beers in the garden’s fading light, we told Ed we’d dodged the brief burst of afternoon hail by sheltering under a ledge, but had then got trapped there by a flash flood cascading down the mountainside. Alessio had to rope us together and lead us through the gap behind the torrent, which would have swept away anyone in its path.“No!” said Ed, eyes popping. He ran off to tell his son before dashing back to add: “Hey, have you guys tried the solar-powered showers? They’re outdoor and unisex – very European! And the water’s warm enough to be pleasant.”He was right. Besides the hail, we’d had nothing but searing sun all day. But when my turn came to shower, a snap electrical storm suddenly descended, lighting up the peaks all around me in flash after flash. It might not have been the wisest idea, to stand under water pouring from a metal faucet on a tree-lined mountainside as lightning blazed, but I wouldn’t have missed that shower, or lovely family-run San Marco, for anything.In the bar later, the refuge’s guitar was passed around and, as an enthusiastic cross-language singsong developed, a group of Italian hikers began doing magic tricks and asking us for Scottish tunes. Platefuls of steaming goulash and bolognese soon followed, rounded off with sublime strudel, grappa by the ladleful, and louder singing.Alessio had been wary when I first floated the idea of finishing our via ferrata odyssey with a Dolomites classic: the mighty Punta Anna, a hair-raising grade five route right up the face of Tofana di Mezzo, which rises ridiculously steeply to a whopping 3,244 metres. But having been with us on Sorapiss, he relented and, after a short drive and a hike, we found ourselves strolling into Rifugio Pomedes, near the Punta Anna starting point.A much larger refuge, Pomedes couldn’t match San Marco for charm, but it did have compensations: en suite rooms a menu boasting beetroot gnocchi brushed with poppy-seed butter and a stuffed squirrel doing via ferrata up its foyer walls. “Your face looks familiar,” we overheard one climber say to another out on the terrace. “Didn’t we meet on the Matterhorn?” Clearly, we had entered another level.In the morning, the route – exposed, airy and a good deal more technical – shot us straight up the cliffside, with big reaches, crazy drops, sketchy footholds, and quite a few heart-stopping sticking points. After the five most adrenaline-fuelled hours of our lives, we reached the top of Punta Anna and broke out the whisky for a celebratory nip in the rarefied air.Accommodation Dorm beds at Rifugio Vandelli start at €52, Rifugio San Marco €53, Rifugio Pomedes €60 (all half-board).• This article was amended on 16 September 2019 to stress that anyone embarking on a via ferrata trip should research the risks and those unsure of their ability should book a guide.Looking for a holiday with a difference?

She added that some of the roads “don’t have the tarmac on,” while a number of homes had “major problems” that needed to be put right. Several are still covered in scaffolding.Porter added that many of the benefits HAB promised to the community, including allotments, an orchard, a cycle path and two electric cars with charging points, had yet to be delivered.“There’s a building site where the orchard and allotments should be,” said Porter, a county and city councillor who lives less than two miles from the site. She added she did not want “the public purse” to have to pay for “HAB’s mess-up”.HAB has not denied there have been problems but added it had been carrying out work on the houses and providing frequent progress updates.The claims relating to the development in Kings Worthy, near Winchester in Hampshire, deal a fresh blow to the Channel 4 presenter, whose property empire has been hit by financial problems.On 10 September it emerged that attempts to restructure the HAB Land bonds had failed, despite the investors having been effectively warned that if they did not back the proposals, HAB Land was at risk of being wound up or falling into insolvency. The directors of the company said they were considering their “next steps”.McCloud set up HAB Housing – the “HAB” stands for “Happiness Architecture Beauty” – in 2007, and then HAB Land in 2014.Lovedon Fields is a 50-home development with prices originally starting at £467,500. It received planning permission in 2015 and, according to Porter, it was originally due to be completed in 2017, though this was later pushed back to the following year.It is understood the first residents moved on to the site in mid-2017. But in March 2019, following a newspaper article that highlighted problems at the development, McCloud acknowledged residents had received a “poor service,” adding: “I’m personally very sorry for the delays and problems caused… and I am putting a plan in place to fix them.”More than six months on, locals claim there is still a catalogue of problems to deal with. A nearby resident said: “The financial scandal for bondholders is only one half of the story – the other is the more human and as awful: the poor house owners left with totally unfinished roadssiteamenities.”He added that the biggest worry was that locals could be left with “a bomb site of a legacy to gaze upon, let alone all the snaggingrepairs that need doing on the houses themselves”.“It’s very disappointing and could cost the community a lot to put the dreadful state of the site to rights, but I’m determined it should not be a public expense,” added Porter.In a statement, a HAB Land spokesperson said: “With regard to our Lovedon Fields development, understandably, we have been prioritising works on the houses of our homebuyers which we have been diligently undertaking. Throughout this process we have been in continual dialogue with our homebuyers, the parish and city councils, and other stakeholders, with frequent updates on progress and planned activities.”The spokesperson added that the directors were continuing to explore and evaluate all options after the vote put to bondholders did not pass."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/948fd323ebf4ceac2d8d6fa581bf31edaefe70e9/0_52_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=858e90227e3193ff6031ae1bb5dcd6ec","title":"simple tips for blitzing your work to do list","story":"You don’t need to master mindfulness or download a complicated productivity app to stay on top of your adminEver get to that stage where you seem to be spending all your time and energy just putting things off? You know you should get stuff done but you find yourself weighed down by the tyranny of your to-do list.And, of course, the more you put something off, the larger the looming shadow it casts. This is particularly insidious when it comes to dull-but-essential tasks, such as admin.And if you’re running a small business, it can be even harder to discipline yourself, especially if you’re working on your own or from home. Moreover, the burden of business admin can feel particularly oppressive, sapping your ability to focus on growing your company.The internet is full of life hacks and tips to help you break this cycle of inertia. But all-too-often the suggestions feel like just another thing to add to your to-do list. Likewise, techniques for improving your time management can sometimes seem a bit, well, time-consuming.Happily, however, there are a number of quick-and-easy tips that you can implement immediately – whether it’s advice for beating procrastination, resisting unhelpful impulses or countering your phobia of finances.For instance, when it comes to tackling the urge to check your social media, try thinking about how bad you’d feel in the near future having failed to complete the task at hand.Or if you’re trying to avoid procrastinating, tell someone else your intended goals for that particular day. This will make you feel more accountable – after all, it’s harder to break an intention that you’ve declared to others than it is to break a promise that you’ve made to yourself.There are also practical techniques for tackling some of the peskier admin tasks that tend to linger on people’s to-do lists – such as nailing your tax return, managing your web presence, and getting the correct kind of business insurance.1. Beat procrastinationProcrastinating doesn’t mean you’re workshy. It’s more likely to mean you’re just trying to stop yourself from feeling bad – either because you have to do something you’d rather not, or you’re worried you won’t be able to complete the task. So, try to focus on the positive outcome instead.2. Control your impulsesIn a world increasingly governed by instant gratification and the addictiveness of our smartphones, the ability to control our impulses is essential to getting things done. But try to think of this as a two-stage process: first, resist the temptation by making it harder to act on that initial urge – for instance by locking your phone in a drawer so you can’t check social media. And, second, maintain that resistance by consciously forming new positive habits.3. Overcome your financial phobiaAdmin avoidance can stem from a general anxiety about financial literacy. According to Brad Klontz, a financial psychologist and author, one way to combat this is to find yourself a financial mentor: “A great way to challenge your beliefs is to find someone who’s a step or two ahead, pick their brains, and become a student of their money mindset.”4. Tackle time managementOne simple trick is to try to become more aware of the value of each moment. “Remember every task comes with a cost,” says podcaster and author Ellen Hendriksen. “Be mindful about what task you are choosing to spend your time on, because that is time not doing other tasks.”5. Find your flowBeing “in the zone” or achieving a “flow state” can give us the focus and energy to perform at our best. One trick is to insulate yourself from tasks that might otherwise distract you by scheduling time in the week to do all the bits of admin that would otherwise intrude.6. Tooling yourself upThe popular idiom holds that a bad worker always blames their tools, but perhaps the opposite is also true: a good worker will always give them credit. Having the right kit helps you signal to yourself your intention to do a job well. In short, if we have good tools, we’re more likely to look forward to using them.7. Nail your tax returnAdopt so-called “microproductivity” methods by breaking this annual round of torture into a series of smaller tasks. These can then fit into those little moments of spare time we occasionally find ourselves with. For instance, try to view each figure that you need to obtain as a distinct task to be completed on its own.8. Manage your web presenceOne byproduct of ramping up your web presence is you can be inundated with demand that you can’t meet. “You turn your advertising off then,” says Jimmy McCann, head of digital strategy at Search Laboratory, which helps clients with online advertising. “It would also be worth having an overflow network to pass stuff on to and get a kickback.”9. Prepare a loan pitchSometimes a business needs a cash injection – whether it’s for upgrading equipment or premises, or just a bridging loan to help with a short-term cashflow problem. However, asking for money and demonstrating an ability to repay it can be stressful and time-consuming. Try to minimise the anxiety and avoid the possible pitfalls by being realistic about your projections – that way you can give a solid timeframe for repayments.10. Get insuredIt can be tempting to put off taking out business insurance. It can linger at the bottom of your to-do list because of the complacent attitude that “it won’t happen to us”. Part of the problem is that many people don’t appreciate the sheer number of possible hazards that exist in the workplace and their potential fallout – whether from accidental damage, disruption or injury. Often, it’s the anticipated complexity of sorting out cover, rather than the cost, that puts people off. But getting the right cover can be simpler than you’d think.For expanded advice on how to overcome common obstacles to getting things done, go to thewhats-stopping-you"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03190ff378e38f4baba04bb16fea2155de26daad/0_350_2716_1629/master/2716.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d85d6515f026953b8fa46e5271fe8ca7","title":"irans supreme leader rules out any talks with us officials ayatollah ali khamenei","story":"Ayatollah Ali Khamenei shuts down speculation about Trump-Rouhani meeting at UNIran’s supreme leader has announced there will be “no negotiations on any level” with US officials, in remarks aimed at dousing speculation of a possible summit between Donald Trump and Hassan Rouhani on the sidelines of the UN general assembly next week.The departure of the US national security adviser, John Bolton, an advocate of forceful anti-Iran policies, from the White House last week, along with the scheduled arrival of the Iranian president in New York had raised the possibility of renewed high-level talks between the countries after months of escalating threats and military posturing.On Monday, Trump appeared to leave the door open for discussion even as he hinted at military action against Iran, which members of his cabinet have blamed for the weekend’s attacks on Saudi Arabian petroleum infrastructure.However, in remarks posted on his official website on Tuesday, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s highest authority, appeared to rule out the possibility of any meeting between Trump and Rouhani, at least in the short term.“If America takes back its words and repents and returns to the nuclear deal, which they have violated, they can take part in the meetings of signatories to this agreement with Iran,” Khamenei said. “Otherwise, no negotiation on any level will happen between officials of the Islamic Republic and America, neither in New York nor anywhere else.”In July 2015, Iran and a six-nation negotiating group reached a landmark agreement known as the\u0026nbspJoint Comprehensive Plan of Action\u0026nbspthat\u0026nbspended a 12-year deadlock\u0026nbspover Tehran’s nuclear programme. The deal, struck in Vienna after nearly two years of intensive talks, limited the Iranian programme, to reassure the rest of the world that it cannot develop nuclear weapons, in return for sanctions relief.The six major powers involved in the nuclear talks with\u0026nbspIran\u0026nbspwere in a group known as the P5+1: the UN security council’s five permanent members – China, France, Russia, the UK and the US – and Germany. The nuclear deal is also enshrined in a UN security council resolution that incorporated it into international law. The 15 members of the council at the time unanimously endorsed the agreement.On 8 May 2018, US president Donald Trump pulled his country out of the deal. Iran announced its partial withdrawal from the nuclear deal a year later.Khamenei is traditionally opposed to dialogue with the US, and made regular pessimistic statements during negotiations for the 2015 global agreement to curb Iran’s nuclear programme. He came out in support of the deal once it was reached, arguing Iran had shown “heroic flexibility”.The US pulled out of the agreement last year, with Trump arguing it was too narrowly focused on Iran’s nuclear programme and did nothing to address the country’s missile development, human rights abuses and sponsorship of militias in the Middle East.As part of a “maximum pressure” campaign intended to bring Tehran to the table, Washington imposed harsh sanctions on Iranian exports which have choked the country’s economy, including its oil industry.In the past four months, at least 13 oil tankers in the Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz have been seized by Iranian forces or been targeted by acts of sabotage, starting on 12 May with the appearance of large holes in the hulls of four ships docked in Fujairah, one of the United Arab Emirates. The US and Saudi Arabia have repeatedly accused Iran of perpetrating the damage. Tehran denies the allegations.Separately, Iran’s judiciary confirmed on Tuesday that it had detained three Australians, including two with British nationality, whose arrests were made public earlier this month.The detainee accused of spying is though to be a woman identified last week as a University of Melbourne lecturer, Kylie Moore-Gilbert, though earlier reports had said she had already been convicted and sentenced to 10 years in prison. It is not clear which “third country” Gilbert-Moore has been accused of spying for.The two accused of taking pictures are Jolie King and her boyfriend Mark Firkin, a travel blogging couple who are thought to have been flying a drone without authorisation.Holly Dagres, a non-resident fellow at the Washington-based thinktank, the Atlantic Council, said Khamenei’s latest comments appeared to reinforce a hard line, but his mention of the nuclear deal did leave room for dialogue.Iran’s actions over the past months were calculated to send Washington a clear message, she said. “They’re telling the US that if you don’t come and sit down with us, things are going to get worse.”Trump stressed on Monday that Riyadh would have to play a leading role in any retaliatory strike against Iran, especially when it came to paying for it.“The fact is the Saudis are going to have a lot of involvement in this, if we decide to do something,” he told reporters. “They’ll be very much involved, and that includes payment. And they understand that fully.”The Saudi military spokesman for the Riyadh-led coalition fighting in Yemen said it was understood Iranian-made weapons had been used in the attack, but stopped short of blaming Iran.“The investigation is continuing and all indications are that weapons used in both attacks came from Iran,” Col Turki al-Maliki told reporters in Riyadh."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f0185a0c95ecfda1a45b6c430a4651d297ab9b1/0_64_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=155f6926bd5d275db3cfa594fc9b09ec","title":"israel election voters head to the polls for second time this year","story":"Netanyahu campaign has demonised Israel’s Arab minority and vowed to annex much of Palestinian territoriesIsrael elections: everything you need to knowIsraelis are going to the polls in the country’s second election this year, following a campaign dominated by Benjamin Netanyahu and his vows to implement a far-right, ultranationalist agenda in exchange for a record fifth term as leader.Facing the prospect of criminal corruption indictments and hoping to extend his unmatched stint in the prime minister’s office, Netanyahu has promised to declare up to a third of the occupied Palestinian territories as part of Israel if he is re-elected.His campaign also demonised Israel’s large Arab minority as a fifth column that endangers the country, allied itself with the extremist Jewish Power faction, and warned that the election could be stolen by fraud in Arab areas. And Netanyahu last week reportedly considered a major military operation against Gaza.“Citizens of Israel, we find ourselves at the high point of a historic change in the history of the Jewish people and the State of Israel,” the 69-year-old prime minister wrote in the Maariv newspaper on Monday.He claimed he had spent the past three decades fighting to keep Israel’s military presence in the Palestinian territories despite “the pressures of the Clinton and Obama administration”.“I am now asking for your confidence so as to complete this historic task and to fortify the State of Israel’s borders and security forever.”The Israeli PM is embroiled in four cases involving allegations of bribery and misconduct. He denies wrongdoing in every instance.Case 1000\u0026nbspis an investigation into gifts received on a regular basis by Netanyahu and his family from two wealthy businessmen, including cigars and pink champagne.Case 2000\u0026nbspis examining whether Netanyahu behaved improperly during a taped conversation with a newspaper publisher in which he appeared to try to negotiate more sympathetic coverage in return for lowering the circulation of a rival paper.Case 3000\u0026nbspis an inquiry into alleged kickbacks in a deal to buy German submarines. Netanyahu is not a suspect, but he was closely involved in the deal and the case has ensnared members of his inner circle.\u0026nbspCase 4000, the most serious,\u0026nbspinvolves allegations that Netanyahu offered incentives to the Israeli telecoms company Bezeq in exchange for positive stories in an online news website it owns, Walla.Asked if that included the hundreds of Jews who live under heavy military guard amid tens of thousands of Palestinians in Hebron, Netanyahu responded: “Of course.”More than 6.3 million people are eligible to vote at polling stations that will close at 10pm (8pm BST) on Tuesday, after which exit polls will be reported.With a razor-thin margin expected between Netanyahu and his main rival, Benny Gantz of the Blue and White party, an inconclusive result where neither has a clear path to forming a coalition government is a potential outcome. That deadlock could plunge Israel into another political crisis, with the prospect of weeks of tense deal-making or even a third election.Gantz, a security hawk who focused his campaign on Netanyahu’s alleged corruption and anti-democratic moves, also wrote in Monday’s edition of Maariv, slamming the prime minister for “spins and telling lies”.The former head of the army, who describes himself as a centrist but also supports annexing Palestinian land, promised he would employ “disproportionate force” to fight off frequent rocket attacks from Gaza.Outside his polling station on Tuesday, Gantz said his party “will bring hope, we will be bring change, without corruption, without extremism”.As with every Israeli election, security has been a key issue, with Netanyahu’s opponents attempting to paint him as indecisive and conflict-averse. When the prime minister was whisked away by his security team at a campaign event during a Palestinian militant rocket attack from Gaza, Netanyahu’s political foes jumped on the incident to portray him as weak.The local Haaretz newspaper reported on Monday that later that night, Netanyahu had considered launching a significant military operation in Gaza, one that may have delayed the election, but was advised against it. The government denied the report.Israel is holding a repeat election just five months after the last one. This time, all eyes will be on Avigdor Lieberman, Netanyahu’s former right-hand man, whose refusal to join a coalition government with Jewish ultra-Orthodox parties in May led to a cascade of events that resulted in the second vote.His staunchly secular stance against religious politicians appears to have drawn support from the nonreligious right wing, and he could come out as the kingmaker who decides Israel’s next prime minister.Lieberman wants Netanyahu to form a unity government with the opposition, but Gantz has ruled out serving with him. Netanyahu, the longest-serving prime minister in Israeli history, is also very unlikely to sit in a government headed by anyone but himself.At the West Jerusalem polling station where Netanyahu voted earlier in the day, Hannah, a 36-year-old government employee who refused to give her last name, said she was voting for Lieberman in order defeat Netanyahu. “When I grew up in Jerusalem, most neighbourhoods were secular. Now most are religious,” she said. “We feel it every day in Jerusalem.”In preparation for election day, the military closed crossings with the occupied West Bank, where more than 2.5 million Palestinians live under Israeli rule but cannot vote, and Gaza, where 2 million more live under a blockade.As in previous elections, Netanyahu has warned of defeat at the hands of politicians from Israel’s Arab minority and “leftists” in an attempt to boost rightwing turnout. Last week, Facebook temporarily shut down a chatbot on his official page for breaching the company’s hate speech policy after it warned of Arabs who “want to destroy us all”.Israel’s Arab parties could win significant votes after reunifying into a single alliance, similar to 2015 when they became the third-largest force in the Knesset. It is possible they could gather enough seats to block Netanyahu’s premiership."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"President opens ploughing championship expressing concern for vulnerable farmersCompany blames on-going blockades for lay-offsAngela Irwin (54) also pleaded guilty at Antrim court to falsely ordering prescriptionAdam Kelly (17) from Skerries has developed a tool that helps to develop super computersTemperatures due to reach 20 degrees on Wednesday and ThursdayEtihad Airways said ersion of flight was a \u0026lsquoprecaution\u0026rsquoCritics say it will reduce access to river in city centre through use of concrete walls along quaysPresident says emerging employment trends \u0026lsquoreduce employees\u0026rsquo hard-won labour rights\u0026rsquoCommittee decides the evidence presented could not support a finding against doctorFemale passenger uninjured in incidentDes Long says he sat opposite Adams at meetings of the IRA\u0026rsquos Army CouncilSecond day of disruption following a failed tram on Suir RoadAtheist parent alleges son discriminated against for not attending Communion choirDepartment has written to Data Protection Commissioner outlining \u0026lsquoinconsistencies\u0026rsquoFire safety shortcomings estimated to cost \u0026euro11,000-\u0026euro14,000 per apartment to remedyWarning comes as Northern Secretary holds talks aimed at restarting Stormont assemblyApartments on sale for \u0026euro260,000, close to what they originally made at top of marketCompleted reconstruction of Dublin estate set to top five times original estimateLimits allow for budget-day package of \u0026euro2.8 billion, with \u0026euro2.1 billion already committedConstitution gives parents a right to withdraw their child from religion classes"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4020842.1568720202!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dry and sunny weather for first day of ploughing championships","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDry and sunny spells are forecast for the coming days, as thousands of people descend on the annual National Ploughing Championships in Co Carlow.

Photograph: PA Former Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams’ assertion that he was never a member of the IRA is a “lie”, a former IRA leader has claimed in a new BBC TV series on the Troubles. Mr Adams has consistently denied that he was a member of the IRA. Des Long, who was on the IRA’s army executive for 17 years, says Mr Adams was the chairman of the IRA’s Army Council and sat opposite him at executive meetings. His interview is to be screened tonight as part of the second episode of Spotlight on the Troubles: A Secret History, a seven-part BBC Northern Ireland documentary investigating the Troubles. When presenter, Darragh MacIntyre, puts it to Mr Long that Mr Adams “wasn’t in the IRA”, Mr Long laughs. “You can’t be on the army council unless you’re a volunteer, and you can’t be chairman of the army council unless you’re a member of the army council, and I sat opposite him in meetings,” he responds. “That lie he comes out with that he was never in the IRA, that’s a lie, and I’m saying that now as having sat opposite him in meetings. I’ll probably get shot for it, but I’m saying it,” he adds. Earlier this year, Mr Adams told the inquest into the British army’s killing of 10 people in Ballymurphy in west Belfast in 1971 that: “I was not a member of the IRA, I have never disassociated myself with the IRA, and I never will, until the day I die.” Republican split In the programme, Mr McIntyre explains Mr Adams declined to take part in the series. He also says Mr Long fell out with Mr Adams in 1986 during a wider republican split. Speaking on BBC Radio Ulster, the Sinn Féin MLA Conor Murphy rejected the claims, saying they were “not new” and Mr Adams had “consistently denied them.” “I know the programme has to trail titbits to try and excite some interest every Monday or Tuesday, he said. “These allegations have been made over the years, they have been consistently denied and I think you have to look at the people who are making the allegations to see what their motivation is” he said. “I was aware that he was a highly intelligent man and that he had never used a pistol or thrown a bomb,” says Lord Ramsbotham, “but he was definitely a strategic planner of the highest order and I thought certainly he was directing the political direction of the IRA.” The episode begins in 1972, the bloodiest year of the conflict, which the IRA anticipated would be its “year of victory”. It includes rediscovered footage which was filmed for an American documentary, The Secret Army, which shows a bomb attack being planned and carried out in Belfast, gunmen in Derry, and weapons classes for IRA recruits. It includes images of the planning and execution of a bomb attack on the Queen’s University Sports Hall in Belfast in May 1972, in which several people were hurt. IRA ceasefireThe programme also reveals new details about the IRA ceasefire of 1975 which include the claim that Britain had agreed to discuss its withdrawal from Northern Ireland. But a document written by the most senior official in the Northern Ireland Office and uncovered by the BBC reveals the British plan was to weaken the IRA by “stringing them along”. The former commander of the IRA in Belfast, Billy McKee - who died earlier this year - said that “on the table was British withdrawal. They came to us, they sent for us at that time, we didn’t go to them,” he says. The IRA met with the British “over a dozen times”,” he explained. “I was convinced they were very serious.” The programme also reveals a secret British army report from 1978 on “Northern Ireland Future Terrorist Trends”, which concluded in 1978 that the IRA was “well equipped, more professional and capable of waging war for the foreseeable future.” The first programme in the series, which was broadcast last week, included claims that the former DUP leader Ian Paisley supplied money to the UVF to carry out a number of bombings in 1969. It also contains rare footage of the former deputy first minister, Martin McGuinness, allegedly preparing a car bomb for an attack on Derry’s Guildhall in 1972. Episode Two of Spotlight on the Troubles: A Secret History will be shown Tuesday, September 17th at 9pm on BBC One Northern Ireland and BBC Four."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons september 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraph matt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Brexit latest news: Follow and watch Supreme Court prorogation hearing liveJodie Chesney was \u0026#39blameless\u0026#39 bystander in \u0026#39pathetic drug turf war\u0026#39 when she was murdered, court hearsLuxembourg PM\u0026#39s \u0026#39empty-chairing\u0026#39 of Boris causes unease in Berlin - but he is warmly greeted by Emmanuel MacronMaori tribe bans replica of \u0026#39barbarian\u0026#39 Captain Cook\u0026#39s ship from port on journey to make 250th anniversaryTop PR firms turn down opportunity to fix Hong Kong\u0026#39s reputationFood festival condemned for parading endangered blue shark through street before cooking and eating itComment: Boris Johnson\u0026#39s secret plan to escape delaying Brexit may well lie in the Incredible Hulk\tIran\u0026#39s supreme leader says talks with US \u0026#39on any level\u0026#39 out of question Comment: Farewell, BBC Red Button – now we can finally let Ceefax rest in peaceComment: Dithering Corbyn is right to fear being eclipsed by Jo Swinson\u0026#39s fanatical support for Remain\tComment: Hysterical little Luxembourg\u0026#39s dirty trick proves we are right to leave the EULondon theatre: the best plays and shows on now\u0026#39He ruined our country\u0026#39 -  readers on David Cameron\u0026#39s return to the public eyeItalian former prime minister Matteo Renzi forms new party in blow to week-old coalitionComment: No wonder Luxembourg\u0026#39s PM is cross about Brexit — it is overturning the EU gravy train\tThai \u0026#39Tiger Temple\u0026#39 blames government for deaths of rescued tigersComment: Here\u0026#39s how Boris Johnson can avoid delaying Brexit and deliver a no-deal by October 31 legally\tIsrael elections: Why it\u0026#39s do or die this time for Benjamin NetanyahuMan, 21, arrested in connection with Pc Andrew Harper\u0026#39s death after \u0026#39new evidence comes to light\u0026#39Cancer survivor becomes first to swim Channel four times non-stopPersonal alarms issued at Wolf of Wall Street theatre show to prevent sexual assaultWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/09/14/TELEMMGLPICT000209430458_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqFQfAtbbiWQ9LTv4s2yIts_GH8TDIoV-pDol7ykUJZu8.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"vacuous liberal wokeness now beyond parody","story":"Pop singer Sam Smith has come out as “non-binary”.Our half-baked obsession with \u0027ersity\u0027 is holding us back  ‘I was listening to them sing the other day, and their voice is no better than when they was a he.” No, ladies and gentlemen, the ’s sub editors have not gone on strike.

The album cover happened by chance – after hanging out on another shoot a few weeks later, Lane heard the band’s art director hassling them to choose an album cover. He’d brought his portfolio with him, which included the now-infamous “ass shot”.230 29) The Notorious BIG – Ready to DieBiggie Smalls picked a baby resembling himself to star on the cover of his debut Ready to Die. By doing so, he summed up the album’s autobiographical content, which begins with childhood and closes with death. He also uses the notion of childhood innocence to foreshadow how our surroundings can have a lasting impact.It might not be the quintessential David Bowie album, or the one that introduced fans to Starman. But the face staring back at you from this particular album cover is, undeniably, the most recognisable Bowie look: red mullet a gaunt, sombre expression and that famous lightning bolt across his face.One of the greatest debut albums – and arguably the best hip hop record – of all time has a fittingly arresting cover image. A photo of a seven-year-old Nas was superimposed over Danny Clinch’s snapshot of one of the housing projects in the New York rapper’s native Queensbridge. Designed by Aimee Macauley, it was intended to reflect how the projects used to be Nas’s entire world, “until I educated myself to see there’s more out there”. But Nas was also inviting you to see through his eyes and into those very projects where he grew up, and feel immersed in that world via the power of his storytelling.Years after its release, Kate Bush noted how The Dreaming was deemed by many to be her “she’s gone mad” album. Its multiple, disparate narratives and metamorphic production intertwine with movie influences, particularly music hall crime capers of Houdini’s era. On the sepia-toned album cover, Bush plays the role of the escapist’s wife, looking to the distance, rather than at his face, as though trying to contact him via a different medium than mere speech. The way she holds his face in her hands gives her an additional, mesmerising power and conjures the old-world, eccentric mysticism with which she was – and still is – associated.Photographer Michael Spencer Jones had a task on his hands organising Oasis for what is indisputably their best album cover. It was different to what the band originally envisioned – Noel Gallagher had spotted a photo of the Beatles sat round a coffee in Japan, so thought Oasis could be photographed at the dining table of guitarist Bonehead’s house in Manchester. Jones didn’t see this working, so spread the members around Bonehead’s living room instead, and asked them to bring objects that were personal to them for decoration. Noel liked Jones’s idea of hanging an inflatable globe (brought by one of the roadies) from the ceiling. “Yeah, global dominance,” he said. Soon after the album’s release, that’s exactly what happened.Andy Warhol conceived the idea of a vinyl cover with working zipper that would reveal a pair of white briefs beneath the bulging jeans of a male model, who has to this day never been identified. Many fans assumed it was Mick Jagger, but people working on the shoot said several models were photographed and Warhol never revealed which one was used. It represented what the Rolling Stones quickly became famous for: an edgy, hyper-sexual kind of swagger.German painter Mati Klarwein – who also created Santana’s artwork for Abraxas – was behind this gatefold cover that served as an embodiment of Davis’s creative manifesto. The surreal and complex renderings mirror what Davis does with the music itself challenging traditional notions of structure and juxtaposing concepts of passivity and aggressiveness, anger and love.930 22) ACDC – Back in BlackBack in Black’s all-black cover design fit the mood of a band emerging from dark times. In the wake of the death of vocalist Bon Scott, ACDC had tracked down Brian Johnson, whom Scott had previously mentioned to the band. Certain people at their record label, Atlantic, weren’t so keen on the cover, but the band were insistent: it was a memorial to Scott. And now one of the most instantly recognisable and best-loved album covers in rock history.Visually striking and symbolic of what Debbie Harry was doing both as a woman and an artist in the music industry, Parallel Lines’ cover was shot by photographer Edo Bertoglio. It was apparently rejected by the band but later chosen by their manager, Peter Leeds. The juxtaposition between the band, who beam in their matching dress suits like a bunch of schoolboys at their senior prom, and Harry, who stands defiant in her white dress, hands on hips, is wonderful. “I’m not impressed,” her stance seems to say. “Try harder.”Dylan walks arm-in-arm with then-girlfriend and muse Suze Rotolo through the West Village in freezing New York, February 1963. Rotolo described the circumstances to the New York Times in 2008: “He wore a very thin jacket, because image was all. Our apartment was always cold, so I had a sweater on, plus I borrowed one of his big, bulky sweaters. On top of that I put on a coat. So I felt like an Italian sausage. Every time I look at that picture, I think I look fat.” Yet her memoir, A Freewheelin’ Time, also noted the cover’s significance, how it “influenced the look of album covers precisely because of its casual down-home spontaneity and sensibility”.Led Zeppelin couldn’t have picked a better image to serve as a visual introduction to their fans. It’s an easy tactic – using a photo from a real-life tragedy, in this case the Hinderburg disaster, for shock factor. But it worked, and the cover went on to become one of the most indelible images in rock music.1330 18) Never Mind the Bollocks – Here’s the Sex Pistols“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks – Here’s the Sex Pistols. They’d caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Using the word “bollocks” on the front of their artwork caused instant censorship, and more controversy that would only benefit its performance. Despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts. Today, it is arguably the most recognisable punk album cover in music history.For a limited time, The Roots’ Grammy-nominated album Things Fall Apart was available with five different covers, which reflected each of the world’s “greatest turmoils”. The most enduring was a photograph taken during a Civil Rights Movement-era riot – a stark black and white image showing riot police as they chase two terrified black teenagers.Yes, Dark Side of the Moon, with Storm Thorgerson\u0027s geometric design, is the most iconic of Pink Floyd covers. But the shot he conceived for Wish You Were Here – taken by Aubrey ‘Po’ Powell – is by far the more visceral. It shows two businessmen shaking hands, with one of them on fire, and to the band it represented the fear of revealing your true feelings for fear of “getting burnt”. Two stuntmen were involved, with one (Ronnie Rondell Jr) dressed in a fire-retardant outfit covered by a business suit, and his head protected by a hood, covered beneath a wig. Unfortunately, high winds meant he lost his moustache and eyebrows to the flames. Hopefully he felt the resulting shot was worth it. Fans definitely think so.Just two of Fleetwood Mac’s then-five members appear on the cover of their best-selling and arguably greatest album. Stevie Nicks and Mick Fleetwood’s legs are entwined, which serves as a pretty good metaphor for the entanglement between band members that resulted in so many of the record’s lyrical back-and-forths. And really it’s just a gorgeous, classic image, photographed and conceived by Herbert W Worthington with the band, and designed by Desmond Strobel.The instantly iconic cover of It’s Blitz! shows little but says a lot. There’s a sense of female defiance in showing the woman’s hand, nails in red polish, crushing the egg, a symbol of fertility. It also embodies what the Yeah Yeah Yeahs did on this album, which is take traditional sounds, equipment and ideas and scramble them into something completely subversive.This shot was taken by celebrated photographer Herb Ritts, who later teamed up with Madonna for the “Like a Prayer” and “You Can Dance” covers. It is one of her most recognisable images, inspired in part by Andy Warhol’s pop art and also by the iconography of Madonna’s idol Marilyn Monroe. Here, she invites fans to make the immediate connection between pop art and commercial value, making her the first to exploit the late Eighties concept of pop artist as brand.The Clash paid tribute to Elvis Presley by mimicking the pink and green lettering from his 1956 self-titled album. Yet the image, one of the most iconic in rock history, blows that version of rock and roll to kingdom come: everything “safe” that the King had offered was replaced by Pennie Smith’s photograph of “the ultimate rock’n’roll moment – total loss of control”. Bassist Paul Simonon later told Fender that he’d smashed his guitar out of frustration with bouncers for not letting fans stand up from their seats at the Palladium in New York City. The captured moment is visceral, dangerous and anti-establishment – just like The Clash.Elvis Presley appears mid-belt on the cover of his self-titled album, clearly performing one of those iconic vocal whoops. It’s a visual introduction to rock’n’roll for his unsuspecting American audience, done 20 years before The Clash would replicate that classic pink and green lettering to do the same for their British fans.Six guys stare down toward the ground, one pointing a handgun right at the viewer. This is the cover art for Straight Outta Compton, the pioneering debut by NWA. The photographer was a 28-year-old white guy, Eric Poppleton, who was struggling to make ends meet after graduating from art school. He and his art director Kevin Hosman spent a day following the guys around alleys in LA, until Poppleton found a spot where he got on the ground and asked NWA’s members to stand over him, with one holding “what was hopefully an unloaded” gun. He had no idea the photograph would become one of the most iconic images in gangsta rap. Poppleton would go on to shoot four other NWA album covers.2230 9) Bruce Springsteen – Born in the USAThe Boss tells you everything you need to know about him with one image. An epitome of the blue collar American, Springsteen’s seventh album cover was shot by Annie Leibowitz and shows the artist’s from behind, dressed in worn blue jeans and a simple white t-shirt, with a red cap hanging out of the back pocket after a long day’s grind. “We took a lot of different types of pictures,” said Springsteen, “and in the end, the picture of my ass looked better than the picture of my face.” Combined with the American flag in the background, the cover parallels the themes of Springsteen’s music.An album cover that would inspire future generations of bands to slouch moodily against brick walls. The Ramones were near-impossible to gather together for a posed photograph, but Robert Bayley – a photographer for Punk magazine, managed to get a shot that captured the band perfectly. Wearing ripped jeans and leather jackets, they stare blankly at the camera through sunglasses, or fringes that half-conceal their eyes.Few album covers can profess to have literally stopped traffic, and it’s testament to the iconic status of Abbey Road’s artwork that thousands of fans have attempted to recreate it. The band, and photographer Iain McMillan, had just 10 minutes to get the shot, which was taken from a step-ladder while a police officer held up traffic behind the scenes. Six photos were taken, which McCartney later examined with a magnifying glass before making his decision.Before he tried to “break the internet” with a nude Kim Kardashian on the cover of Paper magazine, Jean-Paul Goude took some of the most memorable images of the Eighties for Grace Jones’s album Island Life. She appears on the cover in what looks like an impossible pose it is, in fact, a composite of her in different positions, cut and pasted together for one of the most striking images in music history.2630 5) The Velvet Underground and Nico – The Velvet Underground and NicoLike the working zipper of The Rolling Stones’ Sticky Fingers, early versions of The Velvet Underground and Nico asked the owner to “Peel slowly and see”, upon which they’d peel the banana skin to reveal a flesh-coloured banana beneath. MGM was happy to fork out for the additional costs of manufacturing the vinyl, with the assumption that its ties to Warhol would help boost sales. It’s one of very few albums where the person behind the album art, rather than the band themselves or the album title, are named on the cover.The cover art for Joy Division’s debut album was designed by Peter Saville, who had previously created posters for Manchester’s Factor Club in the late Seventies. The chosen image, which was picked by Bernard Sumner, is based on radio waves from pulsar CP 1919 – from the Cambridge Encyclopaedia of Astronomy. “The duochrome Peter Saville cover of this first Joy Division album speaks volumes,” Susie Goldring said in a review for BBC Online. “Its white on black lines reflect a pulse of power, a surge of bass, and raw angst. If the cover doesn\u0027t draw you in, the music will.With its star-studded cast and bold colour scheme, the cover of Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band came to define artist Peter Blake and also The Beatles themselves. There are 88 figures in all, including the band themselves, on a set photographed by Michael Cooper. Blake collected a list of names from three of the four Beatles. The list included Tony Curtis, Marilyn Monroe, Aubrey Beardsley, Oscar Wilde, and even Adolf Hitler (requested by John Lennon, and hidden behind other figures). If you bought the record, Blake later said, “you also bought a piece of art on exactly the level that I was aiming for”.Critic Camille Paglia once suggested that Robert Mapplethorpe’s photo of his former lover, friend and collaborator Patti Smith is the greatest ever taken of a woman, and seeing it, you feel inclined to agree. The godmother of punk herself said she thought she looked like Frank Sinatra, dressed in a crisp white shirt with a black ribbon around her neck. A black jacket with a horse brooch on the lapel is slung casually over her shoulder.  “The only rule we had was, Robert told me if I wore a white shirt, not to wear a dirty one,” Smith told NPR in 2010. “I got my favourite ribbon and my favourite jacket, and he took about 12 pictures. By the eighth one he said, \u0027I got it\u0027.”Photographer Colin Lane met the Strokes in early 2001, after being commissioned to shoot them for The Face magazine. The album cover happened by chance – after hanging out on another shoot a few weeks later, Lane heard the band’s art director hassling them to choose an album cover. He’d brought his portfolio with him, which included the now-infamous “ass shot”.230 29) The Notorious BIG – Ready to DieBiggie Smalls picked a baby resembling himself to star on the cover of his debut Ready to Die. By doing so, he summed up the album’s autobiographical content, which begins with childhood and closes with death. He also uses the notion of childhood innocence to foreshadow how our surroundings can have a lasting impact.It might not be the quintessential David Bowie album, or the one that introduced fans to Starman. But the face staring back at you from this particular album cover is, undeniably, the most recognisable Bowie look: red mullet a gaunt, sombre expression and that famous lightning bolt across his face.One of the greatest debut albums – and arguably the best hip hop record – of all time has a fittingly arresting cover image. A photo of a seven-year-old Nas was superimposed over Danny Clinch’s snapshot of one of the housing projects in the New York rapper’s native Queensbridge. Designed by Aimee Macauley, it was intended to reflect how the projects used to be Nas’s entire world, “until I educated myself to see there’s more out there”. But Nas was also inviting you to see through his eyes and into those very projects where he grew up, and feel immersed in that world via the power of his storytelling.Years after its release, Kate Bush noted how The Dreaming was deemed by many to be her “she’s gone mad” album. Its multiple, disparate narratives and metamorphic production intertwine with movie influences, particularly music hall crime capers of Houdini’s era. On the sepia-toned album cover, Bush plays the role of the escapist’s wife, looking to the distance, rather than at his face, as though trying to contact him via a different medium than mere speech. The way she holds his face in her hands gives her an additional, mesmerising power and conjures the old-world, eccentric mysticism with which she was – and still is – associated.Photographer Michael Spencer Jones had a task on his hands organising Oasis for what is indisputably their best album cover. It was different to what the band originally envisioned – Noel Gallagher had spotted a photo of the Beatles sat round a coffee in Japan, so thought Oasis could be photographed at the dining table of guitarist Bonehead’s house in Manchester. Jones didn’t see this working, so spread the members around Bonehead’s living room instead, and asked them to bring objects that were personal to them for decoration. Noel liked Jones’s idea of hanging an inflatable globe (brought by one of the roadies) from the ceiling. “Yeah, global dominance,” he said. Soon after the album’s release, that’s exactly what happened.Andy Warhol conceived the idea of a vinyl cover with working zipper that would reveal a pair of white briefs beneath the bulging jeans of a male model, who has to this day never been identified. Many fans assumed it was Mick Jagger, but people working on the shoot said several models were photographed and Warhol never revealed which one was used. It represented what the Rolling Stones quickly became famous for: an edgy, hyper-sexual kind of swagger.German painter Mati Klarwein – who also created Santana’s artwork for Abraxas – was behind this gatefold cover that served as an embodiment of Davis’s creative manifesto. The surreal and complex renderings mirror what Davis does with the music itself challenging traditional notions of structure and juxtaposing concepts of passivity and aggressiveness, anger and love.930 22) ACDC – Back in BlackBack in Black’s all-black cover design fit the mood of a band emerging from dark times. In the wake of the death of vocalist Bon Scott, ACDC had tracked down Brian Johnson, whom Scott had previously mentioned to the band. Certain people at their record label, Atlantic, weren’t so keen on the cover, but the band were insistent: it was a memorial to Scott. And now one of the most instantly recognisable and best-loved album covers in rock history.Visually striking and symbolic of what Debbie Harry was doing both as a woman and an artist in the music industry, Parallel Lines’ cover was shot by photographer Edo Bertoglio. It was apparently rejected by the band but later chosen by their manager, Peter Leeds. The juxtaposition between the band, who beam in their matching dress suits like a bunch of schoolboys at their senior prom, and Harry, who stands defiant in her white dress, hands on hips, is wonderful. “I’m not impressed,” her stance seems to say. “Try harder.”Dylan walks arm-in-arm with then-girlfriend and muse Suze Rotolo through the West Village in freezing New York, February 1963. Rotolo described the circumstances to the New York Times in 2008: “He wore a very thin jacket, because image was all. Our apartment was always cold, so I had a sweater on, plus I borrowed one of his big, bulky sweaters. On top of that I put on a coat. So I felt like an Italian sausage. Every time I look at that picture, I think I look fat.” Yet her memoir, A Freewheelin’ Time, also noted the cover’s significance, how it “influenced the look of album covers precisely because of its casual down-home spontaneity and sensibility”.Led Zeppelin couldn’t have picked a better image to serve as a visual introduction to their fans. It’s an easy tactic – using a photo from a real-life tragedy, in this case the Hinderburg disaster, for shock factor. But it worked, and the cover went on to become one of the most indelible images in rock music.1330 18) Never Mind the Bollocks – Here’s the Sex Pistols“The album will last.

I’m not sure I’d take bets on it right now –\u0026nbspI really have no idea.”Mr Flewitt said it “isn’t going to fundamentally undermine” McLaren if there are tariffs on cars into Europe as he outlined his lack of concern about what happens six to 12 months after a no-deal Brexit.He added: “But on day two and day three if we’re struggling importing parts, if we’re struggling exporting cars, if our employees are really concerned because they don’t know what’s going on, that kind of uncertainty could cause disruption for some weeks – and that’s really not good.“For an independent company like us, you disturb our cash flow, you disturb our employee base, it’ll have very, very serious ramifications.“What we really need is some certainty, some thinking.

If I don’t earn the money, I won’t be investing.“If I’m not investing, that has a cumulative impact on jobs, on buying parts from suppliers, on the success of the company, on taxes we pay on everything.”Mr Flewitt also said he “hates the idea of a no-deal Brexit” due to the lack of clarity anyone can offer, describing it as “no deal with no understanding of the consequences of no deal”.He also said: “The politicians need to lead us. Fine, if the country has mandated that we leave, and that’s what we decide to do, but then their job is to make sure the rules, the guidelines, the processes are in place to manage that exit in an orderly way –\u0026nbspnot to damage, not to undermine the country because we didn’t manage it well.“If the outcome isn’t a great one that’s a consequence of the fact we had a referendum and we voted to leave.“But for the consequence to be a damaging one because we don’t manage it properly, that’s downright irresponsible – and it won’t just be supercars.“Your headlines won’t be ‘McLaren can’t build supercars’ on 4 November.“It’ll be: we can’t get medicines, we can’t get food, we can’t get clothes the chaos that could ensue – because there won’t be a differentiation between this component and that component coming in, cross-border trade – that’s the bit I think is irresponsible, to lead us into that.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The company needed the additional funding from investors to complete work on the mine to extract polyhalite potash, a type of fertilizer, in North Yorkshire, as well as on a transportation tunnel to Teesside.The company originally expected to obtain loans guaranteed by Britain’s Infrastructure and Projects Authority. After postponing the bond sale last month, Sirius went back to the government asking for help with raising money from investors, but the government declined, the firm said.\u0026nbspIt added that it will now slow the development of the project – which includes boring a mine more than a mile deep – as it looks for alternative sources of funding.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Protesters dressed as the Incredible Hulk and Robocop outside the Supreme Court in London where judges are due to consider legal challenges to Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u0027s decision to suspend Parliament.

The 5 per cent share of short-changed workers is equivalent to about 1.5 million people.\u0026nbspA government report last year noted that there is effectively no state agency enforcing holiday pay regulations and cited evidence suggesting that the unpaid amount is equal to losses from violations of minimum wage rules.Lindsay Judge, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: “The UK has a multitude of rules to govern its labour market – from maximum hours to minimum pay. But these rules can only become a reality if they are properly enforced.“Labour market violations remain far too common, with millions of workers missing out on basic entitlements to a pay slip, holiday entitlement and the minimum wage.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Team Europe celebrate winning the Solheim Cup at Gleneagles in Auchterarder, Scotland.

Workers must be paid the higher National Living Wage if they are 25 or over. The current rate is £8.21 per hour.The analysis by the Resolution Foundation reveals that the risk of being short-changed on pay or holiday is closely linked to the worker’s personal characteristics, the type of their contract and their industry.For example, workers aged 25 and under are almost twice as likely to be underpaid the minimum wage as any other age group.\u0026nbspOne in seven workers in the hotels and restaurants sector say they receive no paid holiday entitlement, while one in six workers aged 65 or over report the same violation – more than any other age group.Workers in firms that employ fewer than 25 people are most likely to miss out on paid leave, as are workers on zero-hours and temporary contracts.The scale of labour law breaches may be even bigger as the Resolution Foundation points out gaps in available data.\u0026nbspSurveys miss out some important questions and workers are often unaware their employer is breaking the law or they may be reluctant or too frightened to report the truth, the think tank says.Meanwhile, the HMRC findings on minimum wage underpayments are based on the number of firms that were caught and so also understate the true picture, the foundation added.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.135 35) Arctic Monkeys – Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not (2006)A new wave of British guitar bands was already being pioneered by the likes of The Libertines, Bloc Party and Franz Ferdinand when the Sheffield-formed Arctic Monkeys arrived on the scene. But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.Sheeran continued: “I’ve said yes to 90 per cent\u0026nbspof the features I’ve been personally asked for, unless I’ve been on a break or I haven’t known the artist personally.Sheeran added that he has a deep\u0026nbsprespect for the scene as well as for Wiley.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspSheeran’s collaborations album features Eminem, Cardi B and Chance The Rapper. Drake was recently in London for the premiere of Top Boy\u0027s third series, which he produced.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

However, Libra differs from many cryptocurrencies as it is centralised in its nature against the founding member companies, in a similar way that fiat currencies are centralised against a central bank,” Ana\u0026nbspBencic, president of digital exchange\u0026nbspNexthash, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.\u0026nbsp“Due to the ... circle of multi-billion dollar companies essentially managing their own currency, it is not surprising that central banks are cautious of money moving in this direction. It will be interesting to see the result of these talks and whether governments or Libra will make any adjustments to accommodate it within the online global economy.”The meeting in Basel, Switzerland, will involve representatives from the Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve, according to officials who spoke with the\u0026nbspFinancial Times.Facebook previously said that it welcomes feedback from global regulators, claiming that it announced Libra long before its intended release date in order to address any potential issues.“In the nearly three months since the intent to launch the Libra project was announced, we have become the world’s most scrutinised fintech effort,” a spokesperson for Libra told\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbsplast week.“We welcome this scrutiny and have deliberately designed a long launch runway to have these conversations, educate stakeholders and incorporate their feedback in our design.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In the past, Google has used its Pixel launch events to show off new smart speakers, Chromecasts, and other products.Google will almost certainly show off two versions of the new phone: the Pixel 4 and the bigger Pixel 4 XL, in line with recent years. It might also launch a special 5G version, it said.The company tends to hold its launch events in October, soon after the release of the iPhone, and so the rough schedule for the launch event had long been expected.

More than 130 applications have been made to the US Commerce Department by companies hoping to sell goods and services to Huawei, but none have yet been granted.One billion Google calendar users exposed to fake invite scamThe ban on trading with the Chinese firm comes after concerns were raised by US government agencies that its devices could be used as spy tools by the Chinese state. Huawei has consistently denied these claims, and an escalating trade war between the US and China has not helped matters.Huawei has relied heavily in the past on US companies, particularly for software used in devices sold in US and European markets.Mr Yu previously said it was Huawei’s preference to continue working with US firms like Google in order to build its products.The Mate 30 will be launched on 19 September in Munich, with rumours suggesting it will feature more camera lenses and support 5G connectivity.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke).

Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.The deleted scene, below, has caused speculation that the X-Men could join the Marvel Cinematic Universe, following Disney’s acquisition of 20th Century Fox, which has the rights to the franchise.The footage was released shortly after Avengers: Endgame director Joe Russo said Spider-Man leaving the MCU was a tragic mistake.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If I don’t earn the money, I won’t be investing.“If I’m not investing, that has a cumulative impact on jobs, on buying parts from suppliers, on the success of the company, on taxes we pay on everything.”Mr Flewitt also said he “hates the idea of a no-deal Brexit” due to the lack of clarity anyone can offer, describing it as “no deal with no understanding of the consequences of no deal”.He also said: “The politicians need to lead us. Fine, if the country has mandated that we leave, and that’s what we decide to do, but then their job is to make sure the rules, the guidelines, the processes are in place to manage that exit in an orderly way –\u0026nbspnot to damage, not to undermine the country because we didn’t manage it well.“If the outcome isn’t a great one that’s a consequence of the fact we had a referendum and we voted to leave.“But for the consequence to be a damaging one because we don’t manage it properly, that’s downright irresponsible – and it won’t just be supercars.“Your headlines won’t be ‘McLaren can’t build supercars’ on 4 November.“It’ll be: we can’t get medicines, we can’t get food, we can’t get clothes the chaos that could ensue – because there won’t be a differentiation between this component and that component coming in, cross-border trade – that’s the bit I think is irresponsible, to lead us into that.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

What a waste of public money, and ours.”Mr Wright issued a Public Interest Intervention Notice in June following the purchase by Sultan Muhammad Abuljadayel and Wondrous Investment Holdings of a 30 per cent shareholding in IDNM and a 30 per cent shareholding in LHL. IDNM is the publisher of The Independent, while LHL is the majority shareholder in publishers Evening Standard Ltd, and the two companies operate under the name ESI Media.In its report to the culture secretary, Ofcom said it could not rule out\u0026nbspthere may be “incentives and ability for the buyers to alter the accuracy or editorial stances of the publications”.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We have carried out a detailed analysis of a sample of the content of both publications before and after the transactions, and there has been no evidence or substantial claims of any influence in practice to date.\u0026nbsp“We cannot, of course, rule out any suggestion that the buyers might in future, perhaps with the other shareholders’ consent, seek to present more positive coverage of Saudi matters. However, this is a possibility in relation to other newspapers as well, for example\u0026nbspto any newspaper potentially seeking to expand overseas.”Although Ofcom noted that newspapers are not generally required to be transparent about their ownership, Ms Morgan voiced disappointment that neither company was willing to take further steps to address gaps in transparency and mitigate the risk of future inappropriate influence on editorial matters.\u0026nbspThe Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said in a statement: “Overall, the secretary of state’s conclusion is that Ofcom’s report goes a considerable way to satisfying her in relation to the public interest concerns relevant to this case, and based on Ofcom’s conclusions she would not have referred the case to a phase two\u0026nbspinvestigation.”In a statement, a spokesperson for ESI Media said: “We are pleased, but not at all surprised, that the secretary of state has agreed with the conclusions of the CMA and Ofcom. They both found that there were no grounds for the government to take further action in relation to the investments in The Independent and Evening Standard.“Ofcom said there was no evidence whatsoever of interference by the investors in our editorial operations. This was after a thorough investigation, including the analysis of thousands of published articles and a public consultation.\u0026nbsp“Ofcom considers the safeguards already in place to protect editorial freedom to be appropriate. Similarly, the CMA concluded that there was no need to pursue a further investigation on competition grounds.\u0026nbsp“We said at the outset that this enquiry was disproportionate and unwarranted and our position hasn’t changed.

Habitat loss and poaching also pose severe threats.‘Frozen Dragon of the North’: New species of flying creature foundWhile millions are now kept on farms, these appear to overwhelmingly be members of the most common species, while wild populations are at great risk of extinction.“These findings come at a time where urgent interventions are required to save Chinese giant salamanders in the wild,” said Melissa Marr, a PhD researcher at the Natural History Museum.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Zookeepers hope to one day introduce another animal to Professor Lew as a mate.Scientists believe that in light of the recent study, published on Monday in Ecology and Evolution, future conservation efforts could\u0026nbspinvolve\u0026nbspscreening farmed giant salamanders to determine their species before encouraging them to mate and reintroducing\u0026nbspthem into the wild among their own species.Dr Turvey added:\u0026nbsp“We hope that this new understanding of their species ersity has arrived in time to support their successful conservation, but urgent measures are required to protect any viable giant salamander populations that might remain.”Additional reporting by PAShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

We don’t know what they’re made of and one really important question is, ‘How massive can you make one of these stars?’ It has implications for very exotic material that we simply can’t create in a laboratory on Earth,” said Maura McLaughlin, astrophysics professor at West Virginia University.The neutron star is a pulsar that emits beams of radio waves like a lighthouse as it spins. Pulsars get their name because of twin beams of radio waves they emit from their magnetic poles as they rotate hundreds of times each second.\u0026nbspAstronomers measure these radio waves to work out the mass of stellar objects. They can do this thanks to its orbiting companion star.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This phenomenon – known as “Shapiro Delay” – is because the gravity from the white dwarf star slightly warps the space surrounding it.\u0026nbspThis warping means the pulses from the rotating neutron star have to travel a little bit further. Astronomers measure that delay to calculate the mass of the white dwarf, which in turn provides a measurement of the neutron star. \u0026nbspOnce the mass of one of the co-orbiting bodies is known they can accurately determine the mass of the other.\u0026nbsp“The orientation of this binary star system created a fantastic cosmic laboratory,” said Scott Ransom, an astronomer at National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) and co-author on the paper.Black hole may have swallowed neutron star, astronomers believeHuge neutron star sent blasts of material at EarthNasa detects ‘unusual’ infrared light from mysterious neutron star“Neutron stars have this tipping point where their interior densities get so extreme that the force of gravity overwhelms even the ability of neutrons to resist further collapse.\u0026nbsp“Each ‘most massive’ neutron star we find brings us closer to identifying that tipping point and helping us to understand the physics of matter at these mind boggling densities.”Pulsars spin with such speed and regularity that astronomers can use them to study the nature of space-time, the mass of stellar objects and our understanding of general relativity.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

After postponing the bond sale last month, Sirius went back to the government asking for help with raising money from investors, but the government declined, the firm said.\u0026nbspIt added that it will now slow the development of the project – which includes boring a mine more than a mile deep – as it looks for alternative sources of funding.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Protesters dressed as the Incredible Hulk and Robocop outside the Supreme Court in London where judges are due to consider legal challenges to Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u0027s decision to suspend Parliament.

The 5 per cent share of short-changed workers is equivalent to about 1.5 million people.\u0026nbspA government report last year noted that there is effectively no state agency enforcing holiday pay regulations and cited evidence suggesting that the unpaid amount is equal to losses from violations of minimum wage rules.Lindsay Judge, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: “The UK has a multitude of rules to govern its labour market – from maximum hours to minimum pay. But these rules can only become a reality if they are properly enforced.“Labour market violations remain far too common, with millions of workers missing out on basic entitlements to a pay slip, holiday entitlement and the minimum wage.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Team Europe celebrate winning the Solheim Cup at Gleneagles in Auchterarder, Scotland.

Workers must be paid the higher National Living Wage if they are 25 or over. The current rate is £8.21 per hour.The analysis by the Resolution Foundation reveals that the risk of being short-changed on pay or holiday is closely linked to the worker’s personal characteristics, the type of their contract and their industry.For example, workers aged 25 and under are almost twice as likely to be underpaid the minimum wage as any other age group.\u0026nbspOne in seven workers in the hotels and restaurants sector say they receive no paid holiday entitlement, while one in six workers aged 65 or over report the same violation – more than any other age group.Workers in firms that employ fewer than 25 people are most likely to miss out on paid leave, as are workers on zero-hours and temporary contracts.The scale of labour law breaches may be even bigger as the Resolution Foundation points out gaps in available data.\u0026nbspSurveys miss out some important questions and workers are often unaware their employer is breaking the law or they may be reluctant or too frightened to report the truth, the think tank says.Meanwhile, the HMRC findings on minimum wage underpayments are based on the number of firms that were caught and so also understate the true picture, the foundation added.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Pink Meanie was discovered during a nightlight jellyfish e by the collections team in the waters around Robben Island and in Cape Town Harbour. Pink Meanies are jellyvorous, meaning they feed on other jelly species by reeling them in with their long tentacles.

He seems to be the sticking point in negotiations with other parties, said Daniel Katz, 33, a software developer voting for the\u0026nbspultra-orthadox\u0026nbspparty United Judaism Torah in Jerusalem.\u0026nbspUTJ\u0026nbspand the other major ultra-orthodox party\u0026nbspShas\u0026nbsphave pledged to join a coalition headed by Mr Netanyahu. \u0026nbspAdel\u0026nbspMelois, 18, a first-time voter who decided to cast her ballot for Jewish Power, a hard-right party, agreed.

We need new ideas for the Right, she said.\u0026nbspIn Tel Aviv, Israel\u0027s commercial capital where many voters traditionally vote centre or left-wing, there were equal signs of frustration with the prime minister, but over the\u0026nbsppossible corruption cases against him.\u0026nbspThe most important thing is to switch out the King, said\u0026nbspIftah\u0026nbspGorali, a Blue and White voter, referencing Mr\u0026nbspNetanyahu\u0027s\u0026nbspnickname King\u0026nbspBibi.\u0026nbsp​The King is stuck in his place, we need to get rid of him, and our best chance is through Blue and White.... The corruption is just growing. We have an entire country that most of the time is dealing with the prime minister\u0027s personal problems. Why? he asked.\u0026nbspThe last polls published over the weekend by Israeli TV Channel 11 and 12 showed\u0026nbspMr Netanyahu neck and neck with chief rival Mr\u0026nbspGantz, with both their parties securing around 32 seats. They also predicted neither Mr\u0026nbspNetanyahu’s\u0026nbspright-wing block nor Mr\u0026nbspGantz’s\u0026nbspcentre-left allies will be able to secure enough seats together to win the overall 61 seat majority needed to form a ruling government.\u0026nbspCommentators accused Mr Netanyahu, of\u0026nbsp“throwing everything but the kitchen sink”\u0026nbspat the elections in his last-ditch attempt to secure a historic fifth term in office. His critics say he needs to stay in power as a shield against possible legal action in the future.\u0026nbspHe launched a flurry of media interviews in the lead up to the polls, including possibly\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspbreaking elections rules by giving an interview to a local radio station on the day of the vote.Gantz voting in a Rosh Ha’Ayin polling station, central Israel, together with his wife Revital (Blue and White Party handout)Just hours before polling stations opened, Mr Netanyahu also vowed to annex all the settlements in the occupied West Bank, including an enclave deep in the heart of the largest Palestinian city: a move illegal under international law and sure to ignite conflict with the Palestinians and possibly the rest of the region if implemented.\u0026nbspIt followed comments made a few days earlier where he vowed to immediately annex the Jordan Valley and the Dead Sea area, which makes up just over 22 per cent of the West Bank, if re-elected.He also arranged a meeting with President Donald Trump to mull the idea of a mutual defence treaty just ahead of the elections. Before that he met with Russian\u0026nbspPresident Vladimir Putin in Sochi, again part of a campaign to remind the public of his unique relationship with foreign leaders, and his diplomatic skills.\u0026nbspIsraeli media also reported the prime minister\u0026nbspcame within a hair’s breadth of starting a military offensive\u0026nbspin Gaza after he was embarrassingly forced to flee the stage in a campaign rally in the southern city of Ashdod on Wednesday, when militants from Gaza fired at the city.While the polls were bleak, the prime minister’s supporters remained confident that Mr Netanyahu and his rightwing Likud party would still win.There is no way that\u0026nbspLikud\u0026nbspwon’t be in the ruling coalition, we are going win“There is no way that Likud won’t be in the ruling coalition, we are going win,” said Netta, 24, head of the Likud student faction at Hebrew University at a rally in Jerusalem on Monday.\u0026nbsp“There isn’t anyone who comes close to Netanyahu.”Raphel Ohyon, 66, a driving test instructor, agreed adding that Benny Gantz had “little to no experience” in politics.The snap elections were called just months after the previous elections in the spring when Mr Netanyahu failed to form a ruling coalition, after his one-time ally and former defence minister Avigdor Lieberman and his right-wing party Yisrael Beiteinu refused to join forces at the 11th hour.\u0026nbspAvigdor Lieberman, leader of Yisrael Beitenu party, casts his ballot in Israel\u0027s parliamentary election, along with his wife Ella at a polling station in the Israeli settlement of Nokdim in the occupied West Bank (REUTERSAmmar Awad)Rather than allow Israeli President Reuven Rivlin to give another political leader the chance to build a ruling coalition, Mr Netanyahu’s Likud party and its supporters voted to go back to the polls.Prominent pollsters warned that there was a chance Mr Netanyahu might fail to build a government again,\u0026nbspgiven so many centre-left parties have vowed not to join forces with Mr Netanyahu because of his likely indictment on graft charges.Mr Lieberman, whose party is polling at nine seats and could play kingmaker again,\u0026nbsphas also nominally promised to form a coalition with Mr Netanyahu\u0027s rivals Blue and White.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIf no majority bloc is formed it\u0026nbspcould mean a third Israeli election.\u0026nbsp“Netanyahu will have to make serious compromises, said Dahlia Scheindlin, a public opinion expert who has worked on seven election campaigns in Israel.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“Someone will have to give up their promises to get the ladder and climb down from the tree.

The Government has to push for change, otherwise it will only be a matter of time until someone  dies.”New statistics published by NHS Digital have shown a dramatic increase in the number of young children admitted to hospital with anaphylactic shock - a reaction so severe it can be fatal.A worrying  children aged  and under were treated for anaphylaxis from  to , compared to  from  to  - a rise of over a third.Clare, , who lives in Canterbury, Kent, with husband Stewart, , a tennis coach, and her two remaining daughters Charlotte, , and April, one, knew Sadie had issues from when she was a baby.Her reactions were severe, with her lips quickly swellingshe came into contact with milk, but it took six months of doctors trips before they got help.Eventually tests showed she was allergic to dairy and nuts.There are no official Government guidelines on allergy testing, and Clare calls care haphazard - Sadie was in and out of hospital for the first four years of her le as she kept having reactions.Eventually her family paid for private tests, with Clare claiming kids with allergies should be checked regularly as things change so quickly with them.“I cant tell you what kind of stress we suffered,” Clare says.“I battled severe anxiety for the first four years of Sadies le. Its so scary, you get conflicting information, I didnt know what was safe.But things didnt get easier.“The first time she had an anaphylactic shock she was five, Clare recalls. “We put that down to a contaminated spoon in an ice cream parlour.“The second time it happened shed accidentally eaten a brioche bun and had a delayed anaphylactic shock two hours later.“She had another one after a plain burger. There was no dairy listed in the ingredients but she reacted.“Still there was no follow up appointment.It was at a family picnic in Whistable, Kent, in August , that Sadie suffered a fatal anaphylactic reaction after eating a ham sandwich - even though Clare had checked the packaging to be sure she could have it.Although the family gave her medication and quickly got her to a nearby medical centre, Sadie was unresponsive.She went into cardiac arrest, and nothing could be done to save her.Lynne Regent, chief executive of the Anaphylaxis Campaign charity said modern diets could be to blame.One child in  now has a serious nut allergy which means every school across Britain is affected, she says.Allergies can be hereditary.If there is asthma in the family, sometimes you get children developing food allergies but it also happens in families where there is no history of anything.Our eating habits have changed exponentially over the past few years. We all eat more processed food and there is less cooking from scratch. We eat dferent sorts of food from all over the world.We dont know why this might cause allergies but its a change in behaviour that might explain why allergies are increasing. Its something we need to research.A Swedish study of over one million children found that babies born via Caesarean section are five times more likely to develop food allergies in later le.Presumably this is due to the dferent bacteria a child is first exposed to, Dr Brough says. Whether they go through the birth canal or not and the impact this has on their gut bacteria.Babies fed formula milk are also more likely to suffer skin allergies such as eczema and dermatitis, though evidence is thin on the ground.It is probably the lack of breastfeeding rather than formula that is the issue, Dr Brough explains.There is only one proper study due to ethical issues but children in the control group with low breastfeeding rates had double the risk of eczema up until one year of age.Many parents say their childs allergies appear to have been present from birth.One of those is Tanya Ednan-Laperouse, whose daughter Natasha died aged  after eating a Pret a Manger baguette containing sesame seeds on a BA flight to France.Natasha was severely allergic to sesame seeds but they weren’t listed in the ingredients.Tanya , from Fulham, South London, struggled to access the right support in Natasha’s younger years.“I gave Natasha a tiny bit of banana when she was six months old and she had an anaphylactic reaction,” Tanya recalls.“I became terried about what might cause a reaction. I went to my GP and asked about allergies and I asked whether Natasha should have a test, but he said No, its really rare, nothing to worry about.“He told me to wean her on to a dairy milk formula. I did, and she had a full anaphylactic reaction. Her lips and face swelled, she was struggling to breathe. Still, we were offered no tests.”Until Natasha was two, she survived on chicken and vegetable soup made at home by her mum as the family tried to avoid potential allergens. She was also diagnosed with asthma.“Aged two and a half, she grabbed a bread stick with sesame seeds on it and she reacted, Tanya explains. It was then she was finally given a blood test.“Sometimes just walking into a coffee shop would make her react, we put it down to milk proteins in the airthey were making frothy coffee.Tanya believes the rate of allergies has increased so fast that professionals are struggling to cope.We are facing a time bomb when it comes to allergies – and it’s going to explode, she says.After Natasha’s death in , her parents set up the Natasha Allergy Research Foundation, a charity which aims to raise awareness of allergies as well as pushing for change.Their biggest success is with Natasha’s Law, legislation which will force businesses to list the full ingredients on prepackaged foods from the summer of .Mum Emma Amoscato has two children - James, six, and Amalia, three - with allergies and hopes the law will make things easier for her.“A lot of places now will have a disclaimer and say they cant guarantee any of their food is free from anything,” explains Emma, , a writer from Bedfordshire.“At the moment, restaurants only have to list the top  allergens and both of mine have quite rare allergies.Swollen lips and or eyes, itchy skin or a rash like hives, wheezing and finding it hard to breathe or speak, feeling faint, dizzy or confused, vomiting or having diarrhoea are just some of the symptoms of severe allergy and need immediate action.This is by no means a full list of symptoms, so always speak to your doctor about what you should watch out for.Sometimes there are other factors that on the day can increase the severity of your reaction. These are called co-factors and these can include exercise, feeling unwell with a viral illness, alcohol and tablets, such as some painkillers.For some people with allergies, more serious reactions such as anaphylaxis may only occurthey have eaten a specic food, or taken the medication to which they are allergic, then they exercise.People with asthma and allergies are known to be more at risk of severe reactions than those without.Just like Sadie’s family, Emma struggled to get testing for James. He was a grizzly baby and by the time he was  weeks old he had severe eczema.His reactions grew steadily stronger and around his first birthday he was referred to a specialist and diagnosed with allergies to milk, garlic, egg, sesame, some nuts and sumac.He was admitted to hospital with anaphylaxis after taking a sip from another child’s milk cup while on holiday. Dad Carl, , had to inject him with adrenaline.“After that it kicked in for us how serious it was,” Emma says. “We kept asking ourselves what wed doit happened again, wondering what would happenwe werent with him.“We read news stories about children like ours who have died, it’s a huge worry every day of our lives.People say its because we are too clean but my children have had allergies since birth. That doesnt explain what has happened to them - we need answers.Sadie’s parents Clare and Stewart believe the UK has a lot more work to do when it comes to providing care and awareness for allergy sufferers.“No one  should have to die for things to improve,” says Clare.“Sadies little sister is also battling allergies. I live every day terried that I will have to say goodbye to another little girl.I cant do that - something must be done.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This is because they are so far apart that architects had to factor in the curvature of Earth.Today, it’s still as unnecessary as it ever was. And it’s no longer the longest suspension bridge in the world. But it remains, in my opinion, the most beautul.In fact, and I’ve said this often, it’s the most beautul man-made thing of all time. Apart from maybe the Riva Aquarama speedboat.When I stand on the south shore on a misty morning and see the wafer-thin road disappearing off into the sea, it takes my breath away. It really does.So I’m glad it was made. And I’m glad too that the Labour government also built the Post Office Tower, even though it is now just a hazard to aircraft.Then there’s Concorde. The world did not need such a thing.And the technical challenges facing the engineers were huge. A Nasa boffin once told me that getting a passenger plane up beyond Mach  was more dficult than putting a man on the moon.But that old commie Tony Benn had decided Concorde was going to succeed, so he pushed and he pushed and, by God, are we glad he did.Can you imagine such a thing Because even though the beautul white bird is now grounded, we still have those memories of the shattering noise it made and the way it could make the sun rise in the West.I remember once, standing on a beach in Barbados as a British Airways Concorde roared overhead at treetop height.After it had passed, a stunned American on the next sun lounger looked at me and said: “You Brits.”I was so proud, I didn’t get round to telling him it was half French.Since Concorde though, Britain hasn’t really done anything of any great importance. There’s been talk of a new railway line from London to Manchester, but in evolutionary terms that’s just a shuffle. And now it probably won’t happen anyway.Which is why I am SO excited about the idea of a bridge linking Larne, in Northern Ireland with Portpatrick, in Scotland.Weirdly, the Labour Party — the party that created the Post Office Tower and Concorde and the Humber Bridge — are furious, saying it’s not needed and will be too expensive and it’s only been suggested to get Boris out of his backstop hole.But can you imagine such a thing A -mile bridge supported on columns ,ft high, and rising even higher in the middle so ships can pass underneath. It would be magnicent.Yes, it would be dficult to make. The seas there are rough and deep and the seabed is littered with discarded Second World War mines and bombs.But as John F Kennedy once said: “We choose to go to the moon and do the other things not because they are easy, but because they are hard.”ACCORDING to a headline in The Times this week, The Handmaid’s Tale is increasingly ringing true.Really  We are heading for the terrying society portrayed in Margaret Atwood’s brilliant book A society where women are kept either for breeding or cleaning  Where girls can be killed for speaking  Or mutilated for looking at someone in a funny way And where children are taken away at birth and given to someone  I know cricket fan and woman Theresa May has suggested that Geoffrey Boycott, who has a conviction for domestic abuse, should be given a knighthood.But that’s a long, long way from sewing up the vagina of the woman he beat.I once saw a sufferer in Burma and the pain was so excruciating that powerful muscle spasms had snapped both his legs.And it wasn’t ordinary rabies our man in Morocco had caught either. It was “furious rabies” which causes extreme thirst and a morbid fear of water. At the same time.Mercully, he has now died. And we, meanwhile, are left to ponder what sort of a God comes up with a disease like that to end nearly , lives every year.ON the basis you should know your enemy, I read a book on holiday this year about why we shouldn’t kill animals.It wasn’t called – “If you eat meat, you’re a bastard”, but that was the thrust.And after a while, I deliberately left it in the rain, so I didn’t have to finish it.However, since I ed to Britain about a month ago, I still haven’t been able to eat pork.Cows  Chickens  Sheep  Not really bothered.But some of the things I read in that book about how pigs can play video games and feel love – they stuck.And so did the bit about how frightened they look when they are being taken to the slaughterhouse.I tried this morning to have a bacon sandwich but I couldn’t bring myself to put it in my mouth.It’s annoying. Pork was always my favourite meat but I’ll have to find a substitute.I’m thinking badger. Or maybe a nice roast fox.I know people who’ve found lost phones in their trouser pockets, and most women are of capable losing anything up to a medium-sized dog in their handbags.But I’ve never heard of anyone losing themselves. Until now.A party of tourists on a bus tour of Iceland spent hours searching for a missing passenger only to find she was in the search party.She hadn’t recognised the description of herself and it wasn’t until three in the morning that her mistake became clear.Bet she was popular.AT long last, space boffins have found a planet which they reckon could be capable of supporting le.They will know soonit has an atmosphere but they’ve already worked out that the romantically named K-b does have water. And it’s only million million miles away, which means that with current technology, we could reach it in just two million years.The only problem I can see is that it’s twice the size of Earth, with eight times the mass, so any astronaut who had survived the -light year journey would weigh quite a lot when he arrivedSo much, in fact, that after a little while, his brain would be dragged into his spinal cord.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Second, it must protect the integrity of the EU’s single market. Third, it must not involve any checks on the island of Ireland.Barclay said the UK could meet the first two of these tests, but not the third. He said there was no point in presenting any detailed proposals until the EU shted on the question of checks.One Government source explains thatthe UK did, the “EU would nuke the proposals and we would be in chaos”.So the challenge for Boris is to get the EU to move on this third point. His Monday meeting with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker gives him a chance to lobby him on this very issue.Juncker is an instinctive deal-maker and, with his term as president due to end on October , he will be keen to resolve Brexit before he goes.I also understand that several EU governments, including in France, are now apprehensive about the possibility of a second referendum.They believe it would be bad for the EU for the UK to stay in given how contested UK membership now is.They fear this would lead to every Council decision, all new EU legislation and every European Court of Justice judgment becoming a matter of controversy.The EU, though, will not abandon Ireland. This means that whatever proposal Boris comes up with will have to be something Leo Varadkar is prepared to swallow.The first meeting between the two men has given Downing Street some hope that they can find something that works for Dublin, them and the DUP.The DUP’s willingness to entertain Northern Ireland continuing to follow EU rules on agriculture has opened the door to further discussions.If Parliament had not tied Boris’s hands, he could have seenthe risk of No Deal would have pushed Dublin and the EU to compromise on the checks front. But his ability to negotiate is now weakened.For this and other reasons, the odds are still against a deal. But there is a greater chance of one than a week ago.The Liberal Democrats start their conference today in their strongest position for years.They are polling around  per cent and in line to make major gains at the next election.At conference next week they are expected to adopt as their position that a Lib Dem government – stop laughing at the back – would simply revoke Article , cancelling the referendum result.This will establish them as the most unambiguously anti-Brexit party, a development that concerns a growing number of Labour MPs in Remain seats who want their party to take a clearer line on the issue for fear of losing ground to the Lib Dems.At the same time, the policy means that the Liberal Democrats can tell voters they will make the whole issue go away. By contrast, a second referendum would drag things out.If politics is now about Leave v Remain, rather than Left v Right, expect the Lib Dems to come back with more MPs than they have ever had before, following the next election.One of the things that urgently needs sorting out in this country is technical education.Those who don’t want to do an academic degree are being ill-served by further education.Gavin Williamson, the new Education Secretary, told Cabinet this week that there are up to , people trained in Hair  Beauty yet only a need for about , new recruits to work in this industry each year.The result is tens of thousands of people doing courses that don’t lead to them getting jobs or boost this country’s productivity.Those who want a second Brexit referendum are now arguing there shouldn’t be a General Election until a second referendum has taken place.Tony Blair, Labour’s deputy leader Tom Watson and Tory rebel Oliver Letwin have all made that case this week.Leave aside the massive issue of whether there should be a second referendum before the result of the first one has even been implemented, this plan would mean that this Parliament would have to carry on sitting until well into .This is a disastrous idea. This is a useless Parliament and keeping it going will just add to the national paralysis.With no party able to command a majority in the Commons, nothing can get done. Eventhis Parliament could muster a majority for a referendum, which is far from certain, it could do so for little .It is hard to see what meaningful domestic legislation can come out of this Parliament given that neither Boris Johnson nor Jeremy Corbyn can secure the backing of most MPs.The public desire for politicians to get on with both Brexit and the domestic agenda is why No will spend next week trying to emphasise its tough-on-crime policies.I understand Boris Johnson will put flesh on the bones of his plan to end early release for violent and unrepentant criminals.Friends are urging Amber Rudd to stand in the West London seat of Kensington at the next election.Its controversial Labour MP, Emma Dent Coad, has a majority of just .The thinking goes that the constituency isn’t keen on either No Deal or Jeremy Corbyn, so Rudd could do well standing as an independent.But it is exceptionally hard for independents to win seats, andRudd were to go down this course, she would be standing in the constituency for the first time – she is currently MP for Hastings, down on the south coast. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We have Farage’s no-deal Brexiteers pulling one way.And those who want no Brexit at all pulling in the other direction.Neither are true democrats, because during the referendum the Leave camp promised to get a good deal from the EU, while Remain politicians said that they’d respect the result.And while those isive groups may shout the loudest, neither represent the majority of the British public who just want politicians to get on with it and work together to deliver a sensible Brexit.That’s why we’ve this week formed our cross-party MPs For A Deal group, to remind the public that there is still a majority of politicians who would prefer a deal-based Brexit to a catastrophic no-deal Brexit or an undemocratic no Brexit at all.Founding members include Tory leadership candidate Rory Stewart, Lib Dem Norman Lamb and Labour’s Caroline Flint.We all come from very dferent political backgrounds, and even on Brexit we’ve had our dferences. Some of us voted for Theresa May’s deal, not because it was perfect but because it delivered on the result of the referendum.Others couldn’t support it because they felt it was a ‘blind Brexit’ — a leap into the unknown — and asked May to come back with something better.But we are all agreed on one thing.After May held cross-party talks with Labour in May  she came back with ten changes to her deal, and we all believe that this compromise package was more likely to get through Parliament.We all believed at the time that MPs should have been able to debate and vote on this, but sadly it was rejected by second referendum advocates and no-dealers.The Withdrawal Agreement Bill, as it’s known, included protection of workers’ rights, food standards and the environment, which would have benefited us all.We now hope that Boris Johnson brings a similar offer back to Parliament so we can vote on it.Sometimes it’s easy to forget that  Conservative MPs backed May’s deal in March this year while more than  other MPs voted for dferent forms of a Brexit in indicative votes.The desire to agree a Brexit deal is there.A failure to do so may well result in the consequences set out in the government’s own ‘Operation Yellowhammer’ no-deal report.Sensible MPs desperately need to face down the isive voices on either side and come together in the national interest.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We do not eat them, and that is a very important message to send to the rest of the world.“It’s not culturally insensitive because we’re not telling them what to do – we’re just telling them what we do.“We shouldn’t be worrying about that, so I was surprised that was the MoJ’s objection.”Justice officials also argued that it would be dficult to enforce the law and the current ban on transporting or exporting dog and cat meat suffices.Eating dog is already banned in Germany, Austria, Taiwan, South Australia and Hong Kong.An estimated  million dogs a year are slaughtered to be eaten, across China, the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia.Most are stolen off the street.Their meat it is considered both a delicacy and a health tonic.The World Dog Alliance mounted a campaign in the UK last year for a full ban on any activity relating to the eating of dogs.A series of MPs back a ban, including former Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan who dubbed it “a disgusting habit”.A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said: “We currently have some of the strongest animal welfare laws in the world.The government is currently considering whether any changes are needed in this area in the UK and will set out any plans in due course.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

installations.It comes after a survey of , adults, commissioned by British Gas to mark Gas Safety Week , found a tenth admit they would probably still use an appliancethey saw it ‘spark’.Lauren Vazquez, engineer and safety expert for British Gas, said: “Our engineers are in and out of homes around the country every day, checking that customers’ electricity is safely wired and testing all gas appliances to make sure they’re safe.“We regularly visit customers who haven’t had their electrical wiring or gas appliances checked in  to  years, which is a concern.We have so many gadgets in the house nowadays that it can be dficult to keep on top of them all, but it’s important to keep an eye on whether they’re working as they should be.“Some of the unsafe appliances we’ve come across could have had a devastating effect on our customers’ health and safety, had we not identied them.”It also emerged more than two thirds of UK householders actively worry about the safety of the appliances in their home, while half have received an electric shock from one.But more than half do not test their household gadgets as often as they’re advised to by the manufacturer, and almost two thirds of respondents admit they have used an appliance despite it being faulty.The average Brit knowingly has three broken electrical gadgets – including items from toasters and laptops to lighting and boilers – in their house.The study also found  per cent were unaware that monitoring their energy use is a good way to look after appliances.Using a smart meter can help identy changes in energy consumption which could be attributed to dferent devices being turned on or off, and that might also reveal any faults.To mark Gas Safety Week, British Gas is raising awareness of the importance of having carbon monoxide detectors in the home.Lauren Vazquez added: “You can’t hear it, see it, taste it or smell it, and it kills around  people a year – but fortunately, carbon monoxide poisoning is preventable.“Tell-tale signs of a carbon monoxide leak include sooty stains on your cooker, finding your gas fire has become dficult to light, and spotting that the flame on your boiler is burning yellow or orange instead of blue.“Faulty central heating systems are one of the most common sources of carbon monoxide in the home.So as well getting your boiler checked once a year, it’s essential to

probably Nish Kumar and there’s no real need to worry.For as long as the BBC remains a going concern you’ll be hosting The Mash Report, which has been doing Auntie’s dirty political work for four series now without any change to the agenda, format or personnel.So we still get satirical news headlines presented by Ellie Taylor, the only team member with breakout potential.Offence finder general Rachel Parris continues to do a very convincing impression of a passive-aggressive public school nightmare.And there’s a guest slot for Geoff Norcott who, alone among the irregulars, treats it as a comedy show.Uniquely, Geoff is also the only person introduced by his political preferences: “The voice of Conservative Britain.”A tactic that, much like the host’s repeated references to, “BBC checks and balances”, is meant to give The Mash Report an air of neutrality but does the exact opposite, as none of the other guests are introduced as “left-wing student arse”, even though it describes all of them.Same applies, obviously, for host Nish, who has any number of unattractive presenting habits, the absolute worst of which is introducing the subject of race where no one  would think it belongs, including a picture of Boris’s girlfriend, Carrie Symonds, with new puppy Dilyn.“People will lose their s**t over a nice white lady and a cute dog.”It hardly needs me to tell you the BBC would never allow a white presenter to go down the opposite road.Double standards and bias, though, are the calling cards of The Mash Report and its host, who’s one of those political obsessives who simply cannot cope with the fact the entire country doesn’t bend to his socialist will.So he’ll angrily denounce, “Sections of the Press” , for, “Failing to hold the Government to account”, while treating obvious anti-Boris anti-Brexit propaganda as absolute gospel.Here’s Nish’s version, for instance, on Jeremy Corbyn bottling out of a general election.“Labour don’t trust Boris Johnson enough to support a general election ’cos they fear he’ll set the date to force a No Deal Brexit and that lack of faith is totally justied.”I doubt even Jeremy Corbyn, in his cowardly heart of hearts, believes that cobblers. I am fully aware, however, how the right-on conspiracy theories play out here.That is, I’m only saying this because The Mash Report goes against my own political prejudicesand am part of a right-wing media group trying to destroy the working-class via Brexit.The same right-wing media group that broke the Yellowhammer No Deal crisis story, off which The Mash Report has been leeching material all series.Above and beyond my own obvious desire to enslave the proletariat, through dumb quiz show answers, though, I am also a comedy fan, and the remarkable thing about the Brexit circus is that not once, in more than three years, has The Mash Report, Have I Got News For You, The Last Leg or Frankie Boyle’s New World Order said anything so funny it’s worth repeating.Hardly surprising really when, rather than being part of the comedy process, all of those shows are such an entrenched and slanted part of the left-of-centre political process they’ve all removed deserving Labour targets, like Diane Abbott, John McDonnell and Emily Thornberry, from any sort of firing line.It’s natural BBC Channel  bias and stupidity that’s led them to that sorry pass, I think, not orders from above.But the chances of those two networks ever changing their tone and playing fair Take the exact number of angry rants Nish Kumar’s aimed at Labour’s anti-Semites, on The Mash Report, multiply it by the number of times he’s mentioned the actual result of the Brexit referendum and your answer’s still zero.THE height of optimism  Britain’s Got Talent: The Champions host Ant McPartlin announcing: “We’ll be back with the winners of Holland’s Got Talent . See you in a few minutes.”Remarkably, though, they did, and I quickly regretted the decision, as even Simon Cowell had lost patience with the process by then and was taking it all out on some Dutch dance troupe called Fire.“It lacked imagination and creativity. I’ve seen this a million times. You’ve wasted a massive opportunity, guys.”The miracle was he didn’t snap earlier and far more often, as there were plenty of other acts absolutely begging for the red buzzers.Prime targets included: Mrs screechy pants, from Spain, Christina Ramos, DJ Arch, who won South Africa’s Got Talent aged three, presumably beating a two-year-old ventriloquist, and those Lebanese caterpillar dancers, Mayyas, from Beirut, whose reception owed a lot more to good manners than entertainment value.Picking two winners was, by contrast, a much harder task. But David Walliams’ golden buzzer went to Nico And Paddy, an -year-old salsa dancer whose signature move is the unravelling toilet roll drop, while the overall Wembley Arena winner was correctly judged to be Canadian escapologist Darcy Oake, who now faces the usual BGT challenge of doing something “even more dangerous” for the final. A simple solution presents itself.Get the Lebanese dancers to handcuff you inside that box, then see how quickly you escape, smart-a**e.CALLING out around the world, are you ready for a cookery heat Summer’s here and the time is right for basting turkey meat.Apologies to Marvin Gaye, William “Mickey” Stevenson and Ivy Jo Hunter for the dreadful liberties just taken with their Motown classic, but it’s not every day a genuine music legend rocks up in the BBC Celebrity MasterChef kitchen.And as well as Kiss FM DJ Rickie Haywood-Williams, Grammy-nominated singer Martha Reeves was also present, marinading cod and being told off by Gregg Wallace for over-seasoning a turkey burger for her troubles.She seemed to enjoy the experience as well.I just hope Martha was paying proper attention to the health and safety lecture head chef at the Kricket restaurant, Will Bowlby, gave fellow team member Greg Rutherford at the tandoor oven.“It rises in temperature to between  and  degrees.“You do not want to look over it, ’cos . . . ”It’s like a heatwave.MEANWHILE, on EastEnders, Ade Edmondson has reappeared, on Jean’s cancer ward, in a characteristically happy-go-lucky mood as Daniel.“I’ve got absolutely nothing to live for.

It brought tears to my eyes, although I had heard it all before from him and his we, as well as living through  years of similar traumatic experiences.His anguish at carrying his adored son in his arms for the last time was palpable.Perhaps I am just someone who shares some of Cameron’s “privileged pain” as the privately educated parent of a child with profound disability.Thankfully my daughter has survived complex epilepsy, among other problems, to reach adulthood.Yet like Cameron, I was plunged into the darkness of despair after the birth of a child with disabilities disrupted my le. Only later did I learn this was a form of grief as parents mourn the child they expected and come to terms with changed realities.We met soon after Ivan’s birth, a routine lunch between a journalist and MP turning into an intense discussion of shared experiences. Later we spoke about the impact on our lives and politics, even swapping notes on trusted doctors and schools.Cameron told me of struggling to take in diagnosis of Ivan’s Ohtahara syndrome, when a doctor said their son faced, “very serious dficulties”. He askedthis meant Ivan might have trouble with maths or much worse “I’m afraid it means he probably won’t walk or talk,” replied the paediatrician.For any family, rich or poor, this moment is a shock as dreams are shattered. Then comes a struggle to hold a family together, to retain jobs and relationships, to fight for education, respite and support in a system that seems often so uncaring.Your background makes little dference when filling in endless forms with the same details, searching for a school that might take your sick child, struggling with a seizure in a park, trying to find a public toilet to change a soiled pad or banging your head against blasé bureaucrats to win a few hours of respite care to retain sanity.Even at the world-famous Great Ormond Street Hospital we endured doctors who never read case notes, ed phone calls or responded to emails. One lost key files at a critical time another was a le-saver I will never forget.Exhausted families cling to such saviours as they navigate an overloaded, maze-like system filled with officials feuding over budgets. It seems almost asit is designed to inflame the distress of parents struggling under intense stress.This is recognised by this newspaper’s Give It Back campaign, demanding the Government plugs a £million-a-year funding gap and calling for a joined-up care system to help ensure families can live some semblance of normal le.Cameron wrote about the “torture” of seeing his son’s “small frame racked with spasms and what looked like searing pain” and feeling so helpless to stop the distress.However many times you see such seizures, the suffering never stops — as I felt again on Sunday afternoon watching my beautul daughter endure a series of fits that eventually needed emergency medication.As any parent knows all too well — hearing the hideously familiar screams while seeing the flailing limbs and rolling eyes — epilepsy can be a fatal condition.There are joys too, of course — but the pain of such parenthood is profound, the agonies seared deep in the soul, the struggles seem remorseless.And that is for everyone — whether rich or poor.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

However, some people get two. It’s like a lottery.If there’s a fire at the front of the house and that is blocked, the fire service said they’d have dficulty getting me out because I’m a big guy.“They made the house  per cent perfect but what they didn’t do was a door entry system and I’m doubly incontinent soI need to let someone in of a night I might not be in the best state.“I don’t want everyone having keys and having a key box frightens the le out of me because they’re not impenetrable.

I could even put a coat on in winter and go outside and sit with a cup of coffee while watching the birdsI wanted to.“I’ve been denied that privilege,you want to call it that, for the last two years.“As a disabled person I’ve lived for two years with this level of distress in this property and I wouldn’t have taken it had I known that this was the case.”He feels he’s being discriminated against because of his weight and admits that,he had another disability, he may be given a higher priority.His anxiety makes it dficult to leave the house but Darren, who is unemployed, says his depression isn’t being helped by not being able to get fresh air.A spokesperson from LHP said: Since being made aware of the customer’s concerns, the Lincolnshire Housing Partnershipteam, which was Shoreline Housing Partnership initially, has worked extensively to meet their needs, something that we would do for any inidual with specic housing requirements.Once a suitable property was identied, a process was followed to ensure the necessary work was identied and carried out – this involves recommendations from an Occupational Therapist, who is not employed by LHP, and the awarding of a North East Lincolnshire Disabilities Facilities Grant, .The work that was formally approved and funded by the DFG was kitchen and bathroom adaptation with the creation of a wet room, and the widening of the front door and internal doors.These adaptations were agreed with the customer. However, on their completion they issued a formal complaint, on the basis that two other actions had been verbally agreed but were not carried out – these being the installation of a specic door entry system and the widening of an external rear door.LHP decided to launch its own formal independent investigation to ensure that its course of action and action of staff were satisfactory, and this was carried out by a highly experienced independent assessor.A further independent fire safety assessment has also been carried out to address the customer’s concerns regarding fire safety in particular the rear access and again no further adaptions were identied as necessary.With regards to the door entry system: a system that is widely used by LHP was offered to the customer, but they deemed it not to be satisfactory for their specic needs. In such cases, LHP is happy for customers to make their own inidual arrangements.We value all our customer feedback, and aim to support all our customers, particularly those with disabilities, to ensure that they have a home that is suitable for their needs."},{"url":null,"title":"elon musk hired private investigator unsworth","story":"The Tesla tycoon paid James Howard , to probe the private le of Vernon Unsworth and claims he was later told he was wh**emongering young girls.The pair clashed when the Brit accused Musk of grandstanding by offering to help his ing team rescue  boys trapped in a cave in Thailand in July .Unsworth is now suing Musk in Los Angeles federal court, saying Musk ly branded him a paedophile and child rapist. The trial is scheduled for December .Musk has also claimed in his native South Africa paedo is commonly used to describe a creepy old man.However, it appears that the reports from the investigator were incorrect. In subsequent court documents Musk states that the investigator may have led him astray.In his court filing, Musk asks the judge for a summary judgement - which was refused - and explains all the reasons why he thinks he is innocent of defamation.The legal documents state: The investigator reported that Mr Unsworth was a fixture in Pattaya Beach, Thailand, a locale notorious for prostitution and child trafficking.It goes on that he had a taste for young Thai girls, that he w**remongered his way through the go-go bars of Thailand, that his only friends were his sexpat peers.It also states that he married his Thai we when she was a teenager, after starting a relationship when she was a young girl.The allegations come after the Mail Online obtained a motion Musk filed in a Calornia court on Monday.Specically, Musk testied that he sent e-mails to Buzzfeed due to a concern over what he heard about Unsworth.Musk said in the deposition: And I was like, well, whatthis is a real situation  Whatwhat we have here is another Jeffrey Epstein.We should, you know - I have this - I am told this information. I don’t knowit is true.But whatwe have another Jeffrey Epstein on our hands  And whathe uses whatever celebrity he gains from this cave rescue to shield his bad deeds  This would be terrible.”In the deposition, Musk also said he now believes that the private investigator led him astray, and was “just taking us for a ride.”Musk also attempted to play down the user of the word paedo arguing the word just means creepy old man in his home country.After failing to have the lawsuit dismissed, lawyers acting on behalf of Musk have now argued the term paedo guy was not an accusation of being a paedophile.In documents, lawyers say paedo guy was a common insult used during Musks upbringing in South Africa and he thought it was synonymous with creepy old man and aimed at insulting ones appearance and demeanour.The legal documents add: There is no evidence that Mr Musk intended or believed that his July  tweets, that Mr Unsworth was sus or paedo guy, would be interpreted as fact.To the contrary, the evidence is that Mr Musk believed and intended his statements to be read as what they were: bare insults.Musk had sent additional tweets after the paedo guy post, including one saying he would bet someone a signed dollar the alleged accusation was true.His lawyers argue his tweet cannot be defamatory because the statement was not made with malice, a requirement of the US constitutions First Amendment.The row between Musk and Mr Unsworth began after the er dismissed his offer to help and said he could stick his submarine where it hurts on July  last year.Musk responded by accusing him of being a paedo. He later deleted the tweet.Mr Unsworth, , has a signicant other in Thailand, a -year-old woman, according to the lawsuit, which asks for , US dollars .He started going to Thailand in , where he explored and mapped caves, the documents said.In June, Mr Unsworth, a financial consultant, was made an MBE for his service to cave ing.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mum Steph Davidson is now urging people to become blood and stem cell donors, to help keep her little Adeline alive. The former medical administrator from Alness, Scotland, and her husband Jordan were thrilled to welcome their daughter in November . Little Adeline had a bowel obstruction which required surgery soon after birth but she recovered well. Always small for her age, mum Steph, , made an appointment for Adeline to see a paediatrician but the four-month wait delayed this until February , .    The paediatrician noted how pale Adeline looked, although she seemed healthy otherwise. Nonetheless, he did blood tests and just a few hours later Steph received a call asking her to come back in immediately. Adelineaposs blood tests revealed possible blood cancer and Steph was told to prepare for her not coming home. Initially, doctors suspected leukaemia but when Adeline was transferred to Aberdeen Hospital, further tests confirmed that it wasnapost leukaemia, but doctors were no closer to a diagnosis. Adeline was tested for chromosome mutations, genetic conditions, other types of cancer and doctors are now testing her genomes to find a diagnosis. Adeline has very low platelets, red blood cell and white blood cell counts, causing bruises, petechia, tiredness, breathlessness and paleness. In March, doctors believed Adeline could have myelodysplasia, a blood cancer and bone marrow failure, but she shows signs which extend beyond this diagnosis, although it hasnapost been confirmed or ruled out. Since her diagnosis, Adeline had to be pulled out of nursery for fears of infection or falling which would have devastating impacts on her weakened system.    Steph started sharing Adelineaposs journey on @adelinebluesjourney_x to encourage more people to donate blood or become stem cell donors and has already seen almost , more donors sign up and help save her daughteraposs le. While searching for a stem cell match, Adelineaposs blood tests have been reviewed internationally, in Canada and Germany among other countries, to widen the search. Adeline needs a bone marrow transplant to save her le, but no full matches have been found yet so blood transfusions keep her stable until a match is found. Low blood counts put Adeline at risk of infection, internal bruising and bleeding out through a small cut as her blood cannot clot as usual. However, Steph insists that her battle with this mystery illness hasnapost dimmed Adelineaposs spirits as she maintains her lively personality and refuses to stop having fun. It was planned that Adeline would have a Hickman line put in to allow blood to be taken, transfusions to be given, and any medicine can go through the lines too, said Steph.    This was the best news because it was becoming traumatic for Ads as each time she had to get bloods taken, it took five attempts. Her veins were so weak and small, so theyaposd often collapse or move when the needle went in. She was an absolute star during the operation and calls her lines her apostogglesapos. Sheaposs not phased in the slightest with this new accessory. The first diagnosis we got was myelodysplasia in March, a form of blood cancer and bone marrow failure.For the last few months, theyaposve started to steer away from this diagnosis as Adeline has moments of stability and symptoms which arenapost covered by that diagnosis. It hasnapost been ruled out,but it could be something .Adelineaposs bone marrow doesnapost produce enough red blood cells, platelets or white blood cells so she needs transfusions once every two weeks. When she needs platelets, she bruises easily and has little patches of petechia on her body. When she needs red blood cells, she becomes pale, tired, clumsy and breathless. Platelets help our blood clot when we bruise or cut ourselves, so when Adelineaposs are low, she has a high risk of bleeding out through a cut or bleeding internally from bruising. White blood cells help fight infection, so when Adelineaposs are low, she has a high risk of getting an infection and her body struggles to fight it off. Even though Adeline is poorly, you wouldnapost be able to tell. Sheaposs a lovely, lively, funny, beautul little girl and this illness hasnapost stopped her having fun.

He ed to Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, after being made homeless and moved into his current property in March last year.    Lincolnshire Housing Partnership , which owns the property, widened the front and interior doors to help make the house more accessible, as well as making other adjustments to bring the bungalow up-to-date. The back door, however, remains inaccessible because it hasn’t been adjusted with the result that Darren cant get out to sit in his garden. It has sent him into a deep state of anxiety and depression and he is worried that,there’s a fire, he’ll be trapped inside his own home. But LHP say they carried out their own formal independent investigation and came to the conclusion that it was unnecessary to make adjustments to the rear of the property. It turns out that the authority says they’re only responsible to provide one exit. However, some people get two. It’s like a lottery, he said. If there’s a fire at the front of the house and that is blocked, the fire service said they’d have dficulty getting me out because I’m a big guy. “All I wanted was to get settled and sorted out. “They made the house  per cent perfect but what they didn’t do was a door entry system and I’m doubly incontinent soI need to let someone in of a night I might not be in the best state.  “I don’t want everyone having keys and having a key box frightens the le out of me because they’re not impenetrable. I have anxiety so I would never sleep again. Darren is trying to desperately lose weight and says he’s lost  pounds since taking medication to treat his diabetes after he was diagnosed last year. He says all he wants to do is to be able to enjoy his own back garden and not be a prisoner in his own home as he tries to get his social le back on track. “I’ve been anxious about this on top of my usual anxiety and depression,” he said. “Anywhere I’ve ever lived I’ve been able to get out into the yard and when you’re not very able it’s nice to get outside. I could even put a coat on in winter and go outside and sit with a cup of coffee while watching the birdsI wanted to. “I’ve been denied that privilege,you want to call it that, for the last two years. “As a disabled person I’ve lived for two years with this level of distress in this property and I wouldn’t have taken it had I known that this was the case.” He feels he’s being discriminated because of his weight and admits that,he had another disability, he may be given a higher priority.  His anxiety makes it dficult to leave the house but Darren, who is unemployed, says his depression isn’t being helped by not being able to get fresh air. “Too many organisations want to fat shame me when it’s not my disability,” he said. “It’s a causal effect, not a primary. “There’s no doubt that losing weight will help me be healthier and it impacts every facet of my le. “You can’t click your fingers and say ‘I’m thin’ because it takes a lot of time to get overweight so you’re not going to get thin overnight. “With depression it’s a very circular issue. A lot of people run to the drug dealer for their fix but I roll on to the refrigerator. I’m trying to do something about that.” A spokesperson from LHP said: Since being made aware of the customer’s concerns, the Lincolnshire Housing Partnershipteam, which was Shoreline Housing Partnership initially, has worked extensively to meet their needs, something that we would do for any inidual with specic housing requirements. Once a suitable property was identied, a process was followed to ensure the necessary work was identied and carried out – this involves recommendations from an Occupational Therapist, who is not employed by LHP, and the awarding of a North East Lincolnshire Disabilities Facilities Grant, .

It was caused by a group of pet woolly mangalica pigs which had been terrorising the neighbourhood of Penryn in Cornwall for months by breaking in gardens and escaping into the road.The owner has now finally sold them after their latest stampede damaged several graves - including one belonging to Charlie Jermyn, who died of sepsis in .   Charlie was born in a toilet at home but died  hours later of sepsis after healthcare workers failed to spot the tell-tale symptoms. An inquest later highlighted a sequence of failures leading to Charlieaposs death. But his family have now faced further heartbreak at the destruction of his final resting place at the Glebe Cemetery.   Hayley, of Penryn, said: We found out via Facebook that the pigs had got in, and I went down on Saturday morning to take photos.They have done a lot of damage to the grass next to Charlieaposs grave, and there was mud all over his headstone base and ornaments and some were knocked over. They had also lted some of the grass in front Charlies headstone and started disturbing the earth which was very distressing.    Hayley said the man who owned the pigs had been asked over the course of several months to get the pigs under control. He is aware of the damage done but hasnapost approached any family regarding an apology orhe could make it right, she said.    I am awaiting the council getting back to me as well. We were obviously devastated but realise it could be a lot worse. At the end of the day pigs will be pigs and itaposs up to the owner. Our son Harry, who is , was really upset about it. He helped tidy up Charlieaposs grave and keeps askingthe pigs are gone now. Witnesses claimed it was a gang of four pigs which caused the havoc. Neighbours Adam Philpott and Natalie Flynn said they called the police on Friday to report the troublesome swine.

The survivors, now aged  to  and eight of whom are blood related, are now celebrating their recoveries while raising awareness of the cancer. Joyce Waite, , was first diagnosed in  and her nephewaposs partner, Jane Reeson, became the last to have a successful mastectomy in . We’ve all fought cancer together as a family and shared our experiences with each other which has really helped, said Vanessa Haw, , who was the eighth family member to be diagnosed, back in April . The fact ten of us have gone through it has been a huge help. We’re a close family so we’ve been there for each other.    That support and knowing someone had breast cancer but survived has been brilliant. The shop owner, of Coningsby, Lincolnshire, who has four children and eight great-grandchildren, was diagnosed with cancer after an annual mammogram in April . She refused radiotherapy because of how it affected her mother Barbara who was diagnosed with cancer in . In May , Vanessa had a left-sided mastectomy and had all lymph nodes removed from her left arm. She had two more operations to remove damaged skin and underwent a right mastectomy in October  as a precaution.  The gran added: Even on the worst days, you knew there was le, there was hope. I had my last yearly mammogram in April . I got called back and had to have a deep core biopsy whilst I was there. I got diagnosed with breast cancer four days later. I made the decision to refuse radiotherapy due to the way I had seen it affect my mum. And her -year-old mum, Barbara Limb, was the second woman in the family to be diagnosed with cancer. The retired care home worker, who has five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren, went to her GP in July  after experiencing breast pain. She was referred to Grantham Hospital in Lincolnshire and had a mammogram and two biopsies before being diagnosed with breast cancer.  She said: I was sat at my friend’s house when she said to me ‘Barbara you have got a pain’ and she asked me what the pain was like. When I told her she said it was the same sort of pain she had. She made me go to the GP that afternoon. The doctor saw me and got in touch with the local hospital and the next week they did a mammogram and a biopsy on the same day. The doctor said that there was something there but they bad missed it so I had tofor a second biopsy and the results confirmed I had breast cancer. I had my op on the August ,  and had lymph nodes removed and a lumpectomy. This was followed by a full course of radiotherapy which still burns me all these years later. But Iaposm a survivor.  Barbara’s niece Trudie Smart, , a teaching assistant from Boston, Lincolnshire, was diagnosed with breast cancer in April . She had eight cycles of chemotherapy before having a mastectomy in November that year followed by three weeks of radiotherapy. She said: My breast cancer was ER+ which meant I produced too much estrogen so I opted to have my oies removed. Just months after her diagnosis, her mum Shirley Limb, , of Kirton, Lincolnshire, was diagnosed in September . Shirley, who has three grown-up children, six grandchildren and two great-grandchildren, was given the news following a routine mammogram. An ultra-sound and biopsy confirmed she had breast cancer and she had a lumpectomy and lymph nodes removed just before Christmas that year. She then had radiotherapy every day for three weeks and was told she was in remission in the summer of . Despite not being a blood-relative, Vanessa’s brother’s partner Lorraine Hill, , was diagnosed after finding a large lump in her breast in .  The barmaid and mum-of-one, from Horncastle, Lincolnshire, had chemotherapy to shrink the tumour before undergoing a partial mastectomy. Sister-in-law Hazel Holland, , was also struck down when she had mammogram in February . The mum-of-two and breakfast club supervisor had an operation in March that year to remove a lump and lymph nodes, followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy. She said: I just took it all in my stride and got on with le.  Three years earlier in , Hazel’s mum Mary Limb, , was told she had breast cancer after doctors found a lump. She was in hospital for four days after her operation to remove the lump and lymph nodes followed by radiotherapy. Two years later Mary’s sister-in-law Margaret Bedford, , was diagnosed in August . The mum-of-three had a lumpectomy the next month and following four weeks of gruelling radiotherapy was declared cancer free. A month later, in October , her son David’s partner Jane Reeson, , was dealt a devastating blow when she was diagnosed with cancer.  The delivery driver and mum-of-two children had a mastectomy on her left side in November that year. She has been told to take estrogen-blocker Tamoxen for five years but so far all tests have come back clear. She said: “I couldn’t feel a lump at all, soit hadn’t been for the mammogram it could have been a dferent story. “Obviously knowing what many members of the family had gone through meant I was conscious of the importance of getting regular check-ups.” The family’s calendar will be officially launched next month with all proceeds going to the charity Breast Cancer Care.

Daniel Bates has been sentenced to  months in prison after spending a whole hour wandering around a new build housing estate in Houghton-le-Spring, Durham, in a drunken stupor, trying door and window handles as he looked for something to steal.The -year-old either burgled or attempted to burgle  homes on the single morning of June  this year, leaving several residents frightened, ChronicleLive reports. Newcastle Crown Court  heard Bates stole a mountain bike from one personaposs garage, while another man saw him on CCTV trying to open his patio doors.But the judge said the most serious of the incidents happened on Greenfield Way, when a woman came down the stairs at around .am and went into her living room to find a man, very muddy and smelling of alcohol, standing next to her baby. Prosecutor Emma Dowling said: She was frightened, she asked him why he was there and what he was doing. He said aposI tried knocking but there was no answer so I came inapos. She asked him to leave, which he did.  In the womanaposs victim personal statement she said: I donapost feel safe in my own house. My baby was right next to where he came in. Iaposm on edge and upset that someone could come into my house without permission. After it happened I took my baby upstairs and burst into tears. Bates was then seen on Syston Close, a nearby street, trying the door handles of two houses before going into a garage and stealing a red mountain bike as the alarm went off. The court heard the witness who saw this called the police. Ms Dowling said: Another witness saw the defendant and recognised him vaguely from being around the area. He asked hershe wanted her windows cleaned and she said she didnapost, but she began to watch him as she was suspicious about his behaviour. She saw him looking through windows and trying door handles of other houses. The court heard that the last offence happened on Black Cherry Close when a witness saw him in the rear garden of a neighbouraposs house and alerted the homeowner. Ms Dowling said: He checked his CCTV and could see the defendant trying to open the patio doors before walking around the house to the front and trying the front door. Police attended an address not too far away at Avon Terrace and found the defendant and the stolen mountain bike. Steven Reed, defending, said Bates turned to crime to fund a drug habit. He told the court: He was wandering around in a drunken state, trying doors, trying windows. There was no planning involved, it was totally unsophisticated and an attempt to find something to steal.

Earning herself the nickname Dr Pimple Popper, the -year-oldaposs is an expert in all things to do with the skin, nails and hair - and people around the world are addicted to watching her work. And now sheaposs shared her own secrets by revealing her night time skin care routine - including a very easy hack for using make-up remover wipes and the mistake lots of us make while washing our face.In a video for Harperaposs Bazaar , the TV star showed people exactly what she does every evening and what products she uses to keep her skin clear and bright.   She says: Iaposm definitely always aware of what Iaposm putting on my skin but I am not crazy about it. I do not have a lot of steps in my regimen, but I do know my skin type. I am dry and on the sensitive side, so I like to keep things to a minimum. She also shares her biggest regret of how she treated her skin when she was younger, saying she wishes she didnapost rub her eyes so much when she was younger. This causes damages to the area which changes the skin and over time causes lines and wrinkles. Instead she dabs her face and her eyes at ever step of her cleansing process.She starts by removing her fake eyelashes and using Lancomeaposs Bi-Facil Double-Action Eye Makeup Remover on her eyes. This costs about £. But instead of putting the liquid on normal cotton pads, she has her own which she describes as a mix of Kleenex and a pad. Sheaposs careful not to rub her eyes, instead just dabbing it on and letting it soak into the skin. She then uses her own SLMD Skincare cleansing wipes to remove the rest of her make up. She says: I dab at my face, I try to get off the excess make-up.    I donapost rub because Iaposm more prone to getting rashes or irritations, and when you do that you get more wrinkles because those change your skin and make you look older. Even a washcloth is going to cause micro tears, so you just need to be gentle.Sandra alternates between two cleansers to address the two biggest skin problems she has. She either uses the CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser , which you can buy from Boots for £., and her Salicylic Acid Cleanser which is pricier at £.When it comes to washing her face, Sandra has an important tip which can make a huge dference to you skin. She said: The thing thataposs really important about washing your face that I know from a dermatologistaposs perspective, is that when youaposre washing your face youaposre actually getting rid of moisture, so you really want to not go really hot and you donapost want to go really cold either.    When youaposre washing face youaposre actually getting rid of the moisture. You donapost want to shock your skin. Lukewarm water is the best. I donapost rub my face either, I just rinse off. When your skin is still moist thataposs the prime time to moisturise becauseyour skin is wet the moisture evaporates. The air pulls the moisture out of your skin and you get drier. Thataposs why you get that tight feeling after you wash your face.Speaking about her dry skin and eczema , she explains that she uses SLMD Hyaluronic Acid Serum to help her skin which she allows to sink in before moving onto the next step."},{"url":null,"title":"man sells 325k home set","story":"NewsMan sells £K home to set up sex toy business - and he now sleeps in his officeEXCLUSIVE.

Tom Thurlow decided to throw everything at his idea to launch a new range of vibrators for women and has spent the past three years learning everything he can about the industry.Last week his hard work paid off when he launched Ricky , but itaposs a huge risk as heaposs invested pretty much everything he has into the venture.The -year-old sold the £, Gloucestershire home he bought with profits from his last business success, cashed in his Premium Bonds and got rid of his fancy car to free up as much cash as possible. He moved back to his parentsapos house for a while but says they got fed up with him, so he decided to set up a make-sht home behind his desk. Tom has tried to make it as homely as possible and bulk buys Pot Noodles on Amazon to keep his spending as low as possible.    Tom told : It was everything really. I just decided,Iaposm going to be in I need to be all in. I really believe in it and Iaposm a risk taker. My whole le is in it. Iaposm happy to lose it allthataposs the way it goes.I just think that whatever happens with Brexit , people are still going to want to masturbate.The idea came about when his last business, a dating website for students called ShagAtUni, started to drop off. He said: I enjoyed a lot of success with ShagAtUni  but it started to drop off when apps like Tinder came on the market.  Rather than flogging a dead horse I just wanted to do something dferent. I just thought sex toys seemed the most exciting. I donapost take myself seriously. I donapost think sex is a big deal like most people in society do. People werenapost surprised when I told them. Most people think itaposs great and they think itaposs quite cool and exciting. There have been a couple of people who didnapost agree with the sex toy stuff and they think itaposs seedy. Thataposs fine, everyone has their opinions but I will have a debate with them and challenge them. My biggest critic is my mum, she just thinks itaposs horrying.    After coming up with the idea Tom booked a flight to cheap flight to China to learn as much as he could about the production industry and things went from there. Despite having one bad experience when he was nearly ripped off by a fake business he found on the internet, he managed to learn a lot about materials, safety and production. He said: Itaposs been a really interesting learning curve. There have been a lot of hurdles along the way. His trips to China did product one particularly embarrassing moment for Tom, and he says it was the low point of the business.    He was travelling back to the UK with a suitcase full of test products - about  vibrators - when he was pulled in by airport security. He spent about two hours being questioned by staff about what they items were and why he had so many of them, and ended up missing his flight. He said: It was awful. It took them a long time to realise what they were. They were just looking at me with stern expressions. They just kept asking me in broken English what it was. I was travelling on my own, so it just looks dodgy as hell.    It doesnapost get any more humiliating than it did then. That was definitely a low point. Tom decided to focus his attentions on womenaposs sex toys and he wants to address the stigma that surrounds female masturbation. He said: Itaposs really bizarre that a woman is judged on masturbation, I just donapost get it. Iaposm really focusing on women who have never had a sex toy before.

A worker suffered third-degree burns in the explosion which occurred during repairs to a sanitary inspection room on the fth floor at the State Research Centre of Virology and Biotechnology. The Siberian facility, also known as Vector, housed the Soviet Unionaposs biological weapons research during the Cold War before it was transformed into one of Russiaaposs primary disease research centres.    A major incident was declared after a gas cylinder explosion blew out glass windows and sparked a fire that spread to  square metres before it was finally extinguished. Russia insisted the parts of the building affected by the blast and fire did not hold any biohazardous substances. Authorities said there was no structural damage to the site in Koltsovo, a small city in Siberia that has become a hub for biotechnology, molecular biology and virology.

Colum OaposCarroll flew with his we, Maura, from Dublin, Ireland, for an eight-day golfing trip at the Mar Menor Golf Village in Murcia last Tuesday when they were caught up in the storm. The -year-old became aware the area was expecting a historic deluge on Thursday after barricades went up and they heard thunder and lightning. But the full impact only dawned when they woke up the following morning and realised they couldnapost get out of the resort gates. He told : On Friday, all hell broke loose and we were stuck here and we just couldnapost get out.    Staff were unable to access the resort due to the treacherous roads and meant guests were left to their own devices. They endured queues of up to  minutes to get supplies as local restaurants in the area were shut. Residents were also forced to endure  hours without running water after the supply was cut off over fears of contamination from sewage. Pictures showed how cars outside were swept over barriers and left abandoned.    The golf courses and hotel pools were also submerged due to the flooding. Colum, who is retired, said staff did their best to keep guests happy, but struggled with the workload. There was no water, no staff. Another guest told me there were nine staff members manning the whole resort. The shop was closed because the staff couldnapost get into the place. The security guard was handing out the food and then he was working at the bar. If you were looking for a drink at the bar you could be queuing for  minutes. Everybody was walking in circles. There was nothing to do.    Colum said tourists were left in the dark as to what was going on and received little official communication. The guests were laughing because the whole situation was so unbelievable, he said. When we asked questions they just said they didnapost know. No one had any idea whataposs happening. Southeastern Spain is still struggling to deal with two days of torrential rains which killed five people and saw some , people evacuated. The situation is critical, all the municipality is full of water, Mario Cervera, mayor of the town of Los Alcazares, one of the most affected in Murcia, told Spainaposs state-run TVE channel last week  Many roads, railways and an airport closed on Friday and emergency services rescuing people stuck in flooded highway tunnels.

The part of town where Dundee Harp was founded is long removed, but that section of town was still there in the s.”Rob continued as he traced Dundee Harp’s once fertile source of talent: “We can start at Pat Cassady’s barber shop, or across the street at the premises of Terry McMahon’s pub – The Harp.“Both were on Brook Street in the Westport area of Dundee, otherwise known as The Burn. Heading east towards City Square, to the right past Daniels brae, you pass the Burn Bar.“A quick look inside would probably see brothers Pat and Jim Sturrock pouring sumptuous pints of heavy, and Eddie Greenan would normally be standing at the far end of the bar.“A bit further on, you would be at the Blackness Road junction before heading down the Blackie past the Blue Mountains, and now entering the bustling shopping expanse of the West Port.“With the Globe Bar visible in a rear-view mirror, crossing over Tay Street reveals the Overgate. This historic artery had a pulse and an energy all to itself.“Those memorable stretches of the old town nurtured the players who turned out for Dundee Harp FC.”Rob revealed that Arbroath had a star defender, a local lad called Tom O’Kane.Rob went on: “He took no prisoners and could leather a ball from one end of the pitch to the other.“At the beginning of the - season, Tom was poached and somehow persuaded to leave his home team to sign for Dundee Harp.“The town of Arbroath was outraged at the smash-and-grab by Harp.“Were underhand means used to attract O’Kane “Probably.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/06/image.jpg1_.396679.jpg ","title":"blether exhibition on dundee uniteds greatest gaffer jim mclean is wonderful","story":"Tannadice Park currently hosts a wonderful initiative as Dundee United remembers the glory years under their greatest-ever manager.Tom Cairns, chairman of the Dundee United Business Club, along with several other volunteers, host the ‘The United in Memories’ display at the ground.Said Tom: “This year, it features The Jim McLean Years and can be viewed every Wednesday until late November .“On display is an array of interesting memorabilia encompassing the managerial career of the most successful manager in Dundee United’s history.“The event is staffed by knowledgeable volunteers from Dundee United Business Club.”This has got to be a must-see event for every United fan – and, indeed, every football fan.Admission is free via the main door at Tannadice Park from pm until .pm and has easy disabled persons access."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/SNS-19281556-MS-Dundee-v-Alloa.jpg ","title":"dundee boss mcpake blasts horrific decision that could have cost side three points","story":"Dundee boss James McPake blasted referee Alan Newlands for a “horric decision” that could have cost his side a vital three points.The Dens gaffer was annoyed to be talking about what he said was “as blatant a penalty on Cammy Kerr as you’re likely to see” when he should have been talking up a “controlled” win over a good Alloa Athletic side.The spot-kick would have given the Dark Blues the opportunity to see the game out easier as the Wasps piled on the pressure late on.McPake said: “It was a horric decision that could have in the end cost us – I have to say I don’t like criticising referees but it’s decisions like that that can cost points.“We had one at Tannadice that I was honest enough to say wouldn’t have mattered in the grand scheme of things but that one really could have mattered.“It was as blatant a penalty on Cammy Kerr as you’re likely to see.“I’m being genuine when I say I don’t like doing it because they have a hard enough job as it is but it was as stonewall penalty as I’ve seen.“They said nobody saw it.“I end up talking about something I shouldn’t be when I should be talking about the dominant display from us.”First-half goals from Danny Johnson and Jordan McGhee either side of Liam Dick’s th-minute equaliser for the visitors were enough to give McPake’s side victory.“It was a good three points,” he added.“I thought the performance was decent in spells. Alloa were decent, we knew they would be, and credit to them for playing some good football.“We really controlled large parts of that game and I thought the front three were a real threat. Josh McPake was excellent, it was a good first start for the kid, and Fin Robertson coming back was very controlled in the middle of the park.“I thought he dictated the play for large spells. In the last  minutes, we got a bit deeper but we saw it through.”Josh McPake limped off in the second half with a dead calf but should be fine for next weekend while Jamie Ness wasn’t risked after his ankle knock. Josh Meekings missed Saturday’s game due to a family issue."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/5d7b60fe6a1559.24284622.jpg ","title":"dundee out to up the tempo against alloa to get back to winning ways","story":"Jordan Marshall says Dundee are aiming to up the tempo against Alloa tomorrow as they bid to get back to winning ways.The Dark Blues welcome the Wasps to Dens Park this weekend aiming to cut the gap to the top of the table and finally put the - derby thrashing at Dundee United behind them.Marshall admits that was a hard one to take but insists the work done on the training pitch since then can pay off as theyto league action.He told the Tele: “We’ve been working on moving the ball faster in training – we’ve been doing lots of drills on that, moving it quickly across the pitch.“A lot of teams will come here and just sit in this season so we do need to move the ball quick and catch them off guard.“To be honest, I don’t think we’ve done that enough this season – when we have we’ve scored goals.“Against Ayr that worked, Fin Robertson switched to me, I put it in and we scored.“We’ve been trying to do more of that in training. It’s harder for the defence when you move it quickly from side to side because there will be a gap in the defence some time.“As well as moving it quicker, you have to be patient to wait for that gap to appear.”Marshall was given a break by manager James McPake for the - Challenge Cup defeat to Elgin City last Sunday and is keen to get back on the pitch come tomorrow.“I wasn’t playing on Sunday, the gaffer said I could head home and see some family and get a rest, but when I came back the feeling was positive around the place, to be honest,” he added.“I don’t think we need to dwell too much on it. We’ve had a couple of bad results but it’s happened, it’s over and it’s about putting it right tomorrow.“If you look over the whole start to the season, it’s been a decent start.“The derby was obviously a night to forget but we have three more derbies this season and we’ll be looking to put that right later on in the season.”On being rested, he added: “I want to be playing every week but we have a good squad with two good players for every position. The gaffer needed to see Sean Mackie play as well so, fair enough, I respect his decision.“It’s always good to have a bit of competition.”Dundee picked up six clean sheets in their opening eight matches of the season and rediscovering that will be key to getting back to form, says Marshall.Their inability to deal with set-pieces at Tannadice, too, took the left-back by surprise two weeks ago and the former Queen of the South man revealed improving that has been a key part of training lately.He added: “We’d kept a few clean sheets already this season and then conceding six was unacceptable, particularly at this club.“We need to get back to being solid and doing the basics right like we were doing when we were picking up so many clean sheets. We’ve been working on our set-pieces.“Usually we’ve been pretty solid from them this season. We need to put that right because we can’t defend like that.”And Alloa in the past have used their threat at set-plays to pick up some vital results in the Championship.Marshall added: “I haven’t seen much of Alloa this year but last season they were always organised and they scored from a few set-pieces against me when I was at Queens.“They are also a good footballing side and I’ve heard they are playing out from the back this season so they’ll probably come here and try to play football as well.“They are a part-time team but they were brilliant last year. They always seem to grind results out and we need to be aware of that.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/685228fd-45a3-4180-9022-442d8acf66fa-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/685228fd-45a3-4180-9022-442d8acf66fa-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/685228fd-45a3-4180-9022-442d8acf66fa-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/685228fd-45a3-4180-9022-442d8acf66fa-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"mural celebrating dundees comic history to be unveiled at city cinema","story":"To celebrate an upgrade of its Dundee cinema, Odeon is to create a comic mural inspired by the city.The mural will pay tribute to Dundee’s famous contributions to the comics industry, and comes as the cinema firm carries out a major refurbishment, which will bring  reclining seats across  screens.The refurbishment of the cinema to its Odeon #Luxe# standard also includes a brand-new on-site Costa Coffee corner and iSense screen at the Douglas Road venue.There are just  Odeon Luxe cinemas in the UK, three of which are in Scotland.Revamp will see Dundee complex one of the top cinemas in the country\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp revamp-will-see-dundee-complex-one-of-the-top-cinemas-in-the-country embed # secrethZQTLUb\" data-secret\"hZQTLUb\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"The firm will be creating the comic mural in honour of the city’s famous history and achievements for the industry that has inspired many popular films.The hand-drawn, four-metre mural will incorporate the moments and icons that make Dundee special, and will be unveiled inside the cinema on launch day.Odeon Luxe Dundee general manager, Kim Thorne, said: “We are so delighted to be celebrating not only the opening of our fantastic new ODEON Luxe Dundee, but also the city’s incredible contribution to the comic book industry, which of course inspired many modern blockbusters.#We hope all Dundee locals feel a sense of pride as they walk through our doors and see the astounding comic mural inside, and we can’t wait to welcome all of our guests to experience the new Odeon Luxe Dundee.#"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/5d77d03e4538e5.07230682.jpg ","title":"shankland starring but appere not far behind says dundee uniteds mcmullan","story":"Ten goals in just nine appearances so far for Dundee United means the hype surrounding striker Lawrence Shankland is both understandable and fair.And it’s meant him picking up the Player-of-the-Month award for August has to go down as one of the easiest decisions the judging  has ever had to make.So far as winger Paul McMullan is concerned every plaudit that’s come his new team-mate’s way has been thoroughly well deserved.Butthere is an injustice surrounding the Tangerines’ blistering start to the league season, McMullan feels it might just be the lack of recognition for Shankland’s fellow-striker Louis Appere.Because he feels since breaking into the first team at the start of the campaign, the -year-old has also had a massive impact.“Louis has been brilliant. He came in for pre-season looking sharp and really fit and he’s carried that right through into the league campaign,” said McMullan.“He’s been really good but that’s probably gone under the radar a wee bit with Shanks scoring however many goals he has, but Louis has been great.“I’m sure Shanks will say the same thing because Louis has been really good for him and they seem to work together very well.“It’s made things a bit more dficult for defences because there is two of them up there to worry about and that’s good for us.“The two of them complement each other very well and that’s what you want from your strikers. It’s good for the team.”As they look to continue what’s been a perfect start in the Championship with, four wins from four outings so far, tomorrow sees United head for Ayr United and potentially one of their toughest tests to date.McMullan is well aware last season Somerset Park was not a happy hunting ground.It saw United suffer two defeats that were signicant blows to their automatic promotion challenge.While he is determined to take three points this time, he expects to have to work hard for them.“They were dficult to play against last year and it will be the same again,” McMullan added.“They are direct and make the game really physical. You don’t really get a minute on the ball.“So you have to be ready to go against them andyou are not at it % then you will get beat.”Of course, one big plus this time round is that man Shankland being in tangerine instead of black and white.McMullan’s viewing that as a double bonus.“I think he scored six goals against us so it will be great that he is not up against us this time.“Having him in your team is brilliant. You just need to get it into the vicinity of the -yard box and the ball usually hits him and then goes in!”For the Terrors, the main priority is another win to keep the early season momentum going.While he admits his preference would have been for the league games to be coming thick and fast right now, he’s not too concerned about last week’s break for the Challenge Cup possibly interrupting the team’s flow.“The cup has kind of broken it up a bit for us. It was a bit inconvenient, to be honest, and it’s not the greatest cup as it is.“It kind of broke up our momentum but we are determined to pick up where we left off after the derby against Dundee.”“The positive side of the couple of breaks we’ve had since the league started is that they can give time for boys who’ve picked up knocks to recover properly and we’ll all be feeling fresh for this game.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/KMil_Bee-005-846x564.jpg ","title":"the first thing i did in the morning was make myself a double vodka and water dundee man turns his life around with the help of community group","story":"“The first thing I did in the morning was make myself a double vodka and water,” said Ian Thomas, speaking of his -year alcohol addiction.“I’d have a few of those for my breakfast.“I would wake up and vomit, have diarrhoea.“I was delirious, tremors, no appetite. I was drinking to knock myself out.”Ian, , of Earn Crescent, said his le was so low he had suicidal thoughts of slitting his wrists and jumping off the Tay Road Bridge.He said: “I kept a diary. I wrote in it every day the amount of times I was sick, bleeding, diarrhoea, then wrote that I just wanted to go to sleep and not wake up.”Ian desperately wanted out of the le of alcoholism but he did not know how he could escape it without dying.He said: “I was hospitalised dozens of times.“I wasn’t the master of my le anymore, alcohol was the master of me, everything I did revolved around it.“I lived in a slum.“There was blood everywhere, spewing everywhere, mouldy drink cans, pee all over the place – I knew it was a slum but I didn’t care.”It got so bad that Ian could not walk or talk and was checked into former psychiatric hospital Sunnyside in Montrose three times for detoxication by his family.But it was only following the third time Ian made the conscious decision to stay sober – a feat he’s managed for  years now.He said: “I’m not proud of myself.“I don’t look at the past, I just take each day at a time.“I tell myself I’m sober today and the rest slowly takes care of itself.”Ian now keeps himself busy with activities such as drawing and creative projects at Just Bee Productions.The community group offers people a safe space to be creative and connect with others at vulnerable times in their lives.Ian said: “Getting involved with Just Bee is one of the best things that’s ever happened to me.“It keeps my mind busy and gives me something positive to focus on and it’s good to be around people again, instead of sitting in the house on my own all day with just my thoughts.”Ian and about  other participants in the group are gearing up to start working on a musical theatre show called This is a Mental Musical.Claire Bee, founder of Just Bee Productions, said: “The show is about mental health and everything that goes along with that.“It’s also about giving people a  to have a voice to say what they want to say.”The show will be performed in Dundee and the group hopes to take it to Edinburgh Fringe Festival next year.Former plays performed by Just Bee include Drink, The Musical which toured community venues in Dundee, including nearby prisons, and another musical called Next Stop Please.Former heroin addict Cheryl Ferguson, , said: “Doing the musicals has helped to build up my confidence, self worth and a feeling that I belong.“It’s opened up opportunities which I wouldn’t have thought were possible and I’ve met loads of brilliant people who are like family now.“I love it. No drugs can give that sort of feeling.“The first time I did it, I came off stage and felt brilliant and it wasn’t brought on by any substance.”"},{"url":null,"title":"ariana-grande-everything-need-know-hydro-gig","story":"POP powerhouse Ariana Grande will play the Hydro on Tuesday night."},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey -

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives. There is also support for parents and carers.At SDS centres customers can get information, advice and guidance about jobs, the local labour market, training courses and apprenticeships as well as how to prepare for interviews and help with CVs and applications.The work of SDS careers advisers in schools and centres is supported by Scotland’s careers website myworldofwork, where you can access advice  hours a day. It is packed with career information, advice and tools such as the CV builder. There is also a dedicated exam results section.Details of the local SDS centres are available at myworldofwork centres and information about events and opportunities is also available on Facebook.Pauline Graham, Project Manager for the SDS Exam Results HelplineSir,I had a great time at this year#s Islay Show. It was fantastic to speak to so many of my constituents.It was also wonderful to see many local business stalls promoting Islay#s dynamic and booming economy.The show was well attended with lots of families, both local and visitors, having a fun day out and luckily the sun was shining most of the day.A huge thanks to all the organisers and everyone  who contributed to the event.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I have real concerns about the deteriorating condition of some Argyll cemeteries.Constituents from Islay recently joined Councillor Alastair Redman in highlighting the poor upkeep of cemeteries in the area he represents.Councillor Redman reported that there were also problems at other cemeteries in his ward, including the cemetery at Carradale in East Kintyre.I understand that Argyll and Bute Council confirmed that they now, at last, have plans in place to address the problems at Kilnaughton.It remains disappointing, however, that things are allowed to deteriorate to the extent that the maintenance of cemeteries has become a matter of public concern.Frankly, it is very surprising that a cemetery where interments are actually still taking place has been undermined in this way and there must surely be an obligation to ensure this doesn’t happen.My experience is that communities in the Highlands and Islands pay special regard to the final resting places of fellow members of their communities and will be perplexed to discover that they appear to be uncared-for.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures august 16 2019","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTayvallich reader Colin MacInnes captured this photo of these two fluffy cygnets at the Corran Burn in Lochgilphead back in July.A couple of adult swans were spotted floating nearby at the time on Loch Fyne and Loch Gilp around Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll course draws skippers and compliments","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowMid Argyll Radio Sailing put its toe in the water last Saturday when skippers arrived with their model radio controlled yachts from the club#s first competition.Several Scottish clubs # Ayr Bay Radio Yacht Club, Greenock, Rhu and Paisley # travelled to Mid Argyll joined by others from as far afield as the Preston area.A total of  yachts raced each other around the club#s Loch a Bahrain course near Cairnbaan.A steady wind from the south produced some exciting close encounters results and near misses.

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

With the world championship they also secured the Champion of Champions accolade for the fourth year in a row.The band#s success has been remarkable since being formed with Inveraray  youngsters just  years ago by current leaders Pipe Major Stuart Liddell and lead drummer Steven McWhirter. The band rose rapidly through the ranks, winning the world title, and many others besides, at every grade in which it competed.Inveraray is now established as the Grade  band to beat and players are attracted from around the world # but regardless of its international make-up, Inveraray still lies at its heart.That fact was clearly in evidence as the reception was crowned by a magical performance by the world champions, enjoyed by all and captured for posterity on the many mobile phones raised to the heavens.Speaking as he presented the quaich, Councillor MacMillan congratulated the band on its success, achieved in a relatively short period of time thanks to the dedication of all concerned.Argyll and Bute MP Brenan O#Hara said the band#s success has been #absolutely remarkable# and quipped that Inveraray#s success had turned him into a #born-again piper#, so inspired has he been.Pipe Major Stuart Liddell, Inveraray born and bred and from a line of superb pipers, said: #I want to thank all band members for their hard work over the past several years, and of course their families who have put up with so much and made sacrices for it to happen # particularly those with young families. It is greatly appreciated.#He added: #Thanks to the town of Inveraray and everyone  who has supported us. We couldn#t have done it without you.#And it was on to a selection of brilliant tunes to entertain the adoring fans clustered around the green.Speaking after the event, Inveraray Community Council convenor Linda Divers said: #Thanks to everyone who came out to show their support to Inveraray and District Pipe Band, and to Councillor Donnie MacMillan for coming along tonight.#The community council would like to thank all helpers as well as the British Legion and the band for the use of their tents.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

The roof over this extension will be a green roof.ldquoThe proposal seeks to restore this category A listed building, rehabilitating it as a contemporary three-bedroom dwelling.ldquoOverall, the proposed architectural moves retain the external appearance and the local identity of the buildings and their surroundings while reconstructing existing dilapidated outbuildings.ldquoThe alterations respect the character, materials and scale of the existing fabric and enable it to meet st century standards for contemporary family living by replacing all windows and doors and including new internal wall linings throughout the lodge and outbuildings where materials and internal finishes have been carefully considered and selected to enhance its historical features."},{"url":null,"title":"council-bit-environment","story":"BORDERS Council officials hope to join a new environment consultation.On September th, Scottish Government revealed it wants the public sector to spearhead efforts to combat carbon emissions in Scotland.We asked the Scottish Border Council what its plans for meeting government standards were and how they planned to go about achieving them.A spokesperson for the council told us: \"It is proposed that a first action for the Sustainable Development Group would be to review the recent decisions and actions of the UK and Scottish Governments and UK local authorities with a view to making recommendations as to how the council can play lsquoour partrsquo in tackling climate change.\"We will review the Scottish Governmentrsquos commitment to achieve net-zero emissions of all greenhouse gases by  at the latest, consider how to respond to this objective, and, specically, any Scottish Borders targets and actions to which the Council should commit to.\"We have already carried out a number of positive projects including: installation of electric vehicle charge points and development of our electric vehicle fleet, delivering local home energy efficiency programmes supporting home insulation and launch of the Affordable Warmth and Energy Efficiency Strategy and local habitat enhancement projects.\"In  multiple city councils announced climate emergencies and were followed by UK governments soon after.Roseanna Cunningham, Climate Change Secretary for Scottish Government said: ldquoSeveral public bodies, including the City of Edinburgh Council, have already made firm commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

site.ldquoWhile already one of the most modern plants of its kind in Europe, we are always looking for ways to improve reliability and efficiency through continued maintenance and investment in new

Last weekend, we were fortunate to be invited to an orchard in East Lothian to pick some apples.As we entered Lewis stopped for a moment and said ldquoWow.He has seen apples growing on trees before, but I think it was the sight of so many apple trees together all in fruit. It was a visual feast, even for me.And so we picked some apples, in the company of a friend who uses local fruits to make juices. Lewis just couldnrsquot decide which apple tree to pick from first. He wandered about in awe, eyeing the apples.There were many ieties in the orchard, but I sadly canrsquot remember all their names.ldquoI think Lewis is in paradise, I remarked as I watched him.ldquoWhatrsquos paradise  asked my nearly six-year-old inquisitive daughter Skye. I had to think about my answer.ldquoSome people say itrsquos a perfect place, but other people say itrsquos a perfect feeling.ldquoCan be both then, maybe at the same time Skye replied.I smiled and agreed. We both watched Lewis, as he wondered under the small trees, dancing with delight at the sight of so many delicious looking ripe apples.ldquoYea said Skye, ldquoLewis is definitely having paradykes.ldquoWe say in paradise I said, in a bit of a teachery tone.ldquoBut you can have it too insisted Skye ldquobecause itrsquos a happy feeling.How could I disagree  ldquoYoursquore right I smiled.ldquoThis one Lewis called out. The apple was just out of reach and so his sister ran up and carefully picked it for him, in the way she had been shown. Lewis studied the apple before eating, savouring the moment.He was indeed both in, and having, paradise.We collected a small basket full of apples of dferent ieties, and after giving our thanks we started our walk back to the car. As we meandered along the path Skye asked for a story about an apple.So I told the story of Johnny Appleseed. Then a riddle ldquoA wee roond hoose, sometimes red, sometimes green, the maist bent lum ye hae ersquoer seen. Nae windaes or doors tae open or slide, it has a secret, therersquos a star inside.The answer of course is an apple. The bent lumbeing the stalk, and the star being the seed core when the apple is cut horizontally through the middle.As we walked, I reflected on the symbolism of the apple, and how it has been used in folklore and legend. And of course there is the famous apple which fell on Newtonrsquos head.Well it probably didnrsquot really fall on his head, as that seems a later embellishment, but for sure Newton himself often told the tale of the falling apple and the inspiration it gave him. He lived well into old age, and I think he understood the power of a story to convey the meaning of an event or idea.We approached our car and I took my sonrsquos hand to keep him safe as we crossed the road.ldquoDad he said looking up at me, ldquoyou are my walking apple.I laughed at the image and wondered what he meant. Was he referring to my rotund body shape perhaps ldquoWhy am I your walking apple  I asked him.ldquoCause I love apples and you are walking with me he said, with a sense of poetic meaning only a young child can convey.I was momentarily overwhelmed by this simple but moving comment.

This occurs when cats come in contact with chemicals such as fuels, lubricants and some solvents.Usually, self-grooming causes the cat to ingest the toxin, or in some cases they inhale it which can cause a severe pneumonia.The toxin can cause problems throughout the body and on the skin too.When Jonny had examined Tikka, he immediately sent her to our Tranent surgery for blood tests and intravenous fluids as she was dehydrated.Fortunately, Tikkarsquos blood tests were normal so she did not have kidney damage.She tolerated her fluid therapy well and was soon looking much happier however several areas of her skin had become red and she was losing hair especially on her front legs.Tikka did not want to eat or drink. She was given analgesics, antibiotics and soothing cream was applied to her skin.Our nursing staff ensured she was as comfortable as possible and as she was not eating by herself, they fed her via a feeding tube several times a day.Her skin became red and thickened and some areas sloughed off.She had to have cream applied frequently to the damaged skin, just asshe had suffered burns.Tikka was finally well enough to go home where Mrs Taylor continued to treat her skin. Tikka started eating well again and is improving daily. Her fur is regrowing and soon she will have her beautul coat again.Now Mrs Taylor was very vigilant and realised she had to do something to help Tikka immediately.If you suspect your cat may have had contact with petroleum-based substances, please contact your vet as soon as possible.Often the first sign you may have is your pet smells of petrol or diesel.There may be vomiting or diarrhoea. They may actually be dizzy or confused or showing other neurological problems such as staggering and trembling. There may be respiratory signs such as coughing or wheezingthey have inhaled the chemical.Do not try to make your pet vomit as this can exacerbate the toxicity.The first thing you should do is try to remove the chemical from the fur.In many cases, it is best to bring your pet straight to your vets as soon as possible. The nursing staff at veterinary practices are well trained in dealing with intoxication emergencies.With petroleum products there are three main areas where the body can be affected: l The internal organs especially the kidneys, so your vet will want to blood sample your pet to check for any damage to the kidneys or other organsl The respiratory system can be affected especiallythe toxin is inhaled. This often happensthe patient vomits then inhales some resulting in a very severe pneumonia. Your vet may wish to take x-rays to check for this.l The animalrsquos skin can also be affected. The petroleum products sit on the fur then soaks through to the skin where they are held in contact by the fur. This causes them to act as a caustic substance, damaging the skin and hair follicles. Often the first sign before the skin damage is seen is hair loss due to the follicle damage.The treatment for these causes is supportive at all times. There are no specic antidotes. Intravenous fluids are administered, this helps overcome dehydration and helps eliminate toxins from the body.Analgesics are given to help keep pain from damaged skin and internal organs to a minimum.Antibiotics are given, as damaged skin is very prone to secondary infection and they are always givenpneumonia is present. Skin treatment has to be intense to keep infection to a minimum and encourage damaged skin to recover.Thankfully Tikka has made an excellent recovery, thanks to Mrs Taylorrsquos quick thinking and the intense nursing care given by the nursing team at Dunedin Vets."},{"url":null,"title":"tim-39-s-tales-magic-real-39-s-around-us","story":"Of course, in stories magic is very real a frog or beast can transform into a prince, dragons and witches can fly, animals can talk, wishes can be granted by faeries and spells cast by wizards.

Animals do talk, any dog lover will tell us that.Have you ever seen a hare and made eye contact and felt the connection or watched a squirrel hide nuts, and then come up to you asking for more Walk in a wood, or by a riverbank, or just sit in your garden or a park and the magic is all around you. We watched wood pigeons nest in a small elder tree outside our front window over the summer. Two eggs hatched and we watched as they were fed and finally flew the nest. It was, truly, magic.The magic all around us is still vast, and we could all make our own list the sound of birdsong, watching a butterfly flutter, a spiderrsquos web decorated with dew, the glimpse of a deer in a wood, the mist wrapped mountains, a red sparkling cloud during sunset, a wee beastie under a rock as it scampers for cover, the whisper of an ancient tree and the sweet smell of a wood.But I believe that sadly too many of us donrsquot notice real magic anymore.And when we donrsquot notice something we donrsquot feel connected to it, so we donrsquot care about it. And when we donrsquot care about it we donrsquot protect or value it.And when we donrsquot value it, we canrsquot feel the wonder and sense of awe it creates. And so we trash it, ignore and neglect it, exploit it. And we forget we are part of this magic that we are sons and daughters of nature too. And so we disconnect ourselves from what can truly make us feel happy, and instead drug ourselves with the articial magic of our own technology which makes us feel all powerful.But the truth is we are not.Ultimately we rely on the natural environment for our physical and emotional well-being, as much as the creatures we are making extinct.We need nature, it doesnrsquot need us, and eventually it is in control. Asto make this point huge waves hit the rocks of Prestonpans in a storm not so long ago, drenching the nearby houses in a display of naturersquos power.

It has already secured some Scottish Government funding to convert some of its snow-clearers in to dual-fuel hydrogen power. Its aim  N t just to make its own services green but to seed a market so commercial operators can change too. In the long run electric vehicles have lower running costs, experts believe. But they are more expensive to buy than their diesel equivalents. At least for now.Such initiatives will take municipal leadership. And municipal cash.The council has set up a working group to trash out how it gets to zero net carbon. Its recommendations are still under consideration. One is for climate bonds. That means the up-front costs of things like new vehicles could be spread out over years.In its report, the group said it ldquoheard of action by other cities to develop municipal climate bonds in order to fund low carbon developments.ldquoWe commend this model and think the city should explore its potential application to Glasgow.ldquoWe recommend that the cityrsquos partners work together to develop business cases for low carbon energy and transport investments through examination of alternative financing models, including the use of municipal climate bonds.The city councilrsquos buildings, vehicles and services only account for around % of CO emissions. So its efforts to reduce carbon output are often designed as a laboratory of good practice.This includes efforts to improve its own premises. Here too there are capital costs that can lead to revenue savings. And that might justy borrowing, not necessarily through climate bonds.The working group highlighted the prospect of replacing old fluorescent, metal halide and sodium lamps with energy efficient LEDs.Its report said: ldquoSuch an investment scores well for both carbon savings, at an average reduction of over  tonnes of Co per annum for each system installed, and financial payback typically in six years.ldquoThe council does not currently have a plan to replace existing lights with LEDs other than on a re-active basis as lamps fail.The group also enthuses over retrofitting ldquobuilding management systems across premises.Its report added: ldquoInvestment in modern building management systems helps the council achieve savings on energy usage.

Age also seems to be a factor, with many more young people demanding greater urgency. To properly tackle climate change, we need to seriously up our game. Scotland currently scores two out of , because electricity accounts for only about % of our energy and emissions.

To date most of this work has focused on oceanic islands like Hawaii or the Canaries.However, oceanic islands are only present at the surface of the Earth for a few million years before they themselves subside and are subducted back into the mantle. So it can only provide a tiny snapshot of crustal recycling over the four billion years of Earth history.The St Andrews team investigated a suite of alkaline magmas erupted in continental rts similar to the modern day East African rt.The Scottish scientists say that although these magmas have very unusual chemistries, they show many similarities with those oceanic lavas and, crucially, are found throughout Earthrsquos geological record.The team focused on an alkaline province in south-west Greenland using cutting-edge isotope techniques to chemically fingerprint ancient crustal material in the source of these magmas.Through a combination of remote field work ndash by boat and helicopter ndash and careful chemical analysis the team was able to show that these magmas were tapping into ancient crust subducted into the mantle  million years before the volcanoes started erupting.Once the team understood these processes in Greenland they compiled a global data on alkaline magma chemistry and were surprised to find that the vast majority contained a recycled crustal component in their magma source.Lead author Dr Will Hutchison, from the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University, said: ldquoOur key result is that the isotopes of alkaline magmas are highly iable and this suggests that their recycled crustal sources have changed through geological time.ldquoThe beauty of our global dataset is that it extends back over two billion years and so these unique alkaline rocks represent an extremely powerful record for understanding crustal recycling over Earth history.ldquoBy carefully bringing together the igneous and sedimentary isotope records, this might allow us to understand how changing crustal input is tied to volcanic output, and ultimately build a much better understanding of what happens to tectonic plates once they get transported into the deep Earth.It is not the first time that Greenland has been picked to try and uncover some of the Earthrsquos mysteries. Some scientists have previously believed Greenland may have been home to a mud volcano where le on Earth may actually began.Researchers discovered the chemical elements crucial to the formation of le in mud volcanoes at Isua in south-west Greenland.It was believed le began in underwater geysers, but research conducted eight years ago argued that these could not have sustained le, and that the volcanoes offered the oldest environment where le could begin.The ices of Greenland and Antarctica bear the fingerprints of a monster - a gigantic volcanic eruption in  or  AD that killed tens of thousands and helped trigger one of the worst periods of global cooling in the last , years.And in August, it emerged, that after years of searching, a team of scientists had finally tracked down the source of the eruption.The teamrsquos work laid out evidence that ties the natural disaster to Ilopango, a now-dormant volcano in El Salvador. Researchers estimated that in its sixth-century eruption, Ilopango expelled the equivalent of . cubic miles of dense rock, making it one of the biggest volcanic events on Earth in the last , years. The blast was more than a hundred times bigger than the  Mount St. Helens eruption."},{"url":null,"title":"marie-claire-39-s-easy-sneer-women-39-s-magazines---39-ll-miss","story":"Opening the glossy, handbag sized covers marked a transition from girlhood to womanhood. Prior to that, Irsquod been a regular reader of Mandy and Judy but now, now I was fully adult.From then, I never missed an issue.What lured me in, I think, was the unfettered aspiration of it all. As young women can be prone to, I was never satisfied with myself and here was, essentially, a manual of betterment.The women featured - the models, the celebrities - had perfect skin, swishy hair and fashionable clothing.If I could only add up all the money I spent on skincare having read the promises of epidermal glory, Id likely have enough to pay off my mortgage.Marie Claire came as an addition to Glamour. I liked its serious features, sitting side by side with fashion and beauty. I credit Marie Claire with introducing me to the hardships of women in developing countries, broadening my feminism and introducing me to international news.Thats right, a womans glossy. Who would have thought But womens magazines have long, long been a Trojan horse, sneaking controversial topics in among the lighter articles - whether thats through the agony aunt pages or simply a strong editorial decision.You wouldnt think it because its so easy to sneer at womens magazines - heavy on the advertising, heavier on the fluff. Melt your back fat, how to wear neon yellow eye shadow, buy these shoes at pound a pop. And its so easy to sneer at things aimed at women, to fail to take womens likes and choices seriously.Readers could learn about miscarriage and also about how to make shorts appropriate office wear, learn about hemlines and headlines.They helped to define mainstream feminism and, in the popularity contest of publicity, often went awry - Glamour, say, giving its annual Women of the Year Award tohellip Bono. A man, and not a very popular man at the best of times.The magazine was also an early adopter of the currents trans rights debate, sparky controversy when giving the newly transitioned Caitlyn Jenner the same award.Some of the most read political coverage has come from womens mags: from Teen Voguersquos op-ed on Donald Trump gas lighting America to Michael Howard being grilled on his views on abortion by Cosmopolitan magazine during the  election.When broadsheet newspapers treated ldquowomenrsquos issues as a separate, less worthy topic to be handled by one dedicated page and tabloid papers dealt with women exclusively as sex objects, womenrsquos magazines gave a voice and a place for the things that mattered to women.In an industry where female editors were a minority, magazines allowed women to reach the top. Female writers with serious clout have contributed to womens magazines: Joan Didion at Vogue Glamour had Susan Orlean and Gloria Steinem while Betty Friedan used a commission for Good Housekeeping to rip apart the medium.I cant pinpoint the moment that I stopped reading womens magazines. Partly I simply didnt have the time - there was no natural point in my day for me to pause with a magazine. Mostly I simply no longer needed the services of Glamour or Marie Claire.It slowly dawned on me over a long awakening that the pound skin cream wasnt making any discernible dferent to anything other than my bank account. I would never buy any of the clothes in any of the features because they were out of my price range.By now my current affairs came from newspapers instead.Its not the case that magazines failed to move with the times. They very much did, backing the trend towards body positivity rather than thinness at any cost introducing more politics and current affairs becoming more erse in the models they used.Magazines, though, are always aspirational, no matter how down to earth or wholesome they try to appear. Even when serious subjects were tackled in one section, there was also still the subtle message pervading the rest of the pages that you could and should be more beautul, more fashionable and buy more stuff.Buying a magazine became a bit of an event - something for a flight or a long train journey. Something to switch off with.And so it came to the point with Glamour I didnrsquot notice that, in , it had gone web-only. If there was anything I did need, I would Google it. You would think somebody working in an industry dependent on print sales would be more mindful of paying for a product, but no.I wasnt alone in giving up my monthly glossies. Marie Claire has recently too joined the ranks of the digital first, that publishing half le of having no print edition.The internet has everything the mags offered: online magazines cover feminism, beauty vloggers deal with lipstick and food websites cover cookery.What the web lacks is scrutiny. Magazines had teams of fact checkers. Editors had accountability - think of the backlash against skinny models that saw the glossies called to explain themselves to politicians.Theres no road back now for the web only publications but lets hope we dont regret what comes to fill their place."},{"url":null,"title":"margaret-taylor-pride-flag-proms-big-moment-inclusivity","story":"Lucky because that yearrsquos programme included Chocircros No.  by Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos performed by the BBC Symphony Orchestra and the combined choral forces of the BBC Singers and BBC Symphony Chorus. The sound they created was huge, uplting and utterly enveloping, and experiencing it was by far the highlight not just of that night but of any orchestral performance I had seen before or since. Even now, a decade later, I get goosebumps just thinking about it.The second half, though, I think my dad and I could both have taken or left. All that pomp and circumstance didnrsquot really sit too easy with us and I am pretty sure we were the only ones in the audience not to stand and holler during the highly theatrical rendition of the Thomas Arne staple, Rule, Britannia. It wasnrsquot just that lyrics about Britons flourishing ldquogreat and free at the expense of nations ldquonot so blest as thee grated, but that all the flag-waving and singing along felt more than a little bit daft. The whole thing just wasnrsquot very us.But thatrsquos the thing about The Proms: despite many of its concerts pushing musical boundaries despite a programme of free discussion events shedding light on the seeming impenetrability of classical music and despite the availability of thousands of pound promming tickets meaning those of slender means still have some hope of managing to attend, for too many people The Proms is the last night, the last night is the second half and the second half just isnrsquot for them. Given that itrsquos all so very British Empire, with all the negative connotations that that brings, can you blame them Only this year the final event of the eight-week extravaganza was a little bit dferent. Yes, there was the usual patriotic fare, with Henry Woodrsquos Fantasia on British Sea-Songs, Edward Elgarrsquos Land of Hope and Glory, Hubert Parryrsquos Jerusalem and ndash of course ndash Rule, Britannia all featuring. And, yes, there was plenty of union flaggery. But this year there was something  too: a self-styled ldquoqueer girl with a nose ring using an event that to some symbolises the pinnacle of cultural exclusivity to take a very public stand in the name of inclusivity.American mezzo-soprano Jamie Barton has seemingly never been one to conform, with her love of opera representing ldquoan act of musical rebellion against parents who raised her to the sounds of bluegrass, the Grateful Dead and The Beatles. Having come out as bisexual in , she used her appearance at this yearrsquos Proms finale to stage another act of rebellion, subverting the chauvinistic undertones and overtones of Rule, Britannia by performing it in the colours of the bisexual flag while waving the distinctive rainbow Pride flag high above her head.It was a gesture, she said, that was designed to ldquomake a very clear statement of pride, tweeting afterwards that ldquoit was an honour to wave a flag that stands for inclusivity, ersity, and above all, love.Her actions certainly had a positive effect for some, with the Proms audience in the Albert Hall breaking into spontaneous applause when Ms Barton held her flag aloft and the journalist James Ball, global editor at The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, tweeting that Ms Bartonrsquos actions represented ldquoa moment for inclusivity. A colleague of mine said witnessing that moment was ldquowonderful, adding that ldquoas a gay man, it brought tears to my eyes.Not everyone felt that way, though. Jordan Daly, co-founder of LGBT visibility charity Time for Inclusive Education, spoke for many when he tweeted thatMs Barton waving the Pride flag during Rule, Britannia was a moment it was ldquoa crass one. ldquoA rainbow flag during Rule Britannia \" he wrote. ldquoThere are LGBT people suffering the worst violence and discrimination across parts of the Commonwealth because of the cultural impact of the British Empirersquos exported homophobia and sodomy laws. Save this.I can certainly see his point. After all, wasnrsquot it the glorication of empire ndash of the ldquodread and envy Britons could instil in others ndash that kept my dad and me in our seats back in   And there is no doubt that colonial-era laws are still blighting the lives of LGBT people the world over, with India only last year overturning British-born legislation that banned consensual gay sex on the basis it was an ldquounnatural act, while it is estimated that close to  former British-administered countries continue to criminalise homosexuality. It is a shameful legacy of a shameful time in our collective history that not one of us can be proud of.Yet to dismiss the waving of a Pride flag during that particular song, in that particular segment of that particular event, would seem to miss the signicance of the moment entirely.In modern times at least the finale of The Last Night of the Proms has always been something of a camp affair. The Rule, Britannia my dad and I saw back in  was no exception, with mezzo-soprano Sarah Connolly, a singer famed for playing so-called breeches roles, strutting onto the Albert Hall stage dressed as Lord Nelson, saluting and scowling like the best of pantomime villains. Yet despite that it has never seemed a particularly inclusive affair ndash until now.Of course itrsquos right to question whether operatic pieces like Rule, Britannia, whose words most certainly leave plenty to be desired, have a place on modern concert programmes. And of course the idea of revelling in an age-old image of Britishness at this particular moment in history will be repugnant to many. But anything that shows that traditions like the Last Night of the Proms are not the preserve of traditionalists, that meanings can be changed and that membership \"rules\" can be relaxed, has got to be recognised for what it is ndash a moment. More than anything, though, Jamie Bartonrsquos moment was A Moment not in spite of its setting, but because of it. That is something we should all be able to take pride in."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-unionist-aim-now-redraw-indyref2-mandate","story":"Presumably,polls suggest support stands at or near that figure the barrier could be raised to  per cent, or  per cent of those registered to vote :Petition launched to require two-thirds majority for independenceMr Smith does not seem to understand that in UK democracy the tradition has been that success is one vote more than anyone . For instance, much to the great surprise of public opinion, David Cameron won a majority at the  election.

As Nick Clegg could remind him, campaign promises can come back to bite political parties. Sir Nick \"promised\" not to increase university tuition fees. He did. Better Together \"promised\" that voting No would secure Scotlandrsquos place in Europe. It didnrsquot. The SNPrsquos promise in its  Holyrood manesto was conditional: the Scottish Government should have the right to hold a democratic event \" there is a signicant and material change in the circumstanceshellip such as Scotland being taken out of the EU against our will\". Dragging Scotland out of the EU defies the  percent who voted to remain. No democrat should deny Holyrood the means of honouring such a clear vote.: A pro-independence majority at Holyrood is not a mandate for another referendumSimply setting aside the EU referendum result might be the LibDems latest style but Mr Rennie would do better to observe the Edinburgh Agreementrsquos aspirations for the referendum. Its terms sought a process that \"should deliver a fair test and a decisive expression of the views of people in Scotland and a result that everyone will respect\". The  loss of the referendum was followed by an unprecedented SNP landslide in  SNP majority of seats in  and  an overwhelming SNP majority in rsquos EU election. These indicators, plus opinion poll increases in support for both independence and a second ballot, suggest that the people of Scotland ndash to whom politicians are accountable ndash appear increasingly minded not to respect the result from . If the single expectation was that the result would command respect there was no indication that that respect would be mandatory. The \"settled will\" of . percent in Scotland who voted to reconvene the Scottish Parliament has been respected the No vote settled nothing.Before Mr Rennie boxes himself into a \"no deal\" position he should reflect on Scottish historical intellectual flexibility. Hugh MacDiarmid observed that the \"constant effort\" of Patrick Geddes was \"to help people to think for themselves, and to think round the whole circle, not in scraps and bits\". Scotlandrsquos independent future maps onto that \"whole circle\" of which collaborative, broad and cross-community consensus will form part. As MacDiarmid observed of Geddes \"he knew that watertight compartments are useful only to a sinking ship\".

The narrative is one of uneasiness, simmering anger, growing distrust, and a sense that, as things stand, wersquod probably be best going our own separate ways before it gets worse.That three-word hashtag is in essence the public expression of a signicant slice of popular opinion. A vocal group in one part of the union - England - is telling an entire other part of the union - Scotland - to sling its hook in no uncertain terms. England is sick of Scotland, and the Scots are no longer wanted.

UK-wide surveys show widespread support for a second independence referendum and a poll on a united Ireland. When Donrsquot Knows are removed,  per cent favour a second Scottish independence ballot, and  per cent support a vote on Irish unity.

Back then, the EU was certainly not on the side of independence. Scotland was told by Spanish premier Mariano Rajoy that the country ldquowould remain outside the European Unionit voted for independence.

All energy consumers pay for the cost of investment in new network capacity so the regulator ensures that it obtains the best deal possible for them.Ofgem launched a consultation in December last year on proposed changes to SSEN’s plan in an effort to ensure value for money for consumers.Following consideration of consultation responses and further analysis, the regulator has decided to approve the plan subject to the conditions set out in its decision.Approval is conditional on a total of at least MW of new wind farm projects on Orkney either being awarded a Contract for Dferenceor being judged likely to be developed by December .Ofgem would expect to be satisfied that new wind farm projects are likely to be developed despite not being awarded a CfDan independent audit states that the project is financially viable, has signed a relevant grid connection agreement and has been granted planning permission.However, SSEN has stated disappointment that the regulator is maintaining its position that the MW of new renewable electricity generation needs to secure planning permission and demonstrate financial viability prior to granting approval for the construction of the link.Ofgem has extended the date in which developers need to meet these conditions from December  to December . SSEN has said this means, in turn, that the construction of the transmission link may be delayed for at least a two-year period,the full time is required to secure the MW target, or shorterthe need is met at an earlier stage.SSEN’s Transmission and Distribution businesses now intend to consult with Orkney developers and other stakeholders to help establish the optimal #whole system# solution in an effort to make the most of Orkney’s renewable potential.Talking about Ofgem#s decision, Rob McDonald, managing director for transmission with SSEN, said: “Whilst we are clearly disappointed with today’s decision, our commitment to work with Orkney developers and other stakeholders to unlock Orkney’s vast renewable potential has not changed.“With both the UK and Scottish Government committed to net zero emissions, we firmly believe Orkney and Scotland’s other two major island groups will have a key role to play in the fight to prevent the worst effects of climate change.“We now look forward to working with developers and other stakeholders on Orkney to collectively explore the best way forward to unlock Orkney’s renewable potential.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We have seen consistent growth, and demand for Scottish products like machinery, food and drink continue to rise across the globe.However, the ongoing uncertainty of a looming no-deal Brexit poses a huge threat to jobs, businesses and our economy and I fear these impacts are becoming more pronounced.The publication last week of the UK Government’s assessment of the likely impact of and preparedness for a no-deal Brexit sets out the stark and grim reality of the dangers we are facing.Under no-deal, according to the UK Government, delays to freight would mean delays to goods in and out of the UK, causing issues for importers and exporters as well as manufacturers. Fresh food supply will decrease and financial services – one of Scotland’s largest industries – will be disrupted. There may be fuel disruption and impacts at Scotland’s only refinery at Grangemouth. All of which points to a major dislocation for our economy.That’s the base or worst-case no-deal situation – and it’s a situation which, at this point in the Brexit negotiations, puts our economy in jeopardy.It is hardly a surprise that, faced with these prospects, overseas orders are falling as companies in other countries aren’t willing to take the risk to buy products or invest in services that they don’t know they will receive.: Path open for independent Scotland to ‘walk into’ EU membershipFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereThe economic implications of leaving the EU with no-deal will be disastrous for Scotland and could push the country into recession. The Fraser of Allander Institute has said no-deal could equate to GDP in Scotland being £ billion lower and unemployment rising to nearly double the current rate. That level of contraction would more than wipe out the last two years’ growth in the economy and the gains in employment.But it’s not just no-deal, even an orderly Brexit will have an impact. The European single market and customs union is particularly vital to the Scottish economy and is eight times bigger than the UK market alone. More than half of all Scottish goods we exported in the last three months were sent to Europe and over the past year, goods exports to Europe have increased by . per cent to £. billion.And a Brexit that saw Northern Ireland able to benefit from continued alignment or membership with the single market or customs union while Scotland is dragged further away would put us at a real competitive disadvantage.: Boris Johnson ‘working flat out’ on Brexit deal as he meets Juncker: Brexit: Boris Johnson lied about his alleged lie to the Queen – Brian WilsonWe are already seeing the impact Brexit and the threat of no deal is having on business and consumer confidence in Scotland with an increase in stockpiling and reduced investment intentions.Consumer sentiment in Scotland has been negative since the EU referendum and we’ve seen it deteriorate further in the first half of the year.Last week our unemployment figures, whilst low, began to rise suggesting a slow-down in the labour market.Every day brings new warning bells.The UK Government cannot simply claim this isn’t happening, when every independent study highlights the risk Brexit poses and the damage being done. Temporary boosts in activity as people and businesses stockpile ahead of approaching deadlines are beneficial on the surface, but they speak to the dangerous situation we are in.Figures showing negative growth in the UK in the last quarter should not simply be discounted as a blip.Now I am an optimist and a believer that Scotland and Scotland’s business community are incredibly resilient. The recovery from the financial crash shows what can be done and the progress in industries such as renewable energy, food-and-drink and tourism shows that we can tap into new markets, that our expertise is valued, and our exports valuable.Through our work as a Government, we are taking steps to protect jobs and our economy from Brexit at the same time as we continue to work to make our economy fit for a low-carbon, high-innovation future.Our Future Skills Action Plan will help ensure Scotland has a skilled and productive workforce which is resilient to future economic challenges.We are continuing to increase investment in RD, our export plan seeks to ensure we are not just fighting back against the impact of Brexit but targeting key markets and key industries that have real growth potential.We will build on that in the next year with an action plan to boost inward investment and the early stage investments of the Scottish National Investment Bank.We aim to combat the potential fall in population as a result of Brexit, with campaigns to ensure EU citizens know Scotland is their home and they are welcome and efforts to secure an immigration policy that fits Scotland’s needs.And we are engaging with business organisations across Scotland and seeking to address their concerns to mitigate any drop in economic activity and to remove constraints to trade. This includes providing bespoke information for how businesses can prepare for Brexit and supporting access to finance, for businesses of all sizes.We will continue to do all of that and more, against the backdrop of this deeply damaging Brexit, but I must be honest that not every impact of Brexit can be mitigated.Of course, the easiest way to tackle this is to prevent Brexit and we will keep working to do that. The economic damage already being done shows why standing up to this UK Government is so important.Scotland did not vote to leave the EU and we continue to stand firm against efforts to take us out of the EU against our will.Derek Mackay is Finance Secretary and SNP MSP for Renfrewshire North and West©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"dark skies and economic progress are both important leader comment","story":"For centuries, light has been associated with economic and philosophical progress.And so it might seem a bit odd, in the home of the Scottish Englightenment, to be extolling the virtues of darkness.But modern science has demonstrated the importance of both light and dark to the human body clock as well as the rhythms of the natural world.

Now we know some of those people so we can get together again and join forces.#Pat McNicol who lives in Broadford said that after hearing about the local group #Broadford plastic free and beyond# she started to gather all the plastic from her weekly shop and was #horried# at the volume of plastic which was going to landfill.She said: #As iniduals, we can do something, and thenwe are a group of people acting collectively we can make changes.#Anne MacLennan from Lower Breakish commented: #I was in New Zealand for  years and was a climate activist there.I was heartened that the Government was doing the workshops # we need government action but they also need to know that there#s action from the bottom upwards.#Ardvasar resident Lysana Robinson said: #My father taught rural science and environmental studies, so I was the one in the greenhouse.#I have been an environmental activist for many years, I do moth trapping because it tells you more about the environment than looking at the flora because when things go wrong the population is decimated.#Trish Rogers from Broadford said: #I agree with Dorothy that climate change is the big one and I#ll do everything I can to get people involved.#Addressing what measures people could take to make a dference, she added: #There are things such as the circular economy, where people can recycle to avoid throwing things away.#She also went on to highlight the benefit of local and seasonal food, energy-efficient heating, and transport efficiency options like using public transport, car-sharing and cycling.Touching on the upcoming meeting, Ms Jackson said: #We will share some of the things that are already happening # there will be brief presentations. Then the idea is for people to go into local groups and talk about what they can do locally.#We will then have a picture of who is interested in doing what and come up with possibilities for people to link up and then we will try and work out where we can go from there.

But this week the #Peatbogs# will be back on home turf to showcase their energetic brand of traditional-inspired electronica as part of this year#s Skye Live Festival.The rare Skye gig will mark the start of another autumn tour for the six-piece group, for whom constant re-invention has proved key to longevity spanning almost three decades.The sound that#ll boom out in the tent high above Portree Harbour this Saturday will be far removed from the group#s roots as a folk band playing in local pubs. But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree. I would hope local people can support it in any way they can.#The Skye Live festival runs from Thursday th until Saturday th September.

Gareth Bronte on This MorningIt was to be the first time the family had met Gareth and his we Kirsty in the flesh.It made for an emotional segment on the show as presenters Phil Scholfield and Holly Willoughby introduced the story which was captioned ‘A Random ‘Slice’ Of Birthday Kindness’. Lea explained to Phil and Holly how she had been spurred on by Gareth’s kindness to carry on the good gesture: “I know it wasn’t absolutely the same circumstances, but I just thought I wanted to do a good gesture for somebody  so I paid off the same amount that he’d paid off our cake onto someone ’s. It carries on the story as well.”Gareth and his we Kirsty, who live between Loughbrickland and Rathfriland on the outskirts of Banbridge, were then introduced.Lea Ni Bhriain on This MorningTheir daughter Hannah Stella Bronte was born prematurely on September ,  weighing just two pounds, five and half ounces. Their baby girl lost her brave fight for le after eight days in ICU.Gareth told the show: “In the lead up to what would have been Hannah’s birthday my we and I wanted to do something to mark it. Our little boy Caleb, who is four, came up with the idea of letting a helium balloon go so that it would make its way up to heaven. That was something we had planned.“I’d said to Kirsty I wanted to do something dferent, maybe a little random act of kindness to share a little joy.

Bangladesh finally won its freedom from East Pakistan in  after a bloody, -month war of independence which left up to three million dead.Of late the developing country has been in the headlines for providing shelter to , Rohingya who have fled persecution in neighbouring Myanmar.“Coláiste Feirste was honoured to welcome the Bangladeshi delegation,” said Seán Mistéil. “Minister Chowdhuryexplained the importance of mother languages to nation building and economic well-being. That resonated powerfully with our students.”Minister Chowdhury toured the site of the Gaeltacht Quarter’s next development project: a triangle of disused land which represents one of the last building sites fronting the Falls Road.“We have bold plans to transform this triangle of land into a Gaeltacht housing and tourism project,” added the Coláiste Feirste Chairman. “This vibrant and visionary social development initiative will promote the collective economic capacity of the wider Spórtlann na hÉireann and Coláiste Feirste site. We believe that maximising this hub of interdependent and unique elements is best achieved through a one site vision that connects all of its parts. We have this coordinating vision in place and it has enterprise and exchange at its heart. It is infused with environmental and economic promise and includes a wealth of cultural, sporting and human potential.”The visit of the Bangladeshi delegation was hosted by London-based Study Circle and facilitated by the growing Bangladeshi population of Belfast."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"casements claim replay win over johnnies","story":"Northern Switchgear Antrim Senior Football Championship quarter-final replayPortglenone Casements -St John’s -From Paddy Tierney at Coláiste FeirsteTHE sequels are never as good as the originals and last night’s Antrim SFC replay failed to reach the heights of Sunday’s thriller in Ahoghill as St John’s crashed out of the Championship following a three-point defeat Portglenone at Coláiste Feirste. In truth, the margin of defeat flattered St John’s who, for the second game running, failed to fire.They got out of jail at the weekend when an injury-time Pearse Donnelly goal almost plundered an unlikely victory before Conal Delargy kicked the equaliser. The general consensus was that Casements had missed the boat and that the Johnnies would win the replay, but Portglenone boss Barry Dillon said he knew his players could better Sunday’s performance. “We sat back too deep on Sunday, it was our own fault,” said Dillon. “Maybe the fear of winning made them a bit apprehensive, but we knew we had more in us. “In the first half of the drawn game, we showed we are the better team and we had that belief coming into this game that we could go and finish it.” While Portglenone fielded an unchanged team from Sunday’s drawn game, St John’s started Domhnall Nugent, Brian ‘Bam’ Neeson and Sunday’s goal-scorer Donnelly. Yet, as was the case on Sunday, it was Casements who made the brighter start with a hat-trick of frees from Conal Delargy and Ronan Kellyhelping them establish a - to no score lead after a cagey opening  minutes. It took the Johnnies  minutes to open their account following a well-worked move finished by Matthew Fitzpatrick, but Paddy Kelly responded in kind for Portglenone minutes later. Peter McCallin got his side’s second score on  minutes with St John’s struggling to break down a well-organised Portglenone defence. The Whiterock Road men then lost Donnelly to a black card and Delargy converted another free to move his side - to - ahead. When Kieron McKenna added another from play, Portglenone looked in a strong position approaching half-time and a Paddy McBride free with the last kick of the half was badly needed by the under-par West Belfast outfit. The second half was just four minutes old when Portglenone cut a dash through the heart of the St John’s defence to score a brilliant goal with full-forward Michael Donnelly firing past Padraig Nugent. Less than a minute later, St John’s hit back with a goal of their own. Having been off-target with a few efforts from frees,Neeson’s fortunes changed when an attempt at a point dipped under the crossbar and beyond the reach of Portglenone goalkeeper Ryan O’Neill. That should have been the catalyst for St John’s to kick on, but instead it was Portglenone who regained control of proceedings as another Delargy score moved them four clear once more. St John’s continued to squander chances at the other end with Neesonand Fitzpatrick firing wide of the posts. McBride converted a free before Dermot McAleese broke forward to score for Casements. Ryan McNulty landed a stunning point from play with  minutes of normal time remaining, yet their hopes of another rousing comeback were dented when they lost centre-forward Conal Kelly to a second booking. McBride briefly reduced the gap to two points while Nugent was forced to make a great save to deny Niall McKeever at the other end. Michael Kelly scored an excellent point moments after his introduction for Portglenone and a Ronan Kelly free gave them a four-point cushion approaching full-time. Rather than sit back and defend their lead as they did last Sunday, Dillon’s men went for the jugular and further points from McKeever and midfielder Fergal O’Kane put them six clear. There was one last surge from St John’s with Michael Bradley’s sideline being fisted into the net by Fitzpatrick deep into stoppage time and the Antrim star had a second goal-bound shot blocked with the final play of the game. Yet Portglenone were the better team over the two games and they progress to a semi-final meeting with Lámh Dhearg on Saturday, September  at Creggan.

For Martin Moreland, Principal of Mercy College, it was very dferent indeed.Born on the Ormeau Road in South Belfast, Martin was the youngest of six children. Having left school with no exams, Martin’s road to the classroom and education sector began as an engineer.“I never really thought I would be a teacher because I never had the confidence to be one,” he explained.“It was a dream in a sense but I never really thought it would be a reality.“I left secondary school with no exams. I went out into the world of work – it gives you a lot of le experiences or the real world as I call it.“I went into engineering and had several jobs. My we has a job in education and she told me about a course up in Derry that gave you access into university. I went and got a GCSE in English and Maths and spent three years up in Derry doing the course.Martin was accepted into St Mary’s University College and after his first teaching job in West Belfast, has moved to the North of the city.“With my engineering background, my first job was a Technology and Design teacher in St Colm’s in Twinbrook and I spent  years there. I loved it there, it was a great community and a school that was thriving.“I moved on to Mercy where there was just  kids. I started off as a teacher before becoming Principal and I’ve been in the role for ten years.”Martin then reflected on the many changes in education over the years, not least the challenges and successes of Mercy College.“When I came in, it was about building up confidence and profile of the school, given our location in North Belfast.“Pupil numbers now are  but our challenges now is very much to do with space and classrooms.“We have been co-educational for a few years now which is fantastic. We have a   ratio girls and boys in Year . Our LLS programme is still really successful and we were the first school to start that.“The standards are amazing – % of girls are getting three A-Levels from A* to C which is very unique. % of our GCSE students got five GCSE’s at the top grades and there are not many other schools in the North that can boast such results.“Finances remain a huge challenge for us. There is no room for any extra money in the system. It is not easy at all.”Away from school, Martin is kept a busy man being a father of ten children.“I am a family man. I am a father-of-ten so at home it is a very busy household, with the kids ranging from  to .“I am very much an outdoor person. I like nature and sunshine. I am also big into running and gardening. With my technology background, I like a project such as a pond or a patio to keep me entertained.”As for the future, Martin is content at Mercy College but would love no more than see a new building for the school in his working le.“I am  now and I suppose you start to think about how many more years I can give in education.“I probably have another ten years in me. I am happy at Mercy College – there are so many challenges every year.“I really want to see our newbuild come for the school which is in the pipeline – just need Stormont up and running to approve it.“The future of the school is very bright. There is a lot of work still to be done to maintain our standards and results and improve facilities for the kids.“"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"meabh set to sing the anthem at croke park","story":"AN Under- Lámh Dhearg footballer will perform Amhrán na bhFiann in front of thousands of GAA fans on Sunday ahead of the Dublin -Galway All-Ireland Senior Ladies Football Final. -year-old Méabh McNeill told Daily Belfast that she is “super excited” to be singing in front of up , fans at Croke Park ahead of the finale to the ladies football season. “When I was seven myself and my brother went to Scéim Samhraidh at our club, Lámh Dhearg,” she said. “One of the events was learning and singing the national anthem.

I’ve been singing every year since.”Méabh spoke of how the club’s Cultural Officer, Ronan McHugh “asked me to come back last year to teach the kids how to sing the anthem”. “That is the thing about our club, the kids that attend the summer schemes, and there are now three running, end up coaching younger kids coming through which is fantastic,especially the U- girls.”“I then started singing the national anthem at club events such as juvenile and senior dinners. “Antrim Cultural Officer Bronagh Lennon asked my dadI could sing at some championship games and then onto County Antrim league games.

She and her husband Joe have grown apart, both wounded by their marriage. Shirley is there to peel the spuds, put dinner on the table and tend to the grown-up children, Millandra and Brian, asthey are still toddlers. Shirley talks to the wall as there is no-one  to talk to.Her friend Jane has bought her a ticket for two weeks in Greece and the first act is the will she won’t she build-up to getting there.Shirley tells us how she wanted to be a “courier or air hostess” but was discouraged by less-than-patient teachers at school – “Only the clever ones get to do that.”Shirley Valentine has “disappeared,” we are told, worn down by routine and repetition and now “frightened of le beyond the walls.”By the time the interval came the audience was rooting for Shirley as she gets ready for her two weeks in Corfu.In Act Two, gone is the mousy dress, apron and sensible shoes of the first half and in its place is a striking Shirley: colourful bathing suit, tanned skin, feet encased in bright pink shoes. We learn that Shirley’s friend Jane abandoned her for four days ”to shack up with a man she met on the plane. “I was alone but it was lovely” – Shirley took her table down to the beach most nights to watch the sunset and sip her wine.Shirley Valentine is a timeless story – a woman stuck within four walls who needs to break out and break free. Tara Lynne triumphantly portrays a woman who was a prisoner in her own kitchen but learns that there is “le beyond the walls” and drags us along with her, cheering in her wake.As the lights dim, she’s on the beach and waiting for Joe – who she believes probably won’t recognise her – to come and talk at the crossroads they have found themselves at.In a poignant touch, there was a standing ovation for actor and “hugely talented” assistant director of the production Julie Maxwellwho tragically passed away last month.Shirley Valentine runs at the Lyric Theatre until October .

Adams and Martin McGuinness were both on the republican team whose chief demand was for a British commitment to withdraw from Northern Ireland.The talks collapsed and shortly afterwards sectarian tensions in Belfast boiled over as Catholics fled their homes but were stopped from occupying vacated Protestant houses in the west of Belfast.“That was the end of the ceasefire,” says former IRA man Tommy Gorman.The Provisionals resumed their offensive and on Bloody Friday nine people were killed and  injured as the IRA unleashed  bombs across Belfast.Brendan DuddyLord Ramsbotham, who was aide to the Army’s most senior officer here, told the Spotlight documentary that Bloody Friday provided an “admirable excuse” for the start of Operation Motorman to get rid of the no-go areas.Some , soldiers were deployed in what was the biggest military operation of the Troubles.The Army met little or no resistance and MacIntyre says that was because of the late Derry businessman Brendan Duddy, who had contacts within the IRA and the RUC.Duddy was at the centre of a secret agreement to reduce the possibility of bloodshed by removing more than  Provisional weapons from the city.Duddy — who died in May  — was to become a vital conduit between the British and the IRA in their discussions for the rest of the Troubles."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/7857c/BINARY/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest updates","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

For example, can lessons be learned from other towns which experienced similar problems or what about changing the sequencing of traffic lights in the town centre  he asked.ldquoIt has been said many times that there is no quick fix solution to Downpatrickrsquos congestion problem and while the layout of the town may pose problems for engineers, surely it is time for some innovative thinking Cllr Curran said he believes that all the key players need to get together, suggesting years of inaction has exacerbated the congestion nightmare faced by residents, businesses and visitors to the town.He added: ldquoIt is time to forensically examine the problem and come up with ideas on the way forward.

It was also an effective way to promote the work that we do and raise awareness among the regular customers to Asda. ldquoThe foodbank has noticed an increase in donations to our permanent collection point in the store since the campaign ands partnerships like this make our work so much more effective.Downpatrick store manager, Roger Croskery, said Asda has always always been proud to support the communities it serves.ldquoOur community champions work tirelessly to support charities, projects and initiatives that make a real dference to the people living around their Asda shop, he said.ldquoBut we want to do even more to help local communities across the UK to save money so they can live better. Wersquoll do this is by doing our part to tackle the growing issue of poverty in the UK and our Fight Hunger campaign is part of this work.Roger and Linda, along withy other staff members from the Downpatrick store, recently visited the Fountain Foodbank to see the impact the donations have made, to meet volunteers and find out more about how the foodbank works.The foodbank provides emergency food parcels to those who find themselves in dficult circumstances and has distributed over three thousand food parcels in the local area since opening in March .It also receives weekly donations of fresh food from Asda as part of an ongoing scheme with FareShare which has  yearsrsquo experience working with the food industry to safely ert edible surplus through a UK-wide network of frontline charities fighting food poverty.FareShare works with businesses and charities to get food to good causes in a way thatrsquos cost effective and makes sense for the business and the charities, with the Fountain Foodbank registered to receive some of this food.The volunteers say this particular initiative is an effective way to cut down on waste and help those who find themselves in dficult circumstances.Asda says that by the end of the Fight Hunger campaign, it aims to provide an additional  million meals every year by investing in the charitiesrsquo infrastructure and services so they can collect, store and transport more food.In addition, the store aims to provide , vulnerable people access to fresh food every year and make fresh food the norm in food banks and not the exception.Asda also wants to tackle the root causes of poverty, helping one million people with the food and support they need to help them out of the situation they are in and expand the companyrsquos existing food donation activities so every one of its stores has the ability to donate edible surplus food to local food banks and community groups..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th September 2019 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C September 4%2C 1979  ","story":"WARRENPOINT mdash A plea by Official Unionists to adjourn this weekrsquos meeting of Down Council because of the murders at Warrenpoint and Mullaghmore was rejected the SDLP and Alliance members.The motion to adjourn was defeated by ten votes to six and immediately the Unionists walked out mdash not in protest but as a gesture of sympathy to those bereaved by the murders.The motion was introduced by Saintfield councillor, Mr William Finlay, who said he looked back with horror at the murders, the victims including  soldiers at Warrenpoint, Lord Mountbatten, his grandson, Nicholas , the Dowager Lady Brabourne, and a  year-old boy, Paul Maxwell.Acting chairman, Mr Paddy OrsquoDonoghuesaid he would be impartial in the matter and was quite sure they all shared the revulsion, horror and disgust and would like to show their sympathy with those were bereaved ldquoin such a dreadful way.He pointed out that there had been two committee meetings of the council since the murders occurred, but since Mr Finlayrsquos motion was a procedural matter councillors must decide without any debate whether or not they wanted to adjourn the meeting.He added: ldquoHowever, whether or not the council decides to adjourn should not be interpreted as to whether or not councillors approve of the vile deeds which have been perpetrated.After the vote, in which the SDLP and Alliance members voted against the Unionists, Mr Finlay said he was sorry about the decision which the majority had made.NEWCASTLE mdash The fireworks display organised as the climax of the Newcastle summer season did not go down with a bang, but instead fizzled out.Torrential rain minutes before the fireworks bonanza was due to begin washed the show out and it now seems likely that the display will be held at Halloween at Downpatrick racecourse instead.Drumgath Accordion Band and Ballykeel Pipe Band were about to march into the arena to put on a marching exhibition when the rain came down.More than pound had been spent on the fireworks, but the rockets, roman candles, catherine wheels, shells, mortars and numerous other favourites were saved from the rain. Disappointed spectators had their money refunded.The fireworks bonanza, sponsored by Down District Council, was to have marked the end of the Percy French Festival.However, the stage will now switch to Downpatrick in October where a successful display was staged last year.ARDGLASS mdash Suki, the cat escaped a horrible death at Ardglass harbour recently, has found a new home in Lisburn.The story about how Suki survived an attempt to have her drowned aroused so much interest that the person who found her, Mrs Joan Owens, was inundated with phone calls to give the cat a home.Mrs Owens, of Ardgtreenan Crescent, Belfast, accepted the first of more than  calls and the cat left for its new home in Dundrod Walk, Lisburn, earlier this week.ldquoSomeone had tried to get rid of the cat, Mrs Owens explained. ldquoSuki was tied in a paper bag and thrown off the side of the harbour, but instead of hitting the waves she landed in our cabin cruiser, which was anchored.ldquoWhen we were taking our boat out of the water for repairs to the hull we came across a torn bag on the deck. Then we heard noises from a cabin mdash and found Suki mothering three new kittens.ldquoUnfortunately, we had to have the three kittens put down and Suki neutered.

The proposed new school will also be in the trusteeship of the De La Salle Congregation.St Patrickrsquos Grammar has maintained its opposition to the merger proposal since it was muted in , while both De La Salle and St Maryrsquos support the merger.Mr Joe McCann, St Patrickrsquos Grammar principal, said he is ldquodisappointed that an apparent EA source had broken the news of the merger plan locally before his and the other schools were formally notied.St Patrickrsquos parent body mdash The Parents and Friends Associationmdash said that it will ldquovehemently fight these proposals with every means necessary, through the courts and, unfortunately, in the media.PFA spokesperson, Cormac Artt, criticised the EA on how the news was leaked ahead of the schools being notied last Thursday and the argument that local children will be educated together and the likelihood of capital funding for a single-site school build.Mr Artt continued: ldquoThis proposal cites an enrolment of  pupils and alleges that this yearly intake will be made up of up to % who will be admitted by academic selection.ldquoHowever, the census figures suggest thatall those who live within a three-mile radius and those for whom the school is the nearest Catholic grammar are admitted automatically without sitting the GL entrance assessment, there will be very few,any, places for those applicants seeking admission via academic selection.Mr Artt suggested that the outworking of this means that the rural communities and primary schools who have been an integral part of the grammar schoolrsquos -year history, will no longer have a place in this proposed super school, including those in Teconnaught, Loughinisland, Strangford, Kilclief, Dundrum, the Ards peninsula, Castlewellan and Newcastle.ldquoThe choice for boys in these areas who wish an academically selective education will therefore be travel to Newry or Belfast to try to secure a selective grammar school place in Catholic schools that are already heavily oversubscribed, he said.ldquoThe alternative for those who wish to keep the tradition and connection with Downpatrick will be to attend the state academically selective, Down High School. Aside from the injustice of this on the rural communities, is the impact this will have on families.While the EA said that the proposals have ldquoalready been subject to formal stakeholder consultation with parents, staff, governors and pupils, Mr Artt disputed that.ldquoParents of students from St Patrickrsquos Grammar requested a meeting with the De La Salle Trustees in April to discuss the Trusteesrsquo vision going forward. They finally responded in June by refusing to meet the parents citing rsquoit is not clear what,anything, will be gained by a meeting,rsquo which clearly makes the parents think that they do not care about the pupils of the school where they are Trustees.ldquoThe Board of Governors, staff and parents are overwhelmingly opposed to this proposal and for the De La Salle Trustees, who are the only stakeholder supporting this vision, to refuse to speak to the current parents is a disgrace.De La Salle principal, Ciaran Maguire, said he was ldquodelighted to see the proposal going to full public consultation.He told the Recorder: ldquoItrsquos been a long time coming. I am reassured now that the families of the greater Downpatrick area will have an opportunity to finally get behind the vision to secure the town as a model of good practice, where childrenrsquos education is a priority.ldquoThe De La Salle Congregation have been working on bringing post primary education in Downpatrick into the st century. In , they first proposed that St Patrickrsquos Grammar should become a co-educational school.ldquoThe Department of Education at the time wanted to see a proposal that was reflective and inclusive of all schools in the Downpatrick area. That advice was taken by the De La Salle congregation and they have been working, in partnership, on a solution to ensure that all children in the greater Downpatrick area have an education system that they can be proud of.Mr Maguire said the origin of the transfer test ldquowas a solution to a problem back then, suggesting the problem is dferent now and a new solution is needed.He added: ldquoWhat we need now for our children is something radical and exciting for all those involved. If we are the child-centred schools we say we are, then this is undeniably the right thing to do, not just for my pupils, but for the St Maryrsquos girls and St Patrickrsquos boys.Mr Maguire contended that while some may see the proposal as ldquoas an attempt to wipe out a schoolrsquos history and tradition, itrsquos an opportunity for them to continue their great work in preparing our children for le.He said that it will cater for all children from the local feeder schools, without the fear of having to sit and possibly fail a test.Mr Maguire added: ldquoWe are removing barriers those same barriers that our children currently struggle with, the fear and anxiety of not fitting in, not being good enough. I urge all parents to get behind this proposal, your opinion matters and should count.Welcoming the proposed merger, St Maryrsquos High School principal, Ms Rosemary McLaughlin, said ldquoit has the ability to deliver.She added: ldquoWe are very proud of our school as a centre of excellence and we look forward to this new opportunity of proposed change to serve all young people..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th September 2019 Migle.jpg","title":"Migle thanks foster parents for help in education success  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH woman has thanked her foster carers for the key role they played in her educational success.Miglehas revealed how growing up in foster care helped shape her future career as the Regional Adoption and Fostering Service launches a new campaign encouraging more people to become foster carers across the Provincersquos health trusts.Migle was fostered by South Eastern Trust foster carers Michael and Martha eight years ago and is currently studying Computer Science at Queenrsquos University Belfast.She moved in her with foster parents when she was  and admits she would not be where she is today without their support.ldquoBefore I went to live with Michael and Martha I never even thought about going to university, said Migle who moved to Northern Ireland in  from Lithuania.ldquoThey were able to help me choose what I wanted to do with my le.

Over the past three years Irish Lights has proactively engaged with the local community and relevant state agencies to establish the best approach to the site. he continued.ldquoWe have now developed and tested new technology to achieve a sustainable solution that will enable retention of the historic lens and sweeping beam at St. Johnrsquos Point. I look forward to meeting with the community to discuss these plans in more detail.The Lecale Lightkeepers say that while they accept there is some concession on CILrsquos part in proposing to keep the sweeping beam at the lighthouse, they have been informed by the Commissioner that the range of the beam will be reduced by up to nine miles. They also claim that the beamrsquos iconic ldquoloom will be lost, robbing the lighthouse of what they describe as its ldquointangible heritage.A spokesperson for campaigners said that through their freedom of information requests for communication between CIL and others, they have found a ldquolack of appreciation for the intangible heritage of lighthouses and a disregard of the views of coastal communities.ldquoWe have seen examples of modernised lights and none have retained their original characteristics. The new light source proposed for St Johnrsquos Point would be an LED which, in itself is suspect, as according to the Royal Society Publication April , LEDs have detrimental effects on Epaunal Marine Communities.Campaigners say Newry Mourne and Down Council has already voted unanimously to protect the sweeping beamrsquos current mechanism and trustsrsquos that CIL will not be given planning permission to proceed with its proposal.ldquoThe lighthouse is a listed building and its character, the light, must be protected, declared the campaignersrsquo spokesperson.ldquoWith the loss of the historic lights at Fastnet, Mew and Tory it is even more vital that St Johnrsquos Point should be kept for heritage purposes. Moreover, it is a beautul feature of our nocturnal landscape, much loved by the local communities.Turning to concerns about the mercury in the current lighthouse mechanism, the spokesperson said mercury vapour is a known toxic substance, arguing that vaporisation only occurs in certain circumstances, notably in very warm conditions where there is poor ventilation.ldquoThe St Johnrsquos Point lighthouse is fully automated and the lantern room is well ventilated.ldquoAccording to the late attendant Henry Henvey, the mercury had not needed any attention in at least  years nor were there ever any concerns about its safety.Next Wednesday eveningrsquos meeting in Ardglass starts at pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th September 2019 Red.jpg","title":"Red High 25 group in fundraising drive  ","story":"NEARLY  years on, the loss of Ballynahinch teenager Mark Quinn is still keenly felt today mdash by his grieving family, schoolmates and his fellow soccer players.The  year-old took his own le on December , , with his funeral service one of the biggest his home town has ever seen.Earlier this year, Markrsquos former classmates at St Patrickrsquos Grammar School in Downpatrick joined together to fundraise in support of community mental health initiatives in his memory coming up to his anniversary.The former students, now grown men, many with sons of their own, all found that Markrsquos death hit them in dferent ways then and throughout the following years.The group, known as Red High , decided that they wanted to raise money to help support other young men who may feel in despair.Markrsquos family is fully behind the initiative and other planned events which will go to support Ballynahinch Counselling Services and The Edge Youth and Community Centre.The gesture comes with the knowledge that Ballynahinch has one of the highest suicide rates in the district.World Suicide Prevention Day was marked yesterday and Department of Health officials announced plans to reduce suicide rates in Northern Ireland by % over the next five years.Speaking of behalf of her parents, Peg, and the late Hugh Quinn, and siblings Lynda, Michael, John, Patrick, Jarlath, David and Jemma, Markrsquos sister Katie Cassidy said they were ldquooverwhelmed to have been contacted during the summer holidays by Markrsquos school friends from the Red High.Katie said: ldquoTheir effort to keep Markrsquos memory alive while also raising awareness about mental health issues is more relevant now than ever.

Talking can make all the dference, we wish we knew then what we know now.ldquoThe pain and devastating reality of living without your son, brother, nephew or uncle truly causes physical pain. But there is also help in dealing with the loss of someone to suicide. In the early days after Markrsquos death when our faith was extremely tested, we received tremendous support from our parish community.Katie also asked for support for the upcoming football tournament at St Patrickrsquos Grammar next Saturday, September  and for Ballynahinch Olympicrsquos annual fundraising effort.She said: ldquoWe hope everyone will come along to the Red High next weekend to enjoy the football tournament.

He said: ldquoSo far the lads have raised over pound, with great support from past pupils, ex-teachers and of course Quinnyrsquos family.ldquoThese are dferent times now compared to . Mental health awareness is something that people are much more open about these days.

Their free dog welfare workshops, delivered as part of the Charity’s ‘Be Dog Smart’ campaign, enhance the National Curriculum and seek to provide children between the ages of seven and  years with the knowledge and understanding they need to act responsibly and safely around dogs in their homes and those they may see out and about.Each workshop benefits pupils by involving a pretend dog as its focus, with the aim of developing compassion and consideration for all living beings.Not only do children - whether dog owners or not - learn how to behave safely around dogs, they also learn all about the commitment involved in owning a dog through a creative and interactive learning experience..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Last year, Cathy Clyde, Dogs Trust’s NI Education and Community Officer delivered workshops to , children. This year they are on track to improve on this number yet again. With the growing success of the ‘Be Dog Smart’ campaign, Dogs Trust now employs  education and community officers across the UK to provide workshops in their designated regions.Cathy said: “Through debate and discussion, our responsible dog ownership workshops encourage learners to embody important values around dog ownership such choosing the right breed or type of dog for your le style, as well as understanding that dogs are a lelong commitment and not a disposable commodity. I would welcome the opportunity to work with schools in the area and encourage them to get in touch, as pupils really do get a lot out of the workshops as do their dogs.”For more information about ‘Be

It carries on the story as well.”Gareth and his we Kirsty, who live between Loughbrickland and Rathfriland on the outskirts of Banbridge, were then introduced.Lea Ni Bhriain on This MorningTheir daughter Hannah Stella Bronte was born prematurely on September ,  weighing just two pounds, five and half ounces.

And you can’t be chairman of the army council unless you’re a member of the army council — and I sat opposite him...and I’m saying that now, having sat opposite him in the meetings.

At present abortion in NI is only lawful where a woman’s health is seriously at risk.David Smyth of the Evangelical Alliancesaid official figures from England and Wales last year show % of abortions involved “physically healthy women aborting physically healthy babies”. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Similarly, he claimed, there will be no explicit safeguards in NI to prevent abortions ongrounds of disability or unwanted gender and that most will happen “because a human child is unwanted”. Yet the commission is raising no concern, he said, because “it does not believe that the unborn child is entitled to any protection before birth under human rights law”.But Les Allamby, chief commissioner of the NI Human Rights Commission, responded that the analysis and criticism “was neither accurate nor fair”.The only change, he said,will be that it is “no longer possible to take criminal prosecutions against, for example, women and clinicians”.Other regulations will remain in place, he said, including clinicians’ professional duties, “other criminal offences” and Department of Health guidance.He noted that the UK Supreme Court found that NI abortion law is contrary to a woman’s right to personal and bodily autonomy. Under common law, he said, it found that “the foetus or unborn child, while having some statutory protection, has no free-standing human right, rather such rights are inextricably linked to the rights of the woman”.From March , he said, NI law will meet the recommendations of an inquiry into NI abortion law by the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. “This concluded that current NI law has led to systematic violations of human rights against women who are compelled to travel to undergo legal abortions, self-administer pills or carry a pregnancy to full term.”NUJ condemns MP’s attack on News Letter journalist Sam McBrideBack channel used by MI told the IRA to bomb economic targets Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The UN inquiry recommended access to abortion, he said, where there is a serious threat to a woman’s health, in cases of rape and incest and for “severe foetal impairment”. He added: “The picture painted by the Evangelical Alliance ranges far beyond what the recent legislation in Westminster requires.”Mr Smyth responded: “The commission has still failed to answer the key question – whether it advocates any human rights protection for a child before it is born.” • Monday’s News Letter reported Mr Smyth as saying that NI’s new abortion legislation would leave Down’s syndrome pregnancies without any legal protection here – unlike in England and Wales. Mr Smyth has pointed out, however, that legal protections for Down’s syndrome pregnancies in England and Wales are minimal, that % are terminated and that he expects a similar rate to occur in NI

We canrsquot afford to push action further down the road all the time or expect others to be the ones to sort out this mess.ldquoWe want to see the Wales Pension Partnership, the Welsh Assembly, the Welsh Government and all other public body pension funds ditch fossil fuel investments and we will be keeping the pressure up until they do the right thing, both for the planet and for future generations here in Wales and around the world.Previous research by Friends of the Earth found that the eight local authority pension funds in Wales invested over poundbn between them in fossil fuel companies.Last year Monmouthshire Council was the first in Wales to vote to est its pension fund from fossil fuel companies. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In August Sepa ied the operating permits forExxonMobil Chemical Limited and Shell UK Limited, which shares the site, requiring them both to address the impacts of flaring andinstall noise-reducing flare tips.Energy Minister Paul Wheelhouse said: ldquoGiven community concerns, the Scottish Government has been clear that the frequency of unplanned flaring at the site is unacceptable and that the operators must take steps to address this, so this announcement of action being taken is therefore to be welcomed.ldquoThis signicant capital investment over the next two years to improve the reliability and sustainability of the site is positive news and will help to address key issues identied by Sepa such as flaring and noise pollution.ldquoHowever, we know the local community will want to see this translated into lower frequency and impact of flaring too and I understand that isan objective of the investment also.ldquoIt is also welcome that investment of this scale secures high-value employment that will be crucial in the transition to a net-zero economy in a way that is fair for all and we are keen to discuss with ExxonMobil the plantrsquos role in the transition itself.ldquoThe oil and gas sector can and will play a positive role in the low carbon transition, helping to channel its resources and innovative supply chain to lower its own emissions, as this investment will do, and to help design the erse energy system we need for the future.Scottish Green MSP Mark Ruskell said: ldquoIt is good to see the operator finally take steps to reduce flaring at this plant, and I know the many residents who have had to suffer light, noise and air pollution will be impatient for a better quality of le.ldquoHowever, many of my concerns remain.ldquoI can see nothing in these plans about investment into carbon capture and storage to ensure the plant meets the  carbon-neutral target, a technology seen as the solution by the First Minister.ldquoThe  jobs being promised are temporary ones, which is no way to secure the future of a community.Ian Buchanan, chief compliance officer at Sepa, said: ldquoSepa has been clear that repeated unplanned flaring by ExxonMobil was both unacceptable and preventable and that in future flaring will be the exception rather than routine.ldquoHaving served a series of notices and operating permit iations to drive investment, including in noise-reducing flare tips by , we welcome todayrsquos broad announcement from ExxonMobil.ldquoWe look forward to working with ExxonMobil on detailed proposals to both address the root causes of flaring and also on the requirement we have set around the shortest period possible to plan, design, build and safely integrate new ground flare technology which will signicantly reduce impacts of flaring on local communities..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: ExxonMobil unveils  xAm plan to reduce flaring at ethylene plant article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--Promoted Stories       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Their free dog welfare workshops, delivered as part of the Charity’s ‘Be Dog Smart’ campaign, enhance the National Curriculum and seek to provide children between the ages of seven and  years with the knowledge and understanding they need to act responsibly and safely around dogs in their homes and those they may see out and about.Each workshop benefits pupils by involving a pretend dog as its focus, with the aim of developing compassion and consideration for all living beings.Not only do children - whether dog owners or not - learn how to behave safely around dogs, they also learn all about the commitment involved in owning a dog through a creative and interactive learning experience.Last year, Cathy Clyde, Dogs Trust’s NI Education and Community Officer delivered workshops to , children. This year they are on track to improve on this number yet again. With the growing success of the ‘Be Dog Smart’ campaign, Dogs Trust now employs  education and community officers across the UK to provide workshops in their designated regions.Cathy said: “Through debate and discussion, our responsible dog ownership workshops encourage learners to embody important values around dog ownership such choosing the right breed or type of dog for your le style, as well as understanding that dogs are a lelong commitment and not a disposable commodity. I would welcome the opportunity to work with schools in the area and encourage them to get in touch, as pupils really do get a lot out of the workshops as do their dogs.”For more information about ‘Be Dog Smart’ visit www.bedogsmart.org.ukFor more information or to book a ‘Be Dog Smart’ workshop, contact Cathy Clyde on    or email cathy.clyde@dogstrust.org.ukCarrick firefighters form guard of

Kelly Gardens in the Co Armagh town, qualied as a pharmacist in , graduated as a doctor in February this year and has been working at McCabe’s Pharmacy in the Northwood area of Dublin since May.The former St Michael’s Grammar School pupil explained: “The lady came into the shop struggling to breathe, she was in full-blown anaphylactic shock.”Emmett acted quickly and gave the woman an adrenaline shot: “I could see the rash on her neck so I knew she had an allergy.“I thought I’d have to do CPR. I gave her a shot of adrenaline and it didn’t really do anything.“Then I gave her a second adrenaline pen and it seemed to work until the ambulance arrived.“She required two more in the ambulance but from what I’ve heard she seems to be good now, thank God.“I’m also trained as a doctor so I think that certainly helped.”He added: “It’s not the sort of thing you expect to see and I’m glad I was able to help.”Emmett, whose long term ambition is to work in anaesthesia, has been in touch with the lady’s family who expressed their gratitude for his lesaving actions: “Her daughter contacted me and said she couldn’t thank me enough.”Emmett’s family back in Lurgan have expressed their pride in the young doctor’s heroic actions.His aunt Margaret McManus said: “We are very proud of him. He lost his twin brother, Finbar, three years ago and he has worked so hard. His mum dad and granny Eilish and sister Emma are so proud of him.”Emmett said: “My family has been through a tough time, I lost my brother when I was studying for my medical degree, I couldn’t focus on my exams.

Several motorists were warned about their speed but the sad thing was that two motorists received Fixed Penalty Notices for speeding.“On top of this one motorist obviously didn’t see us driving behind him when he decided to lt his mobile and start chatting to a friend instead of concentrating on the road. As a result this motorist also received a Fixed Penalty Notice for his misjudged action.“I would prefer to inform you that we had a successful day and caught nobody as it truly saddens me to issue these fixed penalty notices but some people just will not learn.“What I also noticed today was that not one person waved to us.

The medical teams were incredibly calm, and it was very helpful in such a frightening situation.” Trevor continued, “I was in hospital for five days. I knew it would be traumatic for my two young boys to visit, so we waited a few days before bringing them to the hospital.“I have had surgery on two occasions already with more to follow.“As a joiner this has of course had a massive impact on my livelihood and while I would love nothing more than to be back at work, I’m also aware that it will take some time. “I am very grateful that my limb has been saved and I now want to give something back to this charity as I know it takes £, a day to keep it going.“It was fantastic to be able to visit the air ambulance base recently to meet with the HEMS team who treated me at the scene. I have two sons and they thoroughly enjoyed being able to finish school a bit early for the important visit to the base and see the helicopter and meet the team. “I’m so grateful to them and also to the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service and all of the other medical professionals who have treated me so far.”Dr Darren Monaghan said: “It was great for the team to be able to welcome Trevor and his family to the base.

We speak to founder Daniel Crawford and his team about the journey so far A spark in the mind of Daniel Crawford as he studied for his masters degree in Glasgow just a few years ago has grown into a business at the sharp end of technology. axialD is tasked with turning the complicated and laborious process of converting D medical scans into D models – and producing them for use by surgeons and medical professionals. It’s an ever-growing business, spun out of Ulster University, which is expanding its reach across the UK, Ireland and now into the US where it’s targeting a burgeoning fresh marketplace. The company has been involved with Catalyst since , been directly involved with a host of its programmes, and is participating in the EU INTERREG funded North West Centre for Advanced Manufacturing , managed by the Special European Union Programmes Body . Catalyst is Northern Ireland’s leading technology hub, home to  companies and around , staff. Daniel has a strong team around him – growing to  staff based in Belfast city centre, including Niall Haslam, chief technology officer, Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships and Cathy Coomber as operations manager. While studying medical visualisation and human anatomy in Glasgow, Daniel was exposed to the raft of imaging available – including CT, MRI and ultrasound, and began examining how the crucial data could be better used. The biomedical physics undergraduate grew the idea into his thesis – looking at converting D data sets and converting them into fully D printable files. “That allows us to turn images into D models to allow surgeons or registrars, to understand digital pathologies, before going in to theatre,” he said. “But we discovered it wasn’t just good for that and surgeons also wanted to get their hands on the D models.” That gave Daniel greater scope for developing the concept. In one early case, a surgeon was able to use one of the D prints to identy small fractures in a patient who had suffered a motorcycle crash, that weren’t initially apparent using more traditional methods. The company was thrust into Catalyst’s Springboard programme in  – a  week scheme which allowed a would-be entrepreneur, fresh out of university, access to business training and development, which included working with PathXL’s Stuart Harvey. From there, it was into the Halo programme – bringing axialD together with angel investors in order to get the start-up off the ground. It landed £, through Techstart and private investors, which allowed the company to get the ball rolling. Through Catalyst, Daniel also got the opportunity to visit MIT and the entrepreneurial development programme, Way to Scale, bringing axialD to Massachusetts and the Boston area – the global heart of the health technology sector. Niall Haslam is axialD’s chief technical officer. He said a Belfast and Boston partnership has helped strengthen the links between the cities, bringing firms from Northern Ireland to the US for both networking and scoping out the potential for setting up shop across the Atlantic. “The Way to Scale program brings entrepreneurs together. It’s a great networking opportunity,” Niall says. axialD is now a partner in the EU INTERREG-funded NW CAM, which brings together a network of research institutes, universities and enterprises to carry out research in advanced manufacturing. It is working with Ulster University on a number of projects, including looking at developing custom designed jigs for hospitals to produce D models. Cathy Coomber has been with axialD for three years. “What we have done in that time is looking at standardising the processes,” she says. “Biomedical engineers from Ulster University and those across the UK are producing data, manually segmenting thousands of medical images in order to help them develop an algorithm. “That allows us to massively improve our standardised process and reduce the time involved in producing those files.” That could mean reducing the time down from up to five hours, to as little as an hour. “When the company started, Daniel was able to get those early users excited in Glasgow, and then setting up in Belfast there were key surgeons which helped set the pace,” Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships said. The company has since been involved with NHS frameworks as a means to help remove as many bottlenecks as possible. This involves developing and marketing the products to the NHS and HSC in the Republic – helping them to learn about the product, the process and what area of specialism it can be used in. “In the last  months with the development of the algorithms, we are moving in to the US,” Katie said. “We’re seeing a lot of growth in the US.” And the axialD team is also growing fast. “We have  staff at the moment but are looking to expand in  months,” Daniel said. “That includes new staff in the US to help grow and manage that market as we further expand our software team back home.” The success of axialD mirrors the overall success of Catalyst, since its inception  years ago. It’s an independent not-for-profit organisation across its four sites – including its largest base at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast, alongside its Londonderry hub, Ballymena, along with the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub at Danske Bank in Belfast city centre.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jm_1.jpg","title":"how do you retain staff and keep them enjoying their job","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by Ulster Business With such intense competition for talent, the challenge for employers isn’t just finding prospective candidates, it’s also keeping them, writes John Moore, managing director of Hays NI Astonishingly, almost half of professionals surveyed in the Hays What Workers Want Report said that they left at least one new job within the first  months because it didn’t match expectations formed during the application process. A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"new  bedroom boutique hotel planned for belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by John Mulgrew A listed Belfast building could become a new hotel and restaurant as part of wider plans for a £m revamp of the city centre. Tribeca Belfast, formerly Royal Exchange, will see UK developer Castlebrooke redevelop much of the north side of the city centre. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. As part of the revised plans it wants to turn the listed former Assembly Rooms building at the corner of North Street and Waring Street into a new -bedroom hotel, with a restaurant and bars. That would involve knocking down part of the newer extension to the building, including the rear part of the former Northern Bank and the adjacent - North Street to “accommodate the new extension to form the proposed boutique hotel”. “The proposals for the existing building are similar in scope to that which was included as part of the extant approval. It is proposed to conservatively repair the existing historic fabric of the former Northern Bank,” a design statement says. “A key feature of the proposed extension is that the interface with the rearelevation of the existing listed bank building will be improved by setting back the footprint of the proposed extension so that the north west corner of the original building is readable.” The scheme includes the re-use and adaptation of the existing building as well as an extension on the footprint of the existing s extension on North Street. The extension will be set over five floors, with a rooftop bar, while upper floors are set back with metal cladding to the facades to “reduce the overall massing of the building and reflect the roofing materials or upper story treatment of surrounding buildings”. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. This summer the developer ran a fresh public consultation amid revised plans for the scheme, which included signicantly reducing a huge -storey building to around , retaining additional facades and dropping plans for an underground car park.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/da1.jpg","title":"clarity telecom building telecoms from the ground up","story":"Posted on Monday September  by Ulster Business Clarity Telecom helps businesses of all shapes and sizes develop their communications needs from the ground up, and is now rolling out its fast-growing cloud software across the UK and Ireland. Founder and managing director David Whelan speaks to Ulster Business about a business which boasts the right tools for the job David Whelan’s vision and mantra for what is now one of the leading telecoms businesses is clear – telecommunications services are only as good as the foundations on which they are built, with engineering front and centre. He’s the entrepreneur behind Clarity Telecom – a successful Belfast-based full-service telecommunications solutions company with almost  years under its belt, helping develop top-end connectivity – including lines, calls, mobile, broadband and cloud software – for businesses across Ireland and the UK. And for David, telecoms is all about engineering at the core of finding the best comprehensive solution to its customers, having the right tools for the job, and having world class people. For Clarity Telecom, it’s about developing a bespoke system for companies, focusing on engineering from day one. Since its inception in , Clarity Telecom has grown to have a greater engineering capability than any other independent telecommunications company in Northern Ireland, and is now rolling out its leading byphone VoIPsystem throughout the UK and Ireland. David also says through Clarity Telecom and its burgeoning byphone technology, the company could double revenues in the next three years as well as growing its workforce. “The phone network stops at a plug in the wall and from that point on, you have to provide the infrastructure and management,” David says. “What we do is focus on the engineering. It’s all about how well it works and adapts to your business. “By focusing on that we are looking at the way things are being built, and we can then get insights on how we can change and improve things.” Led by engineering, the Clarity team is driving change within the telecoms industry ensuring client infrastructure is fit for purpose and for the future. That starts with assessing a business’s needs, making sure the network is suitable, reviewing the workforce needs and bandwidth requirements. From there, Clarity Telecom can develop a bespoke solution – from cabling, to switching, cloud services, routing and phone systems. Clarity Telecom now has a team of  staff – a third of whom work directly within the engineering side of the business. But that number could grow further still, as the company expands its business across Northern Ireland, and develops its byphone technology. The company developed its subsidiary, Voxbit, in  – specically to design engineering solutions. And through that has come one of its most successful products, byphone. A simple to use VoIP , byphone is a drag and drop system that allows users to configure their own phone set up suited to the exact needs of the organisation and enables a range of analysis tools that can help business owners drive up efficiencies. “In  as VoIP started coming along, I realised that was a signicant opportunity,” David says. “Where the communications industry is going is into the cloud. It’s going from traditional storage within buildings, into something in the cloud. The traditional telephone systems are evolving. “We started making a series of innovations surrounding cloud technology. We realised you can make it simpler – we were asking ourselves, can you make it work without a manual, for example. “If you can, in the same way as Apple’s iPhone made things easier for users, people will start using the services. It’s about making everyone’s le easier. “The end user wants to be able to use the system easily, from managing their telephone number, to having access to voicemail. It’s about the ‘power of simple’. “We now have around  resellers for the byphone system in the UK, and we are looking at trebling or quadrupling those sales,” he said. One of Clarity Telecom’s customers is Mid  East Antrim Borough Council. The firm was tasked with bringing together the complex communication needs of the new ‘super council’ following the amalgamation in . “With bringing three councils together, one of the main problems was having a single phone number that people could call. If you have numerous sites, spread across three council areas, that would involve a lot of rip and replace,” David says. “But we gave them one telephone number and then managed the routing to all those bits of equipment across the council areas.” Hotel giant Andras House – which operates seven hotels and , rooms in Belfast including the Crowne Plaza at Shaw’s Bridge and the new Hampton Hilton – is also another major customer. “Businesses trust us to be able to provide the engineering solutions in order for them to run their companies,” David says. So, why should a business consider Clarity Telecom for its crucial and comprehensive connectivity needs  David says Clarity is all about improving how companies interact with their customers – making it easier, and thus, improving revenue and sales. “As you manage your telephone connections you become better at dealing with your customers – you become more efficient at dealing with them, and they will have a better experience. It’s about improving customer contact. “As a business you are able to do a lot more, such as listening to call recordings, access to statistics and using data which will help manage that contact, as well as saving on costs and making your business more efficient. “What solution depends on your business. That is where we come along. We never put a system in without doing a full engineering visit.” Some of the connectivity includes the ability to connect landline with mobile phones, call forwarding and being able to access voicemails as digital recordings, by phone or computer. “When companies deal with us, they can come along and say ‘this is what we are trying to do’, and we are able to work the engineering and infrastructure, before then providing the services,” David says. “It’s also about fighting against the view that it’s all about price. Yes, you have to be competitive, but you need the right infrastructure. For example,a shop loses connectivity for two days, then they lose two days of sales, simply because they don’t have the back-up for the credit card payment system. “It’s about getting businesses to think about the infrastructure and all of the issues. It’s not just about how cheap you can make a call. It’s about how customers can engage with your business – and we are at the heart of making that happen.” For further information, contact Clarity Telecom on    or visit www.clarityteleView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/greggssss.jpg","title":"greggs to open new belfast city centre store","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by John Mulgrew Greggs looks set to open a new store in the heart of Belfast city centre, it can be revealed.

Trade NI – the new alliance between Hospitality Ulster, Manufacturing NI and Retail NI – is unveiling a -year plan called ‘Vision ’ at a Westminster reception on Wednesday afternoon, as the UK’s political system enters its most volatile period in a generation. With just weeks before the UK is expected to leave the EU, more than  guests are confirmed to attend the event that will be addressed by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Julian Smith MP and the shadow Secretary of State, Tony Lloyd MP. Business leaders are also due to attend a later event at Downing Street, and a lunch at the Irish Embassy. Trade NI’s “transformative economic plan” will set out key policy priorities that have the potential to create , jobs and to make Northern Ireland a high growth economy. In a joint statement, Trade NIs Colin Neill , Stephen Kellyand Glyn Roberts , said: “Northern Ireland is facing a huge challenge as it struggles politically and economically with a growth forecast of around % or below. This is simply not good enough and we can’t sit idly by and let events overtake us. We must break the cycle of limited economic growth.” “Our three organisations represent most of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland. Therefore, a louder voice needs to be heard on their behalf so that they don’t suffer in the wake of the local political issues. We want a reboot of the economic policy of Northern Ireland, in order to benefit our economy and safeguard our growing business community.” “We need to be bold and ambitious about creating % or even % growth over the next few years, but that requires decision makers to be pressed into action and a series of policy and legislative decisions to be taken and driven through. Our local economy and businesses have taken a back seat and we simply cannot afford that situation any longer.” “Our Vision  document sets out a bold new ten-year plan for creating , new jobs and creating a high growth economy. We want to make Northern Ireland the best place in the UK and Ireland to shop, socialise, locate and start a business “The Vision  plan sets out to create a better ing business environment and attract further inward investment that will lead to a revitalised economy taking on the challenge in turbulent times.” “We want to make Northern Ireland an eco-system of innovation.Trade NI is keen to work with all business organisations, chambers of commerce, trade unions and voluntary sector representation to create a new progressive partnership for change in Northern Ireland.” And Kevin Kingston, chief executive of Danske Bank, sponsor of Trade NI’s Westminster reception, said: Danske Bank is proud to be one of the main sponsors of Trade NI’s Westminster reception. Trade NI is seizing the initiative and ensuring that the voice of the local business community is being heard loud and clear at a time of upheaval and uncertainty.” “The vibrancy of the Northern Ireland private sector is imperative to the strength of our economy and we need to ensure that local businesses are protected and well positioned to be able to compete globally in the post-Brexit environment.” Emma Gilthorpe, executive director, Heathrow Expansion, said: “Heathrow is delighted to support the launch of Trade NI, echoing Heathrow’s commitment to connect Northern Ireland to global growth and to share the benefits of an expanded Heathrow with the businesses and communities of Northern Ireland.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/dm11.jpg","title":"tech entrepreneur named catalysts innovation founder","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by Ulster Business A top tech entrepreneur has been named as Catalyst’s Innovation Founder for  by a  of leading judges.
